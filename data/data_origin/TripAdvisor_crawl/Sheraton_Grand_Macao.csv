"The most hip and vibrant hotel in the Cotai strip! While most hotels along the strip is a decorated with the theme of Royally Luxurious, Sheraton Grand Macao breaks the norm by being the hip and vibrant hotel with daring color themes. Making it suitable for young millionaires and millennial travelers like me.   My Executive Suite gives a perfect view of the Eifel Tower at the Parisian. The room is spacious and decorated in the theme of modern luxury just how I like it.  I definitely will return to the property when I have the chance.",50
"This may not be the fanciest hotel on the Cotai Strip but the service is good, rooms are spacious and clean for a reasonable price.  Its great for families with good connection to other hotels and a great shopping mall and food via the well marked  internal labyrinth of lifts, walkways and escalators",50
"Short staycation yet amazing. Gorgeous room with a fabulous view. I particularly thank to Vermond, hes the one who assist me upon checking hes very professional and have warm smile. Next best part is food in breakfast has a great variety taste so delicious. We were impressed for there beyond service as well. The scent of the hotel lobby was kind of relaxing also. Overall service was excellent. Every single member of the staff from check in to check out were great. Thank you. Thank you, you made my daughter birthday memorable even the simple effort from Joletta. I highly recommend this place. Thank you Sheraton",50
"I would like to thank you and your team especially to Front Desk Miss Jaeselle for the decoration ,Miss Josie for follow up our request and Mr. James Zhou for our friendly check out.Thank you guys for the great job you did for decorating our hall for my boyfriend's birthday. You completely surpassed all my expectations. It was so beautiful and memorable THANK YOU SO MUCH and looking forward for our next booking on October 28",50
"Excellent services. Love all the staff, they are super friendly and nice, specially Ana in front desk. We enjoyed so much during our staycation. Thanks so much for the birthday arrangements. Will definitely come again.",50
"The reception staff are great and help a lot. Too many tourists in the lobby, and there are the casinos besides the lobby. The location is so great and can take the shuttle bus to go many spots and different casinos.  All the service is good and the staff in the lounge are very nice to help and can remember you have been here, very sweet.  Overall speaking, good hotel to stay!",40
"Everything about our family staycation at the Sheraton was perfect! It started with a call from Rechell from Guest Sevices Center the day before we arrive at the hotel confirming our booking the next day.. She was very gracious and very polite in assisting me with our room and she even asked me if we are celebrating a special occasion. The next day, we were impressed the moment we set foot on their lobby up to the time we checked in. Paula and Theresa from the front desk are both kind, knowledgable and courteous. They both explained the package we availed and surprised us with a family suite.. I was very touched because we, especially my kids loved the room! They also welcomed us with a very sweet note from Rechelle and a box of Madeleines.  Overall stay was amazing and we‚Äôll‚Ä¶",50

"Had a wonderful summer staycation experience in Sheraton Grand Macau Hotel on August 14-16, 2020.  The room is spacious, comportable, beautiful and clean. The staffs are friendly and accommodating. Thanks for the room upgrade FO staff and to the guest services ambassadors by the name of Sheena and Jetro for helping me to carry all my luggages and for escorting me from the check in counter to my room door. The heart shaped swan, rose petals and pack of chocolates decorated on the bed was a surprised for our wedding anniversary. The room cleaner Ram Chandra # 6005299 is so polite and has excellent customer service. Everything that I have requested (room service) they deliver it right away.

We had such a wonderful experience at the Sheraton hotel. Everything we needed was accommodated perfectly. We celebrated my friends birthday and we had a fun time. We will definitely stay here again soon!,50
Great experience with this luxurious hotel. Staffs are friendly and accommodated. Super recommended. 1 night is not enough to stay here because of their good and outstanding service and also the beautiful room and its cleanliness ‚ù§Ô∏è Surely recommended,50
"I celebrated my birthday in Sheraton. I did not expect this massive surprise that a staff named Jeaselle, prepared when I had entered the room. The bed had a lot of flowers in it, spelling out my name. It was so unexpected, and gratifying. It‚Äôs truly one of the best birthdays I‚Äôve ever had, and certainly one of the most fun experiences as well. So my friends and family will make sure to come back to this hotel and we will recommend it to others. Thank you so much Miss Jeaselle for your wonderful surprise, and for ensuring I had a great time there. Continue your good service. üôèü•∞",50
"We just want to thank the following staff  To guest relation officers Ms.Sally Yu Guest service agent, Front Office and Rechell Ann guest relation team for all the emails welcoming and reminding us on our upcoming hotel reservation. Being a working mom this email helps us a lot, to never forget our incoming staycations. A great reminder indeed.  Upon Check in 13 August 2020 Ms. Eurika welcome us with smile on her face. She very friendly and courteous. She even upgraded us to a family suite. Since it is a post birthday celebration of my son. Staying on family suite is our first time experience and we are all excited going up to our room to see what it looks like. And we are all amazed when we get there. She even assisted us on our room and help us on our luggage. Thank you Ms.‚Ä¶",50
"I‚Äôm a frequent visitor to Sheraton, especially Sheraton Grand Macao, I used to stay here every time I visit Macao, and I also visit different Sheraton around the world, but I never met a reception staff like this time when I checked in. I want the leaders know what happened with the staff whose name William, a local boy, speaks Cantonese. When I walked to the reception, he didn‚Äôt say welcome or hello, but I said to him, funny, right? Then I tried to change a better room, his answer was there are not which means I can‚Äôt change. What??? It was under the outbreak, and not much people there, he told me no better rooms left. I said I don‚Äôt mind to pay more. Then he walked into the back office and left me wait for couple minutes... there‚Äôs no people waiting, but I need to wait couple‚Ä¶",40
"Sheraton always feels like home. A day before arrival, we received a call from Giselle who confirmed every details of our stay. Special thanks to Josie who remember us everytime we come and  explained the packages very well upon check in. The bell man who assisted us to our rooms was very kind and Cristina who we called for inquiries was very patient with us. Overall stay was great and will surely come back.",50
"It is very nice of Sheraton to give such good deals or packages to avail during this time of pandemic specially knowing we are all still in lockdown. We had a memorable & perfect staycation as they offered an affordable promotion of early check in at 12pm & late check out next day 6pm, complimentary upgrade to next room category and what's more? 500mop dining vouchers & free entrance at Eiffel Tower & Qube Kingdom (if you have kids to bring with you)  What I love about them is their customized services to each of their guests. As they know that we are celebrating my boyfriend's birthday, they called me before the booking date and proactively offered us a suite room upgrade, birthday decorations & special amenities. I was surprised & got very happy with their advance‚Ä¶",50
"Room is big, with a large bathroom with shower and bath tub separated. The bathroom amenities like shower gel and shampoo are poor in quality. I have uploaded the TV channel list and laundry price list.   The router in the room provides both wired and wifi connection. Two power outlets at the table and one at bedside",30
"It was an excellent experience to celebrate my birthday at Sheraton hotel, with a nice staff and helpful suggestions from the staff, a very warm welcoming especially in the check in area where I met 2 helpful beautiful ladies name. Ericka and Eurika they really help me lot and the rooms are very nice and convenient. Excellent reallyü•∞. I wish that I could have a next booking with my daughter when she visit me here in Macau.  Thanks for the wonderful experience I‚Äôm happy to recommend this hotel.  ",50
"This was my first time in sheraton hotel, we stay for 3 days 2 nights for a staycation with birthday celebration with my friends. First I would like to recognized Ms. Ana Asilo for assisting us for our check in, She was so accommodating and explaining to us what are the ammenities, discounts and vouchers that the hotels gives us for the rest of the stay, she also upgraded our room to be in suite. Kudos to you girl. The room was huge and clean. I love the pools because it seems that we're just the people on the pool area. To sum up I enjoyed our stay. Till next time. :)",40
"It was a great experience for me and my family during our staycation in Sheraton Grand Macao. I really appreciate for the free upgrade service to Family Suite which is so amazing for the kids, even though for me. lol  I‚Äôd highly recommend all my friends to stay in your hotel who would like to have a wonderful staycation in the near future.    At last, thanks for the professional service from yours.",50
"This is the 3rd time this month and it's obviously been very good, they've consistently went above and beyond. The staycation package was something we needed from what's happening with the world. It has been rough, to some maybe even harder but they sure did delight some of us. It was already a give away for 880 patacas with 500 patacas daily food voucher, the Qube and Eiffel tickets for 2, early check in late checkout and a room upgrade        (because why not, right? If it means making their patrons happy and the rooms are available anyway). That is customer satisfaction right there! What's even greater is the personalized touch the employees gave, the handwritten notes of thank you, gift, origami they folded.. even walking us from the lobby to the elevators. It was really‚Ä¶",50

We enjoyed our stay there. The room is huge and clean. We love the comfy bed! We had a very relaxing weekend so we‚Äôll be back very soon.   I love the steamed rice rolls and dim sum at the Yum Cha restaurant. We made the right choice!,50

"Booked a room for weekend getaway and we mainly come to enjoy the pool. Prior arrival, I was being informed that I could only use the hotel facilities only after getting a room. Therefore, we decided to come a bit later than scheduled. However, upon arrival, I noticed the staff actually can be very flexible as they do allow guest to use the facilities while waiting for the room to be ready.  Nonetheless, the pool is great with attentive staff around.",40
"We had a really great time on our stay in Sheraton Macau. I would like to commend the excellent hospitality preparation of Ms.Erika¬† Mallari, with the decorations, birthday cake , and arrangement with our room preferences.Everything is set up on details and we had a very happy experience.

Stayed at the hotel by myself in June. Kudos to Ms. Maria Cristina Precella for being very hospitable and quick to resolve issues. She  goes an extra mile to make sure that guests feel comfortable and safe. Thank you again! <3,50

"Me and my husband usually celebrate Anniversary out of Macau but this year was an exception due to flight restrictions because of Covid19. We decided to celebrate our Anniversary with our family for a One night stay here at Sheraton. We stayed at Family Room Suite and our kids surely had fun staying (my daughter don‚Äôt even want to leave). It may be an overnight stay but we surely enjoyed their staycation promo of early check in 12pm and late check out 6pm. The frontliners William Wong and Paula made sure that we had a smooth checked in and checked out process.

"As this covid-19 has given us a lot of stresses in life, it‚Äôs time to spend a weekend getaway with family. From the moment we stepped in, we‚Äôre greeted with a beautiful smile by your front desk executive, I believe her name is Eurika very friendly, hospitable and kind. Well presentable and knowledgeable about the amenities of the hotel....I would like to commend Sheraton for a good job in training your staff. Anyways, your package is very attractive for locals in this time of pandemic... Actually I have recommended Sheraton to my friends and relatives. Surely we‚Äôll be back!!",50
Rooms are spacious and clean. Room service is very good. Hotel staff are very friendly and polite.  The only so called negative comment is the hotel compound is so big and it takes quite a walk from my room the swimming pool area.  Sometimes you might get lost.,40
Stayed last April this hotel was amazing connected to others and so much to see  The room was lovely and the staff friendly the food in the restaurants were amazing ample breakfast to chose from at the grand buffet.  Hop8ng to go again in April this year,50
"Best hotel to stay in the cotai strip! Connected to Venetian through a bridge...near Sands as well.  Has lots of food choices like cheesecake factory!!  If you don't want to gamble too much, this place offers lower minimum bets. If you want free hot milk tea, just go to the casino area and drink for free!! haha  Hotel rooms are spacious and complete with toiletry amenities.   Worth every penny!! ",50
"Amount so many hotels in Macau, there is nothing special to mention about Sheraton Grand Cotai.  Except its a pleasant surprise that the guestrooms got a very nice view of the Eiffel Tower.  The front desk, as usual, is crowded with many people. We stayed one night only, but we have to waste much time in all these check in procedures. But, as we have special arrangement with the hotel for celebrating birthday to our family member.  The room was nicely decored with rose pedals and balloons, together with greeting card, rose bundle and birthday cake.  Thanks Sheraton, our birthday in Macau would be memorable ÔºÅ ",40
I traveled with my wife in China in December. Our first destination is Macau and stayed at Sheraton Grand Macao hotel. The doorman provided very welcome service for our arrival and check in was responsive. They also have provided free shuttle bus service to the other side of town. The Concierge team was very helpful and helped us to plan our trip. The breakfast was good and many choices for us. We will stay here again for our next visit.,50
"Very busy over the CNY period, staff still tried their best to accommodate the requests of the masses. Fittings and rooms were nice, however getting a little dated. Casino in the hotel not as nice as the Venetian for example. Great gym though!",40
"All the filipino staves and security personnel from the hotel and in casino are all acting bossy and disrespectful. They are like waiting for a tip, and if you don‚Äôt give a tip, they will snob and make face plus laugh behind your back. They are making fun of the guests. Seems like they‚Äôre not seriously doing their job. They should be fired and replaced by more competent people. They act bossy like they want the guests to adjust for them, really.",10
"From check-in to our daily breakfasts and evening reception times in the concierge lounge to the housekeeping service, we were extremely pleased with the Sheraton Grand Macao.  And even though the prices--everywhere on the Cotai Strip--are pretty steep, the Sheraton's were better than all of the other options.  Local buses are cheap, reliable and convenient. Get off the Cotai Strip and go south to Coloane Village for the day or to the north island where the culturally Portugese sites are. The Macao Museum is especially worth the time and the low entry fee.",50
"Staying at a Sheraton for two weeks during a work trip you would expect the service to be good, however the China factor and low paid workers, lets through heaps of numbers at it scenario seems to be in play here.   The Check in procedure was laborious to say the least, it took approximately 15mins to get checked in, and then every couple of day we had to continually put more credit on the account which got tiresome as the process never seemed easy and quick.  The restaurants and facilities of the hotel are very good, and food options were excellent and keeps it a 4/5. The room service, house keeping options were pretty ordinary with something everyday not being done in room servicing.   Probably look for a different hotel to stay at for the next work trip there.",40
"Would not suggest staying here at all. The rooms are below par, the service is missing and there is very little ambience or atmosphere. It is lacking in every element that a Sheraton Grand should portray. Sadly can not recommend this place. ",10

We stayed in the Hotel for two days with the understanding that New Year's celebrations would draw lots of tourists to Macau especially in this gaming resort with shopping arcade and connecting overpass to some nearby hotels.   We already adjusted our expectation to the service and comfort level which Sheraton brand hotel could have provided. The room was well maintained when we first visited a few years ago. No disappointment at all.   We were able to get directions from Hotel staff for the newly opened Macau Light Rapid Transit and we should be grateful there were street signs of getting to the nearest station just little outside of the building.   After all it was wonderful we were in the room with view of count down event held by Parisians Hotel across the street (would be‚Ä¶,40
"Upon booking, I ordered a non-smoking room, but I was welcomed by a strong smell of cigarette when entering the room. We called Room Service, and the staff was indeed very sorry and willing to help. The agent told me that a staff member would bring the keys to the room in a few minutes.  Behold, that's when the drama starts.  It was 11.45 pm when we called room service (it was indeed late by normal standards, however, in Macau, the service was still at full scale, even in late night). We waited for an hour, an whole hour without any staff appearance. We called again. The staff remained very polite and was very sorry for the delay, which was appreciated.

"This is one of the best value for money hotels in Macau and the sky tower has new rooms which are pretty spacious. We had an amazing view of Eiffel tower and enjoyed our stay. However, the check in process was very long and tedious. With two children under 4yrs, we had to stand in queue for 30mins in the priority counter which is totally unacceptable. They could staff more ppl, else what is the point of having proririty if we still had to wait for half hr ??",40
"We stayed for 3 nights in a Deluxe room. The room was clean and bathroom large with separate shower and bath and a good supply of amenities. Robes and slippers are provided and there is an in room safe. Check in was horrendous. It was Christmas Day and would expect it to be busy, however 40plus minutes in a zig zag queue was unacceptable. Especially after our long journey to get there. My husband fell asleep on one of the very few benches available, waiting for me. Only one person was allowed to queue. But this seemed the rule for some and not all. There should have been double the amount of staff on at the check in time. It was chaos.

"Cotai Strip is pretty much the reason for the mass tourism of Macau with the endless luxury shopping and gambling opportunities.  With so many upscale option along the strip, we went with the reasonably priced Sheraton Grand, one of the four hotels that make up the Sands Cotai Central Complex.  While it may lack the theme park vibe of the Venetian or the Parisian, the gambling and shopping options practically looked identical.  The check in and out were both surprisingly efficient but we also avoided the worst times checking in super late and checking out early.  Breakfast spread was fantastic mix of both Asian and Western food.  We were lucky to have a room with a view of the Parisian's Eiffel Tower which was cool.  Room was spacious and the beds couldn't have been more‚Ä¶",50
Me and my family stayed at Sheraton over the New Year holiday and we had an amazing experience. Check in was fast despite the many travellers coming in. The staff were very welcoming and helpful with our requests especially Theresa. She made our stay that much better. The room was very clean and comfortable. The breakfast buffet had an extensive and excellent selection of dishes to choose from. Check out was a breeze as well. I would definitely recommend Sheraton to other travellers looking for a luxurious and comfortable stay in the Cotai Central area of Macau.,50
"We stayed here for a 3D2N stay and the room really spoiled our plans to explore Macau since it was just such a good place to sleep in. Check in process at the Bonvoy desk was a bit slow, but we've waited in longer lines so it was okay. Since the hotel is combined with the Sands Cotai Central mall, so every facilities that the hotel gave follows the property layout so expect navigating this mall before getting to check in/reception - not all reception desks near designated lobbies were available. Check on what particular programs are available for your stay because we managed to join in the Crab Bash in Sheraton Grand Macao's Feast buffet restaurant.",40
It was a wonderful new year stay with the family at the hotel. The check in was quick despite the number of people. The staff were also accommodating and quick to respond to our requests especially Theresa. Will definitely want to come back and stay with the hotel again the next time we visit and hopefully explore more of what the hotel has to offer. Also the breakfast was very good and the staff were again very helpful and accommodating.,50
"Very basic stay in Macau, and as a Titanium Elite Member, I expected more than a plate of fruits in my very basic, old feeling room, which deserves some remodeling.  Unfortunately, I wasn‚Äôt upgraded to a suite as expected whenever there‚Äôs one available (and there was). That would have made a big difference.  In fact, the only good thing about my stay was Ms. Carmela at the Club Lounge, who‚Äôs a true professional and the sweetest person. Thank you. ",20
This is my first time to stay here for family trip.Front Desk Staff gave us a surprise gift and extended out checkout time. The kids really enjoy about this. Room is comfortable. Pricing is good.    We are happy with kind of service we get all the times. Keep up the good work..!!,50
this is my second time to stay this hotel.  As i like their service to our guest.  I email to tell them that my niece celebrate birthday during this trip.  Hotel replied us will arrange balloon decoration.  Our nieces opened the door and saw many balloons at the floor inside the room.  They are so happy and also has mini cake and DIY birthday card to her.  Really gave them the best memory. Thanks for Sheraton team :),50
"The hotel is very huge with two Towers. Very crowded all day long with casinos. I stayed here for 3 night business trip and found it was perfect. Spacious room and washroom, shower, bathtub, amenities, variety choices of breakfast buffet etc. The downside is check-in process. They have several counters and the main one was with very long queue (around 30 guests). Though hotel staff arranged me to make it at the other Tower in upper floor, the staff took around 20-30  mins each. Too many details in checking in in their system. Worth to stay anyway.",40
"This is my 3rd time to stay here for business trip. Actually overall was fine everything was perfect except my pictures below: I stayed in a standard room with 5 nights, which I found the facilities in washroom was broken!! I don‚Äôt know why the room was still available for accommodation under this situation! First, the shower door was fallen which even can‚Äôt totally close the door when I was doing shower. Second, the hanging bar aside was also broken too, nothing can be hanging on or even touch the bar. Third, tho not a big deal that 1 towel was dirty & 1 towel was a bit damaged.  I am not blame on their service but guys should much more focus on hotel facilities maintenance, and please keep checking the situation of all the rooms before anyone moves in! ",40
"I received an email stating I can check in at Marriott Bonvoy counter but when I wanted to step onto the steps, I was blocked by a Marriott lady staff who was very unfriendly and rude requesting me to show the print out indicating I am a Marriott member.  I told her that I am a gold member but I didnt print out the check in email or downloads the apps.  However, I asked her to let me in to sit on the sofa first and show her my passport.  She used her  body to block me to go in, I felt so insulted. My husband just came in and gave her my passport, then she passed the passport to let the reception staff to check.  After checking, our booking was there.  The lady did not apologize for her rudeness but just walked away.",30
"The Sheraton grand Macao is less expensive than other Marriott hotels in Macao. It‚Äôs a huge hotel with 4000 rooms, so check in can get really crowded depends on when you arrive. Hotel buffets can be disappointing to westerners since they‚Äôre mainly prepared for locals.",50
All thanks to Jezreel (Manager)for assisting us to reserved a table despite of busy week. Ivy and Amiel (lovely service ambassadors) for ensuring we are taken care of. Me and my husband is so grateful to you guys! You can genuinely feel the Filipino hospitality.  Hospitality at its finest! You guys are the best!,50

So after we check in and go to our room at 2-2024, we go to Feast for our lunch until 3pm. This hotel was in a good area with alot of place like Venetian and Parisian to visit. Their shops was old enough and so crowded for the hotel. Unfortunely this hotel provide shuttle service to the airport but its start from 10am, but our flight are 10.30.

"I was stayed at here on 21/12 until 23/12.I booked a Deluxe twin room(2547,Earth Tower) through Agoda.The hotel is crowded because there are so many people.But the check in queue is very2 long.Great service by concierge.Room in Earth Tower was outdated,Sky Tower could be their newer tower.Room are fairly clean but little old.Cannot control the speed of shower in the bathroom.They also have free shuttle buses to airport and ferry terminal.Lastly,NEED TO IMPROVE MORE ON CLEANINESS IN THE CASINO TOILET.The casino toilet was very2 dirty.",30

"Experienced a good service from the Reservations team, Front Desk and Room Service. They tried best to answer and assist to arrange a comfortable stay.  Special to mention, it was a super busy day when we checked in. Mr. Jacky Lo of Front Desk was cheerful, patient and detailed-minded. He addressed well to my trip purpose and offered his assistance to my preferences. He helped much to imprint a good impression and professionalism.",40
"Like all the Cotai strip hotels the Sheraton is expensive but not as expensive as some of the other hotels.  The staff here are excellent. Right from the Concierge to Reception to staff in the restaurant.  Can‚Äôt speak for other rooms but our room did need a refurb.  The shower was terrible, impossible to adjust flow and direction of water.  Toilet flushing was the loudest we have ever heard in any hotel. So was very audible from other rooms.  But ignoring the bathroom need of refurb the room was very large and the bed very comfortable.  One of the best things about the Sheraton was that it has a shuttle bus that takes you to other hotels/casinos/shopping centres.  The food in the restaurant was great especially the buffet breakfast with so much variety from Asian to western food‚Ä¶",40

1. Room was clean neat and comfortable. 2. There was free airport shuttle bus to the airport right at the lobby.  Disliked ¬∑ I was in Macau for a friends's wedding. Before arriving i contacted the hotel and inform them that we have a back to back booking 2 days stay paid by me and 1 day stay paid by my friend and another 1 day stay paid by me the hotel replied that we had to state this when checking in and depends on availability. But when i arrived the hotel said they were not informed that i had a back to back booking and had to move rooms on the day of my friend's wedding and also they said we had to move because of the WIIFI. Knowing that we will stay continuously a room with no problems should have been arrange for us. Which was really troublesome because my friend and i‚Ä¶,40
"Is not easy to manage the Sheraton with most number of rooms in the world, but I found the staff very professional and really efficient.  Hotel is quite new, very clean and comfortable.  The views are impressive and the breakfast is excellent.  Gym, spa and swimmingpools are very nice.  It¬¥s in Cotai area, but very easy to move around with shuttle bus service (take and drop from this hotel or the others nearby) or public bus or even taxi.  Macau is not that big. It would be my choice again.  Congratulations to the staff and Sheraton Group.",50
"Had such an amazing experience at the Sheraton hotel. The staff were so friendly, rooms were spacious and everywhere was so orderly. Met a super friendly staff, Thapa who worked at Feast, he was so attentive and always ready to help us! Hope to come back soon! ",50
"We stayed at Sheraton Grand Macao for 1 night. Our room is nice and centrally located. I like that I was able to check in at the Club Lounge instead of the main lobby. Our room is in the Sky Tower. According to a website, this is supposed to be the biggest Sheraton hotel in the world. We had a lovely view of the Parisian Eiffel Tower from our room. The room itself is nicely decorated with accents of red and black. Perhaps the best feature of the hotel is the ease of check in and out, and the transport from hotel to the Cotai waterjet where we took the boat back to Hong Kong.",50
I would like to extend my sincere appreciation for your chef - Ms Wong Wai Hung at Feast. She is always proactive to ask customers about the ingredients of sop noodles in a courteous manner. My family has enjoyed dining the lunch buffet today lunch and I highly recommend my friends and relatives to using your hotel service in future.,50
"Spacious room, quite a luxury! Competitive room rate. Lots of space for us to put our shopping! Nice size large bathroom! Fantastic bed, sheets and pillows slept so well! Location is close to shopping malls and connects to across the road too - as Macau is LOTS of walking if you are not on a shuttle bus or taxi! ",40
"Fantastic Hotel, and spectacular spread of breakfast, with lovely and cordial staff everywhere.  Special thanks to Ms Kavita Mahat, in the Feast restaurant, who was of great help, even though her duty hours finished already. Would definitely stay in this hotel again and again.",50
"It's fine if you like gambling, I guess. And shopping though the prices are twice as high for brand names than anywhere else. The rooms are large and comfortable> the rest of the hotel is like being on a crowded city street. No quiet lounge or coffee shop or bar. They were waxing the floor in the lobby at 1 am when people are still out and about and the one coffee shop bar in the middle of the crowded lobby was already closed. I guess the only thing left to do is gamble.",30
"It was our first time staying at Sheraton Grand Macao Hotel in Cotai.  Due to the protests in Hong Kong, we decided to go directly from HKG Skypier to Macao Taipa Ferry Terminal.  There‚Äôs a shuttle that takes us directly to Sheraton. The Reception staff Eurika was so awesome to help me find a room with a view with the Parisian Eiffel Tower for my birthday stay. Another staff Erika has sent a small birthday treat to our room.  Rich at Bene Italian Restaurant inside Sheraton took care of us, gave us a discount rate and special dessert due to being my birthday.

"We had a very enjoyable stay at the Sheraton Grand Macao Hotel.  The hotel is connected to the Cotai mall and you can walk to the Venetian, Parisian, the high end mall, lots of different restaurants and shops.  Great spot and reminds us of the strip in Las Vegas.  The Sheraton hotel is extremely busy with lots of people constantly checking in/out, so if you're familiar with Vegas hotels on the strip is extremely similar.  For those folks that have Marriott Bonvoy status you can check in at the Bonvoy counter that's located slightly to the left of the main entrance and you can skip the long lines.  The rooms themselves are nice, but due to the humidity in Macao they smelled a little musty to us.  House service was good with daily cleanings and they did a good job.  There's a‚Ä¶",40

A very nice one night for the Backstreet Boys concert with two friends and spent most of the time at the pool which provided excellent poolside service. Rooms were up to the Sheraton standard and there was very spacious bathroom as well. Also there is a separate check-in/check-out area for Marriott Bonvoy members. Overall a great weekend stay in Macau!,50
"Me and Family stayed at Sheraton Grand Macao to celebrate my Birthday and our Anniversary as well.

"We spent a great night with my birthday princess at the family suite, which was a complimentary upgrade.  My birthday girl love the kid facilities so much.  Thanks Sheraton for the offer which makes the birthday memorable.  And one thing I need to point out, the room is spotless. The bathroom is spotless.  Everything are extremely clean.  It is a perfect place for families with kids or babies.",50
Stayed at Sheraton this November. Room condition was poor. Middle of the night room heater stopped working. I had to change room with small kid. Even after talking to the manager I was not compensated for the trouble ,10
The room is spacious and the staff are just indifferent. The reception are quite nice and give our kids and drawing set to cheer her up. If you are a member you can check in an hour earlier. The room service is quick and the food through expensive but yummy.,40
"I would say this hotel is performing Sheraton standard consistently.  Value: In general, the hotel offers around 900 HKD per night at weekdays and weekend may be higher. It has great value at this price tag. However, I visit this hotel right before the car racing event. It priced at around 1700 HKD when corporate rate applied and 2200 HKD offers available publicly. It really costs so much given the service remain unchanged. Luckily, the hotel offered me an early check-in and late check-out such that I can have my room for 24 hours. It was somehow compensated for the higher price tagged.  Check-in and Baggage: The waiting time has always bother me. Sheraton is a great brand and many people love it so much especially the one in Macao. Guest usually need to wait over half an hour‚Ä¶",40
"As an Elite Bonvoy member I was really hoping to leave a more positive review. Our trip was mixed, at best.   The rooms are quite nice and comfortable, although the hotel itself is very disjointed. Service is far off what a normal Macau experience is.   Our check-in was very unpleasant. We were invited as Bonvoy members to check in online prior to arriving. Don‚Äôt bother... you need to go through the entire check in process all over again when you arrive.... Check in took a long time, as our attendant was working through the system. The staff are quite pleasant and do try their best to deliver good service, but the system and the poor Organisation of the hotel work against their efforts. The lobby and elevators all smell of cigarette smoke...  The only positives were that our‚Ä¶",30

People make the hotel unique and Sheraton in Macao has them!",50

Normal facilities and good size of room. Avoid 2~3 pm n 5~6 pm for check in or out as many tours wld arrive n created long waiting time.  Drop keycard at express check out stand to avoid long queue.

"First, the hotel is easily accessible via hotel shuttle from the airport. It is either pink or lime green, which has the Sheraton logo. Spotting for Parisian is more obvious. It is the 2nd stop.  I checked in around evening and was awestruck by the night lights, well Macao being Macao. The hotels here are really huge, and that includes Sheraton, with a casino housed on the ground floor.  As a Marriott elite, I got a higher floor room, clean, comfortable with complete amenities. Lounge was really grand, able to house many, with great evening fare.  Overall, I feel staying in the Cotai area is better than the Taipa area (personal preference, I visited Taipa on one of the days for a few hours just for street food and I'm not really a luxurious shopping fan).

However, the line at Sheraton was actually tolerable, and this is what I noticed for the several days that I was able to pass by the check in area.  The front desk/check in counters are plenty.  But in our case, it seems that the hotel has pre screened the bookings and pre assigned us to an agent that comes from our own country.  This is very critical for check in because if the guest is handled by someone from the same country, language barriers that slows the check in process is minimized!  In our case, it was Erika who handled our booking.  We booked for 2 rooms, and our rooms were close to each other. The‚Ä¶",50

It's worth paying extra for the Club Lounge with it's easy check-in desks upstairs and Jazelle's welcoming smile after a long flight. She made it easy to get into our room. Each day the staff in the Club Lounge are all very welcoming and helpful. Although they had a crowded room every breakfast, they still had the time to check on us to top off our coffee.  JC at the concierge's desk made sure all my deliveries were properly received. The bellmen were all very helpful with carrying up my shopping bags. With the friendly atmosphere and efficient staff, this is the best way to relax when you're far away from home.",50

The casino is right next to the reception, so sometimes it's crowded with tourists who are not staying in the hotel. There's a self-check-in and check-out system which makes things much easier.

The hotel itself looks like a dream in the middle of little Vegas with 2 towers and the Venetian opposite connected by a walkway. The shops inside offered all sorts of retail opportunities and the casinos all sorts of entertainment. The connection to the Venetian complex also meant you didnt have to go outside and cross the strip so everything was all in one. The restaurants and breakfast are excellent and the staff in all areas were some of the friendliest people we met across our trip. Our room was brilliant, aswell as modern and full of amenities.

"We loved staying here at the Sheraton and with a cheaper price through Cancelon. Rooms are good size, beds comfortable and the fine linen felt very opulent. The concierge are always a great help. And a special mention of the outdoor pool area, it certainly has the wow factor ",50
"It‚Äôs my second visit in Macau and I‚Äôve chosen to stay at the Sheraton, the view I believe is even better than the Venetian Macao!!! You can see I was holding the cake prepare by the hotel team with the view from my room. This is more than what I asked for!! I will absolutely stay here again.  Lobby is huge and long queue at the same time, I‚Äôd highly recommend to add the lounge access to your itinerary. :) saves time waiting for the line and also light buffet 3 times a day. When I say light, it‚Äôs actually a semi-full buffet. A large variety of food for you to fill up your belly. ",50
"We had a great time staying at this hotel. Extremely friendly staff, clean, well equipped rooms and a super location. The only downside was the long wait for the check-in. otherwise highly recommended.",50

We were pleased by your attentiveness to our intended stay. The view in our room was great & it was clean and comfortable.  Most of all the thoughtfulness of your team to have prepared a birthday cake with a wishing note for my husband on his birthday. It was indeed a pleasant surprise for him! We truly appreciate it.  Thank you!,50
"The Sheraton hotel in Macao is great. They offer free shuttle rom the airport but it's standard in most of the hotels in Macao. The checkin process was great. Even though they were a lot of people for check in the lady took time to make it personal and treat me like a elite member. Don't worry about lines, they are prepared. They have a lot of check- in desks and it's relatively fast process. The room was spacious, with the great view. It was well furnished and clean. So overall I love my stay there.",50
"Spent 7 nights here. The room was quite spacious, we had 2 double beds with plenty of space to move around. The beds are very comfortable, with great quality linen and pillows. A bathroom with bath and separate shower. It was great to see so many families here with children of all ages. I think it is very family friendly. There is a kids club, but I am too old for that, so can't comment. There are several pools with life guards on duty. There are security personnel stationed around the hotel, so felt very safe. There is a casino on the ground floor. The location of the hotel is very central in this area. There is a bridge/walkway which takes you across the road to other hotels. There are free shuttle buses that take you to many locations. I must mention the best asset for this‚Ä¶",50
"Mamata Shrestha, an employ at the pool was so friendly and helpful through out my hangouts by the poolside. She was very kind and talkative to the guests. Among other great staff, she stood out the most and made my stay a memorable and enjoyable. Thank you. ",50
"What made our stay in this hotel very satisfactory are the friendly, approachable, and accommodating staffs who made sure we were comfortable and well aided. We‚Äôd like to thank all the staffs who assisted us, especially our guest service ambassador, Mr. KC. 100% would come back and also recommend.",50
"I would like to mention our guest service ambassador kuya ‚ÄúRico‚Äù, he was really really helpful to us!! So kind and humble, he served us really well! He helped us when we left our room key inside our room. Lol thank you very much sir!! Best of luck!!",50
"Karen was the reason our stay at the Sheraton Macau was such a delight. There was a queue of over one hour to check-in and Karen kindly offer to assist us. In addition to this, she also explained how the hotel worked and where the pool was located. Sheraton Macau is quite overwhelming so Karen‚Äôs help really made our stay a pleasure .",50
"I stay at the hotel for a company function, the food quality wasn't that good, the service... Well, there is no service especially your claim yourself 5* hotel at the formal dinner, the staff doesn't even know what is red, white glasses, yes, it was that bad, no training at all, just randomly find someone who is available for part-time work.

"Spent two nights in this hotel with my wife to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Booked their suite  which the room is quite nice, clean and very spacious. However, the room is full of cigar smell and we thought the smell will gone after some time, but when we get back at night time,  the smell is still there and we are too sleepy to ask for another room, so we spent our first night sleeping in an ashtray.  First day breakfast is very disappointed as we were asked to have our breakfast at their ballroom which everything was set up temporary, some of their hot dishes are cold. So we request to have the breakfast at the cafe in the next morning but not at the ballroom. At first the staff said the cafe is almost full and suggested we go to the ballroom again, but we insist to go‚Ä¶",20
"Even as a premium member it took us ages to check in. 4 bottle white wine list with only 2 available (and as you would expect the two I didn‚Äôt like!). Corridors and room smell of stale food and the air-con didn‚Äôt work. People who visit here like to cook their own food in the rooms.   They did send people up to try and fix it, but frankly it shouldn‚Äôt happen in the first place. (Photo of chap deodorising)  Just generally a typical Cotai casino hotel experience - very average and best to be avoided. In fact, avoid Macau hotels in general!  I don‚Äôt apply this to Marriott/Bonvoy in general - I‚Äôm a fan - but just this (and most) Macau hotels! Stay in HK and travel over!",20

She assisted us to check if there are rooms available that time and helped us to check in, She also suggested places where we could watch the Fireworks Display that day which we were excited to see. After all the registration and introduction of the hotel facilities, she even offered luggage assistance which was very welcoming compared to our previous stays from our trip. The hotel was very wide and the largest Sheraton in the world with 4001 rooms (info which was shared by Ms. Josie as well)  which can be overwhelming so request for a Map upon check in to avoid getting lost. Overall, my‚Ä¶",50
"After an exceptional stay at the Sheraton Nanshan, this property fell short in welcoming me as a Lifetime Titanium Elite guest. I was upgraded to a regular club room with a sad view. No suite upgrade and they said I had to have breakfast in the club room or use up my welcome amenity to eat in the main breakfast area. Seriously? This property made me feel like an average guest. I haven't been in a regular room in years. It is very disappointing given how many rooms there are here, and that they have a designated check in for elite members. The check in was just underwhelming, no welcome note from management with snacks in my room, and again, the view and room, as basic as can be. So disappointed! Take note from the Sheraton Nanshan and step it up!  ",30
"Bene at the Sheraton Hotel is the best Italian Resturant in Macau ! Really nice pasta and seafood . Most importantly they have the best staffs ever ! I go for a few times every month and I get really warm welcome from the staffs ! Special thanks to Sammer , Lama, Hans, Nelo, Maynard, Angel. They are the best and truly amazing!",50
"I understand the peak season of the summer holiday. Yet I get a 95% finishing up room. The room is still on procedure, the staff Joshi Dutt work for me effective and efficient. He is helpful and try the best to get it done. Thank a lot!",50
Stayed at the Sheraton in Macao for a few days for my Birthday and was absolutely amazed by the helpfulness and kindness of the staff. One of the staff called Jean went over and above to make my Birthday special.   She managed to secure a room with a beautiful view of the Eiffel Tower and put decorations absolutely everywhere. There was even a handwritten card with a cake which I thought was extremely thoughtful.  All in all a great experience and would definitely recommend this hotel without hesitation!,50

To Josie and Raphael for being welcoming and gave us a flawless check in and check out. To Brent, who gave initiative to help us store our luggage upon check out as we tour around Macau and to AJ for assisting us and for being so friendly! You all did an excellent job! I honestly can say that it felt so close to home and just overall how I want to be cared for. The property itself is world-class!

"Everything about Sheraton Macau is perfect! Our room has a jaw dropping view of the Parisian Hotel and the Macau Eiffel Tower! Amenities and all details were very well-thought-of. The room was very comfortable to sleep in. We had a buffet breakfast at the Feast restaurant and it was so worth it. So much food to choose from.  In terms of service, I saw some Filipino service staff and they welcomed us warmly. Special mention to Front Office staff Miss Shana, who gave us excellent service! We checked in at around 9pm and were very tired from our day trip in Hongkong then back to Macau again, but Miss Shana made our check-in speedy which made a difference to our stay, making our experience really comfortable and flattering right from the start.

"Stayed for a short weekend getaway with my family in August, very astonished on how you guys ran this 4,004 rooms hotel. Housekeeping is much efficient than I anticipated!  Just would like to thank for the thoughtful service from Earven at your Yumcha Chinese Restaurant, who has showed his genuine hospitality to my family. Also Ling at the Feast, who carried a warm smile when serving breakfast at egg station. Nonan at front desk was pleasant as well, despite facing a long queue of people.  The name tags with full names are bit too difficult to read, and I wish the lady at the water counter in lobby could be in a more friendly tone to explain to me how to get that balloon for my 2 year old girl.",50
"Stayed at this hotel for one night in early September 2019.  This hotel is an average casino hotel, very large and very busy. Have stayed a few times but as a Marriott Titanium member have been rarely upgraded. Have always been advised the hotel is very busy.  The rooms are quite large but do not have a stocked minibar. Also the room had basic amenities unlike other Sheraton hotels in Asia.  As a Marriott Elite member you are able to request extra amenities on their app. These were not in the room and had to make a request three times for them.  The club lounge is good and has an excellent Happy Hour and Breakfast.  Overall this hotel is average but don‚Äôt expect anything special if you are an elite member.    ",30
"Was there a couple of years ago and I gave it a real thumbs up for service and quality. Fast forward to today, tired , poor service and dirty room. Maybe it‚Äôs because of the business or joining Marriott  Bonvoy. It was my wife birthday and I wanted to get a room upgrade. Before grouping together it was much easier. Now points are meaner to get by just like Cathay. Had similar experience in Sheraton Melbourne. All I got was a 3 inch cake. The cleaners also never cleaned the cups and gave us so little toiletries. Had to ask all the time. Highly embarrassed. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll stay in Sheraton chain again. I noticed a big drop in quality after joining Marriot Bonvoy",20
"Staff is very attentive, they're mostly Filipino, so they know how to speak English well and are very pleasant. One of the pool areas is closed when we went there, but good thing there weren't a lot of people swimming when we did that in the morning. They also have free classes at the gym which you can sign up for the day before the class. There is a food court that's a bit far from the hotel but the prices are a bit more reasonable than the food court inside the main mall.",50
"I would like to commend Ms.Asilo who was very helpful and accommodating. Even though I have no reservation, she assisted and gave suggestions to what I need. She was very thoughtful and client oriented.",50
"We arrived at the hotel yesterday with plenty of people queueing.we never thought that shearton macau has 4000 rooms with sky and earth tower. Using our marriott bonvoy, we were somehow freed of the long queue and have been well accommodated by rafael. He check us in with ease and less possible time ever. As we we out of the check in table, someone offeewd a drink to us and offered to accomodate us until we reach our room.This have been a great gesture for us to be assisted with enormous people around the chaos of the lobby due to mid autumn festival.  We were lead to our room with ease despite of labyrinth of people and directions.  Thank you Brent for a very good, efficient customer service.May your skill become part of your institutions culture to properly accomodate customers",50
"I've had the best check-in experience of my life when I checked-in at Sheraton Grand Macao, all thanks to Shana who was exceptional! She was very helpful, friendly, and looked like she really loves what she's doing. I checked in very late and was very tired from my Hongkong trip and Shana's warm welcome made a difference. Since she knew that my flight is very late on the next day, she went the extra mile and gave me a comp late check out which really helped! I cannot describe how amazing Shana was and words can't express how thankful I am. I also got a room with an amazing view of the Macau Eiffel Tower. I highly recommend staying in this hotel. Great facilities, perfect location, excellent staff!",50

Jetro from reception, he really extended his help to us. giving us the maps and giving us good deal with buffet meal and took his time to explain to us how we get to tourists spots. i would like to mention Teddy too who assisted us from our baggage to our room. He was giving us tip how to go around macao. They really seemed so professional and loves their job. Their hospitality is at their best. And lastly i want to mention Santosh, if i‚Äôm not mistaken he‚Äôs an indian guy who served my in room dining one night. He‚Äôs really good and took his time to explain what my food was and how to pour the soup into the bowl of noodles. Kudos!  Lori",50
"We are gold members and were promptly checked in via the club lounge check in area on lvl 4. We stayed on the club floor (40) and was instantly impressed by how spacious the room was with extra high ceilings, giving the room more ambiance. The room was well appointed and the bathroom was huge.  The hotel itself is massive but it is well connected to the other hotels making moving around easy. There is a free shuttle from the Cotai ferry terminal to the hotel.  We had access to the club lounge which I highly recommend as there are all day snacks and after 5pm, there's a mini buffet with free cocktails. We really enjoyed lounging around this area with our toddler.  We would definitely recommend staying here. ",50
"I liked a clean, non-smoking room with a great Paris view. Also, had a fun time in swimming pool! After checking out very easily, we had a lunch in Feast of which the price was discounted when checking-in. Noodle is very yummy, and the services of Arniel and Rob were awesome! I had some problems when booking my room through a third party, but Sheraton gave me a warm and wonderful hospitality! Thanks!",50
"I stayed in Sheraton Macau on Aug 26 with my family for leisure and school visit. My wife and I tried the afternoon tea at Palms. The afternoon treat was very good, and it was so good that my wife forgot to take her handbag.  We did not realize until it was an hour later.  Upon reaching Palms, the smart waiter told me he sent it to security and he showed us the way and we got the handbag at the end.  From Palms to the security, we were greeted with smiles and confidence.  That is very comforting and I would like to express my sincere thanks to all colleagues which are involved.  All of you make a difference.  On SEP 9, I came back again for business.  Sheraton is my first choice and the reception experience was very good.  I asked him to write down his name, Xyryl, photo below. ‚Ä¶",50
The check-in process was very smooth with a Marriott membership card - in particular Sheena and Jetro were excellent and very helpful. The rooms were large with excellent views of the Venetian hotel. The staff put all our family on the same floor near each other with nice views.  The pools on offer might be the best in Macau - we counted 9.  ,50
"The Sheraton is a bit of a dinosaur. It hasn't aged gracefully and it shows. Check-in is a real pain with long lines and slow service. The layout of the hotel is truly awful as if you're staying in the Earth tower, the trip to the pool is really far. And the pool is really quite mediocre compared to the competition. The taxi lines are also long and unforgiving. The hotel feels like a casino first and hotel second. There are so many superior choices in Cotai that if I hadn't gone to the Galaxy afterwards, my impression of Macau would have remained rather poor. ",20
"I stayed here for two nights. I don‚Äôt think it is worth the price. After I checked out at noon I wanted to use the pool, which I thought was a reasonable request. The unsmiling staff told me that I would have to pay a fee to use the pool only for  a few hours until I took my cab ride to the airport. I paid the price and used the pool but what a disappointment! The burger they served was burned, literally and they charged for it too. ",10
"We had 7 nights here - the rooms are big, comfortable, well appointed albeit a little tired with a few cigarette burns on the carpet. Having previously stayed at other Cotai Hotels I would rate the rooms better than those at the Holiday Inne, but not as good as the Galaxy Hotel. We enjoyed staying here, good amenities, spacious and big TV.  We had Marriot Bonvoy cards so received express check in, and excellent personal service on arrival. Non members faced a really long queue in a different area of the lobby.  The Sheraton staff were amazing - help with luggage when departing, sorting out things and seemed pleased to assist.  Buffet breakfast at Bene Restaurant is of a very high standard - nice coffee and an enormous range of western and Chinese foods. Lovely staff with a‚Ä¶",50

I would like to commend Jetro, the ambassador who helped us checked in. He was very accomodating and warm.

Would definitely come back!",50

Found the server from last time and still very helpful and smiling Andrea with her patner thapa is attentive. ",40
"The worst hotel in Macao, especially the front desk and concierge, is not at all enthusiastic, the shower is broken, and waiting for long time with room change, is far worse than that next to Conrad Macao, Cotai Central",10
Excellent hotel! Huge too. Great staff! Quite a disadvantage if you‚Äôre not a BonVoy member though. Suggest you become a member so checking in and checking out would be easier. Also its going to be a much better experience if you‚Äôre a platinum elite member as you get other free stuff. Shout out to Christopher (bell boy) and Ruby (reception) for their help.,50

We had interconnecting rooms with our children which worked really well. There are regular complimentary minibuses going from the ferry port, so no need to worry about transfers. Highly recommend.",50
"Despite being the largest Sheraton chain (4,100 rooms), we received fantastic hospitality from Carmela, a guest service ambadsador from the Sheraton Club.  From check in to getting a special treat (chocolates and cake) from Carmela, she extends to reserving a breakfast table for us every day during our stay at The Sheraton Club as my mum is in wheelchair.  Keep up the great work. It is with such hospitality that we keep coming back to your brand.  ",50
I want to commend the staff from the front desk Ms.Josie Bilag for arranging our stay for one night. We can‚Äôt check in online due to fully booked on that day but she made a way to have us check in and even gave us a cheaper price. When we got into our room some staffs even gave us a complimentary sweets for our anniversary. We really had a great stay at Sheraton and we will surely come back with my kids.,50
Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this awesome hotel we had a top floor view (upgraded i think) the waitress Mamata Shrestha was outstandingly polite and really made us feel welcome what a lovely young lady .,50

She help us to arrange a room on high floor with nice view and arrange all the baby amenity for us. We have wonderful stay in this hotel.",50
I stayed here on a business trip in August 2019.  If you are a Westerner and you don't gamble - be prepared to feel out of place.  Other than eating and shopping - there isn't much to do in Macau during the heat of August.  The room was very nice the staff in the hotel and restaurants were very attentive.  Macau isn't my favorite city - but if you have to stay there the Sheraton works hard to make you comfortable.  My room had a view of the trip which was nice.,40
Superb and homely service. Really liked the way we were taken care of and guided. The spread also was huge and awesome. The waitress who attended to us was very friendly and she took real good care of us and cared to check what we wanted.,50
"bad 1: checked in loooong quene as in photo. i cant understand why there were only a few staff serving such a long Q. tip: book direct with hotel next time so can use e-check in. bad 2: The Sheraton is comprised of two towers. Earth tower is far from swimming pool.  tip: to avoid the looong walkÔºåchoose sky tower if available. esp if you are travelling with kids/old family members.  good 1: comfy bed n clean room. good 2: swimming pool is big. safeguard is responsible since i saw him asking 2 children who play without adults' attendance.  Overall: an average hotel staying experience. Did the job but surprised that there were NO staff expressing greetings, as a hotel residence, during our 2D1N stay.  It's cool if you like this cold feeling.  ",30

Blessed to stay at the Sky tower, just switch to level 4 for the pool, level 2 for an indoor playground, Marks and Spencer, plus straight down to the ground level for Palms.  A breeze to go anywhere in Cotai!  I check-in at 17:30, the guest before me was being served, like 15 minutes.

Upon arrival at the Macao International Airport, we took the Sands shuttle to the hotel (second stop). As the shuttle service is free, it is natural for us to expect self-service from boarding to arriving at the property. However, during arrival at the hotel, a guest service ambassador named Brent was ready to assist, helping us with our luggages from getting it from the hold of the bus until it was delivered to our rooms.

He told us the amenities and the restaurants around Sheraton. Further to this, as we enjoyed the pool with our granddaughter, the services provided by Mr. Rabin Rana Magar were absolutely for 5 star hotel. Mr. Rabin is super nice, well accommodating, friendly and most of all very smart. You might be thinking why smart, this is because he presented himself in a humble way and with full of knowledge of amenities and services that are available in Sheraton.

Traveled recently with office colleagues. We were welcomed warmly at the reception. Hotel lobby is spacious and the staff is helpful. Restaurant had arranged Indian food for us which was good in taste by & large. Casino is available at lobby floor hence no no need to go to Venetian :-).  All rooms are good with good quality sleep. Lifts are very fast. Huge conference halls available at hotel and also a huge shopping center which starts from hotel lobby and continues to all nearby hotels.,50

"Stayed here in June 2019 and the hotel is good, however:  1. Check in and check out is a nightmare- prepare to wait in the queue for around 35-40 minutes. 2. You don't really feel special as a guest because it's so crowded. For me it just misses that personal touch 3. Rooms are quite out dated 4. Room service is pricey and the food isnt good  Now for the good: The location is superb The hotel grounds is lovely   ",30
"Stayed here for two nights with my family which included my wife, two young children, and two parents in their late 60s. Everyone was happy which, of course, pleases me too.  We stayed in the family suite. It was spacious enough to take all of us, and was well-designed to be family-friendly. The room had features that catered to all of us, but the kids were probably most happy, with so many elements designed with them in mind. Definitely one of the most kid-friendly hotel rooms I have seen so far.  The hotel has also pretty much most things we needed. F&B outlets were surprisingly-good, and with the Marriott Elite member discounts applied, the final bills were more affordable than we had expected.  Service here was excellent. Almost every single member of staff we encountered on‚Ä¶",50
I made a booking for my parents in Sheraton grand Macao to celebrate their anniversary. The hotel provide the room with nice view. And also put the handwriting  letter from Korean ambassador Peter Jung with wine and cake to enjoy the romantic mood at anniversary night. My parents touched by thoughtful service from Sheraton grand Macao.  It was the most memorable vacation as well as anniversary for my parents. Sincerely appreciate the service from the Sheraton grand Macao especially to Korean ambassador Peter Jung.  I hope to comeback Sheraton grand Macao again myself with my girlfriend. ,50
"I had a group of eight adults including two seniors when we arrived at the check-in counter on the ground floor. It was chaos with the crowd and I queued at the designated queue for Marriott Bonvoy Elite Gold Member. The other seven did not join the queue but were standing by the side near a pilar so that they were not blocking others.  Then came a lady in RED. Her name is Karen. She directed me to check-in at level 4 with a lounge by the side. I am so grateful for her arrangement. We could leave the crowd immediately and the other seven adults could take a rest and help themselves with refreshment while I do the check-in at the counter. Karen also made arrangement with Guest Service Ambassador, Smith Casal to take care of our luggages at the ground floor.  Faustine checked us‚Ä¶",50
"The only issue we have faced when we were checking in was the availability of the the other room. We have booked for 2 rooms, we arrived at half past 5PM only to have 1 room available.... But overall, our stay has been delightful. I have written to the Guest relation about my niece who will be celebrating her 5th bday during our stay, the GR Team was quick and generous enough to prepare simple surprise for her inside the room and she loved it so much.   Hotel is a short walk to Parisian Hotel where the replica of the Eiffel Tower stands.   The hotel offers free shuttle to almost everywhere. If you wish to visit the nearby hotels take the shuttle from East lobby with the name Cotai Connections - it drives around (just to best of what i can recall)  COD, MGM, Wynn Palace, Galaxy,‚Ä¶",50

"Dining Nice dining service, thanks Kabita Mahat.  She is helpful and friendly. She always notices the needs of the customers and offers help. She is efficient and thoughtful.   Hotel Room Spacious and clean.  The only thing needed comment was the checkin queue. It took around an hour in waiting for checking in though it is understandable during the summer holiday peak season. ",40
"Visited this hotel 5 years ago thinking that it is still one of the finest hotel in Cotai with impeccable service at the club lounge .. was I wrong !!!! The lounge has deteriorated into a canteen type environment with disastrous ambience.. people were piling up the food they cannot finish and it was like a disaster relief centre.. real disappointing  Room wise things are looking ‚Äútired‚Äù and towels definitely need a change ... housekeeping is bad too. Definitely will not return as there are many many choices in this area now with many more hotels up like MGM,Wynn,Parisian,etc just across the road from Sheraton. I suspect the management has changed hands to local management",10
"We would like to thank Grand Sheraton Hotel for the good accomodation especially the one who assisted us - Jetro from the reception area. We were given enough information to make our stay fun and enjoyable.   Surely we get the value we paid for! We had fun with our stay, good food and easy shopping!  Thumbs up!",40
"Had a fantastic short vacation in Sheraton Grand Macao Hotel because of the amazing, friendly and fast services of Sheena, Jethro and our room attendant. We will surely go back again to Sheraton Grand Macao Hotel!",50
"Check in can take a long time. Despite having a huge check in lobby with many attendants, the sheer size of this complex means that there can be a lot of people waiting to check in. It took me more than 30 mins to get everything done (and that's at the dedicated family check in desk).  Being a massive hotel complex meant it felt very impersonal. You feel like one of the many thousands of people that pass through.  The rooms are large and the bathrooms are massive. There's great water pressure in the showers. There are two sets of pools (one for adults only). The family pools felt very busy and crowded.  The complex has a lot of shops and has an enclosed walkway across the street to join up with the Venetian and Parisian. It's a good location if you want to stay out of the heat.",40
I really liked the morning breakfast it included all kinds of cuisine including indian too. Its on the strip which is similiar to vegas. You can easliy stay  here. rooms were superb. Check in does take a time as it is crowdy place.,50
"Thank for Raphael! We traveled to macao from July 10-12. Chek-in took place in the membership lounge. But we reservation was canceled. At that time, the person in charge of check-in was Raphael. We were embarrassed and didn't know what to do.  For a long time Raphael helped and finally we could make a new reservation and check in. If he weren't, we wouldn't have traveled. His bright smile and kindness still come to mind. It's been a long time. I want to say thank you. My family made a lot of memories and finished the trip. I want to say thank you again. Thank you Raphael!",50

Her customer service is superb and she always talks in a friendly tone which i found that she is very warm to talk to. She made sure that my family, specially my kids will enjoy our stay. Christian from pool services was very accommodating and friendly as well.

"If you are staying in Macau definitely stay on the Cotai Strip. It is opulence I‚Äôve never seen before.  Sheraton was amazing. When checking in (very busy) a lady obviously saw us looking confused and took us up to a private check in area where the kids could sit and the line up was quicker.  Special call out to Rechell the guest ambassador who checked me in she was lovely & helpful and also arranged an upgraded room, late checkout and LEGO and chocolates were sent to the room later that day. The kids were blown away.  From our room we could overlook the dancing water at Wynn‚Äôs and the Venetian. I spent so much time just looking out the window.  The hotel is huge but easy to get around.

One of them brought us a wrong item and asked me to call again instead of him assisting to tell his colleagues to bring the item. ",40
"The least expensive of the few hotels in this area. Connected to the venetian and parisien by a walkbridge. but not the grand hyatt. So, if you'll be seeing the water dancer performance, it's a bit of walk outdoors to get there. Rooms are clean, no surprises.  Not bad for the buck.",40

"The first thing I noticed about the Sheraton Macau, and Taipa Island in general, is the shear size and awe of everything. Macau basically took a bunch of US buildings from Vegas, World Trade, Space Needle, and actually created better versions of them.   The appointments in this hotel are what you would expect from a top tier hotel. Everything is immaculate, the staff are friendly and welcoming, and even though Macau is more tailored towards Chinese visitors, I did not feel terribly out of place.  Review disclaimer: I am a US traveler and therefore my tastes may be different than others.  Rooms: The rooms are very well appointed and the bathrooms are gorgeous. The water can be as scalding hot or as ice cold as you want it and the marble and stone work must have been expensive as‚Ä¶",30

"I was suprised when we got it to the hotel that there were a lot of people, this is because the casino is near the entrance and it's also a mall. A Filipino staff in the hotel, Sanjieb, has offered us some help with our luggage and assisted us in our check in as he said that there are a lot of people on that day and there's a long queue in the check-in counter and it will take us quite sometime before we can really go to our room. With his help, we were able to complete the check-in process and go to our room in less than 30mins. He was kind enough to explain and go through to us again all the amenities and facilities that we can enjoy in the hotel. He even gave some inputs where we can go nearby and places that we can visit.  Overall, our stay in the hotel is very comfortable.‚Ä¶",50

Original room was in the sky tower, room was a nice size but had a strange greasy/oily smell. Arm chair had large pen scribbles on the arm rest, tv was damaged and the sheets had black marks on them ( possibly from the laundering process) I brought this to the attention of the hotel so we would not be charged  and requested if we could get a refund and leave to find accomodation else where. They offered to change the chair, hsk brought a ioniser or alternatively we could room move.

"Conveniently Located on the famous cotai street, Sheraton Grand doest appeal as much as its counterparts possibly due to lack of a grand lighting and laser loaded building.  The Hotel was well connected to Venetian and Parisian.  The check in process was the worst I have ever seen, taking more than an hour in the Q. Inspite of a huge Q only 15 counters were operational out of 20-22.  Did not use much of the services but the breakfast provided in their italian restro Bene was good. Casino was comparable to others like Venetian and Parisian. Room had views of the parisian Eifel. Overall, a good bargain at 40% discount to Venetian and Parisian.",40

"Great location, 10 minutes from ferry terminal and walking distance to many casinos and hotels.  Used the VIP club a few times - nice breakfast with lots of choices.

Special mention for Ruby P. In the club. She helped my girlfriend to check in when I was delayed arriving. She also checked with the Chef when I had a culinary question about a recipe in the club. She really goes out of her way to help the guests and provide good service.  Fitness/pool area is really good. Two large attractive pools, Sauna and steam room, gym and fitness center.

Sheena was full of advice on places to go and how to get there experiencing local life with the public transport  It was a great stay and everyone was so helpful.",50
Felt as if this was my second home. Hotel front desks personnel (shoutout to Rechell Ann and Jetro) were easy to communicate with and ensured that transaction from check in up to the experience inside the hotel lived up to its claims of being 5star. Food at Bene is also authentically italian and staff (Hi Nelle of bene restaurant!) at the restaurant are all helpful and knowledgeable with food they serve. Will surely visit again!,50

"Sheraton Grand is a fine property.  Rooms were spacious and service staff was first class.  The hotel provides both shuttles to/from ferries and airport, as well as a around Cotai shuttle that takes guests among about 6 hotels in the area.  It is also connected to St. Regis/Conrad/Holiday Inn/Four Seasons so you can use the services offered by those hotels.    One drawback of the hotel was that because Sheraton's casino, restaurants, shops, and the lobby were all on the first floor, that area gets very congested.  The check-in and check-out lines can be intolerable at peak times.  It would have been better if the lobby was located on an upper floor.

"We stay only 1 night at Sheraton Grand Macau. The 1st night we stay at Sofitel Macau. We take Sofitel shuttle bus to ferry terminal, then we change to Sheraton shuttle bus. No need to take taxi from Sofitel Macau City to Sheraton Taipa. The lobby is very big. We have to walk 5min from the bus stop to the lobby. The room is very big ( 42m2 ) with 2 double beds. We can walk to Venetian & Parisian. We can also take free shuttle bus to Galaxy. We walk from venetian west lobby to Taipa Village ( 15min ). No need to take taxi from Sheraton to Taipa Village ( take sheraton free shuttle to venetian or walk to venetian )",50
"So glad to meet kapwa pinoy here. Thanks to Wilson Dumpit of Sheraton for making our check in process easier.  Wilson is very accommodating, informative and friendly. Will be back in staying here in Sheraton! Hope we could stay here a bit longer so we could enjoy the amenities. üòä",50
"This place is a complete zoo. Attached picture is the line to get into the lounge. Complete mayhem. Avoid the Sheraton Cotai unless you love massive crowds and a maze of a hotel. The staff was friendly and generally wonderful, but management left them to deal with outsized crowds. ",10
"We stayed at Sheraton Hotel 2nd to 3rd of July and we loved it! All the staff were very accomodating from entering the hotel, until checking out. I would like to commend Sheena for welcoming us with a sweet smile and she even assisted us until the check in area. Same with Fernice in the lobby area. Also Eduardo for giving us the perfect room for our wedding celebration and check us in smoothly. Wilson Smith was also kind enough to help us with our things and guide us to our room. Breakfast at the club lounge was also superb! Thanks to Gigi for assisting us and accommodate all our needs. And to Ruby who was very kind and jolly to assist us on checking out. I will surely book your hotel again soon and even recommend to my friends. Not only you have a very good hotel but a very‚Ä¶",50
"I had a great time at Sheraton Grand Macao Hotel! The room was very nice, we loved the view! The check in and check out was very smooth. I love the hotel‚Äôs ambiance, the mall and it‚Äôs accessibility.  The staffs were very accommodating and friendly especially Sanjieb, Nato, Smith and Teddy. They were the ones who assisted and guided us with our 4 days and 3 nights stay. It was our first time in Macao and they were very helpful and always happy to assist our group.  Thank you Sheraton for this experience and we‚Äôll be back soon!",50
"Being a platinum member, I am glad that I got upgraded to a suite room in Sheraton Macao. This Sheraton is such a big hotel with 2 main buildings. Make sure you access the correct building:)  The casino is just downstairs and adults can go for a walk. The staff are friendly and they recognised my platinum membership, as well as the gold membership of my family members. Definitely worth for another try. Will pick the hotel again for my next stay!  See the photos of the wonderful choice of F&B at club lounge during the happy hour:)",50
It‚Äôs just been a couple of days past but the memories that myself and my whole family had with Sheraton Grand was truly in a word Amazing. I would like to thank Erika and her team in assisting us for stay.,50
"We love the service provided by Erika Mallari one of there guest relation , she assisted us very well even the preparation of our room, she even cut some colorful happy birthday lettering, prepare mini cake and rose petals.... Thanks again Erika !!!! We‚Äôll come back surely !",50
"No improvement since hotel opening, the check-in problem is extremely bad, people have to queue up for an hour waiting for check-in.  The hotel fixed the check-in time at 3pm but they are not consider flexible check-in time to avoid crowded in the lobby at the same time.  It's really bad!",20

Me and my fam√≠lia stayed in the hotel for 23 nights and I want to share our amazing experience specially on the pool. All the people was friendly specially M√≠sha. She treat my daughter so well and always ready to help us.,50
"Thank you to your very accomodating staff ; Joyce T (check in counter ) for helping us with our booking, also to Vlads (bellman) for assisting us, and the rest of the filipino staffs in the main lobby for accommodating all our needs.",40
"1. Hotel isn't clean enough, I saw some stains in the bathroom.  2. This hotel is quite far from Taipa tourist area, it takes 20+ minutes walk.   3. There are two towers, I was staying in the earth tower which is very far from the pool. And the design of the pool is quite strange, there are 13+ tiny pools that I could cardly swim.   4. Mattress is a bit too hard for me and my mum. We both couldn't sleep well. ",20
"I had a great experience with my family while staying at Sheraton grand Macao. Everyone in hotel was so helpful and courteous which has made the experience for my family memorable. I would like specially say thanks to Margret and Teddy for making my stay great. I would recommend everyone going to Macao to experience there. Apart from courteous and helpful staff property is also great with lavish breakfast and number of swimming pool.   Really had a great experience! Would love to come back and experience again.  Regards,",50
"We would like to thank the staff, Jetro, Sheena, Smith and another Filipina housekeeping staff, for the great experience we had in Macau, Jetro and sheena briefed us where to go to enjoy our stay in Macau  when lost, Smith, on the otherhand, we used fb live for directions",50
"Everything was more than excellent. Check in - check out was a wonderful experience. The staff was very helpful.   Breakfast spread was mind Blowing with so many options that one could not even check out :)  The location was too good and the walk on Cotai Strip was worth the whole trip.  Breakfast, house keeping staff were all nice and hard working. Just love this place. Will definitely be back.   ",50
First time in Sheraton Macao but certainly not the last time. The lady who checked us in was very helpful (Vanessa?) everywhere fully crowed but no compromise on service delivery. just love this place. Will definitely be back. ,50
"The hotel might have good reviews but my first impression with this hotel was total disgust. What 5 star hotel in the modern world has you wait over an hour just to check in?  This was not even as check in first opened, but several hours later.  Sheraton is a second class hotel in the United States and I guess it applies to the Macau location as well.  This review is just based on the check in process. Pathetic.",10
"Alexis Bollman, Guest Service Ambassador, was very helpful during our stay and stood out as he helped my parents who are seniors with their needs. He epitomized great customer service and it was great to see a fellow Filipino excel in his profession",50
"This hotel is great value for money with lovely buffet breakfast included. There are nicer hotels nearby, including the Conrad where we stayed during our last trip, however the location is right next door and it is well connected to the Venetian/Parisian etc and MGM is just across the road behind the complex. Would happily stay again.",40
"There 2 towers connect and also comment with shopping mall and another few hotels and shopping arcade , the hotel welcome service are very good since you ooff from hotel free shuttle bus , the stuff already help you arrange your luggages and guide you to your correct registration place as your booked ; and the executive lounge provide breakfast and afternoon drink and food also ; room design is very modern and with very fair price , during 1 month staying time , I almost everyday use all kinds of hotel shuttle bus to many famous places in Macau include bus WiFi service ; help me save a lot of transportation cost ,",50
Wilson and Eurika in front desk was quite helpful and professional. They knows how to anticipate guest needs which we has been delighted. Nice room+Wonderful location+Good service=We will back again if we got an opportunity to visit Macao.,50
This hotel is in a great location. The check in staff were so welcoming and helpful. KC was brilliant. waited with our luggage while we checked into room. Then when leaving found us as we headed to check out and again watched our luggage so we didn't have to lug it about. He also made sure we didn't miss our bus to the ferry. He was polite and gave great directions.  The lady who checked us in was great too however I forget her name. She got us bottles of water as it was hot (of course) and gave us brochures for the things we wanted to go to.  When checking in the guy on checkin made sure we had three rooms at least on the same floor.,40
"We had a pleasant stay! Many Thanks to Sanjieb & other staff for being so helpful & accommodating. The kids had fun!!! Also, we appreciate so much the surprise cake for my daughter because it's her 8th birthday. Very nice & cozy a must Hotel to stay when in Macau.  Espinosa Family ‚ô•Ô∏è From Bohol, PH",50
Stayed there for 2 night all were great but only one thing was disappointing that there smoking floors were not only smelling of smoke but also was full of smoke ...!! I hope by putting a better ventilation system this problem will get removed .

"We recently stayed at the Sheraton Macau from 16th June to 17th June. We had a pleasant stay in one of your very comfortable rooms, however, on the last day we had an issue that we feel wasn't handled as well as we believe it should have been. Please see the following point:  1. We checked out at 13:00 and proceeded to leave our luggage with the bell service.   2. We returned at a little past 18:10 and collected our bag, then caught the transfer bus to the Macau Ferry.   3. On reaching the Macau Ferry at 18: 35¬† we discovered that we had left a personal item in our room (3144 Earth Tower). We therefore boarded a return transfer bus back to the Sheraton.   4. We arrived back at the Sheraton at approximately 18:50 and went straight to the concierge desk, where we informed someone‚Ä¶",10
Had a great stay at the sheraton macao.  Josie Bilag was instrumental in ensuring my stay was made perfect and comfortable.  Coordinated efficiently and promptly prior to my arrival and had a nice welcome note on top when i arrived.  Jocelyn Zhu in the club was very efficient and friendly upon check-in as well. Coincidentally she was there for my departure and everything was smooth as expected.  Couldnt be happier with my visit. Will definitely come back.  Thank you again Josie and Jocelyn!,50
Was attended by Wilson and Vimi at the front desk and was very happy with their service. They had our welfare in mind and they were offering alot of advice to us while we waited for our rooms. They explained alot of the procedures clearly and we felt comforted since we had to endure a long day of travel. Was very happy with to have met them. Do keep up the good work! Thank you. We had a lovely stay at the Sheraton.,40
"Thank you Sheraton for making my vacation so memorable and so relaxed. The place is so good for relaxation and the staffs are approachable especially to the one who assisted us MAAM SHEENA PERALTA, thank you so much Maam. Till our next visit.",50

I really enjoyed our stay here. Thank you so much.",50
"Sheraton Hotel Macau's staffs, Sheena Peralta, Jetro and Smith are excellent in their service to us guests.  We will recommend Sheraton hotel to our friends and family. Rooms are clean.  Room service is very good and prompt.  ",50
"Nice hotel with great location, and good service.  We played Casino all day.  Only thing I didn't like was that long queue when check in.It has bus service to the bus terminal, ferry and old town. I will recommend to my friends.",40
It‚Äôs my third time to visit Macau and first time to check in to a five star hotel. All the staff are very accomodating and great. A guest service ambassador approaches us with a big smile for the bell service. Thumbs up for you Samuel Unida great service.  We‚Äôll come back here at Sheraton Grand Macao Hotel. ,50
"Great hote, warm welcome and accomodating personnels always approach us with a smile. Tnx Mr Samuel (guest service ambassador)for your assistance and hospitalty. Looking forward for my next visit together with my friends and family.",50
Great hotel.Rooms are exquisite. Amazing view of Macao. Service is also excellent and accommodating for non-natives. Kudos to Mr. Samuel for his friendly and amiableness to guests. I will definitely recommend to friends.,50

"Sheraton Grande Macao is the largest Sheraton hotel in Sheraton system with 4000 rooms.  The hotel has easy access to Parisian hotel (Eiffel Tower) and Venetian hotel (indoor canals) via air conditioned pedestrian bridge.  Hotel shuttle buses can take you to Wynn Palace where nightly water fountain show is a must see.  Room was large and bed was comfortable, price was very reasonable.  Food court has many eateries but prices are only slightly less than hotel restaurants where you do not have to look for place to seat.  Many entertainment locations (i.e.; the Eiffel Tower) offer 65 years old senior discount if you ask.  The best part of the hotel besides accommodation and location is the welcome agent, Sheena Peralta. She was very warm and helpful.  She gave us detailed written‚Ä¶",50
"My appreciation of the exemplary service I received during my recent stay at Sheraton Grand Macao Hotel cannot be overstated. Every staff member I met was friendly, courteous and knowledgeable. Thank you for the warm welcome Brent & Jetro.   ",50
"I‚Äôll start with the impeccable service. The staff were amiable and extremely helpful. They even gave us useful travel and commute tips. A special shout out to Genevie, Aries, and Andrea for helping make my first buffet experience in Macau a great one!  The food was pretty good. Enjoyed the Asian dishes the most. But try out the lobsters and feast on the fresh oysters to get your money‚Äôs worth!",40
"Five star service. Their waiters and waitresses were the most welcoming and polite people we‚Äôve encountered on our trip, special mention to Genevie and Kersey! Four star food because of the really fresh oysters, but the crab section only had crab legs. Recommend this if you‚Äôre looking for a decent buffet in Macau with a decent price!",40
"Service with a great smile, room cleanliness, taste of luxury, are definitely a BIG YES for us with Sheraton Grand Macao. From checking in to out, we were definitely delighted. At first, there was this discouraging long queue at the check-in lobby, but my BonVOY saved me the waiting time; thanks to Sheena Peralta, the energetic Guest Service Ambassador who assisted us all the way until we got our room. A box of sweets in an elegant Sheraton box delivered to our room surprised us no end.   All in all, our stay is awesome. The room is neatly appointed, luxuriously clean, stuffed with everything we need: great Sheraton beds, many pillows... and the view to our room is simply breath-taking.  Sheraton will definitely be our address in our next stop in Macau.",50
"We had a lunch at Feast Restaurant before we checkin in our hotel room. so many foods to offer, clean and good ambiance, friendly and approachable staff specially JEZ, JUN and IVY. They gave us good, quality and perfect service. It was a good and memorable lunch. Thank you again JEZ, JUN and IVY. ",40
"A very nice hotel with great location, and good service. It's right on the Cotai Strip and has underground access to almost all hotels and shopping center. Food was great with a huge buffet! The only thing I didn't like was that swimming pool closes at 8pm.",50
"excellent service by name Sanjieb (guest service) he is very helpful and can speak english (since is very frustated, some few people cannot speak english in macau), long queue when check in need to be resolved",40
"I cannot even begin to explain or describe how amazing this hotel is. Right on the Cotai Strip, it has access to all the hotels without having to walk outside. The rooms are luxurious and comfortable and impeccably clean.  The staff were always there when needed, equipped with a warm smile every single time.  Breakfast was a vacation on its own. Huge, Vegas style buffet with anything you can possibly imagine. Eggs, Waffels, Ice Cream, Donuts, breads, soups, you name it, they got it. And so, so yummy.  Highly recommend this hotel but take notice that like other hotels on the strip, access to the old city or Tapao is not that easy...it requires public transportation.",50
"This is an excellent hotel with great room. Room service was great. Ordered food once and it was fantastic. Staff overall are very good. The only thing negative in this hotel is the check in process. Yes it has over 1000 rooms but they really need to come up with some solution. It took me 90 mins to get a room! None the less, will I stay here again? Definitely yes!",40
"we were surprised with a bed sprinkled with red roses petals & a box of sweets, as I mentioned in my booking that me & my hubby are celebrating our 22nd wedding anniversary! i never expected but this hotel managed to do an extra job!   our overnight stay in Sheraton grand hotel was amazing! the view at our window was a romantic Parisian tower.. the room was really specious & clean bed so comfy. there was a long queue at the hotel lobby when we checked-in but this wonderful receptionist, Fern,  and Juliana, who assisted me & my young son  a hassle-free one. must definitely stay here for our next vacation.",50
First and last time staying in this mega stinky hotel. The corridor at the ‚Äúnon smoking floor‚Äù stinks with cigarette stench. Room and bathroom were overused. You feel like a no body in here. Breakfast costs a fortune with no proper service. Never again. ,20
"The Hotel is located directly at the Cotai strip, opposite of the Venetian and Parisienne Hotel. So if you want to go there, the location is perfect. The old town is a 15720 Minutes drive away. The Hotel is really huge, and that is the only disadvantage, the ways inside the Hotel can be quite long, like from the Sky tower where I was to the breakfast - and the breakfast room was pretty crowded. But the breakfast was great, a huge choice and good quality. The room was excellent. The bed has the usual great Sheraton quality, you sleep very well. It was convenient to work in the room, Wireless Lan worked well and so did all the rest. The bathroom was nice as well. All in all, once you reached your room, you feel great. Prices in the Hotel for food aso are, as everywhere on the‚Ä¶",50
"We stayed for 3 nights at Sheraton. The room set-up is great. I love the bathroom, so huge and well planned. Staff were nice especially those who assisted us when we departed the hotel. Fern, Alexis and Brent were so accommodating and helpful. They gave suggestions to make our travel easier and more convenient. They were so friendly and courteous.",40
"Stayed here for one night on 31 May - 1 June 2019. Hotel is crowded so there is no upgrade to my room which is acceptable. Service of the lady at the front desk is good. The room is a pretty standard 4 Star hotel room. We checked out around 2 pm on 1 June 2019. Instead of the usual check out point, they asked me to check out using the self checkout on the LCD screen. Did everything correctly but till 5 June have not receive my night credit. This resulted me in missing out ""Double Take: Earn double points"" promo. When i called them on 4 June 2019, they told me they have posted the points already...",20
"Generally the hotel was awesome, facilities were great, delicious food & excellent location with connecting bridges to the other hotels like Parisian, Venetian & Four Seasons Hotel were you can do shopping. Our room  was upgraded instantly w/ the view of Eiffel Tower. There is a convenient check-in counter for family travelers.  But what makes Sheraton extra special were the Staff specially Ms. Erika who pampered us during our stay. She made sure everything was perfect even before she left for holiday. Got a complimentary extra bed for my daughter, play book, free ice cream & delicious treats for the whole family. What else can you ask for!  The Filipino staffs will makes you feel home away from home specially Dan & Samuel who help us with our heavy luggages. Thank you so much‚Ä¶",50
"Outstanding hotel!! Nice size of the bedroom and enormous bathroom. Beautilful view from the window (tour eiffel). The gym was huge and well equiped. We did not try the swimming pool, was winter. The staff was great and walking distance to shopping and all the hotels. It has bus service to the bus terminal, ferry andold town. We will repeat",50
"The hotel was fine itself but what made my experience great was a few staff members who delivered great service- I want to especially mention Guest Service ambassador Samuel who helped carry my extremely heavy luggage all the way down and load it in the taxi for me, I wouldnt have been able to do it myself- thankyou very much! The staff deserve praise for their efforts especially at the fourth floor lounge!",50
"We have the best experience in Sheraton Macau. I would like to commend the crews and staff of the hotel, especially we feel at home as most of them are Filipinos.   To Erika and Cherry of the frontdesk, who always assisted us whenever we need something.  To Brent who helped us for smoothly checking in and checking out.  To Ruby Pineda and the crew who assisted us whenever we have our breakfast.   There is one issue in our room which  the door can't be opened when we are outside.. thus, my family got stuck outside for hours. They cannot give new key as I am the only one registered that time. Thankfully this was handled and fixed by the staff.   Looking forward to stay again one day. Always enjoying to stay at Sheraton.",50
It's a resort complex but very well organized. Hope you have a gold/platinum status which helps you bypass the check-in/out queue. Rooms are spacious and very clean. Lot's of dining and entertainment options. Got a great treatment at the spa,30

My wife said, she arranged for a special birthday cake and fruits at our room. Appreciate the warm gesture.  Will recommend this to our friends and family.",40
"We organized a surprise party for my husband and booked 2 rooms to accommodate a family of 10. Front Office staff, Shana, help us get rooms with great views of the cotai strip. She even made extra effort to give us extra amenities like a birthday cake and welcome fruits in the room.   The room was neat and the housekeeping staffs were friendly as well. We will definitely consider coming back at this hotel. Thank you for making our stay memorable and special.",40
"We re staying for 2 nights at this hotel , and not a single person offer to help us with the luggages.. Then , no room service at all. We went outside until 3 pm and come back , and still, the room is not ciean yet!!!",10
"Typical casino hotel.Huge hotel with spacious room. Breakfast is good, i went to yum cha restaurant and they provide lots of choices for asian breakfast, those chinese sure will like it. Casino is of course attached to the hotel. Hotel is close to parisian and venetian so it's really great and comes with free shuttle as well",40
"The employees, especially Shana, are very accommodating. She really helped in making our stay a great one. The room was spacious with big beds and the comfort room was squeaky clean with a bathtub and a shower.",50
"Our experience with concierge was much above expectations. Since we checked out with family we had lots of luggage and ""Brent"" our guest service ambassador himself took all our luggage in trolley to the exit which was 10 min away from bell office.

"After a grueling 2-hr travel that turned into 16 hours of nightmare, we couldn't wait to lay down on a bed. Upon arrival, we were greeted by Sheraton the remarkably helpful guest relation officer (can't recall her name) who immediately assisted us to get to the member's queue. The receptionist Raphael provided sufficient background for us to maximize our stay and enjoy the facility. Both were great representatives of the brand.  When we finally got to the room, it was not only spacious, complete, and pleasing to the eyes, but the bed was a gift from the cushion gods. Everything about it was perfect. Can't wait to go back to Macau and stay at this hotel again.  Pro tip: Make sure you're a Marriott Bonvoy member before going there. The line at the non-members reception can be‚Ä¶",50

The bathroom is just OK, with a combination of shower and bath. The service is excellent and the staff are very kind and attentive. I'm Bonvoy Titanium and I had access to the executive lounge. This is one of the best executive lounge I've ever seen. It was never overcrowded, there were always places. In the morning, there is a superb breakfast buffet, and in the evenings the appetizers are so much that you can safely miss the dinner. I especially like to thank for the excellent bar service and the superb bartender in executive lounge.",50
I stayed only one night in macao. It was 10 may to 11may. When i checked in i met Manli zhen. She was very kind and explain how i can enjoy in macao. I just worried my schedule is okay or not. She let me know where i can go. That plan was super great to me.  Becuase of her i would like to visit sheraton grand macao hotel cotai central once again when i go to macao again.,50
We stayed here last week for 2 nights and had a great time. The staff were friendly and hospitable especially Dennis the pool manager who went above and beyond and made us an esspresso martini even though it wasn't on their menu. It was our wedding anniversary and they made it memorable. The concierge staff were also fabolous in helping us with our ferry ticket to Hong Kong airport and checking us in for our flight. Would highly recommend!,50
"We decided to spend 1 night here in Sheraton Grand Hotel Macau last May 25,2019. Everything here is extra. From hotel room to hotel staff (especially Jetro and Sheena for helping us from the time we arrived). Super great service. ",50
"we arrived in Macau last May 25,2019. it‚Äôs our first time to stay in Macau and it‚Äôs a bit overwhelming. Good thing Jetro and Sheena helped us with almost everything. not just with our hotel stay but also with how to get around Macau. it is such a great experience for us. we will definitely come back.   Swimming pool is one of the best spot. especially if you‚Äôre not into gambling :)",50
We received a warm welcome and helpful advice through our stay from Guest Service Ambassador Fern.  She even 'looked after' my 81 year old mum by finding her a seat and providing her with reading materials and water while she waited for shuttle bus to airport.  Check-in and out by Harrison was friendly and polite. Housekeeping also did a great job and was careful in replenishing the amenities which meant a comfortable stay!,50
"I was accommodated immediately in the Concierge by Sheena when I was checking in, even if there were a couple of visitors, she managed to accommodate everybody efficiently. Also, thankful to Jetro who made an effort to find an available room for a possible early check in. The hotel also provides bottled water for FREE (unlimited). I had a very comfy and clean room and accommodates request quickly than other hotels I stayed in. Thank you Jetro and Sheena!",50
"I really enjoyed my stay at the Sheraton in Macau! From check-in to check-out, all of the staff were extremely hospitable. The room was spacious, clean, and well stocked with different amenities. I am not a huge gambler but took a look around the casino and it was very clean and organized. I really like that different casinos were connected by walking bridges and the shopping options were endless! Used the complimentary shuttle service to travel to and from the ferry terminal and into Macau city itself. I will definitely stay here the next time I visit Macau!",50
"I stay overnight with my family in this fabulous Hotel. It is one of the best property I have came across. Super refined rooms and spacious. Bathroom is big enough. Well equipped and specious Gym . Very well connected with all big hotels and shopping arcades. Continental Restaurant ""Feast ""was awesome where we had our breakfast as well as dinner!! Foods were really good. Worth staying in this hotel and enjoy Macau!!!",50
"Enjoyed the accommodation here in terms of facilities, room. Only downside was the long queue in doing check in. Other than this, a place I‚Äôd definitely go back to in visiting Macau in the future. Would want to make a special mention to Fern who was so accommodating in helping out and suggesting possible activities.   ",40
"Kudos to the excellent hotelier Mr. Peter Jung! Everything was perfect about this hotel - the location, the price, the customer service, and you name it!! I would definitely stay here again, if I were ever to visit Macau again.",50
"I stayed last week to celebrate my wife's birthday, check in line was quite long and most of them are Chinese main lander. Had my stay checked in using mobile check in, but only one machine is operational as another machine is out of service. A friendly hotel male staff near the self check in counter is very helpful, he knew that we had mobile checked in already but the system couldn't recognize our data. Finally he appoint us to have direct check in at another counter and we just skipped the manual check in long queue.   At the reception desk we were served by Ana Malit, she apologized us for having the self check in system not successful.

We had a great breakfast experience  with the help of your restaurant supervisor Gigi Medina.  She made us very comfortable and offered excellent customer service during breakfast.  Thank you very much Gigi.  Joaquin and Joy,50
"Before I start this writing, please understand that I am not good at English. This is my second trip to Macau. Thanks to erica's care, I think this is the best trip I've ever made. When I first arrived in Macau, the weather was bad and everything on my trip felt wrong. But she made me stay at home. She was so kind and lovely and really the best.  She helped me make my trip the best.  Her behavior made me think that Sheraton Hotel was the best hotel too. She made me want to stay in Sheraton wherever I went. Thank you again for your consideration. Your kindness was a great happiness to me. Sheraton Hotel should be grateful for having the same staff as her. Ms. Erika, thank you so much!! I want to give you more compliments, but I am sorry for my poor English. I'm really, really‚Ä¶",50

From the airport we took the shuttle bus going to the hotel .. Enter the hotel and we fall in line for checking in .. A lady in red name  SHEENA  came near us and said go the priority line as there were only two people online.. JETRO a very nice guy assisted us in checking process and all our  questions were answered ..then she called somebody to assist us more which happened the same lady named SHEENA .. She give us all the information we need and a handwritten note so we will not get lost getting to our room. Along the way going to our room which located on the 23rd ... we saw the restaurant name I Love Palms .. then she said if you want something to bite ..

"From the airport, we used the shuttle bus. You have to ask around which bus to take because there are plenty waiting and they can be confusing. Good thing there are plenty of Pinoys! We got there around 4pm-ish, and it was supppperrrr duper crowded. Even the priority lane still had a long queue. Well, every queue was long. Good thing my aunt is a Member so she was on a different line as well. And also, thank you to the super friendly Jethro & Sheena, who assisted us on the whole checkin process. Made everything not boring. Kudos guys! They even got us a handwritten note, fruits and chocolates!  Since we were on the 23rd floor, again, the elevator is different. So be careful, read the signs or you might not end up on your floor. Love the beddings. Pillows were just so soft and‚Ä¶",40
"Have been in Macau in early May '19 and stayed in Grand Sheraton  with family for two nights. We stayed in deluxe room - Rooms: very spacious, two double beds in room - Views from room: We stayed in Earth tower,  and was greenery all around - Breakfast: Amazing with too many healthy  options to choose from - In and around: Shopping shops in Cotai Central  are many showrooms,  with costly stuff.  But interiors of hotel be it lobbies or shopping area give it grand look.   Further,  connectivity to all major hotels be it Venician,  Parisian gives it a location advantage.   Overall very much satisfying experience.",50
"I traveled to Macau a few times a year. I usually stayed at Conrad and/or JW Marriott. So this is my first time to stay in Grand Sheraton Macau.  It's an excellent hotel, conveniently located. An easy walk to nearby shopping centers, tons of food nearby, and shopping all around. Super good lounge light dinner and drinks with outstanding service from lounge staff.   The hotel upgraded me to an wonderful city view suite, very nice atmosphere. I could see Venetian Macao, airport and harbor from my room. The staff are friendly and helpful. The buffet breakfast is great with a lot of choices. Rooms have been updated and clean enough. Check in and check out experience was super easy. I would stay here next time when I visit Macau.  Thanks Grand Sheraton. I'll see you next time.",50
"Getting There - Macau is a transport no-brainer due to its hotel / casino competition - you snooze you lose! After clearing immigration, turn right and follow the sign that says ""Hotel Shuttles"" and you'll get to a open carpark of sorts. There are 2 bays so just ask the coordinator which one you should take for your hotel and they'll let you know. The bays do not come with any signage as well, so take note. The bus that takes you to Sheraton is a lime green bus which says Sands Cotai and displaying the logos of the 2 hotels accordingly: Sheraton, Holiday Inn, and Conrad. Intervals are about 15-20mins. The ride takes about 10mins.  Price - HKD3,649.41 for 3 nights = SGD633.14 under the Advanced Purchase with Breakfast. Not a bad price for the Cotai area where other hotels can be‚Ä¶",40
"Let me start with the good things first. I appreciate the friendly service of gym and swimming pool staff; they were very caring, polite and helpful. I also enjoyed the the room view and hotel's facilities in general.   BUT.... The first POINT OF CONTACT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT AND IT TOTALLY RUINED MY EXPERIENCE. First, ridiculous waiting time at the check-in counter (40-50 minutes). This I still can understand... But totally unprofessional service from the staff is unacceptable in the hotel like this. Every time when I check in into hotel, I give the 100USD or 200USD CASH because I do not prefer waiting for the money transfer on the card (since I only have debit cards). But this time, I already paid for the room through booking.com and still were asked to give the deposit. The‚Ä¶",20
"The whole team made us feel very special, starting with the preparations for our trip and extending through check out and leaving.  Josie and the guest relations team helped us prepare for the trip... updating our reservation  so we could try and get adjoining rooms. It all went smoothly! The whole pool team was great. Mr Lester got us a cabana (388 for the day and four fresh coconuts. A great value!) they took care of us all day.  Breakfast at Bene wasn‚Äôt cheap, but was a good value.  Walking distance to all the top Cotai hotels. We always enjoy a ride on the Wynn cable car.  Be sure to show your sands card or our bonvoy number to get discounts throughout the hotel. ",50
I have stayed in a few 5 star hotels before but their staff at Sheraton Grand Macao Hotel is quite phenomenal to the extent that their service is a rarity.  They went out of their way to assist me and and family in checking in and even guided us as to where we can take a tour around the city and how to get there with ease.    Our room had the most picturesque view overlooking the Cotia Strip which made our stay very memorable.    I had to make a shout-out to their exceptional staff starting from Joyce at the check-in counter to Sheena who guided us from moment we stepped inside the hotel to the other staff who were always smiling and answer out queries or point us to the right direction when we get lost.   .  Their staff are always the first to approach their guest and ask if‚Ä¶,50

"Our booking is on the day before the Mother's Day. There were so many people that we queued up for about 45 minutes. Yet, the staff called Shana was so nice and friendly. She upgraded our room for free and arranged a late check-in for us. She also printed a shuttle bus schedule and recommended several tourist spots for us. We felt very satisfied about her service.   The room was spacious, and the beds were comfortable too. The bathroom was clean but a bit stale. The overall room facilities were satisfied. At night, we were so hungry that we tried to order a ramen. There were so many orders that it was hard to call the responsible department. But the staff at the counter was nice and helped us to deliver the messages. The taste of the ramen was so far so good, just don't expect‚Ä¶",40

H learned we were high level club members and took us to the Club Level for faster check in as the hotel was very busy  KC enlisted the help of Erika to check us in, KC kept us informed, got our keys and took our bag to our room  He also was insistent that his colleague Erika was the one to thank.  We appreciated the initiative he took and that both employees were so customer friendly.  They both went above and beyond and made our stay at this very nice hotel more pleasurable.",50

"We stayed one night in this hotel. Value wise for a 4/5 star hotel it is pretty reasonable on a weekend.  The check in was quick and they were nice enough to let me do early check in and volunteer to arrange late check out for us.  The room is spacious, with relevant amenities.  As Macau is pretty humid, the room does have a bit of a smell and a bit sticky when u first went in. They should really enhance the room humidity control. The bed is very comfortable.  The hallway needs refreshing as it looks a bit stale.  Please note the hotel lobby in this hotel is always busy. Like a busy airport terminal.  The spa there is wonderful.

"Loved the pools this time of year when we never had to share so it felt like a private pool. Although it would have been great to have access to an adults-only pool during busier months. Lots of seating available around the pools and service by the pool was very good, with a bar that also serves food close by.   Easy to visit other hotels from here and free shuttle to and from the airport.",40

"The room and bathroom are big. All of the staffs in this hotel are quite helpful and friendly, especially the guest service ambassador, Fern. However, the only small problem of this hotel was the front desk service. Even we are in the priority check in lane, it still need to take more than 30 minutes for the check in process. There is a casino too inside this hotel. So, it quite convenient for those guests, who wish to visit but lazy to go out the hotel.",50

Food is excellent and has big conference rooms, Staff is polite and nice.Most of the staff can understand English. Lifts are segregated as per the floors. Its a very big hotel , many times its confusing to locate the place. It has a nice casino. Room key was a problem   could not open the room twice in three days.Every time one has to go down to reception wait in the queue and was asked to provide proof of identity. Also rooms on the side where air coolers are installed were very noisy even on 28th floor. One should definitely avoid these rooms.",40

I find a room is a room is a room in the good, but not crazy expensive hotels. So the room was okay and there was nothing to get excited about or reduce the review score there.  We had a good view and I'm not sure there would be many rooms that didn't because the hotel is not close to other buildings.   The hotel complex is outstanding and the pools and facilities are first class and it's in a fantastic location for the casinos and the other big hotels, which are all worth a walking tour!

She also allowed us for the early check in and check out...also thanks to her for the lovely chocolate box which was a bit of surprise for us.

Air-conditioning was adjustable and responsive.  The restaurant on Level 1, Palms Cafe and Bar, served international cuisine and was reasonably priced. If you didn't wish to eat in the hotel, there's a foodcourt, Koufu, on Level 3 of the complex.

I cant think of staying another hotel in Macau.",50
It has exceeded our expectations for a 5 star hotel. The room was spacious and the toilet was really big. We were even given an upgrade to a room with a beautiful view of the Eiffel Tower plus a complimentary treat.

Actually, I booked 3 times already last july, january and february. We are very satisfied and happy for what she did. She's the one who's always helping us to find a very nice and comfortable room.

There was enough space for clothes and storage, I loved all the amenities and truly can't complain about anything in the room.  We had Club Level and that was also fabulous.  The food was great, the service even better. We had one waitress, Asmita,  during our time that knew us by name and also remembered the way we liked our coffee. She even offered information on local things to do and even took us out one night on her time off to tour the local area. All of their staff were extremely friendly and helpful.  She was exceptional! They were also in a perfect location, to lots of sight seeing and other restaurants.",50
"Despite a little uncomfortable about the shower room (it leaked a bit), I have no other complain about this hotel. The location is superb, the room is big, the bed is comfy.

He helped us with our itinerary for some sort of activities on what to do in Macau. Also, Christian and Alexis from concierge are approachable they never hesitate to assist us with grace and they're very hospitable. Overall, 'twas a great experience! We had the upgraded room as well with the spectacular view of Macau. I will definitely come back again soon. Thank you Sheraton Cotai team for such an excellent service!",50
"One of the hotels in the Cotai complex, and is very busy, as I guess are most of the properties in Macau. We were upgraded to the premium rooms/suites thanks to a membership status that one of my friends had. Rooms were fabulous with great views of the surrounding areas. Ordered in some room service a couple of times and the food was nice. Also ate at the Food Court which is in the complex but a ten-minute walk through the shopping arcade, gazillion options there and all of them good!   It‚Äôs an easy/indoor walk from the hotel to the Parisian and Venetian hotel complexes",40
We stayed in your hotel last April and we just want to thank you for your warm hospitality.  Thanks Jetro (front desk) for accommodating our requests of a room in front of the Parisian's Eiffel Tower.  Our room was very big too!  The buffet lunch we availed was very good and delicious!  It was all worth it!  We had a blast in Macao.  Thanks Sheraton!,50
Great stay and central location within the luxurious Cotai strip. Accommodation was Sheraton standards. Great views.  Not all pools were heated or accessible so guests were crammed in the singular heated one.  No shuttle to old Macau so had to take to Macau Ferry terminal and explored from there.  Would return to it again. ,40
"Our stay was made memorable by guest service ambassadors Harrison and Erika Mallari. Their kindness and warm welcome were much appreciated after travelling from Hong Kong and walking around Macao the whole day. As an SPG member (now Bonvoy), we were directed to a dedicated counter so check-in was a breeze. Although we made a mistake of not booking directly at their website, we were still treated as VIPs and were given a room on a high floor overlooking the Eiffel Tower. We‚Äôre glad we booked Sheraton Macao. Our room was huge, clean, with comfortable beddings and complete amenities. We will definitely stay here again when we visit next time. ",50
It was a short stay but we have a great one. Thanks to great service from the staff who were very accommodating and hospitable. A+++ for us. Xie xie to Jetro and Rechelle who made us feel so welcome and at home in a foreign country. The welcome message (roses and all) and complimentary snacks and fruits were a nice touch. And our special thanks to Sheena (Guest Service Ambassador) who helped us thru in checking in and patiently answering our queries and going the extra mile in making our family vacation in Macau a special one. Thank you and your efforts are very much appreciated.,50
Beautiful and large hotel centrally located close to everything to see in Cotai Central. Largest hotel in the area and walking distance to all the beautiful hotels and casinos in the area. Many underground and covered walkways attached to the property to allow you to avoid inclement weather.  Shops tend to be very high end but many very good places to dine nearby. We were upgraded to a room that was unbelievable. Casino minimums tend to be high and English is spoken minimally there based upon the folks we encountered.,40
"There's 3 types of check-in counter. One for the normal peeps, one for priority lane for kids & elderly. Another one for membership. Seriously what priority lane is this, they take about 30 mins to check in 3-4 guests.",10
"The room really smells when I first enter and the complementary snacks on the table which we had every time are all missing. My son had a horrible reaction to the bedding as this time as his face was all itchy and red. I had stayed there before and had been a member of Marriott, had never experience things like this time. The room is filthy as it smells like old room, and the bedding aren‚Äôt clean. The check in time for priority lane takes almost an hour which compare to all other hotels such as Parisian is too long and tedious.

"The view of the Eiffel Tower is really beautiful. Jetro, who helped check in the accommodation, is really kind, careful and friendly. I want to visit again later. Thank you for leaving me a good memory.",50
"We spent two nights at this hotel. Travel from Hong Kong to this hotel via the new Hong Kong/Macau bridge is convenience. There are shuttle bus from the Bridge terminal (Macau side) which takes you to Taipa pier and from there change the Sheraton hotel shuttle bus (Cotai Central) to the hotel.  As we are Marriott Gold member, there is no wait to check in to the hotel at around 3pm on the special counter. But I saw a queue on the normal check in counters though.  We were upgraded to the higher floor which overlook the Hotel Parisian.  The room we have is very clean.  This hotel is connected to The Venetian and Ritz-Carlton through inside walkway.  Which is very good when it was raining outside on the two days we were there.   We had breakfast buffet in the hotel. Which is not‚Ä¶",50
I was first greeted by Manli {Guest service ambassador) She was professional and friendly.  My room was upgraded to a full size suite. Included a dinning & living room also was a separated TV room. The bathroom has a full size bathtub and double basin.   The room also included breakfast until 10:30 am also complimentary afternoon tea from 4:00pm to 8:00pm.  Staff called me a couple of times ensuring me a pleasant stay.   Box of chocolates and fruit basket from the general manager.  This is one of the best value 5 stars hotels in the world. Highly recommended and you won't be disappointed.,50
I really enjoyed this huge hotel. Joe and Jacky at the front desk took really good care of me and made me feel welcome and important. Room was well equipped and I had a great view. They have smoking rooms which is a good option to have for some. The lounge is huge and fantastic. Great service and it felt like a 5 star restaurant the way they seat you. Pool looked nice but I didn't use it.,50
I‚Äôve always enjoy my stay in Sheraton the room is huge I love the view And the bathroom is nice. The staff are very nice specially Rachell she‚Äôs very accommodating I love her smile..definitely I will comeback again. Highly recommended,50

"For a HK holiday, consider the final night stay in Macau. The Sheraton Effortless Travel Package was great - booking as a Marriott Bonvoy (SPG) member.  Staying Sunday 14 Apr, we paid HKD1573.2 split room HKD1,368, tax HKD68.40, service charges HKD136.80.

"A very pleasant stay.. Here are some facts: 1. If you go to this hotel from Hong Kong, take the boat to Taipa as it's closer to the hotel. If you take the boat at the Outer Harbor, you have to go through a bridge to get there. The only downside is the Taipa schedule is not as frequent as Outer Harbor's. One thing to note is if you say go from Outer Harbor, you can go as standby on an earlier trip. If you get to the ferry pier early, look for the trips that are scheduled earlier than yours (and the Outer Harbor boats run very frequently). Find out what gate the earlier trip is and there is a place you can queue up as standby. If there are seats available, you can go earlier. Of course, seats availability depend upon what day of the week, and what time you travel etc. 2. As you‚Ä¶",50
"We are regular guests at Sheraton hotels internationally and are so dissapointed by the status of upkeep with the rooms at this hotel.  A horrible smell exists in all carpetted areas, from the lift to the corridor and then the rooms, which can only be described as a mix of old smoke and bodily fluids like vomit and urine. The carpets are stained and the bathroom has grime between the tiles.  The only positive experience is the staff and customer service. Despite their efforts and good will, they cannot change the standard the rooms are in and therefore limited in what they can offer.   Do not come to this hotel with a false pretence of a 5 star standard room.",20
"An excellent and huge hotel with great foods, staffs and ambiance. But the furniture in twin sharing rooms could have been much better which are visually looks not good enough. But the breakfast and lunch will be remembered for a long...",50
Samuel (Guest ambassador) and AJ are very accommodating and friendly. They accompanied us to our room and gave us a lot of tips for our Macau trip. They also gave us the shuttle schedules and recommended places to go to. Thank you highly recommended ,50
"Arriving into the hotel lobby, we were attended to immediately by Brent, a guest service ambassador who graciously directed us to the quick check-in desk.  Brent patiently explained the hotel facilities briefly and gave us first time Macau visitors valuable and helpful information.  At the check-in desk, Ms. Shana Biglete handled our check-in efficiently and answered all our queries to our satisfaction.  We stayed 4N/5D in Sheraton and have nothing but praises for the excellent facilities and efficient service we received. Brent was also around to help us on our departure until we boarded the shuttle to the airport.  FIVE STARS for Sheraton, Brent, and Shana.",50
Fantastic service with really kind and welcoming greetings. Excellent counter service and deiensly staffs incomparable ro other hotels. Room is comfortable and clean. We really did enjoy our stay and will come back next time.,50
"The hotel itself is great! Great restaurants in the lobby, casino is nice. Hotel is located in the middle of the strip so it‚Äôs easy to walk to all the other hotels.  The staff are super professional and caring. Notable mention to AJ who assisted us to our room on the first day, very kind, courteous and attentive! Definitely would come back to stay here!",50
Stayed here for 4 nights due to a business conference. The hotel is massive and very spacious. Hotel staff were very helpful and accommodating.   My room was already prepared and cool when I checked it. The room is also very spacious and had ample space to store my luggage and enough counters/tables so I can set up my laptop and vanity items.   Loved my stay here!,50
"We stayed at the Sheraton Grand Macau April 5- 8, 2019, I want to complement the service of the Bell staff. Rico from the Bell staff plucked us out from amongst a large group during our arrival into the Main lobby.He whisked us up to the Sheraton Lounge where they checked us in promptly. Each time we headed out to Taipa or adjacent properties, the Bell staff were trained to spot us (non-group travelers) and help us on our way. AJ knew the HKG ferry schedules from Taipa so well he saved us an hour by walking us over to the other (Non Taipa) Ferry Terminal bus stop. Thanks for a job well done. We will be back.",50
"Stayed 4 nights and I am impressed by the level of service offered by the hotel staff. Perhaps it is to be expected, given the hotel brand and location but I only had smiles and a willingness to help from everyone I encountered. The room I stayed in was a decent size and had the usual amenities one would expect. The mini bar is empty. I had a weird issue with the cable TV about half-way thorugh my stay - this particular channel had its audio play considerably slower than normal so as to be illegible. The shower can be regulated for temperature but not for intensity. Apart from these 2 minor quibbles everything else was good.",40
"Although there were slight problems with the shower and the speed of request handling, this hotel was still stunning for me and my family, leaving a positive first impression of Sheraton brand for us. The staff were attentive, dili gent and caring even though we were only staying for one night. I would particularly like to praise Carol for her speed and kindness in checking us in and awarding us a free room upgrade to a deluxe room with a unforgettable view of Cotai Strip. My family enjoyed the spacious, comfortable and neat room. The room also did not smell of smoke unlike other hotels we have been to, showing that Sheraton takes their no smoking policy seriously. Next time we visit Macau Sheraton will be one of our top choice. Thank you so much for giving my family a memorable‚Ä¶",50

First to greet us upon arriving to Sheraton was Mr. SANJIEB POSADAS, bellman, very polite and kind, and such a nice tall gentleman.   Second who we always asked question was Mr. TEDDY WEE, bellman, polite as always, smile never fades, a handsome gentleman.   BOTH are VERY accommodating, helpful, they try their very best to be able to help us with our concerns. Hopefully for our next visit id get to see both of you.. or maybe if u guys are promoted i will certainly ask for ur assistance, or look around for you. They were never snobbish,unlike other staff's. These men made us feel welcome and comfortable right from the start and until we left.",50
"Same as previous stay, the check-in queue was extremely long this time.  Then I checked with the customer service at the entrance of check-in queue, whether I could use the check-in kiosk even I made my reservation through Expedia, and she said ""Yes"", then reminded me to have cash ready for deposit.  After spending 15 minutes to queue for the kiosk, I couldn't proceed my check-in though the customer service at kiosk scanned my ID card and retrieved my booking 5 times, and she didn't understand why it happened neither.  Then I had to spend another 50 minutes for another queue, damn.  Nevertheless, Vlad was very helpful for my check-in, my request for non-smoking twin room was granted at least. ",30
"Am staying here as I type.  Really difficult to contact them by email, as all the advertised emails do not work, even the email that the general manager replies to the bad reviews on here doesnt work when I used it!  Anyways the hotel is large and chaotic as expected.  Can see most of the good reviews are from people who were upgraded to a deluxe suite.  We paid for 2 deluxe suite rooms, and wanted them near each other, but instead got them allocated at opposite ends of the building.    They said they were giving us an upgrade at check in, however this turned out to be the same room with a higher ceiling...  Sheraton if you read this, a higher ceiling is not an upgrade!!!  Needless to say hopes were raised, and left disappointed.  The suite is very spacious, but not practical.  ‚Ä¶",10

"The hotel was well maintained, we were originally from thr 17th floor and the staff assisted us with our request for transfer to a room with a view. We got to do so within a moments notice. We were assisted by Teddy who was very kind and answered all of our questions regarding the hotel‚Äôs superior service. Upon checkout we were also assisted by the guest‚Äôs relations member sheena with our last second visits to senado square, and upon returning to the hotel to claim our baggage, once again we were assisted by teddy. Such small gestures make our 2 night stay bery meaningful and enjoyable!",50
I stayed here as part of the conference that I was attending. We did get a choice in terms of options and it was OK. But really just OK. The rooms are getting a little long in the tooth and nothing to write home about. I want to be clear that I‚Äôm not really a gambling town kind of guy and this may have jaded my perspective. But really sunk it for me though was the service level in the bars and restaurants. This is not the place to come for a large convention. They just don‚Äôt seem to have the horse power to be able to ramp up to deal with large volumes and I would say this wasn‚Äôt limited to this hotel - this was pretty much everywhere we went in Macau with a large group.,30
"The hotel was well located and the room condition was clean. Thanks to MELA, the staff who helped me, I was assigned with a good view and she is so kind. Next time I come to Macau, I will use this hotel again.",50
"First of all, the welcoming to the hotel was made by Teddy and Sheena and just for that it was worth the visit. They were lovely, helpful and by far the nicest guest ambassador I have ever met. They even provided me some fruits because I am pregnant and they wanted to make my stay unforgettable. Thanks guys, you made it!  The hotel itself is amazing, the bedroom is very spacious and comfy. You have absolutely everything you need here and shuttle from the ferry port and airport. I hope I will be back one day! Thank you!",50
"Loved staying at this hotel! Beds are quiet small, but still managed to sleep everyone. We got an amazing view of the Parisian from our room and it was right next to the lifts which was a bonus!

We Booked into the Sheraton for 2 Nights and were Pleasantly Surprised by the Service. We were checked in by Manli Zhen and she was Most Professional about her Task. She Upgraded us On Request And Gave us a Lovely Room where we could See the Water Show from our Room. Manli is an Asset to the Team and Being a Businessman Her Talent can be Utilised in A more Senior Role-My Opinion as a HR Specialist. Its a Fantastic Hotel and will Definitely come back Again.,50
"The customer service was great, Tiffa Li was very professional and well explained on the hotel room we had and the facilities that this hotel had.  I found that the room and the bath room were spacious enough for my family of 4.

Special mention for the ""wow!"" service of Mr.Raphael and Ms.Erika who helped us on our check-in process.Truly commendable as they really make sure that we'll have a great and memorable stay in your hotel. As I've mentioned that I will be celebrating my birthday, they had prepared a nice room in upgrade! and even had a complimentary cake delivered. Also, Mr.Andy from room service delivers our needs with a great smile and punctuality.Ms.Erika had called and checked if I need further assistance and if everything is okay, which gives a warm feeling just like at home.

The other couple in our party, first time travelers to Macao, were well looked after by Sheena, who we had the pleasure to run into a few times during our stay. Erika personally followed up with us to ensure that everything was going well, and to check if we had any additional needs or requests.

On a personal note, Smith Casal was the first person to greet me upon arrival from my 24hr flight. I was exhausted and Smith Casal was extremely helpful, courteous, kind, and truly set the tone for a fantastic experience here at the Sheraton Grand Macao. ",40
"As a business traveller, this probably wasn‚Äôt the best choice of hotels. The entire place is (understandably) dominated by the casino downstairs. This means that rather than having a cozy lobby where you can have a drink in the bar and listen to jazz, there is the noise of slot machines instead. There is a huge shopping mall underneath the hotel too. Overall the quality of the rooms (there are over 4,000 of them) was ok but not exceptional. Next time I‚Äôll stay somewhere that isn‚Äôt connected to a casino, if possible!",40
"It's really a good experience in Sheraton Grand Macao. No matter how many guests are waiting for them, every staff is always wearing the friendy smile on the face. Many thanks for Sanjeib‚ÄôS help for carrying our plenty of souvenirs back to our room. It's so sweet. Thank you.",40
"All I can say is ‚ÄúWOW‚Äù. The service in the Sheraton Grand Macau‚Äôs club is second to none, and I have stayed in hundreds of hotels. No other clubs offer this level of service, at any cost.   My first impression, made at check in with Mela, was outstanding. She helped us choose the right welcome gift and gave me an amazing suite upgrade. She was thorough, professional, and kind.   Rowell, the food and beverage manager, did everything he could to make us feel welcome and his smiling face and warm communication made us feel welcome. I told Rowell that the quality of the F and B at the Sheraton Grand Macau is better than any other hotel club serves.

When I checked out, the staff helped me carrying my luggage from fourth floor to in front of the hotel and he asked my destination in order to find the address to explain to taxi driver.

The gentleman from the front desk Mr. Raph Grafil was the one who checked us in. Despite the volume of people wanting to be accommodated, and us losing our luggage tag, Mr. Raph Grafil effectively addressed all our needs and queries. He checked us in promptly, and endorsed us to the proper channel effectively resolving our problem with our lost luggage tag.

Manli quickly apologised even though it was not at all her fault. We got a room upgrade as a SPG member as well. This holiday was just fantastic.

The room was very spacious and well cleaned but hope we had a little better view than fans and A/C vents on casino rooftop.

The sheets and pillows were lovely, they felt luxurious. Bathroom is huge and the pressure of the water is superb.

We consider our accommodation appraisals as fair judgements based on these numerous hotel experiences and in our estimation, this hotel rates very, very highly.

"We recently stayed at the Grand Sheraton Macao at Sands Cotai Central and found this to be a decent property on the Cotai Strip. Our stay was ok but the check-in was very poor.   Reservation was made through booking.com. No early check-in is allowed however there is luggage service that is free if you are a hotel guest. Non-hotel guests - MOP30 per piece.   Check-in was a poor experience. In addition to no early check-in, we returned at 2.40pm, 20 minutes before scheduled time to find a huge queue and a 40 minute wait. Upon arriving at the check-in desk, inexperienced staff slowed things down as well and mistakenly included a double deposit hold on our credit card.

"I had some years not select to stay in this hotel and expected their services would be better since more competitors in the market. I stayed in room 1-2306 from 24/3 to 27/3(3 nights).  When we arrived the hotel lobby and noticed that there were crowded with people. Long queues were waiting in the check in counter. I appreciated the front desk counter staff with patient to arrange a room for us though I waited for some times.  Everything seemed in normal as expected, however on 26/3, at around 1:15pm I called to request for room make up then we went to swimming pool. When arrived the swimming pool, the poolside was noisy with some continuous engine sound. The nonstop noisy sound was annoying and we were not able to have a comfortable time at poolside. After swimming, we back to‚Ä¶",30
"Very pleasant check in experience thanks to Ms Manli at the front desk. Nice and cosy rooms, very comfortable beds. Housekeeping also did a superb job tidying up the room we messed up.

"Six of us stayed in Sheraton Hotel for two nights and we had breakfast and lunch there. The room is not very spacious, but the bed in Sheraton Hotel is really comfortable. We spent about 20 minutes waiting in line to check in which was okay, and checking out was quick. Breakfast and lunch were excellent although we waited in line for quite some time to have the breakfast. I guess if we had gone to the restaurant earlier, we might not have needed to wait for that long. The service in the hotel is great.

"I find it hard to believe that so many people have rated this hotel excellent. Its not excellent, its good at average. The clientele of this hotel are tour bus groups. The check-in line was 40 mins long (it feels like you are line to check in at the airport). The mini bar is empty; you need to call them if you want it stocked. They called us in the morning waking us up when we had not requested not it, waking us all. The room had the necessities but was nothing special. There are better hotels at this price range.",30
"1st time in Macau for a birthday getaway and its a great experience. Thanks so much to Jetro & Sheena from Front Desk, very friendly and accommodating. Love our room with an awesome view. Highly recommend!",50
It was a prefect getaway trip to Macau and special thanks to great service and arrangement by Peter Jung from FO! It won‚Äôt be that prefect without you! For sure will choose Sheraton again if visit next time,50
"The lobby was very busy of queue waiting for check-in.  Luckily, I am member so I got priority at separate check-in counter.  In general, the room condition and view both were very nice.  The bath top is comfortable.  Room service was a bit long (40 min) especially I ordered a cold cut and a bottle of wine which did not need to cook.  Food quality was good and price of the red wine was reasonable.  If you asked me to rate this hotel, I would rate 8 out of 10.",40
"I returned once again to the Sheraton Grand Macao for a stay of three evenings. The hotel continues its outstanding reputation. Upon arrival, I was greeted warmly by Juliana and Joe, guest relations representatives. As a Marriott Titanium Elite member, I was upgraded to a spacious suite with a beautiful vista on the 41st floor, penthouse level. The ambiance is most inviting. There was a thoughtful welcome note from management as well as a bottle of delicious Portuguese red wine, delectable chocolates and an array of fresh fruits which added to the sincere welcome. Such initiatives are most delightful and truly enhance the stay at the Sheraton. The housekeeping staff is timely and provides first-rate services.

"It was a long journey to get to the hotel and we arrived earlier than the normal check in time, a front desk staff i believe her name was Karmen greeted us with a welcoming smile and walked us through the check in with informative hotel orientation for us to get refreshed. We happened to get the room early with her help and her patience to all of our questions made our day not as tiring after all. I gotta say Sheraton hires the right people at the desk to show what hospitality is really about to what I believe is the utter unique element in this hotel. Thank you Karmen, and we will definitely be back to see you again!! Keep up with the great smile!!",50

"Coming back to our favorite vacation destination, the New Marriott Bonvoy program provides a nice personal touch to our experience. The pre-arrival customer service welcome messages and quick responses were very impressive. Arrived around middle night, I was greeted by Erika at the Elite Check in counter with a beautiful smile and gracefulness. Within about 5 minuets, everything was taken care of, plus each question was answered and explained in detail. I was even more impressed when Erika met me at the lounge, she remembered exactly my questions and asked me if I would like her to book our ferry tickets to Hong Kong. She made perfect arrangements, plus provided print outs regarding the room charges  question. We feel welcomed and taken care of at the personal level.",50

"Of all the hotels I have stayed with, Sheraton tops. Aside from its proximity to the airport, the room and its services, the people who run it must be the main reason.  Although the queue is long, I love the idea of expedited check-in for BonVoy members.  I was again assisted by Jethro Pasamanero, who before had helped my check-in process in last year.   It's surprising to know that after a year he would still remember my first name. That's a plus point to which I had never experienced with other hotels. Not to brag but that alone is an elation to guest/s. He still went extra-mile by providing insights regarding new services of the hotel as well as new attractions around, while my room is being prepared.  The main point where Sheraton stands out from the rest is the idea that‚Ä¶",50
"Checked in late evening. Horrendous traffic, traveling 24 hours, confused a bit in the lobby, which is humangous. There are three hotels at the same venue. Shuttles do not share. That was like a cattle show.   Being a Marriott-member, we got a nice check in. The hotel was ignorant in all means. They let the staff to survive. I still wonder, how Sheraton treats the ones, who have the even minimal status (i.e. everyone is the basic patron - money in patron out). I do not need the crystal service. Only the service, the excellent staff provide. And that is excellent!!!   Mr. Anselm Tsang was excellent with his team! At the Club, we obtained a seamless service with Mr. Tsang. At the reception, as well, our agent was extremely nice. I regret to advise, I did not have the details.  ‚Ä¶",40

We were helped by Ruby and Elvin amongst other people through the check in process Everyone was very helpful, extremely nice and all were next to excited to help with whatever questions or needs we had.

Also wanted to mention Keelvin, (wrong spelling?) the waiter and bartender from the restaurant Portofino (Spirito was the name of the bar).  He is great waiter and always smiling.  He was happy to answer all of our questions about Macau.  Thanks to all at the Sheraton!",40
Love the Expedited Check in for Convoy members and the spacious rooms. Stayed for a night recently and got a room with the view of the Eiffel Tower and Studio City Resort. The Beds are really comfortable and one gets a good rest.  Tried the Breakfast at Feast and loved the spread being offered. Lunch at Yum Cha was fabulous and being a guest at Sheraton entitled us to a MOP 500 Credit. Dinner at Bene was fabulous and being a Sheraton Guest got us a Bottle of Wine on the House.  If you're looking for a service oriented hotel then Sheraton is the way to go. Best of all it does not have any escorts lottering around and is a good place to stay with family.,50
"We loved the service and how they treat every guest at the Sheraton in Macau. Even it has not the same expensive room rates as other hotels near-by, they providing the same service, the same luxurious room Interieur and the same astonishing public areas as in the other 5 stars hotels. We were shown the conference area by Darius who was very politely and the perfect host to guide us around.  When coming back to Macau we will definitely chose the Sheraton again.",50

We stayed with Sheraton during our Christmas 2017 vacation and we really enjoyed the service/ accomodation that we decided to come back early March 2018.  We had a problem with Agoda regarding our booking and we informed Alrie through email about it since AGODA is non-responsive at that time. Alrie promptly responded and even communicated with AGODA so the next hour, AGODA already reached out to us to fix the problem.   Checking in and out is a breeze.

"Second, I went to Macau for five nights and four nights with Sheraton Hotel. Thanks to the consideration of Korean employee Lily Kang, we had a very satisfying vacation. Especially, the view was good, and the gym was perfect. Casino was also a pleasant memory. They had good access, and they were also Taiwanese, with shopping malls and delicious yamcharets. I am sorry that I could not use the swimming pool because it rained during the trip, but they were all Taiwanese. The most disappointing thing is that for Korean guests, it would be better if there was a Korean language guide book related to shopping mall.  Thank you. I must go with my family again next time.",50

Unfortunately, we don‚Äôt have a good experience. There‚Äôs no other hotel like Grand Sheraton has no seat area/sofa for the hotel guest unless you are their Marriott Bonvoy member. It is ridiculous for a hotel to let its guest to find a seat at the 3rd floor food court and wait for the check in time until 1 pm. Those arrangements made the guest don‚Äôt feel they are welcomed. We sincerely hope the hotel would make a change and don‚Äôt treat its guest‚Ä¶",20

With this Sheraton I was worried service would be lacking. But despite the size and huge amount of guests I was treated with great care. Carmela H. and Kachi Choi made me feel at home even though I was on the other side of the world. My guest left her phone in a cab and security pulled up the camera footage to get the license plate. We were then able to recover the phone thanks to them.,50

ALL the staff were very friendly, efficient, knowledgeable- giving excellent directions- especially Sheena the hotel guest ambassador who made us feel very welcome and assisted with sightseeing or info on restaurants, was useful.

"This is my 2nd stay in the same hotel.   I did my check in on L4 Sky Tower Sheraton Club and received good service although still feel not as great as being an Accor member.  Generally hotel staff of different department are all polite.  My room view was also great and high floor at sky tower.  The only setback was housekeeping did not complete cleaning even when we return back to our room at 1500hrs.  Hence we decided to call and just request for new towels and bottled water.  Guest service said their housekeeping clean rooms in the afternoon which personally I find it strange.  Also, there was no clean room signage for us to request cleaning when we left our room at 10am too.  Overall a good stay as I always like Shoppes at Cotai Sands which is just below the hotel.",50
"As a SPG member and a repeated guest, this Sheraton outlet kept disappointing us. Check in still need to wait for more than 20 min to queue and even its your turn, the never ending typing of the Front desk staffs made the whole process up to at least 30 more mins. Breakfast in feast restaurant gave up another round of queuing up, even to be seated, the coffee ordered will not arrive until 20-30 mins. As a family targeted hotel, a lot of kids were running all around the buffet table with the balloons hanged out to them by the restaurant, it seemed to be dangerous and it was so full during the whole breakfast period. All the staffs I met were very nice and working very hard, but due to such huge package of families, required services are expected to be limited or none.",20

Service was great will come back for it .",40
"As a poorer cousin to the Venetian, it was not a bad choice for us - cheaper, big rooms, and internally connected to a host of the Cotai strip hotels/ shopping areas. The breakfast was sumptuous - but the restaurant for the buffet was small so one had long queues at breakfast times, and a very long walk fm the tower. My biggest problem was the fact that all restaurants shut at 11.00 pm - for a city supposedly excelling in nightlife, this was very strange! We ended up ordering room service on a few days!!",40
At feast buffet we enjoyed great meals at good mood. Also Ronald&Jetco was so kind and helpful. Because of them we could enjoy the time at feast.I recommend you to visit feast at sheraton hotel~~~!!!!!,50

After we've checked in and got our room (no. 2860), we found used slippers underneath the armchair, the safety door lock doesn't function properly and the shower drips all over the place. We were too tired and can't be bother to ask for a different room at the time, we just want to sleep and leave first thing the next morning. We informed the staff of the room conditions upon check out, whether they have taken actions which would be unknown to us. Probably won't choose to stay with this hotel again in the future",20

Macau is getting too crowdy, waiting for lift took forever with so many ppl and the floor lift #s are a bit confusing at first. I had a slight mini Eiffel tower view and the room was quiet and clean. Shavers quality was not ok.",30
Feast breakfast was very good. My table server VY Sura serve hot choco for my kids.:) Sparkling wine was good. I also enjoyed hongkong milk tea. Parisian view room was excellent. I want to visit here again.,50
"As Marriott Bonvoy platinum elite member, you can avoid the long check in line on the first floor. The welcoming hostess took us (she even help carry my wife‚Äôs carry on) to the members only check in counter on the 4th floor at the club lounge. Katie Teng was very helpful. She make sure we get the kind of room we like and try very hard to upgrade us to the best possible suite - one bedroom, one and a half bath corner suite. At the same time she upgraded my second room next to our suite in the Sky Tower. Both rooms is really nice and with fantastic view. At around 5 pm, we went back to the club lounge for a drink before dinner. We were surprise with the variety of complimentary drinks available (wine, cocktail and beer) and a spread of food that you can enjoy as dinner. The‚Ä¶",50
"Mr. Peter Jung upgrade our room which is Eiffel Tower view room. Every evening we can see beautiful and perfect view. My daughter love it!  If you stay Sheraton macau, can walk to Venetian and Parisian. They have ‚Äúcotai conection‚Äù bus, you can go every hotel in cotai. It‚Äôs free. Next time I‚Äôll stay again. Thank you so much!",50
"The hotel is very large with two blocks.  I used mobile check in and went directly to mobile check in counter at ground floor, but my room was not ready, so I waited at club lounge.  The service of club lounge was much better, a staff there helped me to check in and I could access my room (one bedroom executive suite) immediately at about 12:00.  There are free shuttle services to ferry terminal, airport and other places but there is no shuttle bus to go to the Macau inspection building of Hong Kong Zhuhai Macau bridge.  This is very inconvenience for the hotel guests came from the bridge.  ",40
"So all hotels in the Cotai sands are are large, magnamous, and trying to stand out differently.  Yet all are either side to side or facing each other.  So largely I would say if you are in this area, you are in a luxury zone.  Having said so, what appeals to this hotel is the multi location check in because the traffic of guests is huge.  The rooms are big, well appointed and with all comforts with no compromise.  Location is great as is opposite Parisan and 20 meters to Venetian.   Breakfast is large and staff despite being on the over drive are very helpful and serve services with a smile.  The hotel has its own entertainment and own casino.  You are going to be very comfortable here! ",50
We visited sheraton maco for our anniversary and the girl name MANLI ZHEN gave us free upgrade on 35 th floor and attendant us brillantly highly recommendable. She is so nice and friendly thanks Sheraton for making it memorable !!!!,50
very nice hotel with a large room. everything you need is here.excellent food at the palms cafe.we would like to say a very big thank you to ms Fern from customer service..she has gone beyond our expectations to help us..extremely friendly and full of great informatiom which has really helped our stay here...also to Rachelle at the front office...extremely helpful and ever so friendly...we can not thank these 2 ladies enough...you have made our stay here excellent....5 stars to you both..thank you so much,50
"As a Long time guest of sheraton macau, I must say the experience keeps getting better every time I am here. Ricardo‚Äôs service is impeccable. Eduardo always treats me and my fianc√© with warmth and care. The food manager does a great job in making sure the food quality in the club lounge is top notch!  Cannon",50
"I can‚Äôt say enough good things about this hotel. There is a free shuttle from the ferry terminal (although once the light rain opens I wonder whether the shuttle will be discontinued). You can walk to the other casinos in Cotai and Taipa Village. Old Macau is a short cab ride away.   I was upgraded to a Club room as a Silver elite member; I think it was slow mid-week. The room was very clean and large; there was a separate shower and tub.   The lounge had a wonderful buffet for breakfast and dinner with western, Macanese and Chinese food. Service was attentive.   Pool was an acceptable size and cabanas were nice. ",50
"Our recent stay at Sheraton Macau was truly an enjoyable experience, my family celebrated the baptism of my daughter here. I was impressed from the time I checked in and the whole time we were at the hotel, the staff were very accommodating and professional. I would like to say thank you to Ms. Josie Bilag from Front office who goes out her way to make our stay exceptional. They even decorated our room with balloons and gave  a personalized greeting card üòäand also the Staff from IRD specially to Ryan he was so polite and kind for giving our need and requests. Over all it was a great experience!",50
"Upon arriving at Sheraton Grand Macau, via their free shuttle from Macau Airport, we were overwhelmed by not only the hotel and it's wonderful vibe but also by the number of people checking in (due to Lunar Chinese New Year).  NOTE: We had just completed a 2 week cruise and had left Shanghai very early that morning, I was extremely frazzled by everything.  Sheena must of seen how stressed I was as we entered the lobby, she came straight towards my husband and I providing assistance.  Being SPG members, Sheena directed us straight to the dedicated check-in area for members.  Cristina, at check-in desk, allocated a fantastic room with a view of the Eiffel Tower on the 22nd floor. Sheena was always in the foyer area as we walked through, constantly smiling. After a huge day‚Ä¶",50
"The room was spacious and comfortable. We had a deluxe suite, but interestingly no mini bar. The staff were friendly and helpful. Although the Sheraton is part of the rather overwhelming Sands resort, it manage to give its guests a more coherent experience. Very convenient for walking to Taipa village. Would definitely recommend eating at Antonio‚Äôs at Taipa.",40
"We stayed with friends yesterday Feb 17-18 and all the staff were so friendly and hospitable, specially Raphael Graffil from Front desk and Karen who welcomed us in the entrance and assisted us as well.. You can find great rooms anywhere but the kind of service they provided in Sheraton os what makes the trip special.. Thanks Raphael and Karen for your professionalism and hospitality.Keep it up.",50

I don‚Äôt know is that cause of the new bonvoy app or your hotel system.(and there are preferences settings in the app,every time I book is always king size bed room,plus already informed the hotel that is a boyfriend girlfriend trip through email)  When I called to the front desk and they told me that the hotel prepared me a birthday cake and arranged a better view room to me so it‚Äôs not so convenient to swap the room and soon I asked if there was any room else is available,the gentleman in the phone answered me there was only a room in the low floor was available.

"I have bought my wife here 5 years ago to celebrate our anniversary, it was fabulous experience.   5 years later we were in town to celebrate Valentine's day, and it is still the best.   the suite we were given were amazing, especially the view.  if you want great view of Taipa overlooking Parisian and Venetian, you would want this hotel.  Staff is friendly and actively helpful.  The food we tried are all top quality.   If you are in Macau I would recommend this as the only choice.",50
The stay was an enjoyable one with the room details matching what stated online. The booking was a bit messy due to the booking agent problem but the receptionists there were so helpful and put every effort to help solve the issue out. Special thanks to Athena here! Would definitely recommend whomever staying in Macao.,50
"I appreciate the personal service I received from Sheraton Club Lounge especially Welcome Ambassador, Sheena Peralta.  Sheena made my mother and I feel very welcome despite the thousands of guests at the hotel for Chinese New Year.  It was the first time I experienced the service of the Welcome Ambassador in the 12 years of loyalty membership with Sheraton and Marriott.  It certainty made a difference in our experience and enjoyment and perhaps something I will start to expect in my future stays in other locations.",50
"The best hotel to travel to the Cotai area with a family. This hotel has good location, facilities, and good service. In particular, Staff are very service-oriented.  The Korean staff (Lily) was very kind and caring. Thanks to that, I could enjoy a comfortable trip while staying at this hotel. I will choose this hotel for my next trip to Macau again.",50
"The hotel is big but the check-in area is kind of lacking compare with the 4000+ rooms they offered.  We took the benefit of the free shuttle from the Ferry Pier and arrived the hotel with a group of other guest.  There were no staff at the lobby (or maybe they are busy to handle all guests at the lobby) so we proceed to check-in at one of the check-in area.  Since there are not enough sitting / waiting area so 2 of us were lining up and other 5 needed to found somewhere to stand and waited for our 30 minutes lining-up time.  The 3 rooms we got are good, quite decent size and well maintained.  Only 1 issue we got is the shorter shower curtain which made the bathroom floor 'flooded' once we finished the shower but besides than that, it is a very comfortable and clean room.  We‚Ä¶",40
Was very uncertain after reading check-in nightmare stories on tripadvisor.  Was pleasantly surprised when we walked in and identified ourselves as platinum elite.  We were immediately escorted to the club lounge for a private check-in.  Got upgraded to executive suite with a view of the Eiffel tower.  We were treated like royalty for the next 24 hours that we spent in Macau before returning to Hong Kong.  One suggestion is to include more vegetarian options in the lounge.  The buffet was mainly Chinese food. A memorable visit.,50
"Once i entered the vicinity with my son who was only 12 years old, the staffs assisted us right away. Though they have other main check-in areas, the guest service staffs assisted me all the way to the priority check-in area for SPG platinum members. Wow! i feel so important even though I am currently at the base tier. Hahah. Kudos to the guest service staffs, they took care of my check-in smoothly.  The room is nice! Not bad Sheraton! After we have settled in our room, my son dragged me to the pool right away as he do not want to waste his stay. He enjoyed it so much.  Even though the hotel rooms can be accessed by lifts within the mall which is a public area, security is tight. There are staffs manning the entrances towards the room lifts. And you need room cards for you to be‚Ä¶",50
"This is a second visit to Sheraton Macau.  Unlike my first attempt, recently I made a booking of 2N at Sheraton Macau under my name through Trip.com.  On arrived at the hotel, I was told by the hotel that the name was incorrect by Trip.com and when I called up trip.com.  Trip.com customer service told me I have to pay up HK$1000 to made the change subject to approval by the hotel.  Trip.com customer service even insisted the surname I had given was incorrect over the phone when originally the surname I had given was indicated in my reservation email. Trip.com ultimately did not help in any aspects.  I managed to finally resolve the issue thanks for the front desk officers.  As such, I would like to specially compliment Fenn Feng & Lucas Fong who attended to my check in request‚Ä¶",50
Glad that my family and I are lucky enough to encounter their wonderful Southeast Asian style buffet. Foods were great. Services are superb! Big thanks to our server VY and Julia! They are wonderful !,50
"We came over for the night to watch a show and make a short ‚Äústaycation‚Äù from Hong Kong.  We had a room in an Executive Suite on the 39th floor.  The room was spacious, modern and comfortable.    The staff was very considerate and helpful.  We had a minor issue where another family sat at our table while we were collecting breakfast (not really a big deal). The staff were very accommodating and apologetic.  Very nice touch and customer service.    Overall the hotel and staff exceeded our expectations.  We will be back.",50
"Shuttle service is also convenient and breakfast and dinner are delicious~ Above all, the staff are friendly and make the most of the guests requests. I will stay again when I next travel to Macau~~^^",50
"This hotel has the best location. And, whilst your stay here, you don't miss out on anything. The rooms are very comfortable and luxurious. Well-equipped, well-deisgned. The breakfast is good too. We were there during the Chinese New Year Holidays, inspite of being very busy, the chek-in & check-out (the auto chek-out feature is superb) was very smooth. the casino is just at the front-lobby. all other hotels (The Venitian / The Persian / Studio City) all walkable distance, and mostly inter-connected. I would totally recommend this hotel for a family stay. As, we celebrated our daughter's birthday there and the hotel management/staff did the extra bit to make her feel special. Thank You !",50
"We are trying to find some resto where we can eat light meals. Luckily, we found The palms in sheraton. I was with my naughty 3 years old son, he was running and crying all over the place, luckily, the manager Lester helped us to calm this down with our kid. To make him busy, he gave some coloring materials to my son. Great service! Food is also great! Tried the buy1 get1! Thank u Palms!",50
"Decided to flee HK for the New Year and everyone said I was mad heading to Macau. Initial impressions at the check in desk made me second guess myself in coming. The receptionist Manli Zhen was to be honest an angel........despite the mad hoard of people behind me, took the time to recognise I was an SPG member, and helped me upgrade my room, also ensuring I had access to the lounge etc. She really brightened my day. The room was nice (had a view) and I was thankful she ensured lounge access (as the crowds were horrible) she also helpfully pointed out we may struggle for dinner reservations on CNY eve so we were at least pre warned. Overall I enjoyed my second visit to Cotai much more, many thanks to Manli, you set the tone of our stay perfectly, that‚Äôs two for two so far‚Ä¶",40
"We stayed here for 2 night. The hotel is in a great location close to all the food, shopping and attraction. If you are a gold member and above, you have access to their club lounge which provides breakfast, lunch and dinner plus snacks in between. The room are good size, 2bedrooms has 2full size beds. Comfortable and clean. We will stay here again. ",50
"As previous reviews stated, check in line does get long so we went straight to Marriott/SPG member line that was much shorter. But, even we were the 2nd in line, it still took us good 30-45 minutes to complete the check in process. Management needs to find a better way to streamline the process to reduce the wait time. They have self check in kiosk that obviously we didn‚Äôt try. We booked a standard room and got upgraded to one BR suite with club access probably due of being an elite Marriott member.   We stayed in the Earth Tower on the top floor, room is huge. King size bedroom, dining room, living room and a TV room, plus huge bathroom. Room is clean, housekeeping staff is friendly and courteous. Club access is great, free buffet breakfast and lite dinner buffet. Can‚Äôt ask for‚Ä¶",50

If you are SPG member you can enjoy more from the hotel such as designated check-in counter.   Fast check-in and check-out time in Sheraton Club for the member who book directly from the hotel website.  It is worthwhile to book directly from the hotel and become SPG members.,40

We went to the breakfast buffet and it was really good and included champagne (I made my own mimosas which was delicious). Lots of selections to choose from.  Location was great - across the street from Paris/Venetian with a skywalk that connects the hotels.   Only thing that wasn't great was the extremely long line up to check in (about a 30 minute line up with every agent available).

"We stayed for 3 nights in this hotel in January 2019. These are items we enjoyed:  Location - Great if you want to explore the hotels/casinos/malls/attractions on Cotai Strip. It is very central, right in front of both The Venetian and The Parisian, and very close to CoD, MGM, and Wynn Palace.  Rooms - Clean and spacious. Beds and pillows were quite comfortable, and so were the towels and bathrobes. I particularly liked the bathroom: huge and beautifully decorated.  Facilities - Decent bars and restaurants on the hotel premises (I particularly liked Palms Caf√© and Bar and their craft beer selection). Beautiful swimming pools and modern gym (just visited, but didn't try them). Several luxury stores and boutiques if you want to spend some serious money. The casino was nice,‚Ä¶",30

Luckily the receptionist that served us was so helpful and friendly. He had explained to us about the hotel facilities as well. And also he has provided us with the room that we requested. Good job for the staff!! Overall, we love this hotel, clean room & good location. Price also affordable. But hotel really really need to improve the check in / out process.",40

"First time in this property. There is a convenient shuttle bus to transport guests from the Ferry Terminal to the Hotel and vice-versa. The hotel had loads of taxis so transport is easily available.   Food wise, this hotel being attached with a casino as with all properties along this belt, is quite expensive and with limited selection. You would need to take taxi to the other side of Macau to experience the local flavor.   Nonetheless, the check-in experience was great and professional. The room was beautiful and spacious. Wifi was a little slow but still good.   English may not be the main spoken language for all as at times it was a little hard to get the message across.",40
"We stayed for 2 nights and everyone was so welcoming and accomodating- particularly Ricky who checked us in. We were upgraded to a room facing the Parisian, given a bday cake for my partner and late checkout. Our room was fantastic. We had drinks at the palms bar and the bartender Angga was amazing- made us delicious cocktails based on flavours we liked. Angga went above and beyond to make our stay unforgettable!  We also ate at Bene, the food was amazing (particularly the carbonara). Angga again made this amazing by informing the staff at Bene of my partners birthday and they brought us a cake and champagne on the house! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. Thank you to the staff in particular.",50

"The hotel is located in the Sands City. If you aim for a quiet resort, you should stay away from this hotel. There are two towers, the Sky Tower and Earth Tower. If you stay in Sky Tower you have to walk at least 5 minutes to the restaurant for breakfast. The breakfast was very nice and provided a wide variety of food include raw honey and fresh juice. The price of breakfast was expensive but the hotel provided big discount if you buy coupon during check in. The pillows and blankets were of high quality. If you are not a SPG member you have to queue  quite sometime for check in during the peak check in time.",30
"This hotel is very huge and is located in the center of big casinos and hotels. Ideal for shopping and sight-seeing.  Room: Big enough and nice interior  Service: All staffs are helpful, special mention to Arvin Aliwalas from the fitness center who gave a superb service everytime I use the gym.  Facilities: nice pool and 24hrs gym with complete amenities.  Check-in/check-out: quite a long line for check-in but was quick. Express check-out, just drop your keycard and go.  Food/restaurant: Feast was good enough and had many selections, but I felt that Le buffet and studio city had better selections.  Over-all I will stay again because of the nice service of its staffs which mostly are Filipinos. ",50

"We stayed for one night just to experience a 5-star hotel in Macau after previously staying in two other more affordable hotels. TL; DR: Opt for SPG membership and a Cotai view room or suite for the best experience.  Online booking: Booked a non-smoking deluxe twin Cotai view room in advance as a new SPG member and included in the request a 24-hour stay (4PM check-in and 4PM late check-out, subject for approval upon arrival). This booking was prepaid and non-refundable.  Check-in: We arrived at the hotel earlier than 4PM (about 1PM) and the queue was extremely long because it was a peak season.

"My family stayed 2 nights at the Sheraton, Macau at the end of year. All the staff were very nice and the facillities are comfortable.  Especially, I would like to express my gratitude to Lily Kang. I asked an extra bed and Parisian view in advance by e-mail if possile and she met all my requests. Also there were so many people on the check-in line but I could check in quickly since I had signed up SPG membership for free when I had made the reservation.   It was an excellent chice to book the Sheraton hotel which is in a good location, a reasonable price and the wonderful staff. I will stay again at the Sheraton, Macau  and strongly recommand to my friends.",50
"I stayed at the Sheraton Macau for one night and was emailing with Mariana, a reservations manager, before my stay. She was very kind, and as a Marriott Platinum member, she upgraded my room to a Club Deluxe Executive Suite on the 40th floor of the hotel. It was an amazing room and was huge! Over 1,300 square feet and 2 living rooms and 2 bathrooms. The lounge at this hotel is the largest I have ever seen at any hotel. The breakfast and evening snacks are huge and they treat it like a full meal. There is also a full bar with complementary drinks. Overall, my stay was very pleasant and although short, I enjoyed the suite very much.",50
"Room is spacious and standard with a reasonable pricing. However, the time for check-in is really an issue to be fixed as soon as possible. There is no excuse to take an hour or more only to wait for check-in. Buffet breakfast is not bad.",40
"My son just recommend Sheraton Grand Macao since he‚Äôs been always staying there. I book this hotel to celebrate my friends birthday. Suddenly the Front Office Agent just told me that i reserve a King size bed, which I didn‚Äôt notice when i do the booking. Then the attendant named Erika are very cheerful to help me out to find a double bed. She also offer a very nice Parisian view and a higher floor ‚ù§Ô∏è Erika is really an amazing that when i said that we are celebrating my friends birthday she also send us a little piece of cake which my friend really appreciate.   Will probably visit and stay at Sheraton Grand Macao again ‚ò∫Ô∏è",50
"2nd stay at Sheraton Macao w hubs and 9 year old child. This round we stayed at the Sky tower.  Hotel: A typical massive 2,000 + room hotel in Macao. Which means madness during breakfast time. It‚Äôs always a long queue at the main restaurant and we always had to be ushered to another restaurant. Which also explains the sour and dour breakfast line server behavior I.e. those working at the egg and noodle station. Check-in and out however was breezy with family area.  The good: Cheery cleaning crew, also with a smile and polite greetings. I also had a nice birthday surprise from the front office. How nice.   Overall: A decent 2nd stay and only because we couldn‚Äôt get a room at newer hotels such as The Parisian, and JW Marriot during the busy Christmas month.",30
"Although the queue to check in was horrendous, the staff on the ground was attentive. When they realise I was queuing with my elderly mother, they quickly recommend me to use the priority queue. Rachel, the staff who served us was friendly and even gave us a free upgrade to our room. Tried asking for the parisan view but it was full so she offer us another great view of venetian. Even though it was just 1 night, we enjoyed our stay and the breakfast was yummy! ",40

"Sheraton Grand Macao is a great hotel with everything just so perfect. Friendly staff, spacious and comfortable room and with excellent hotel shuttle service to almost everywhere you wanted to go in Cotai Central. I wanted to say thank you to Wilson Webster who has been so helpful and patient helping us to get the connecting rooms with 2 double bed. He was patient, conscious and listened to our request and has been trying so hard to fulfill all our requests. He really showed us what customer service is and deserved a compliment. My elementary form teacher (travelled with me as our 1st reunion trip) urged me to send an appreciation message to him via this platform a couple of times. :)",50
We enjoyed our stay so much and we would like to thank the guest service ambassador named Shana for assisting us during our stay. All of our needs were rightly attended and we enjoyed the sauna. Looking forward to out next stay.,40
"It was a last minute decision to go to Macau for the holidays. We tried to book at Venetian and Galaxy but they were fully booked on the dates that we wanted.   We tried Sheraton Hotel and we were able to get a booking. It was peak season so the room was quite pricey.   We realized that Sheraton is a better choice than the other hotels we were considering because it was not too crowded and we were able to get a room at the Sky Tower with the view of the Eiffel Tower.   It was so beautiful at night and we felt so relaxed.   Sheraton has easy access to other hotels like Venetian, Four Season, Parisian, Conrad. There is also free shuttle that goes around Cotai and the airport.   We would like to mention Erika a Mallari who went out of her way to greet us and helped us to make our‚Ä¶",40
"My wife and I went to Macau for our babymoon. Before we went to the Sheraton Hotel, we sent various questions and requests by mail. Ms. Lilly Kang, a Korean employee, responded directly for us as Koreans. She always responded kindly and actively whatever we asked her. On the day of check-in, she came to the counter to greet us. And she gave my wife a card to celebrate her pregnancy. Other employees were very kind, too. The room conditions we stayed in were also excellent. Above all, thanks to the warm consideration of Ms. Lily Kang, this trip to Macau has become a perfect babymoon for us.",50
"Second visit to Macau, wanted to book Venetian Macau but it‚Äôs full so we tried Sheraton Grand with SPG member rate - very competitive price given the location and services.   Upon making reservations, agent Kylie was helpful to rectify my issue of booking and she has also arranged amenities for my son‚Äôs birthday.   Room size was acceptable but we got good view of Parisian Macau. The whole place was huge with all the shops and restaurants so there‚Äôs something to do for everyone.   I personally like the pool, very nicely designed and their attentive staffs were always walking around to check on the guests.   We used express check-out and was having problem with my credit card pre-auth, Erika from GR quickly solved it and got her colleague from relevant dept to contact me as well. ‚Ä¶",50
"Marriott group largest hotel but still personalized and clean maintained.. very good place, relaxing. Try upper levels. Lounge for platinum members is great. Good cocktails and breakfast, whole day snacks.",50
"We arrived on 1st Jan, check in was very crowded and have to wait for about 30 minutes.  But guest services during our stay is remarkable, even at the midnight.  Considering the hotel size and the peak season, it is worth to rate 5 stars for the services.  Hotel is well maintained and our twin deluxe queen bed is as expected. ",50
"My family and I would like to thank Ms. Ruby-an Pineda for being such a nice,good and accomodating guest service ambassador. Hoping that there would be more person like her in this hotel. My family enjoyed staying in this hotel.",50
"Went to explore Macau for 3 days and stayed at the huge Sheraton Grand Macau. Massive was an understatement. There were large groups arriving and departing non-stop, so happy they had their own designated  area to do so. Clean, modern, and spacious. The FEAST - the hotel's buffet venue is excellent. the offering focused on fresh seafood along the usual buffet items. Not a large selection but a refined menu. Delicious! Wish i had more time to use the spa and health club facilities.",50
"Unfortunately it was not a good start: at no time, especially at 2am, it should never have taken 30+ mins to check in (particularly compared with a 5 min taxi ride from the airport), namely 10 mins waiting in the Gold/Platinum lane as your associates failed to recognise the status, plus 20+ mins at the counter (still hard to understand when all the information is in the system). As regards platinum benefits, it was only when I asked about an upgrade, did your associate actually check.   On the positive side, the suite that he ultimately gave us was very comfortable and we slept very soundly indeed.  The food at the Club Lounge was great and the staff there very friendly and helpful ......as was the concierge service on the ground floor.  We enjoyed the Italian restaurant ""Bene""‚Ä¶",40
"Macau is one of the most imaginative and stirring man-made city in Asia. Undoubtedly anyone who visits this place - comes with ideas of thrill and excitement.  Sheraton hotel is a commercial busy outlet with poor staffing and poor regard for the time of the guests. Their staff is dealing with guests like robots - one comes and one goes- nothing more. It doesn't ring a bell if their check-in counters are queued up with waiting time more than half an hour. There are no sofas or seats at their checkins for young children and women who have to stand up with the waiting while someone from the family does the check-in.  This is something that no hotel in the world does to its guests- make them stand the wait.   Curiously, is this hypocrisy in the name of hospitality, even permissible‚Ä¶",20
"Rooms are clean but a bit worn and dated. Not luxurious.  Location is good - walking distance to most everything in Cotai. Free shuttle to ferry terminal. Next to shopping mall with lots of restaurants and shops.Busy casino on ground floor.  Hotel can be very busy simply because it has a lot of guests mostly from mainland China. This means waiting for check in/ out, crowds in the Casino and lounge and restaurants. But staff keeps up well. All speak english.  Executive Lounge for platinum members was good. Instead of appetizers, they had a full buffet dinner and open bar. Breakfast in lounge good but crowded. Lounge was large and had a separate dining room.  Fitness center is above average with instructor led classes, great Sauna, nice gym, and large outdoor pool.",40
"Love this hotel the most! If I am back in Macau again, Sheraton it is! Service is impeccable especially Juwana from the club lounge.   Room is so huge, go for the deluxe suite! Breakfast is awesome! So spoilt for choice! Free shuttle to Taipa ferry terminal available very 10-15min   This trip is to celebrate my bestie birthday and she had such a memorable stay! The cake and deco is lovely! Thumbs up to the management of sheraton! ",50
"Stayed on Dec 21-25, 2018.  Advised the hotel of late check-in.  Upon check-in, room was ready. Was given a room with view of the Parisian. Very refreshing.  Room is of good size and clean.  Wifi access is fast. Service was very good.  Everyone from the hotel where we asked assistance were very prompt. Facility for express check-out is very helpful, no fuzz.Would definitely recommend to others.  Only problem I observed is there's too many people in the lobby.  But I don't know if they are all guests of the hotel.  Overall, very good!",50
"Couldn't give enough stars!  Service was awesome right from the start. Prompt responses to email queries from various staff from the Guest Relations Dept.  Concierge staff (Alexis) was alert and welcomed us into the hotel, ushered us to the club lounge for check in, waited for us and brought our luggage up to the room. When we were checking out, we were blessed to meet Alexis again at the concierge counter and he helped us deposit our luggage, and even ushered us to the shuttle service area before handing us over to his colleague. Very personalised service from him.  The staff at the club lounge were also an awesome team. They prepared a lovely birthday surprise for us as we stepped into the room, arranged with me in cahoot to surprise my mother with cake and gift, and even‚Ä¶",50
"For the customer service and lady in red uniform (i don't know whats her position) ,i give them 5 stars for the service because very helpful when we trying to check in.  For the other staff,they treat customer badly,  they never smile,  doesn't have manner and ethics at all, You guys work at hotel the most important thing is service but your service so terrible, i have been to many hotels, but never get service like this at all",10
"Great stay with decent and clean room. We are directed to priority line for check-in which is good as I have my 1.5yr old kid with me.   But for checkout , it is not as convenience as other Macau hotels which they would allow quick drop off the room key in a box. For this hotel, the fastest way to checkout is to use the kiosk (but stupidly there r few does not work), and need few clicks still.   I requested a crib and they sent one. I sent the same request in Conrad, they warmly sent togther with a baby bath tube and extra towels and water. Thats make the 2 hotels different in services I experienced",40
"Had the most memorable 6 nights with Sheraton. From the convenience of free shuttle service direct from Airport to Sheraton to the most biggest Sheraron in the world. Once arrived, I was immediately being greeted and escorted by a very friendly Concierge (Ms. Victoria) to the SPG member check in. (Was Lucky to be an SPG member cause the queue was shocking thought they had like more than 10 normal check in counters)  The SPG Receptionist (Mr. Raphael) was very friendly and efficient. Got my bookings right away and me check in process was extremely smooth. Ms. Victoria and the Front Office Manager (Mr. Bensum) was very thoughtful and had arrange some of bellman to assist my luggage (6 days winter stay) and escorted me to my room.  Dine in at Bene (Italian Restaurant) The Carbonara‚Ä¶",50
"We love staying at the Sheraton. As a SPG member we have quick check in. All went well with that.  Our check in was very friendly and efficient.   The room area we are in is Earh 2. It is feeling, looking and smelling a bit old sadly. There‚Äôs tears in the hall carpet which is showing other wear. The double room we have is generous in size and very clean. Housekeeping was quick to supply the additional towels etc that we needed with 3 guests in a room. Hspog iver all with the value and service.",40
The hospitality and service provided by this hotel (especially Sheraton Club) is one of the best among the Marriott chain of hotels. Kudos to the entire team for the above and beyond service extended to my family. Thanks,50
"Not a pleasant stay.  I have chosen to stay with Sheraton in the late night on December 19. My booking cannot be found upon arrival for check-in, and since booking was made via travel website, I was informed that he cannot help to check-in and was told to contact the travel website even I have the email confirmation.  During the time I am seeking for help to manage my booking, I receive no active assistance by the hotel staff.  As a customer, I felt that I haven't been treated well, he was rough when he was providing service to me.",20
"We booked two nights at the Sheraton with club access so we could check out Macau while we were in Hong Kong.  We left the Shangri La hotel, so were expecting to go from great service to a mass market experience, since this is one of the biggest hotels in the world.    Amazingly, the Sheraton Club is extremely well managed.  Not only did we not feel like it was a mass market experience with thousands of others, we got highly personalized service.  First, I got an email welcoming us to the club the day before, but I figured it was a mass email (but still a nice touch).  Then we arrived and the club manager checked us in, he's the one who sent the email (Pedro).  He gave us an upgrade and he and his entire team gave us excellent service the entire time we were there.  We were‚Ä¶",50
Staying here is a better choice. Shuttle service are very convenient to almost everything. Thank you for all the staff very helpful they are very informative. Also big appreciation as they even provide a cake and a letter for my coming birthday. Also a tip always request a room in advance of which side would you prefer to stay. I would recommend this hotel to my friends and family. ,50
"Amazing hotel, great casino and at walking distance to venetian and parisian. we stayed there for two nights and three days. Very good buffet breakfast. Located close to shopping malls as well as food court. Have had few vegetarians so could go to a close by Indian spice restaurant or had some cheese and egg burgers at macdonalds for quick bite.",50
"Spacious room with excellent service and cleanliness. We have access to the lounge too and the food was great! Highly recommended for those who are going to Macau. During peak period, the queue to check in is very long. Bear this in mind. ",40
"There was a queue at the reception for check in but it moves fast as there are many counters available. Carol Luo was friendly, fast and efficient during our check in. Good first impression of the hotel. Keep it up!",50
"We arrived at the hotel about an hour before regular check-in and saw a MASSIVE queue (about 30 people) at the check-in desk. Luckily I have SPG status and it was a separate shorter queue of 2 others. By the time we finished checking in, the regular line had more than 60 people in the line, I am NOT kidding! If you DO NOT HAVE status with Sheraton, I seriously would not recommend you stay here or suggest you check in LATE rather than bang on check-in time (around noon when we finished check-in).  On a good note, there was a slight snag with our booking as the system only had us in for 1 night but we had booked for 2. Wilson Webster at the SPG check-in counter tried calling a few people to help find our booking (the Marriott site was also down at that time!) and asked me to call‚Ä¶",40

"Great treatment for platinum members. As a platinum premier elite member, there is access to the club lounge that has amazing food. All the staff is very friendly and this hotel is in a great location. Was upgraded to a larger room and it is comfortable. I love the Sheraton Macao and would like to return again on my next visit there.  ",50
"Stayed here in the month of Nov 2018. Very spacious room and very good service. Though a five star property, once you get inside it looks like a crowded market place. There is such a big queue for check in. You can go and play in the casinos or goto the casinos in VENETIAN which is interconnected with this property. Very nice breakfasts and other  services are also excellent. A bus departs every fifteen minutes to TAIPA ferry through which you can access the Hongkong Airport.",50
"While I was planning a trip to Macau, I learned about Sheraton Hotel through the app.The hotel has entered the wrong hotel stay period, but the hotel agency application has refused to change the date.   And then I happened to know Peter Jung by Google, and I sent him an email asking for help.  Peter Jung was like a savior to me!!  He changed the hotel's guest date in spite of many inconveniences.  I almost doubled the amount of money, but with Peter Jung's deep consideration, I finished my trip.  If I have a chance, I want to go to Sheraton Hotel again. And I would strongly recommend the Sheraton Hotel for a trip to Macau.   Thank you again for Peter Jung's consideration and pray for the endless development of the Sheraton Hotel.",50
"Stayed here in the month of December 2018. Hotel property is vast and looks amazing. Rooms are bigger than usual and look very nice. But as soon as I checked-in, the toilet seat was dirty. After complaining, obviously the management made sure it's clean and tidy. After they left, the toilet roll holder broke and the whole stand fell upon which the plumber came and sorted the issue. When I used the shower room, all the water was leaking out from the shower room to the bathroom and I was shocked to see everything was flooding when I came out. The whole stay was a mess. Surely they cleaned everything but the problem lies on how they manage the facilities provided to the guest. I have stayed in Sheraton in other places, even 3 star properties do not have such basic issues. I stayed‚Ä¶",30
"PROS:  -Well appointed, spacious room -Comfortable bed with 4 types of pillows -Excellent shower -Quiet corridor -Fast wifi ; fast lifts -Helpful and friendly staff -As there was a very long queue at the regular check-in counters, we were directed to check-in at 4th floor, which made us feel privileged, as that was for preferred guests.  -Express check-out makes leaving the hotel a breeze.  -Pedestrian bridge linking hotel with Sands Cotai Central shopping complex and the other glam hotels -Breath-taking night view from lookout points of pedestrian bridge  CONS: -Seems unable to adjust air-cond to higher temperature (above 25 degrees) -Have to walk 8 minutes to reach restaurant for breakfast (but that's just because the hotel is huge.)",50

As well as trying to lock my booking room on the same floor. I‚Äôm very impress for his kindness.  My lunch at Bene is fabulous, staff set up my table at the area that can see Eiffel Tower.

NO HASSLE during payment and she gave us the complete details of our stay and recommended places to eat and best places to visit.   The room was sooo nice and the best part is our room is facing the Eiffel Tower View!!! Imagine waking up looking at a beautiful view was so great and best part of the trip!

"We were here for a weekend, and in general the experience was fine but finding the place is a real challenge.   We arrived off the Hong Kong ferry, and the first thing you notice is there are signs to all the shuttle buses except for the Sheraton. People will direct to to the right place, which is a loooong walk, but you keep feeling you‚Äôve made a mistake. Even the actual stand where you wait for the bus doesn‚Äôt have a Sheraton logo.   Even when you get there, finding the check- in (or worse, the Club-Level check-in) is a mystery tour. We wandered around for what seemed ages before we actually managed to check in. The hotel is part of a huge complex of hotels, shops and casinos and to complicate things the Sheraton has two towers... anyway, some better signs, from the ferry, and‚Ä¶",40
"It‚Äôs a huge hotel, lots of elevators, somewhat difficult to navigate, have to change lifts at different floors to go from room to lounge. Suite was large but all glass doors in bathroom area needed attention, had quite a lot of dubious marks which are not expected of a 5 star establishment. Summer holidays with many mainland tourists, place is noisy & very commercial. That is Macau! ",30
"We arrived in the morning and check in was not allowed until 1pm, so we checked our luggage at bell desk and went out to explore Macau. When we returned, it was crazy with so many people in the lobby and the check in line was pretty long. But once checked in, we got to our room in the sky tower. It was a decent sized room with a comfortable bed, in room safe, hair dryer, mini bar, strong and reliable WiFi. The hotel is very typical of your Las Vegas hotels. Lots of shops, restaurants and casinos. You can get between most of the hotels on the strip without going outside by trekking through the malls. There are different courtesy shuttles that go to other hotels, ferry terminal/airport and Gongbei border. If you‚Äôre looking for a Vegas experience, then staying in Cotai is for you.‚Ä¶",40

"The facility itself is very well kept and staff is extremely helpful and kind. Specifiacally, I had a very pleasant experience with the staff in the Club Lounge. Carmela, Faustine and Jamie helped me with everything I needed from check in to transfer information. It was so nice to wake up to their smiling faces each morning. As well as Kachi, who was kind enough to help me when I had trouble locating my room. Also, my room had a recycling bin and trash can, which is important.",50
I would like to say it was a great idea in choosing Sheraton Macao to stay! All the staff are very helpful and very accommodating. I thank them for making my nephew‚Äôs birthday a little special! I want to say kudos to Josie Bilag and the service guy (filipino) for there warm welcome and making an excellent job! This was my second stay in the hotel and I will definitely recommend this hotel to all my friends and family who wants to visit Macau!  Thank you again! And more powers!,50
"A great stay with a big room that comes with a comfy bed! Their service is also very good and helpful! Upon hearing that we need an extra bed due to our young kids bumping in together; the guest service ambassador Jetro did not hesitate and straight away offer us an extra bed without any charges. The location was also great with the linkage , we will be able to shop around easily! ",50
"The Sheraton, from a 1000 night Platinum member‚Äôs prospective. What a disappointment.  Well not really, I didn‚Äôt expect much to be honest.  But it is Macau and things tend to run on the top side of the brand name in this town.  What I got was an Albany NY experience while trying to give a Beverly HIll show.  So its a little confusing.  I should start by saying the place is fine, not good, not bad, just fine.  I have stayed at 10 to 15 different places in Macau over the years and this was the worst of all.  But the price was on the low side of the city for my days of stay.  Checkin would have been a nightmare if I wasn‚Äôt Platinum, the wait could have been 45mins to an hour.  I was second in line for checkin for the elite line.  The agent was super nice, but couldn‚Äôt find the‚Ä¶",20

"I have stayed at this property twice this year and the customer service was poor to Marriott standard.  Check in - even though I am a Marriott Gold member, I was asked to go to a dedicated check in counter, but when I present my passport to the front desk staff, there are a lot of people come and go by various questions, and the front desk staff continue to answer their questions by ignoring my check in process. Eventually, it took me 20min to complete the entire process which is not acceptable.  Check out - the first time when I stayed at this hotel, I personally went to the front desk to experience the check out process. The service I encountered is quite similar to the check in process with a lot of people come and go by asking questions. Hence, I just left my key at the‚Ä¶",20
"There are many many 4 and 5 stars hotel in Macau. Training and retaining staff who can deliver good service is a problem.  This Sheraton hotel managed to keep its good staff members. The experience of check in, house keeping and food and beverage services during my stay was top notch. The hardware, i.e.: room, pool, lounge, restaurants are your typical reliable Sheraton standard. The location is excellent within walking distance to everything at the centre of Cotai Strip. I shall return.",50
"I‚Äôm in awe with Grand Sheraton . Everything also got .  When I first stepped in , a Mr Harrison Zheng greeted me and gave me the best welcome . Knowing I have 2 kids and is a elite member , he upgraded me to family suite which my two boys love to bits .  Then at club lounge , a miss Carmela Hidalgo served us to the best we ever had . She provided the best guide . Forever indebted .  Hotel even prepared a cake for my Wife bday . Awesome ",50
"This hotel offers great value in the heart of Cotai with easy access to all areas on the strip. This hotel is not as glamorous as many on the strip or in other parts of Macau, but if you are looking for somewhere that is great value for money, good gym and pool area, with very clean and comfortable rooms then this is an excellent choice.",40
"I just wanted to thank you so much for the amazing reservation on Tuesday at Bene. It was my very special friends birthday and you made him feel so special on his birthday. The sign, the birthday song, dessert, along with the WONDERFUL service was so very special. We are far away from home and family, so to have this fun lunch to celebrate a birthday and life was so awesome. I can't wait to bring all my friends here for their birthday. THANK YOU, for the perfect day!",50
"This is our 2nd stay at the hotel and we checked in at their executive lounge on the 2nd floor as the reception at the lobby is very busy as usual. It is a good sized room for a deluxe located on the 28/F with very comfortable bed which I always find within Sheraton hotels. We literally do not have to leave the hotel for food as we have access to the private lounge which offers a sumptuous buffet during the happy hour.   The hotel also provides a wide varieties of delicious breakfast spread which include western, Chinese, Indian, Japanese with free flow of bubbles. ",50
Stayed 12 nights following a 13 night stay earlier this year. In between we stayed 19 nights in Vegas. We love Macau as we relax in a peaceful and safe environment. All people we encounter at the hotel are friendly and the service is very good. The location is the best as it is central  and in walking distance to other casinos.The bus services are fantastic as they pick you up and take you back to the wharf.  They will also take you to Macau peninsula. By the way the shuttle buses are free. You don't need to take taxis but they are very cheap. Senado square is a lovely place to visit and we enjoyed taking a taxi to calaone and eating at Lord stones where the egg tarts are magnificent. Take away the entertainment from vegas and Macau is a better place to visit. It is also cleaner‚Ä¶,50
"I stayed there for 3nights (13~16 Nov.) with my family. Every staff was very kind and proessional and response for any request from me was performed right after called. Very quick. The Service quality was the best ever in my life. Especially Mr.AJ from the lobby (Filipino guy) was so kind and helpful with warm smile. And balloon specialist in bteakfast was also very impressive, my kids loved it. I had great vacation due to sheraton‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°. -Choi-",50

"I knew that booking & staying in the lounge room access with Sheraton was the best decision i ever made.  Originally, there were only 3 of us going so booking a suite made more sense but later we became 4.  since the living room had a sofa bed, our sleeping arrangements went well plus there was 1 1/2 bathroom which i didnt expect.   Our room was worth $600 for 2 nights was worth it because we had the lounge access which means we have breakfast & cocktails free during our stay.  Breakfast at the lounge had an extensive menu & they change the food everyday.  But the main food like sausage, tomatoes, salads, bacon was present every morning but they other hot food like dimsum.   As for the cocktail hours which was from 5-8pm, they serve different kinds of alcohol plus real food for‚Ä¶",40
"I came here for my birthday celebration in Macau together with my family.  It was a wonderful trip.  My stay in Sheraton was truly comfortable and enjoyable.  The hotel staff were very hospitable.  Raphael Grafill (front desk) gave an excellent service.  I commend him for providing all our needs and for making sure that we have a great experience in the hotel.  Despite the huge number of guests, he was able to attend to us immediately and offer the best possible amenities. The family room was elegant and fitted well to our requirements.  Housekeeping was very prompt in delivering our requests (i.e. bottled water,  additional pillows).  I will recommend this to my friends and colleagues and will surely come back. ",50
"Sheraton has given us a very special memory during our stay. We stayed 2 nights and the service was excellent more than the expected we can see a good view from our room.The hotel is too large and it‚Äôs normal to be a bit crowded while check in time but I am sure it will let you forget everything once you check in coz there are lots of place to go around like shopping malls, convenient shops, and many restaurants. We enjoyed a swimming pool and breakfast feast we found all the staffs were so polite special mention to room service staff Tilak who makes us feel so special by taking very good care of us and tidy our room so well he was very courteous and polite gave us many information about the hotel and the tourist places in Macau.

Breakfast, happy hour and snacks provided at the Club Lounge were superb with a variety of food and drinks. Staff are so courteous and friendly, always kind and happy to help - excellent hospitality and service during our stay.  Thanks to Tomsion Wu for his warm greetings and organising our early check-in, and to Marianna Conceicao for her welcome and gifts. Made our stay memorable and special.",50
Ana Christina at front desk was really professional and had an excellent service.

"To start with, check-in takes forever (to be exact - 1 hour). The management of the hotel really needs to figure a way for more efficient check-in.  The check-in staff gave me a smoking room instead of a non-smoking room but they did fix that and gave me a non-smoking room later. The view of the smoking room is horrible, facing a bunch of machines on the rooftop. On the other hand, the view of the non-smoking room is excellent, facing Parisian and the pool.  The cleaning staff need a bit more training. One of the staff (a guy) rang my doorbell but he did not wait and open my door immediately while I was in my underwear. Imagine if I were a lady coming out of the shower and were naked.  The pool and the gym is good. The pool area is quite big. Location is convenient. There were‚Ä¶",40

"I stay at this hotel most times when I'm in Macau because he location and price are pretty good. They also have good facilities (pool, gym, etc.) However, the check in process is always so long and they never have enough staff. I am a Marriott rewards member and the line was still very long as there was only one person serving loyalty members. Also, they did not credit my one night stay and I tried to email them with no response.  I will still stay again because of the location but I advise others to not expect too much in terms of service.",30
"We stayed here to celebrate my daughter's bday. The hotel was a sight to behold-with all its magnificence&opulence. It was really busy during check-in but Kababayan Jetro from Guest Relations made it a breeze for us. What's more is the very sweet surprise for our lil missy, balloons lined up the floor with matching chocolates&rose petals. It made my daughter's bday extra special",50
Stayed for 2 nights with my family. The check in line was long but good thing there is a counter for family to check in which is a good idea! The hotel was huge. My room has the best view of parisian and it was beautiful my kids loved it  kudos to cyril for doing great job he is the best ! i will definitely go back and recommend to my friends and family ! good job sheraton!,50
"The hotel is conveniently accessible and is found in the Cotai area so going for a stroll is quite interesting. The rooms are spacious enough and the amenities are good for you to enjoy some time out off the busy city. So you can go out have fun and at the same time enjoy a nice relaxing time when you get back. The staff, particularly Jetro, Ana De Guzman and Josie Bilag were very accommodating and would make you feel at home with their warm smile. They were also very patient with us despite our numerous questions and gave valuable information about touring the city. ",50
Stayed here last week. The hotel is amazing. It is so big with all the facilities you can imagine. Check in queues as others have pointed are very long however of you are a Rewards Member you are normally fast tracked. Lunch have quite a lot of variety and some fresh made to order meats and fish for example. Hotel had a casino too.  Highly recommended and very Grand. ,50

I rarely put reviews when I stay in a hotel but OMG it was expectacular because of this guy Jetrix Pasamanero. He is excellent and very helpfull guy. I was on the line and seeing him assisting customer he always smile and make the customer feel very comfortable. And finaly it was my turn and I booked thru marriot since I am a member. so when I gave my card for some reason my card is being declined and he told me to get cash on the ATM and he waited for me till I was able to get cash. I was so pissed with the card being declines but whenever he smiles its makes me happy. I commend this person for being such a good employee of sheraton he loves and value whats he is doing. Great job!!!! and keep it up. when I come back to macau I will defenitely checked inn again At Sheraton‚Ä¶,50

This time i made a mistake and i booked the wrong day. Leaving in a hurry, I made the booking through trip so sheraton could not change the date and gave us the best rate they had which was 1000 hkd more than what we booked for.So, obviously, I was upset about that. Other than that, everything went smooth, the room was very good, the view also. Check out went slow;I think that can be improved.When we returned home we realised we forgot a small item in the room and I contacted the hotel and I got a prompt response that my item has been found and we started formalities for taking it back.

"My friends and I have a pleasant stay in Sheraton Hotel and were pretty amazed by how beautiful the hotel is. The rooms are wonderful, the casino is stunning and amenities / staff are all awesome. The only downside for this hotel is the checked in procedures, where we have waited very long to check in as it was overcrowded with people. This is something which i personally disliked very much. Other than this i have a nice experience with Sheraton",40
it is located at cotai area which is interconnected to venetian and many other hotels .  Rooms were neat and clean !  toilets were clean too  size was average  we booked it at rs 9000 approx which is cheapest among cotai hotels  so i would surely recommend if you can book it below 10k ,50
"The rooms are very modern and fit into the casino vibe of the island. The peninsula, and historic part of the city, is a cab ride away (about 100 hkd). The casino takes up the lobby and the pools weren‚Äôt rated while I was there (it wasn‚Äôt super warm the weekend I was there which was nice for walking). ",40
"First time to stay in one of the Cotai hotels and have mixed feelings.  The  Good:  Location is right in the middle of Cotai strip and is connected to Conrad, Holiday Inn, and walkway across the road to the Venetian.  City of Dreams and Morpheus close by.  Studio City a bit harder to get to but walk-able.  Breakfast has a huge variety.   Often has special discounts for room rates or restaurants.  Staff are mostly very friendly and helpful.    The Bad:  Way too many guests - check-in takes a long time and it's crowded everywhere   Tip #1:  check out the SPG check-in counter as the queue is shorter and the staff are actually quite understanding during the peak / crowded hours.  The hotel is designed to be a single long corridor - this means noises can echo and quite loud.  This‚Ä¶",30

The staff across the hotel was polite, courteous and always ready to help. All in all had a terrific stay and would recommend it very highly.",50
We spent our Christmas holidays at this hotel and I must stay it was worth every minute. Every room has a cellphone that you could bring along with you for wifi access anytime at any point in Macao.

John helped me with my check in last time back in Apr. I saw him again this time, not only did he remember me as a guest he also remembered where I‚Äôm from and what I do in my career. It‚Äôs a small personal touch but I liked it a lot. He gave us a few suggestions of where to dine and play which turned out to be the highlights of our two days trip in Macau . First we went to Oktoberfest which was much better than the one in hk, then we brunched at at Regis which was also an impressive service.   My friends and I are gonna come back‚Ä¶",50
"I would like to express my thanks and appreciation for the service and care I received from Maureen. She checked us in and was extremely professional, polite and attentive to our needs. The best part is she can speak mandarin, english and tagalog fluently! We stayed for 2 nights and enjoyed our stay. As my flight got cancelled and have to return to sheraton for an additional night stay, she was understanding for me to have a slightly late checkout time. My flight was later in the evening. Thank you Maureen, you are one outstanding staff for Sheraton! Please do give them the recognition that they deserve.We will certainly be back!",40
"Third visit in 4 months time, jus want to come back to this place as their rooms are just huge and great. separate check in for members is a plus point as its a massive hotel and very busy although well organized. Plenty of staff to help you out with anything you need or are looking for.  Love how they spend time and interact wit hour little boy of 2 years, just so pleasant that we can focus the things we need to do while staff keeps the little one busy for a minute or 2.. Will definitely come back here every time I am in Macau",50
"Wish to acknowledge Nello, a guest service ambassador who served us in a restaurant. Friendly, warm, enthusiastic and knowledgable about the dishes. Great dining experience.   Sheraton Grand was OK but not amazing for a top class hotel. Executive lounge was lovely with a good spread for breakfast but more snacks & drinks on offer in between meals would be good.",30
"Very nice room and Excellent Excellent hotel staff. I had wonderful experience staying at Macau for a short getaway vacation. Thanks for the hospitality from the front office, lead supervisor Cherry Zhang and her team member.  I had wonderful experience and certainly will visit to Macau again.",50
Not my first choice since I am not a fan of Cotai. Sheraton is ok- free shuttle bus efficient very much like the other hotels. Queue long. Check in smooth and ok after long wait. Room is big enough with view of airport. Service ok.,40
"Booked a room for 4 pax. Were super disappointed from the minute we stepped in till we check out. 1) SPG membership couldn‚Äôt be located in the system. 2) were given 2 single bed for 4 pax. Toiletries (toothbrushes) were given for 2 pax instead of 4. All the whatever not (showercap x 1, towels x 2, lotions, gels etc x 1 tube each). 3) the woman who came to give us extra 2 towels, 1 tube each - shower, shampoo, conditioner was very rude. 4) the staff, Benjamin Hung downstairs at the counter was very arrogant, unfriendly, unhelpful, rude and impatient. 5) the male staff at the shuttle bus service area (towards galaxy) was very lazy, unfriendly, unhelpful and unprofessional. Whatever u asked is being replied by I don‚Äôt know. The queue wasn‚Äôt clear too. Was utterly disappointed by‚Ä¶",20
"I typically do not write reviews, first ever on Trip Advisor, but I had to comment on the Service I received from Justine in the Feast restaurant. After the first day, on subsequent days I asked to be seated in her section, as the combination of prompt service and a delightful smiling attitude helped me start my days off on a positive note. While the overall service at the Hotel was excellent, Justine took it to another level.  Thank you Justine.",50
"Very much impressed by the spacious room & amenities of the hotel. The staff are friendly, efficient & accommodating especially Ericka Mallari, our guest service ambassador. Check-in was hassle-free. Highly recommended especially those with kids and families.",50
"Services were great, everyone greeted me by name at the Club Lounge and except for small little issues, the overall experience was great. We thoroughly enjoy the upgrade experience, my 2 stays at the hotel only got better on the 2nd stay. Special call-out to Carmela, Mariana, Eduardo from the Club lounge and especially to Jon from Front Desk for his taking ownership attitude and ensuring that the experience we have is not just good, but great.  Rooms were good on both stays, lounge food was good also, and service is the best. Views are ok, not great. Sheraton and Marriott is a better choice than the other hotel chains in Macau. I would come back to this hotel again.",50
Clean and nice hotel with lots of people. Everyone nice and polite but we had a gentleman named CHRISTIAN CRUZ who was a concierge be extremely helpful in guiding us around Macau. He was always so happy and friendly. Made our stay enjoyable. I would recommend this hotel. Thanks Christian,50

"The location is good and the shops are accessible as all the hotels are like in Macau. The room was average. It is clean, but the smell made me feel it was a little dusty.  It is a really big hotel. I didn't use the swimming pool and the sauna, but my husband said he liked it.",40
"We had an outstanding time at the Sheraton Grand! Our Checkin was fast Im SPG member elite so they have separate line and all was ready and in order upon checkin.  We also got an outstanding upgrade that was so amazing.   Maureen checked us in and was extremely professional, quick and attentive to our needs. Maureen, She's an awesome person!  5 Stars +++++  We ate at the Bene restaurant  attached and the food was amazing had the lasagna and Pizza and chicken twice.   Nam  Mendoza was excellent in helping us pick good dishes and gave 5 star service.    We had awesome Birthday cake and song!!  Two other great waiters but can't remember the names.  Everybody made our stay a very memorable and excellent stay!  Definitely will return next year!! Thank you! -Colin Mc",50
"We had a great time here again recently. The Hotel was busy , indeed humming with activity- but we still managed to get personalised service and the appropriate assistance from the appropriate staff staff when it was required. The gymnasium and extensive pool facilities were also inspiring during this 'last of the hot weather"" change of season time of year.",50
"We were travelling with 7 people including 2 small children and two grandparents.  We came over from Hong Kong by ferry, timed it so that we could check in after 3pm so the children could be taken straight to the room for naps and everyone else could have showers and settle in.  After standing in the check-in queue for over 45 minutes, only 1 room was ready, despite it being after check-in time and having booked weeks in advance. We were told to come back later to check if the other 2 rooms were ready.  We spent over an hour wandering through the shopping mall with tired children and grandparents before rooms were ready.   Once we got to the rooms, 2 keycards had to be re-keyed which meant more queuing.  During our stay, there were issues with house keeping not making up a room‚Ä¶",10
"The room‚Äôs carpet was so dirty and the Sheraton Tower Lounge did not provide wine, tap water and hot water during dinner snacks time. The server said they were just too busy to provide any water.  Comparing to other Marriott brand lounges I visited, those lounges would provide a refrigerator with different kinds of drinks. And this Sheraton hotel provided almost none.  In terms of service, I didn‚Äôt felt valued as a Marriot platinum member. The St. Regis hotel (opposite to the road) offers much better service for 30US more per night. ",20
"Since it was my first time visiting Macau, I was very concerend to choose a place to stay. I think that I made a great choice to stay at Sheraton Grand Macao Hotel. First of all, they have shuttle bus, which makes it very convenient to get to Ferry terminal and Airport. Also, I got lost a few times because the hotel was so big, and the staff were so kind to show me the way. Lastly, thanks to the Korean staff, 'Peter Jung', I was able to stay much more comfortably.

"Stayed in Sheraton Cotai for 4 nights celebrating my dads birthday. I have reached out to guest service team prior to the visit. I was especially impressed with the warm hospitality extended to myself & family. Every staffs in the hotel were extremely professional & warm, from front desk, bell boy to the lady who helped tidy the room. As it‚Äôs was a special occasion for us, we were offered complimentary cake, waiver of charge for the additional bed & express check in. Small touches that add additional delight to our trip. I will definitely stay in Sheraton in my next visit. Thanks team!",50
"Check in and out was very quick and easy. Room was very good with all amenities and clean. Wifi worked ok but had to keep logging in as I went around the hotel. Breakfast was very good, good choices of Asian and Western food. Impressed that after entering the restaurant was always address by name. Also finally got my SPG membership issue that has been ongoing for months - finally sorted. Stayed on the 25th floor and limited number of lifts going that high. Is a huge hotel and easy to get lost. Good choices of other restaurants. Disappointing that the Palm restaurant / coffee shop closes so ealry at 1130pm. Overall a very enjoyable stay",40
"Big surprise when my daughter open the door and find the colourful balloon all around the room.  And, also the yummy birthday cake and fruit.  It gives her an memorable 7th BD and really thanks for your team especially Josie.  Looking forward another pleasure time in Sheraton soon.",50
"We stayed 1 night and set another reservation because it was so good.  SPG platinum member received upgrade to suite.  The rooms are a bit dated, though did not distract from stay.  We enjoyed watching the Wynn fountain show from our room.   The tea selection and bed were excellent.  What sets this hotel apart was the staff.  Example when I was taking the elevator down to check out with bags the maid saw we were coming.  Stopped her duties and sprinted to elevator so we could get a ride down.  No joke ran.  My little girl high-fives her and we were off.  The executive lounge is busy though food quality and service is very good.  It is impressive to watch people take care of guests - many who are making large messes.  Definitely recommend this to travelers, especially with‚Ä¶",50
"We received a free upgrade as platinum elite members to an Executive Deluxe Suite on 38th floor, Earth Tower. It was a magnificent suite with karaoke room!  I am here on business, but I enjoyed resting in the karaoke room, just to watch TV.  The sofa settee was so comfortable, you could literally become a couch potato.  Colour scheme of the suite was so inviting!   I like to commend staffs Eduardo, Ricky and Faustina Lin (hope I got her name right) for their attention to details and assisting us at the Club lounge.  We arrived very early on Sunday morning when the hotel was busy and we could not check in.  We enjoyed the use of the Lounge while waiting for our room to be available.

Like the unblock view from my room and the Cleanliness of the room. It‚Äôs very convenient to stay here with free shuttle bus services to basically anywhere interesting.

We had two nights at this hotel in october.  + Best bed ever. Great pillows and duvet. + amazing view over Cotai Strip. + great service at check Inn. We got late checkout without asking. + huge and Best breakfast buffet ever. They had everything. I mean everything!  - Bad service at the pool areal. - Bad service with the shuttle concierges.

"My work books this hotel for me a few times a year. I've been coming here about 3 years. The hotel is getting worse over time. The queue to check in and out is ridiculous - my normal waiting time is about an hour. The gym removed things like combs, and the shower has been broken for at least two years now (water goes cold then boiling then cold then boiling again...) and I've told the staff about the problem numerous times.  This is all quite a shame because the rooms are nice (especially the suites) and it's obvious a lot of money went into the hotel.",20
"It is our second time to stay here, and our stay was lovelier the second time around, thanks to the warm hospitality and friendliness displayed by your staff, Mr. Aldrie Rocamora and Ms. Erika Mallari. Their work attitude again made us proud to be Filipinos. Mabuhay!",50
The hotel is bit as spectacular as it‚Äôs close neighbours such as the Parisian and Venetian and the price reflects that significantly. With that said the hotel are obviously in the money making game as they would rather have you pay a machine for a fast check in than help customers out.  We stood in a queue for 45 mins to check in instead.  With that said the rooms were nice and large and the breakfast was ok. ,30

As my husband puts it, ""it is better to stay in sheraton where it feels like home!"" We arrived at the hotel for our check-in and was assisted by stephy (not a filipino but still accommodating) who later called ericka who was very welcoming, talk about filipino warmth!!!!

"The Sheraton Grand Macao Hotel on Cotai is a superb hotel and centrally located on the Cotai Strip with indirect access to the Venitian and the Parisian resorts via the underground mall to the Four Seasons Hotel on the other side of the street. The Club Level Rooms were the highlights of our trip as the rooms themselves were elegant and very comfortable. The evening buffet for club-level members exceeded our expectations and the Club Lounge was very quiet and relaxing. The breakfast buffet offered a lot of options for both Asian and Western guests. Of note, this hotel is a very large complex and was definitely built to cater to Chinese tourists from the Mainland. Therefore, expect the lobby and check in area to be constantly busy and noisy. Otherwise, the hotel's central‚Ä¶",50

You can find bakery, chinese traditional food and European dishes as well. We were very happy to come every day for a breakfast there because all the cooks and staff were very nice. But Justine Almariego made our experience exceptional! She was very welcome to us and to my son. Justine gave us a lot of attention and my son was always smiling a lot when he saw her. Thank you!

Upon arrival, we were told we were getting an upgrade but as the room wasn't ready, we were invited to have coffee and later on drinks at the Club Lounge. While waiting, we were given constant updates re housekeeping.  We were wondering why it was taking so long to get the room ready but as we were comfortably sitting at the Club Lounge and weren't pressed for time, we had no complaints.

Still very friendly staff especially bbq dinner by the pool with the great sight of Parisian tower. Lester was very helpful and ensured we were taken care of. We enjoyed it a lot and food was superb.  View from the room still great. We stayed for 2 nights and also had a chance to enjoy tea time at the Palms.

"The whole trip started with the rejection of the best rate gaurantee as an SPG member. The process was clunky, slow and lacking in transparency. Needless to say I was a little annoyed as I found a cheaper deal after booking direct through Sheraton. I also requested a late checkout which I believed was an SPG privilege based on the website booking form.  Upon checking in I advised of the issue with the best rate guarantee and was told that I got rejected because the comparison wasn't through a travel agent, which turns out to be incorrect. Anyhow, we were also advised that we could not have the late checkout as requested. However, the gentleman assured us our room would have a lovely view which soothed us somewhat.

The service at this hotel is the best I have ever received at any hotel anywhere! The friendly staff went above and beyond to make sure everything was perfect. I appreciated that I was greeted by name daily. After one week in this beautiful place I felt like the staff were more like close friends and family.  As a Platinum under the unified Marriott/SPG program I was upgraded to an Executive King Suite. The room was large and very comfortable. The daily breakfast at the Sheraton Club was expansive and of high quality with a variety of western and Asian choices. In the evening the Sheraton Club serves snacks and drinks. On most nights it was sufficient that I did not need to go anywhere else for dinner - I was quite full.  This hotel is located in the Sands Cotai Central complex‚Ä¶,50

we didn't need to wait much time for check-in because of SPG membership. The room was clean and comfortable and the service was perfact. And it was easy to go everywhere. Especially when we go to see a House of dancing water show :)  I want to go again when I come to Macau later!,50
I had the chance to visit Macau after almost 20 plus years  and was amazed to see the significant changes and construction that had taken place. We took the Hydrofoil from HKG and it was a short 45 Minute ride across.   Upon  arriving  at the hotel we were told that the room was not ready and would be available shortly. This however wasn‚Äôt the case and due to the delay they upgraded us to a Suite. The Room we were given was fantastic and we also had Club facilities due to the points acquired with the SPG membership. The room was a 1300sq ft suite and was equipped with 2 bathrooms one full one half - a TV Room and a Living and bedroom. We had a wonderful stay - the staff was very polite and courteous and I would definite recommend  this hotel!!! ,50
"I've stayed quite many times at this hotel and got upgraded most of the times due to my membership tier. Exceptional experience everytime but this time, it's more than exceptional!!! I was even upgraded to an Ambassador suite that's equipped with a king bedroom and a twin bedroom, each with individual bathroom! I was totally amazed! Service from reception is excellent too, they do manage well for members which really make you feel privileged. Ralphael who checked me in provided great service in locating me the suite and allowed me to check in reasonably early. His smile, tone of voice and the way he speaks made me truly feel welcome.  Room also smell fresh with nicely made beds. Hard to imagine how difficult it is for the staff to clean this room but they made it really‚Ä¶",50
"I visited this hotel during June 2018 and finally have some time to write this review for this awesome hotel.  Arrived the hotel during check in peak hours so Ive ecpected to have some queuing beforehand. Clear instructions and well organized for the queuing system. It wasn't take us much time as we saw all of the counters were busying communicating with guests. My friends and I were served by Athena Ng and her professionalism shocks me. Personally think of she was not feeling well as her voice was a bit crack yet she still manage to provide seamless services during the check in. This is amazing. And room was ready right on spot as we were not expecting. It is because we were there a bit earlier than the standard check in time. Thank you, Athena.  And arriving to the room, the‚Ä¶",40
"My family and i decided to book a room in sheraton during the latest typhoon as our house wasnt really that safe. Upon check in, we were welcomed by a nice girl(forgot her name). After a few minutes upon check in, we received a courtesy call by Josie from Guest Relations who offered further assistance. We felt a genuine care from her and would like to thank her. When we lost aircondition in the room due to the typhoon, she assisted me to move. She even assisted me to fix my billing due to authorization issue. So to Josie, thank you very much for your assistance throughout our stay. Maraming Salamat!",50
Location: just great can‚Äôt get any better   Room: I got an upgrade to be honest and got a suite... it was just fantastic .

Staff: polite dedicated and professional. No complain at all   Overall experience just amazing!  ,50

Great spread, Cantonese Style Roast, Pork, Italian and some India mix, not forgetting all the small desert cakes n Haagen Dazs Ice Cream 2... Yummy Yummy.",50

Since this trip was partially for my son's birthday, I mentioned it to the Manager Mariana, hoping she will send a small cake for him.  She sent a cake, threw him a birthday party with balloon hat and choir, and a room filled with balloons.  We were very moved by how happy the staff genuinely felt and the kids obviously had a blast.  Club Lounge had full buffet in the morning, and a really good selection of salad and hot food between 5 - 8pm.  Kids and adults enjoyed our time there, and we appreciated the convenience.

"This was a good hotel, pretty central on the Cotai strip.  About 15-20 mins from the ferry which we took from hong kong.  There is a large mall and restaurants attached.  Its close to the Venetian and City of Dreams hotel.  The pool area is nice and they serve food and drinks.  Our server was very nice!  The only thing about the hotel was that it wasnt as modern as I thought it would be for being the largest hotel in the area and recently built.  The carpets and tapestries looks old and worn.  We even had some crumbs left on our carpet.  But for the couple of days we were there it was fine and served our needs.  The only thing was we needed to go to the Taipa ferry terminal to go to the HK airport and we kept asking ppl at the hotel, the lady who was at the beginning of the line‚Ä¶",40
"Among the sheraton hotels we travelled so far, the executive floor in the sheraton grand macau was really outstanding. It was a huge club, i must say! From their reception,with accommodating staff, Faustine, and to the manager on duty, Rowell Joson, who willingly gave us tip on great places to go in Macau! Service was personalize and indeed first class! You guys made us feel a different level of experience! A very heartfelt welcome from a very hospitable group of people! In return, we'll definitely share this great experience with our family and friends! Cheers!",50
"We stayed in a club suite for 3 nights and from the moment we step into the suite, we were blown away by the neatness, the size of the room and the luxury it offered.  We found the guest toilet especially as a bonus. The massive King bed was a delight, and the living area very convenient to chill out at. Breakfast was satisfying, however, I feel a few tables outside on the terrace would make it perfect. The staff is super efficient and friendly. Thank you Sheraton, for a great stay.",50

After my complain I got the promised from the Duty manager that my room preferences will be updated in my profile. For this stay, I have also called to the hotel in advance and provide my SPG number to ensure all information will be on the reservation.  Upon my check in this stay, the check in lady seems did not know about my preferences. I mentioned again the I need a quiet room which is not connecting room.

"What an incredible experience my family and I had at the Sheraton Grand Macao Hotel!  The stay was perfect!  From the moment we walked through the doors on day one of our five day stay, the polite and friendly staff were always at hand to help. The rooms were simply gorgeous, very elegant.  The pool and gym facilities are amazing, as a fitness trainer, I generally choose to stay in hotels equipped with a gym as I like to workout while I'm holidays - I can safely say it is one of the best hotel gyms I've ever seen!     I also had an incredible facial at the spa, highly recommend.    All in all, this was a PERFECT holiday and I already can't wait to go back and stay again!  Thanks to the staff at Sheraton Grand Macao! Wonderful from start to finish!",50
"We stayed at this Sheraton for a single night on our trip to Hong Kong. From HK, you can take a quick hour long ferry into Macau where the hotel shuttle will pick you up. Then we made our way to the check in area where the line was super long. Sanjieb realized we were platinum members and led us up to the fourth floor where there was a private check in area. He made sure we knew where the amenities were, got us bottles of water, waited for us to get checked in, showed us to the correct elevator, and even refused a tip. This experience was top notch and made us want to extend our stay as he mentioned plenty of things to do and see in Macau. Alas, the hotel was completely booked up for the next few weeks so we‚Äôll have to come back!",50

The room condition of Standard and Junior Suite at Sheraton didn‚Äôt really impress me but their staff were amazing.

I‚Äôve met a guest service staff named Josie B. who helped me get to the room with so many luggages, was very friendly and that friendly conversation made me feel welcomed. He also explained about services Sheraton provides. I tried to give him service tip but he strongly refused. So I made a promise that I‚Äôll write a review of his great service.

Second visit and it‚Äôs certainly gone down hill since 4 years ago. Arrived at 5am and the night staff are clueless.

I explained I‚Äôm on vacation with my mother and definitely didn‚Äôt want to share a bed.

When I entered the room, none of my requested (and confirmed) items were setup. meh~  Talking about the room.... it was old, tiring, and dirty. And, it was noisy! The lifts took forever to‚Ä¶",20
Our bellman Vladimir Inventor was very helpful. Not only did he help us with our bags but he was able to help us with directions. He went over and beyond his duties as a bellman. We would visit Macao again because of the rest service!  ,50
"I am not a review person but I have to write second review this. And surprisingly my second review is Sheraton again. My first review was Sheraton Pattaya.  Starwood chains are splendid. Especially they trained their staff very and everybody knows what to do for making their customers satisfied.   In Macau I stayed at Sheraton and this was my second time. I was hesitating between Wynn Palace and Sheraton, at the end i know it was great decision i made as we had unforgettable stay with them.  Their GRM Mariana was extremely professional and they Kyle He from reservation team was very helpful even before your check in.   I stayed at Executive Suite, the room condition was great everything is so well maintained.   At the end, it all valued our money. I suggest all my friends to‚Ä¶",50
"One of the best check in experience with Mr. Raphael Grantil. All questions and requests heard and addressed properly. Also liked quick responses from Guest Services. Housekeeping was a bit delayed two days in a row; rooms not cleaned until 5:30pm, which was somewhat annoying. Otherwise, thumbs up! ",40
"Stayed with a friend of mine for her unexpected business trip during G2E 2018. It is easy for us to move around Sands Cotai Central, the Venetian, the Parisian and the Cotai Expo Hall with the overpass between. Got a room on 27 floor facing MGM Cotai and the airport, surely the view was relaxing but the showering amenities could have been much nicer. Basically it is the most affordable hotel on the entire Cotai Strip, and everything is above standard considering its price. For tourists with limited budget but still want to experience the famous ‚ÄúVegas of the East,‚Äù Sheraton is the place to be.",40
"On JuIy 29 i want to express my extreme gratitude of Mr Samuel for a good customer service. He was knowledgeable, patient and helpful in solving problem in our room Skytower1-1021. Thank you for hiring these people They are stellar examples of the customer service that makes a positive difference when working under pressure. Thank you once again",50
It was my first visit here the staff especial thanks to carmela very cooperative. the staff_took care of my uncle whos 82yrs.Carmela made it a point to give the best comfort every staff is very cooperative with a beautiful smile i lvd the stay God bless u all from Ms.marshall and Mr.Kirti shah,50
"I visit Sheraton for anniversay celebration and watching concert. The stay over sheraton is excellent, room is clean and tidy. The bed is comfortable. Staff provided warm greeting and is helpful in providing help.",50
"We have only stayed one night at this hotel.  Guest services was excellent.  Mr. Raphael Grafil answered our questions, listened to our concerns, and provided excellent guest services.  With only the guest servies greeting from Mr. Grafil, we felt like we are already a VIP guest.  Room is comfortable and clean.  Restaurants at Sheraton provides lots of choices with a reasonable charge.  A local food court including McDonald is located inside the hotel for even more economical choices.",50
"The hotel is integrated with the shopping mall and others hotel,the place is so big and you can literally live with out going out of the hotel. The check in and out are really strict with the time but can be done fast,check out can be done just by return the card to the express check out box.the rooms are big and complete,they also lend you a smartphone with internet.to bad I cannot try the swimming pool since the weather is not good at that time,i think for my next visit to Macau I might stay in this hotel again",50
"Our family had great time thanks to your kind consideration When we arrived at midnight,we realized we hadnt requested to have 2 rooms on the same floor for my young 3 kids . You however tried to figure it out quickly and offered a presidential suite for the first night. You also gave us a tip to go to spg lounge directly the following day when we change the room.otherwise we must have been on the long queue  We were happy with overall experience at your property  Rooms were clean and staff were very kind!!",50
"First impression is it is an excellent hotel with good guest service amabassador Samuel!!!!The space for two beds room is big enough for us, which makes it convenient to arrange the luggage. The location is also great and really close to the airport, which takes only 5 mins taxi.",50
"Was told that this is the largest Sheraton Hotel in the world with 2,000+ hotel rooms. Size of room is big and comfortable with a large king size bed, spacious toilet, couches etc. Room deco is a bit dated though. The queue at check-in is quite long, despite being a SPG member. Checkin staff is very polite and cheerful. Restaurant for buffet is quite a long walk from the hotel lobby. ",40
"Never a disappointing moment with Sheraton Grand Macao.  All the staff were very accommodating and helpful throughout the stay.  The breakfast was amazing, with a variety of foods from all around the world.  As my husband and I celebrated our wedding anniversary, the staff made it a super special evening ;).  Thank you!",50
"I strongly recommended you all to enrol as SPG member so you can enjoy the fast track of check-in / check-out process during the peak seasons.....  Also, try enjoying the pools within time frame of 1030~1500hrs in order to stay away from tall-&-short (I mean family members) as they will fill up the pools with noise and screaming.  One thing I would like to point out as an improvement actions for the Management is there are so many non-hotel guests and non-swimmers (hotel guest) walking roung the pools as they treated it as a scenic spot of Sheraton !  My point is that the shoes of these guys may bring along with germs and bacterias to the pools and so contaminate the pools and endanger the swimmers.",40
I am glad to have birthday in hotel and get the lovely cakes.I use swimming pool in the morning.And it could easily saw Paris tower.Also the casino is nice and i won money during the staying.My mom and me really enjoy this holiday.,50
"I was celebrating the birthday with my girlfriend and the hotel arrangement was very great. The Front Desk know the birthday of us and said ""Happy Birthday"" to us when checking in. That was very surprising. Also, the view is very nice and can watch The Parisian. Besides, all of staff, which are including Front Desk and Housekeeping, are very nice and helpful. This stay is my best and memorable experience with my lots of visited hotels. We would be grateful to stay it again.",50
"The hotel was great!  During my stay in Macau, I stayed 3 nights in Sheraton and 2 nights in one of the hotels in Galaxy pool area, but I honestly enjoyed the sheraton stay much more although it was half the price.   It was a great choice to book for a suite with executive lounge access.  Breakfast was great, they could heat up baby food we brought, and we didn't have to leave the hotel for dinner thanks to the evening drinks & snacks served.  The kids didn't have to get dressed to go out of the hotel, so they could enjoy the pool all day long.   Also it felt really good that they would allow for 2 children under 12 to use the lounge for free...   The other hotel didn't allow it, and this just made us feel much less welcomed compared to sheraton.  Pools were large and they would‚Ä¶",50

This is my second time in Sheraton but you never fail to surprise me. Let me tell you a short story.  First My booking has been cancelled by booking.com which made me so upset because i thought it was the hotel who cancelled my booking but good thing i am still keep in touch to your Guest Relations Ms. Erika Mallari as she gave me her business card. So she helped me to call and assist me to rebook again my booking. It was a relief because my birthday is coming in two weeks!   I have book a suite room and luckily Erika made some arrangements and gave me a room with Parisian View. We also received some fruits and pastries with her handwriting with greetings.   But what surprise me most is the balloons on the floor! It feels like i was kid again!I know its a small thing but it‚Ä¶,50

"I called to make a reservation at the poolside bbq for dinner for 10 adults and 3 toddlers and spoke with Jackie. She advised that they don‚Äôt take reservations and but will transfer me to the restaurant to see what they can do because we have a large party with kids. The restaurant didn‚Äôt pick up the line so she took my information (name, phone and reservation) and said someone would call me back.   We have 4 rooms booked for the coming weekend and still have not heard back from anyone. This is not the service I would expect from the Sheraton, very disappointing!!  ",20
"Sheraton Grand is a beautiful property with a great view and convenient modes of transportation. Casinos, clubs, food, shopping and site-seeing are all within indoor walking distance (Sheraton is connected to various other properties as they are all in junction with each other). With the given geographic location this is crucial considering the humidity, temperature and monsoon season.       Exceptional service by Kachi Choi who directed me to my room with very positive energy! He provided very accurate information regarding the casinos, clubs, shopping and dining in the area so I could strategize my stay. He made me feel very welcomed and comfortable.      Would recommend to any visitors ranging from tourists to business people. There are ample amenities to service all needs!",50
"On July 15th, we had a super big and perfect birthday dinner with around 80 people at Bene. The waiting staff were all so kind, professional and pleasant, including the manager. The food was delicious, the seafood was very good and fresh and the best part was the cake. What surprised us most was when the staff members sang the birthday song to us very loudly, lively and cheerfully. It was an unforgettable 18th birthday. We will definitely come again. Thanks to all!",50
Every staffs I've encountered were all so nice and friendly. It was very impressive that they recognize my name at the moment I'm taking a table in club lounge ask how I am. They kept trying to catch if we need anything and were ready to help all the time. Very very impressive and nice service. I wanna say that it's the best of the best including all tier hotels in Marriott hotels. (Thank you Eduardo!) Room was also clean and cozy. I loved the big bath tub in which placed in center of wash room.  Swimming pool was also well-designed it's a long track despite of the nice design. The size and complex of swimming pool seems to be able to satisfy both of good swimmers and those who want to relax and simply have a good time.,50
"It was amazing, celebrating my 34th birthday in Sheraton Grand Macau.  The Room is perfectly beautiful, spacious the view was great and a comfy bed.

"We checked in yesterday into the Family suite with the bunk bed. Typically, I‚Äôm not a reviewer but I‚Äôll like to warn parents of young kids. Mine are toddler age.   1. There was a broken zip on the floor which my child found - it‚Äôs small and sharp; this will be very dangerous if she swallowed it 2. The steps to the bed has very sharp corners so a toddler needs to be watched all the time to be safe 3. Half the room lights were not working  4. The crib was very small and very deep; so not suitable for a baby who‚Äôs a light sleeper.  5. Kids size table and chairs were made of plastic so if you have kids who like to climb, it‚Äôs very dangerous.

Great hospitality ever. Everything was perfect. Staff was superb friendly and helpful. The location was perfect too its located in cotai city which is very easy for you to reach tourist attraction arround macao. Really recommended fo those who wanna come for vacation or for bussiness reason. ,50
Good service (no matter at the SPG check-in counter or communicated with the back office before arrival.  They have also sent follow-up message to me after we check-out). Convenient location. Comfortable room that we spent a long time in the hotel room. The housekeeping did clean the room well.  Will certainly come back!!,50
"Our stay was overwhelming! Upon checking-in, Ruby assisted us very well. She gave us a room with the perfect Parisian view! She made an effort asking us what we need and even told us where to eat and see here in Macau! We really cant thank her enough in exerting an extra effort to provide us the perfecf stay here in Macau! In addition, he even surprised my partner with a simple gift because it‚Äôs his birthday!   Our room was very clean with all the basic necessities that we need. It was spacious, quiet and very comfortable.   We‚Äôll definitely stay here in our next visit!",50

"We stayed just one night. It was an amazing place.  Checked in easily with SPG membership number. The room was quite big and the beds bigger. We were given many free coupons for restaurants and refreshments that was not part of the package. The great surprise was in the choice of breakfast or lunch. We opted for breakfast which was an amazing and lifetime memorable abroad that included several Indian popular dishes like sambar, Paratha ( several varieties). Idly, Dosa, Vada, Poori apart from several other cuisines. Certainly will visit again. It was surprising  that one could pass thro' to other hotels without coming out on the road , all being interlinked.",50
"I arrived on a Wednesday around 5pm and, even with SPG Gold, it cost me 30 minutes to check in. For business travelers, this is unacceptable. The hotel facilities are ok, the gym is well equipped but congested and breakfast is quite good. Elevators are not that fast, adding to the inconvenience of the check in/out lengthy process. ",20
Id like to thank Sheraton for making our stay the most relaxing vacation ever. And thank you for Cyril(the staff who checked us in) for making everything so convenient for us as well! Great service! We will come back again!!,50
"I stayed at the hotel for 2 nights with my sister. The day we checked in was my sister's birthday. The hotel gave us a room with Eiffel tower view. The room was very clean and nice. We really liked a nice view of the room. Also when we came back to the hotel, we found a birthday card and a small box of madeleines. We didn't expect it and we were surprised. We appreciated the hotel and staff very much. It was a wonderful experience in our life. I definitely want to go back to the hotel.",50

Our kids were given coloring book and there‚Äôs also nice sofas for us to wait for my husband to check in.

I understood that Elite Member check-in counter is closed during night time but, staffs are don't care people who intervene the line. Further that I have SPG Platinum but check-in staff told me I am Gold (Yes, I was Gold in 3 years ago). Beware, If you are Elite member of SPG who will arrive in night time, it will be nightmare to check-in the room.  They saying due to high occupancy in hotel, they aren‚Äôt available to upgrade the room and only can provide lower floor.(It`s not matter for me.)

"Wow, what a majestic setting - especially rooms, lobby was normal and slow as usual at holiday destinations.  Was traveling with family on vacation and they have these twin room setting (interconnected) which was very safe & convenient while you enjoy your privacy.  In room dining was good as well. Overall - good 2 days",50

Didn't know what to expect on this side of the road we have stayed at the Galaxy and the Venetian a few times but being linked between Four major hotels. It  was exciting  to be able to walk in and out of the back entrance's of the connecting Hotels for the food court and the free shuttle to the ferry's and the train station. ,50

Pools and sauna and steam rooms were my personal favorite.  Mr. Wilson Webster from SPG concierge was able to upgrade our room to a lovely spacious suite with it's own media room and an exemplary view.   We had a wonderful overnight stay!

"Without doubt Sheraton Grand Hotel, Macau is my family‚Äôs favorite hotel to stay in Macau. We stayed from July 1 - 7, 2018. Upon arrival we were warmly welcome by a Pinoy staff  Ralphael Grafil. Some staff was extremely friendly. The room was so clean and tidy, supplied with complete toiletries and other guest needs. All respect to the hotel management who does a good job, true example of good hospitality and governance. Value for money indeed.  Thank you too to Sir Stephen for the upgrade of our room, well appreciated, such a wonderful way of making your guest feels great and love. We will be back for sure. Keep it up.",50
"There were generous for suite room upgrade, but this time, just stayed at the normal room but with a quite good view to the parisian hotel/tower.   Club lounge was good always. Macao beer changed from bottle to can. Staff members were always nice - best part of this hotel. Check in - a man from the Philippines - kindly checked in and check out at the club lounge was smooth. All were professionally proceded.   Gym looks a bit old but fine to exercise. Didn't use the swimming pool, but fine and quite family oriented.   Elevator system was a bit difficult at first.",40
"Very friendly and helpful staff who‚Äôs always giving excellent service, especially Miss Erika Mallari from guest relations had arranged some surprises and treated us with warmth.   The room is clean, very spacious, relaxing and had an AMAZING VIEW. The location is really great!   We‚Äôll definitely choose to stay here again.",50

As far as the hotel goes, the staff are extremely guest oriented, our very special thanks are due to the ladies who helped us check-in and check-out at the Club lounge. Special thanks are also due to the Chef who jigged up a vegetarian meal for us at the breakfast. We had a Executive Suite for 3 days, which was nice, comfortable and thoughtfully furnished without clutter. The room was pretty well glazed to give a good view. Ample natural light.

"We had an enjoyable one night stay at the hotel, and appreciate that it has airport transfer and transfer to the Zhuhai border as well. It is easy to walk around the area as the shopping malls and hotels are linked. We also walked to the more historic Tiapa area and took public bus to Macau side.  The Cotai area looks like a theme park and Sheraton Hotel is certainly one of the convenient hotels along the Cotai strip. The hotel is also reasonably priced compared to the others in the vicinity, a well worth stay for us!",50
"Luxurious, well-appointed room with a nice view as expected.  However there was one issue.  We arrived at the hotel at around 11:30am and went to approach the check-in desk and we were stopped by a really rude man who barked at us that check-in was at 1pm and told us to go away. We were given no options as to where we could wait, or where we could store our bags.  Luckily we saw the SPG desk and approached them where they were super helpful and checked us in straight away.",50
"Sheraton provides free shuttle buses from Taipa ferry terminal to the hotel For those who aren‚Äôt SPG members, the queue for check-in can take an hour (or more) or you can opt for the self check-in machine which only accepts cash for deposit.  The room is clean, spacious and the bed was very comfortable.  The hotel is conveniently located and with free shuttle buses that brings publics to all the main casinos and shopping malls.  Overall, it was a good stay. ",50

When we finally got to our floor we noticed a strange smell, it just didn't smell that nice or clean. the room itself was large, but nothing that special and certainly not super luxe, the fittings etc look cheap and not high quality. the line for breakfast took at least 30 mins which was insane, one really positive credit though, for the staff member LANCE.

"I had Feast dinner buffet at Sheraton Grand in Cotai Macau was terrible as they have long queue to wait for the table.  However, there are only 2 chairs at the main entrance.  It looks that they have badly trained the staffs to arrange the table.  Also, they are under staffs to serve many tables.  I will never return to Feast again.",10
I love the view from our hotel room...especially the Parisian...combined with the 5-star service of their staff... I felt like a VIP especially when I was greeted and helped by Samuel... I will definitely stay here again and recommend to all my friends and relatives.. ,50

I must say this is one of the best international buffet we have eaten . There is so much variety , seafood is fresh and the additional charge for free flow drinks was well worth the price . The waiteress Diana Reyes Abriam  and waiter Amiel Mamaclay top up the evening with their  great service and smiles .  Delicious ! Well done Sheraton  ! ",50
"I couldn't believe the bathroom was of such poor quality.  First of all, the shower was only equipped with a shower curtain, no glass door, it was only spacious but with a cheap shower curtain.  And the toilet had no lid!!!  I thought I was in a public toilet!  Is it not common knowledge that you need a toilet needs a lid so that when you are finished, you can flush with the lid down and keep the bacteria inside???  How could a 5 star hotel do this?  Imagine all the towels, toothbrushes, combs, everything covered with bacteria???  My son & I went to the pool after check in which was about 6pm.  When we got there, my son wanted some fries but the pool's F&B closes at 6pm.  We were deeply disappointed, especially my son.  Again, I was surprised such service closes so early.",10
"Stayed there for 2 nights. Awesome location on the famous Macau strip. It is connected with the Vanatian through a sky bridge. Had a pretty big shopping mall as well. In house casino I found was much better than the overhyped Vanatian. Buffet lunch was the biggest surprise, spread was lavish and food was really good.",40
"This is my third time to visit this hotel.  Its price is the most competitive among all the 5-star hotels in Macau.  Its performance did not fail me and what's more it is even improving.  For the check-in, there is always a long long queue.  But as a SPG member, I have a dedicated check-in area for an express check-in within 10 mins.  So, you are highly recommended to register as a member first.     This time, my family visited Sheraton's Chinese restaurant for a lunch dim-sum buffet.  The price is very good, around HK$200 and there are a great variety of food.  The name of the buffet is quite misleading, in fact, there are not just dim sum but they also offer other Chinese dishes, desserts and fruits.  The tea is also very good.  I highly recommend this dim-sum buffet. ‚Ä¶",50

"This is our second visit to Sheraton Grand Macau. Always love the location which is connected to coral central mal. For family with kids, it‚Äôs great since there‚Äôs a quite big toys store in the mall connected to Sheraton. While checking in, Eduardo the Guest Service Ambassador was really helpful. He gave the kids some coloring books and pencils to take. He also tried to provide us with the best room available since my dad‚Äôs a SPG platinum member and while it was not available he gave us free breakfast and cocktails for all.",50
"The staff in this hotel is really nice and friendly. We checked in at around 3pm in the afternoon and it is the peak hour for the check in counter as you can see there is a long queue lining up in the lobby. Staff in the check in counter is nice and kind even in such a high pressure environment and her name is Athena Ng. She gave us very clear and detail instruction to us and it is much appreciated.   In addition, I need to special thanks for the birthday treat arrangement and it is delicious.   The in room dining colleagues are nice and helpful. The full breakfast is awesome! Last but not least,there is only one thing for improvement. It is undercooked haninese chix rice ...üôàüôà ",40
My family decided to stay at Sheraton Macao upon a friend's recommendation and we were so happy and will definitely stay here again. Check in was fast as well as check out. I emailed the hotel informing them that my son will be celebrating his birthday during our stay and guest services really made his birthday really special. They decorated our room with balloons and made a special birthday greeting for him.   We stayed at their family suite. Highly recommend this type  of room for family with kids. The kid's room have bunk beds as well as an x box for them to use.   Thank you to Ms Josie Bilag of guest services for making my son's birthday a very memorable one. Thank you for making sure that all of our requests were taken cared of.,50
"I am writing to give a shout-out to Jetro, the Guest Service Ambassador at the SPG desk.  He was helpful and very pleasant during both check-in and check-out process. He went out of his way to accommodate my request of having 4 rooms on the same floor in the same tower during a very busy period in June. In addition, he provided excellent recommendations of things to do and places to eat within the area.  Hotel itself was standard Sheraton style, located within close distance to other large resorts in Cotai strip and Taipa.",40
"Check-in queue was quite long because there were only 3 staff available. Walking from the lift to my room was quite far. But overall, I am satisfied with the stay, great facilities, the staff at the gym were friendly, great location for shopping, the mall was connected to venetian and parisian, very convenient.",40
"The location is good. it is in center of many wonderful places, like Parisien, Venetian, Wynn Palace, and MGM. Quick check-in service with SPG member. Big and clean room space with reasonable price. We enjoy the stay.",50
"Reasonably priced hotel. Nice big rooms. Walking distance to parisien casino and Venetian. Buffet breakfast not bad. We enjoyed our stay there, stayed 2 nights. There are shuttle buses to other casinos too. ",40
We took a CotaiJet to Macao to chase after DreamWorks' lovable mascots.  We enjoyed the free hotel bus to Cotai Strip.  They have a meet and greet session around lunchtime in Paradise Garden where I got to hug penguins from Madagascar and more :p  There's also a dance parade of the characters daily at 4pm inside the mall's premises.  Leji didn't mind being roused from her afternoon nap with all the lively music and excited kids.  The characters all danced with so much energy all throughout the stretch especially Po the Panda and Alex the Lion. They even handed out free balloons; it was pretty amazing.  The pool is not as spectacular as in the photos (there are a lot of guests who swim so the water isn't clear anymore and there are a number of leaves floating in some of the‚Ä¶,40

I read many good reviews before booking sheraton hotel. Many people recommended this hotel for nice location however i was quite disappointed when i first entered the room. Dirty stain carpet and stuffy room smell. I had to change the room but even changed room condition was not so different. They had two pools however they were not in good length. Both pools were divided in halves? I would pay little more and stay at Wynn palace. I stayed at both hotels and sheraton was disappointing.,20
"This is my second time staying in this hotel, and it never fails to exceed my expectations. The rooms are big enough for 4 people to stay in and for this time, they gave us an interconnecting room as we have a group of 8 people.  Service was fantastic as we were given our rooms when we checked in around 12 noon. All the facilities in the room were fantastic.  The concierge was very helpful and gave us good recommendations to walk to Le Parisian instead of waiting for the bus as it was around 10 minutes walk from the hotel and there is no need to walk outside as these hotels, including Venetian Macau and Four Seasons Macau",50
"I had a great experience here! The guy who checked me called Cyril, was so polite and friendly. Did an amazing job at answering all my enquiries and making sure I was satisfied with everything. The bed was so comfortable, and the room was very nice and clean. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and will be returning.",50
"We did a trip over to Macau from Hong Kong, just to see Macau... had a night booked in the Sheraton, what a beautiful place, the room was beautiful and huge, with a huge bathroom, on 31st level, later we had got caught in a storm while out walking and to soak in the bath was amazing to warm up again after the storm ... the hotel was amazing with choices of cafes and restaurants and other amazing shops...",50
Thank you so much to Ms. Josie Bilag and Ms. Stephy from guest relations for the wonderful arrangement during my birthday. My family and I was really surprised!   Thanks to Bellman Smith who helped us with our heavy luggages.   Thank you also to Mr. Alrie and Mr. Eduardo for helping us with our keys and for helping us during our stay.   Lastly thanks to Mr. Bensum Lo who helped us with our extension because we can't go to HK because of heavy rain. Such a relief that we don't need to transfer to another hotel.   Thanks to all the persons i've mentioned above. Thank you for the hospitality especially to my cousins who are from singapore. They really enjoyed staying in macau Because of you guys. Our family reunion and my birthday became so memorable.,50
Our vacation in Macau was very memorable. Choosing Sheraton Macau was a very good choice the room is clean. We really love the pool area. There is a lot of restaurants you can choose. Thanks to our guest service ambassador Josie Bilag for providing a lot of information we need. We felt that she really have care to the guests. 100% no regret staying in this hotel üëå,50
"I chose the Sheraton because of my SPG status, but I didn't regret it: The room was very clean and the staff very friendly. The hotel is quite huge, so I chose two times the wrong elevator ;-). The hotel is directly at the Cotai and has a direct connection to other hotels like the Venetian or Parisian or shopping malls. The pool area is quite nice but not so big as it should be at a hotel in such size.  The hotel is not far away from the airport and the Cotai ferry terminal, so you don't need a bus because a taxi is quite cheap for this short distance.",50
We arrived late night and checked in at Spg counter.The guy at counter called Ms. Erika Mallari (guest service ambassador) to attend to our needs. She gave us a room in high floor with view of eiffel and latest check out time.Very accomodating and hospitable! I will surely recommend your hotel.,50
"Very clean, well located, great restaurants. Long line at check-in but very pleasant and accomodating people at the check-in counter...special mention to Rosie Dilao who was very nice and had a big smile....it is a refreshing experience after a the long flight and the long line at check-in.",50
Last week the electricity of our building shut down so me and my wife decided to stay here because we can not sleep. Josie Bilag make sure that our stay will be comfortable she ask us our needs and everything. Our stress was relieved because of her good service. It was very nice to stay here. One thing is for sure we will come back here.,50
Recently I have a 3-nights vacation in the hotel. The hotel is just great. Room is clean and comfortable. Swimming pools are beautiful and suit families. The mall underneath have many establishments that suit all budgets. Staff are very professional and polite. I left my glasses in the pool area.Their pool staff located it and returned to me while I came down to look for it.  I will definitely return.,50
"Good Experience, though the check in was a bit slow but none the less smooth, Express Check Out (Hardly took any time). I had my stay with family from 8th June 2018 to 10th June 2018, (2 Nights 3 Rooms). The hotel is centrally located in Cotai Area, and is well connected to other major hotels in the area by way of interconnecting shopping malls, walkways and escalators. Cotai Strip is walking distance. Rooms are large and spacious and justify the 5 star Tag, Baths are superb with large Tubs and separate shower areas. Breakfast is really sumptuous, with a very vast variety and Indian cuisine counters and very large variety of cake and assorted sweets, and sparkling champagne. Good shuttle service to ferry and local sites is free of cost. Had a good time at the swimming pool area,‚Ä¶",40

"Yup, the 3Cs...the last word doesn't really flow, but didn't want to use cheap because such a coarse word should not be associated with the property. The Sheraton Grand Macao is a great value hotel located next to the Venetian, Four Seasons, and Parisian. Could get there directly from the airport with the Sands shuttle, and a hotel shuttle service in the east lobby also takes you to Sands Casino in the heart of Macau City. Comfort wise, it's great. Rooms, while not as glamorous as its surrounding 5-star counterparts, are sparkling clean and classy enough for the casual traveler. Only thing I did not enjoy was the attached casino, which cost me more than a month's worth of hotel fees.",50
"We have spent 2 days in the hotel to celebrate my daughter‚Äôs 18 th birtday and we definitely chose the best hotel option. Sheraton was amazing: -The rooms: big, new, tastefully decorated with lovely bathrooms and wonderful views (they have changed my daughter‚Äôs room with an Eiffel tower view room). I especially liked the french madelens that came together with fruit and personalized birthday card for my daughter. The beds with silky sheets are ones of the most comfortable I have ever encounter in a hotel. -The breakfast: wonderful, a huge aray of everything; we even treated ourselves with champagne to celebrate our daughter‚Äôs birthday. -The pools: we had drinks and food (very good, even not a wide choice to choose from))near the pools waiting for our room to be ready and We had‚Ä¶",50

The hotel complex has many restaurants and shops and one can have lots of option for food including a Mc Donald‚Äôs. If anyone likes great variety food court, walk over to the Venetian food court which is just opposite the Sheraton.  It has a sizeable Casino and relatively smoke free.

Its a great place to stay. Just in midst of the shopping area.. Connected internally to Venetian and other mall shopping areas. Casino is just on the ground floor and pretty convenient. Breakfast Diego is awesome and especially Indian food available. Golden peacock Indian restaurant is in walking distance and pretty easy to find. Rooms are spacious and great ambience. There is self checkout kiosk as well saving your time and energy.  Polls are pretty small while the are multiple ones. They are not deep enough for some one who lived swimming in deeppools.  All in all a great place to stay.,50
"It‚Äôs one of my favourite hotels in Macao.   When you arrive during weekend, you will see a very busy lobby full of people.  But surprisingly, staffs can still give me a friendly smile and warm greeting when it was my turn for check-in.  I think 20 or 30 people in front of me in the queue,  I thought I need to queue for at least 30 minutes.  Surprisingly, I just waited for less than 10 or 15 minutes. Happy already!   I called and ordered extra shower gel at night and was delivered very shortly.   Express check-out is very convenient also.  I would highly recommend you to use credit card for deposit at check-in.  I don‚Äôt need to go to the reception for check-out, just drop my room key card to the box in front of the lift, very convenient! ",50

"My friend won a free night at the Sheraton as part of a raffle prize and we were lucky enough to enjoy the experience together.  The deluxe suits are beautiful, we had two double twin beds, and the bathroom was gorgeous, with separate bath and shower facilities all decked out in marble.   The amenities of the hotel were beautiful, though I will admit it is a rather confusing design, having to ensure you enter the correct elevator, in the correct tower in order to ensure you arrive at your hotel room.   The complimentary breakfast at Feast was exactly that. A broad scope of international cuisine of a high standard awaited us a good 10 minutes walk from our room, but it was worth it.

Frankly, I have no doubt not to render my recommendation for this hotel except the people do not mind their one star service. Other than that everything is so far so good.",20
"Have stayed in several new hotels in Macau, Sheraton sure did provide the most perfect stay. The service ambassador Raphael was so nice and demonstrated a quality service by helping us along the check-in and upgrading us to the sky tower with a spectacular view. The room is spacious and clean. The price of the hotel is surprisingly reasonable of a 5-star hotel. Tho, the swimming pool and the facilities are very basic which made it less attractive when compared to other hotels in the area. The SPG membership definitely attracts me to try other hotels in the group again!!!!!",50

"Ok hotel but consistent with my Sheraton & Westin properties around the world, this was is older, the lobby, entrance & casino is underwhelming.  Service seems excellent, although upon arriving at 3 AM it took forever to check-in, no one was working the Gold/Platinum line and despite having communicated with the hotel for the last 2 weeks about a few things I wanted upon check-in, they didn't have 2 of the items ready & hadn't bothered to communicate with me in advance.  Price/value is good but Wynn, brand New Grand Hyatt and City of Dreams looks off the charts modern and nice.

The equipment is very new and there‚Äôs pretty much everything you could want including a room big enough to fit about 10 people for complimentary group classes. - Very comfortable beds. - The location. It‚Äôs situated on one of the newer parts of the Cotai strip, within walking distance of the Parisien, Venetian, City of Dreams, Studio City etc. so you can wander round the attractions and shops without stepping out into the scorching heat.

"One of the best hotels I have visited on my travels. Sheraton Grand is just as grand as Macau. Miss Ana at guest services was so helpful, polite and informative. I would rate the hotel at 10 out of 10 on my stay for 6 days. Food was exemplary. Happy to advice this hotel does not dissapoint as they take care of every fine detail in there performance. Thank you Sheraton. Made my holiday a memorable one.",50
"Great hotel with the best facilities.  Room is big , clean and quiet. Staffs are also very kind. For enjoying fun with casino also very nice. 3rd Floor food court also clean and delicious. We enjoyed 2 night over there and fully recommended the best hotel. ",50
"I was a member of the fitness center, recently the management of the fitness is in downfall, the machines are dirty, before i can see the staffs clean the machines frequently but not these few months, the members have to clean them by themselves with the wet tissues that provided, i think its quite ridiculous with a five star hotel under the name of ‚ÄúSheraton ‚Äú, they even allow guests taking photos inside the gym eventhough sings are there to remind not to take photos, no wonder the old members stopped renewing their memberships",10
"Sheraton is one of the largest world top class hotel. The unique part is the room having the attractive smartphone named Handy which allows you to use the internet data even you go out anywhere in Macau, it has an access to call many different countries with free of charge I think Sheraton has done the best by installing this device inside the room.The room size was very spacious with well furnitures. We had stayed 2 nights in Sheraton and we enjoyed a lot. The guest service ambassador Ruby assist us to checked in with an efficient and quick way. Our Room was makeup by the housekeeping staff Tilak Basnet who had done a great job. We are 3 people living and he left 3 sets of towels/ toiletries and slippers with a notes saying he had noticed we are many so put some extra things‚Ä¶",50
We had a wonderful stay for one night.  Everyone from the reception to the housekeeping staff were friendly and accommodating. I would like to thank Eduardo for his professional and attentive service.  The room was spacious and comfortable.  We will definitely come back again.,50
"From the time we entered till check out, this place just blew our mind. The front desk staff during the check in was so so so friendly, all the fatigue from our journey just vanished. She just made us feel like home, should have noted her name to give a special mention.   Second, the rooms, my god soo sooo good. We came from HK to Macau and having stayed in a small room for the same price, Sheraton room just felt sooo good. The room was modern , decor was outstanding, bathroom so spacious, bed soo comfortable.  The hotel has its own caisno, mall attached.the cotai strip is just outside the hotel.  I will definitely stay here if I visit Macao again and will definitely recommend this to everyone.",50
"Excellent location & excellent hospitality by Sheraton Macau located in cotai area ,on request staff upgraded room for me with cotai view on 21 st floor,casino in hotel in all cotai area.room with breakfast in Ben restaurant but I must suggest they should keep good Indian vegetarian option in breakfast ",50
"Booked  2 rooms ( Club Lounge) and it was an excellent experience! Rooms were nice and with a wonderful view of the strip. We had a great sleep, great food, great room etc... The food was excellent as well and we enjoyed everything! Special thanks and mention to Sanjeb and Carmela for being part of the excellent experience that we had!:-) We will definitely come back to this place again and we encourage others to stay in this place as well! Excellent experience indeed!!!:-))",50
"I arrived around 9 pm, and the queue on check-in was very long. The saving grace was the Russian-looking lady (who, incredibly, knew how to speak Tagalog!!) who did my check-in was gracious and efficient, when my turn came up. Got into my room and was amused to see a plastic baby's bath in my bathroom (Did I really look like a family man, now? hahaha). Turned on the TV and was a bit disappointed at the cable tv offerings (maybe my preferences are just unique - o, no sci-fy channel, no animax) but, kept myself entertained by a pretty good internet connection.",50
"Stayed at tge property for 1 night and the overall experience was ok for a small chain but definately not a par for Sheraton. Had booked a nin-smiking room but by the time i checked in, all non smoking rooms were sold out. The only one available was without a bath tub and the staff at reception were very apologetic about it. However the rooms were not fit enough for a Sheraton branding. Carpets were dirty, no electric kettle or tea bags in the room and no mini bar to go back to in case you feel hungry in the night. The overall staff were very good and express check out ensured you could walk out of the hotel in 2 mins flat. Complimentary pick up  and drip from the hotel was a plus",30
Arrived with my family total 5 pplÔºåwas surprised due to the long queueÔºåspecially thanks to Sasa who really taking care of us and did what she could to full fill my requestÔºå5 Star hotel with great service Will definally come back when I have chance.,50
"The reception is quite busy when I arrived and I was ready to wait in a long line, but I was surprised by a efficient work of staff in FO, Neil, the one who welcome us and got my room in a matter of minutes. I was specially touched by Ms. Erika Mallari in assisting us, gave us a special treat for my mother for mother's day, even though they are busy she took a time to help us take pictures and answer the question we have.   The room is very comfortable. Fast WIFI, clean and have excellent quality. What I like the most is the swimming pool, the view is so relaxing and the staff is very helpful and accommodating, specially Mr. Lester and Paul. Will definitely recommend to stay here and will be back again! ",50

As soon as we came in the hotel from the shuttle bus from taipa we are treated nicely with a smile by the bellman and helped us with our luggages. We are assisted through the spg counter and from there jetrix accomodated us very well and guided us in the in and outs of the hotel. And also the help us by giving us a room upgrade that any family would dream of having my kids is so thrilled to see their rooms that they dont want to go out lol all thanks to the effort and blessing of sir Stefan for approving our room upgrade.

"I visited Sheraton Grand Macau with my family and had read great reviews about the hotel However I found my self a bit disappointed as the services in no way matched the expectations. The hotel overall is big and beautiful. It is well connected with some other 5 star properties like the Venetian and Four seasons. The hotel casino is nice, however I liked the Venetian casino better. The hotel also offers free shuttle services from and to the ferry terminal, though note that the shuttle is also used by the guest of other hotels so it can get really crowded.  Our overall experience however was poor. Firstly we had arrived at the hotel by 3.00 P.M., however they said that my room was not ready which was very surprising for such a big hotel. We were only given a room at 6.45. P.M.‚Ä¶",20
"Ruby Pineda and Cristina of Sheraton Grand Macao were very very helpful and accommodating! All of our questions and inquiries were addressed by them properly. They gave us clear description of our bookings and even grant us on a very perfect room with the parisian view. They serve us with heart, sincerity and most especially with a smile. Great job!!",50
I would like to give a thumbs up to the staff that make the Sheraton a great place to stay..Bellboy AJ always on the go and very helpful also check in Francis Su top service..Also thanks to the staff at Palms Lounge they do a great job with a smile on there face thank you Bella & Sally and staff..The food is also great,50

Had a great experienced in Sheraton Hotel Macau. Erika Mallari in the Reception welcomed us with her warm smile. She was courteous and assisted us to set our luggage to be deliver directly in our room and when we arrived in the room our stuffs already there. She explained to us that we can do the express check out which we did and we save our time. She can also able to provide the information about pool operation time and the Gym. Housekeeping team also able to delivered our request immediately. So far will recommend this hotel to our friends and family for the hospitality of the staff in different department as well as good service.,40
This is our 2nd time to check-in at Sheraton and never did they let us down! Customer service is excellent!! All our request was granted!!! Applause to Wilson Webster and Valerie!!!! Thank you and we will stay here again!,50
The place is awsm.great hospitality.We went there frm hong kong by ferry.It was a 2hour journey and then there is shuttle service at the port for transfer.Sheraton aka Sands(people it sands) was a lovely place with nice ambience.I particularly found the casino better than that of parisian and vanation hotels.The room has handy that you can take out with you during your visit to nearby places for internet services and for call.The place serves one of the best buffet with a large and fresh spread of food.You can walk to most of the places from there like the broadway and the macau convention centre is also near. ,50

"This hotel is absolutely the worst SPG hotel in terms of check in service. As an SPG preferred guest, I have to wait 2 hours to complete the check-in. At least 2 people jump in front of the queue. 2 hours only for check-in to this hotel!   Can you imagine as a SPG guest member, you have to stand on the queue for 2 hour just for checked in. the manager actually feel like is okay without showing any apologize? I recommend you guys book hotel through travel agency not waste your SPG points since make no difference in check-in. SPG member exclusive area was used by everyone without any management.   They not showing any respect and apologize to you expect put a bad fruit cart to your room.  I wish 0 star is an option for review this hotel. Avoid at all.",10
"I've been staying at this property since 2013 when it first opened. As an SPG Platinum Member, I almost always get upgraded to the Executive Suite (a big room that comes with a living room, media room, en-suite bath and view of the Cotai Strip), which makes me come back and stay here all the time. Over the past 6 months or so, I've stayed here 3 times and on each occasion I was told the property was sold out and no upgrade was available. Instead the front desk said that she could get me a standard room with a view, but cannot upgrade the room size. When I got to the room on the 21/F, it was a nasty view of the rooftop and a bunch of pools that no one uses. How is that possible given that the hotel brags about how this is the biggest Sheraton in the world?! The quality of the‚Ä¶",10

"Been to Macau for no less than ten times yet staying at Sheraton Grand Macau this time is one of the most memorable and comfortable stays by far.  Checked in quite late at 7-ish and was greeted by Mr. Ray Lei at the check-in counter. Feeling so much taken care of as he explained everything in detail including the check-out time, dining options, joining the Starwood member, etc.  Was further amazed by the room size, cleanliness and most surprisingly the silk linen!!! I had a sweet night through just because of the impeccable silk sheets, simply love it!  Too lazy to get down and have breakfast the next morning so room service was the only option.

In this suite kid can play Xbox and paint with crayon. If you come to this hotel with your kids , such suite will absolutely a good choice for you to happy your young mates.",50
"I actually have great expectation on the hotel, but my experience speak otherwise.   We have book a room for 4 adults with 2 double bed, on arrival, the hotel inform us that one extra bed will be provided because the double bed is actually not a double bed but a super single. So in order to cater for 4 adults, they supply the extra bed at no extra cost which we very much appreciate it and credit to the hotel, it is very comfortable. And that's all to said about the service.   From the first day we arrived at our room, even though we clearly check in as 4 adults, all the amenities, towel, slipper, bottle water etc only prepared for 2 person. We have to repeatedly call house keeping to provide 2 more set everyday during our stay, which is rather annoying seeing that we always come‚Ä¶",30

I had morning flight to Macau and arrived to hotel before check-in time. Warm thanks to Celin at front desk who kindly arranged room for me! Buffett dinner in the Fiest restaurant is outstanding, restaurant staff is extremely friendly and attendant. Special thanks to Gigi for perfect service! I cannot wait to get back!",50
"First time visit to this 4800 rooms hotel. My stay is comfortable, quiet, and large with all that I need and well cleaned daily. Recommended.  During this period, it is a very crowded with many Chinese tourists. Hence, the environment was pretty noisy and not a dull moment though. There is a also large casino right in the midst and a large shopping mall too. There are many nearby large malls, hotels and casinos within walking distance too.   As I had fully paid for my stay directly to SPG, I was surprised to be asked by the front desk staff upon late check-in to put about an equal amount HK$ 3,000.00 as a deposit. After discussion and insisted that I had no intention to use further hotel services and see no reason for such a deposit, the amount was reduced to HK$ 1000.00. This‚Ä¶",40
I am writing this review to give thanks to Ms Erika Mallari -Guest Service Agent and Mr Jon Yau - Assistant Front Office Manager for making our stay at the Sheraton Macao an enjoyable one. Both of them are helpful and attentive to our needs.,50
They make us feel VIPs with the service they gave us. From check in to attending to our needs their service was excellent. The best thing about our stay was being attended by a fellow Filipino. That made communication very easy. Thanks for making us feel at home Erika. Keep it up. Will definitely book again soon.,50
"We had a great stay at Sheraton last April 27. We arrived in Macau early, but the bell service allowed us to secure and leave our things in the hotel. Checking in is hassle-free thanks to the staff, we forgot to ask his name, who guided us in checking-in. The bellboy, AJ, was especially helpful. He helped us settle our things in the room. Overall, great experience!",50
We checked in at spg family counter with my mother who happens to be disable. Erika Mallari (guest service ambassador proactively offer us a disable room with very nice view of eiffel tower. She even helped us to walk in the lift and ask mr. Teddy the bellman to helo with our luggages as i am with my kids too.Such an overwhelming feeling to make us feel special. Will definitely comeback!,50
"My husband and I together with his family, had a superb stay at Sheraton Hotel. We booked inter-connecting rooms for 2 nights. Meaning, easy for us to bond as a family whenever we please. The staff surprise us with a warmth welcome in our first day, with a complimentary tray of food, a box of chocolate and a card with a Wedding Anniversary Greetings. Very accomodating staff from check-in (Josie) to check out; also fast room service. I highly recommend this hotel to my friends and colleagues. ",50
"Always enjoy my Sheraton affiliated stays. BUT this one at the Sheraton Grand Macao Cotai Central 'dripped in finesse' from the delightfully friendly, knowledgeable and accommodating SPG check-in agent, Jetro, attendance at the fabulous Bruno Mars 24 Magic Concert to the beyond superb buffet breakfast! Now, I plan to shop til I drop at the super convenient attached shopping mall. Thank you for a wonderful 24 hour stay!",50
Well appointed rooms. Given a nice view of the Parisian hotel and tower.   Checkin was pretty chaotic - huge line and people walking all over the place (especially groups...). Luckily I saw there was a SPG counter and only 1 person was being served. However when I got there I waited about 15 minutes to get any service. For some reason there were 2 front office attendants serving the same guest.,30
"One look at this place, and you can be sure to lose yourself in the incomparable luxury that the Sheraton has to offer. Internationally renowned brands are all within minutes away from you room, as the ""The Sands Mall"" is directly below the Sheraton. And if that is not enough, one can easily take the bridgeway connections to the venetian, and the other prime hotels for more shopping and activities.  But what made my stay unforgettable was truly the staff. A first class bellman crew is what the hotel has to offer. We highly commend Brent, Sanjieb, Samuel, Renato & Christian for being fast, friendly and efficient. Moreover, two thumbs up for Jetro, Josie and Wilson for making our check in smooth and making sure requests and concerns were well addressed. Keep up the Exemplar work! ‚Ä¶",50

Moreover, because of them we would definitely want another stay in this hotel.",50
Had been to Macau on 19th Apr with my family. Reached early and was provided by an early check-in by Rechell. She was very courteous and arranged for direct delivery of our luggage as we wanted to visit the Dreamworks Star parade at 1.30pm before going to our room. Got a lovely Eiffel tower facing room in the Sky Tower with twin beds aa requested. Thanks Rechelle for making our stay memorable. ,50

Superb Club Lounge so far in Macau! Nevertheless this will not be good enough without the professionalism of the person that handled us for 3 consecutive nights,Asmitha our server, who always make sure that we feel welcome,and to the manager on duty Mr.Rowell Jason, who always enthusiastic to see us and made sure that we were look after all the time,We were amazed that even it was so busy we still felt very personalized by this two club staff..We will definitely share this to our friends back in singapore and we cant wait to see you all again!!!",50
"Great service, facilities, rooms and Casino - Sheraton is your one-stop shop for everything in Macau and perfect for a weekend break (if like me you are a Hong konger). I was particular impressed by the services, weekends are usually busy and despite being full and booking.com reserving a Twin instead of a King room, Erika at front desk did everything to accommodate all our asks, and took the time to look after us. 10/10 in terms of service! Everything else was great - shopping mall within the hotel if you are not a big fan of gaming and very close to old town to sample Macau finest cuisine. Would definitely stay at the Sheraton again!",50
Spending 2 nights in Cotai and this property located in the Sands Cotai Central. It has 2 building for this property and I stayed in tower 2 which named Earth Tower. The disadvantage for the guest who stayed in this tower was the swimming pool it‚Äôs too far! You have to wear the swimming attire with bathrobe and walk through the ballroom before you reached to the swimming pool. For those who wish to swim it‚Äôs advise to request the room in the main tower which named Sky Tower. Or else you may bring swim suit to the changing room to change. The pool was good and there‚Äôs few individual pool to choose. The room cleanliness was average as the carpet not been vacuum as there‚Äôs still debris found on the carpet at the same spot after the room make up by the room attendant in the Day‚Ä¶,40

We definitely enjoyed spending our trip in macau. It‚Äôs a busy weekend and queue was really long. But  guest service ambassador ERIKA MALLARI help us to check in fast and smooth.

She also give us some tips on how to save time and money to go to historic places in macau.When we get back to our room after a long day of walking she gave us a fruit bowl with personalized message.

From my check-in the staff Jetro is very welcoming and very pleasant, he is very happy to help in answering enquiries I made with smile which is a good start to feel good in our stay. Thanks to Miko for upgrading our room into Family suite. Also, whenever I call for guest services the staff are delightful to give my room request with all smiles.

"We often travel to Macau when ever we get a time off and always like to enjoy different hotel‚Äôs facilities and services. However this time we thought we give a try to Sheraton Grand Macau Hotel and surprisingly it was One the best pleasant experience we had so far in Macau. We arrived at the hotel lobby just before 3 pm via free shuttle Bus from the ferry terminal. We were queuing up in the line for check in and it was quite a long queue. Suddenly a gentleman named( Frank) approached us while we were still in the line and directed us towards the SPG counter service where he instantly granted us the room key and enrolled us to SPG member programme which instantly gave us discount offers in all of their restaurants.

"The location of this hotel is perfect for visiting all of the hotels and casinos on Cotai and the surrounding area, all in walking distance. The executive Deluxe suite is an amazing room, one of the very best that I have stayed in. This also allowed us access to the lounge, which included light snacks and alcoholic drinks between 6pm & 8. The breakfast, which is included, is huge and covers everything you could wish for. My only complaint was that after checking in, we were left to wander aimlessly around the hotel in an attempt to find our room. I was surprised that nobody showed us to the room and it was a first for me. However, a very minor issue and was soon forgotten after enjoying a Macau beer or two.",40
"Really enjoyed our stay! Though the pool is closed because of the cold weather, they still allowed us to use Jacuzzi. The service was excellent, purpose of stay was a birthday party and one of the staff named Josie Bilag even helped us set up the balloons.

"Come for an international meeting for 1000 participant. The hotel is Cotai area , where the new pier is located. A very convenient ride from Hong Kong. I booked a pick up Limo With the hotel.  This is very convenient as the receptionist  came to the pier and took me directly to my room( updraded to a suite at 35 floor ). The room is hugh , separate living and bed room , two bathroom .  Modern , clean . The hotel has 4000 rooms with casinos and only short coming is not many good restaurents.  You need to go to the mall or other hotels close by .  The outdoor pool looks nice and big. , too cold to swim . The convention area is big. , they can hold convention for 10000 easily. Our 1000 attentee did not make the place look busy.  This is not a fancy place , but good for this purpose",40

I have to say the club room experience was fantastic the free drinks and dinner each night was amazing and it was great to have a lovely server called Rowell Jonson who made the effort to make sure we were looked after and talk to us which we really enjoyed. The pool areas were lovely and facilities at the hotel were more than what we needed.  The only thing i would say to improve the hotel would be to have more people greeting you on arrival as when we walked in there were hundreds of people coming from all directions and had no idea were to go and the hallways on the floors smelt smokey.

Staff called front desk but no one picked up, and my wife and two toddlers had to wait like denied morons while other guests with breakfast vouchers were served. I had to raise my voice and showed email confirmation before allowed in  -  Departure time, submitted my luggage ticket and waited in queue but bags did not arrive. At least 7 people behind me got their luggage before me, no explanation and I had to scold people. Eventually...bag came but shuttle bus was gone. We were hand carrying two sleeping toddlers‚Ä¶",10
"We are here staying now. There is no mini bar in the room, rooms are not so clean. On top of it, we left our at 11am & got back at 4pm & our room was not cleaned. When I called customer service they gave me an excuse that we start cleaning after 3pm. Although in the morning I saw their staff cleaning the room. But what a silly excuse that we clean at 3pm. Most people check in by 3pm, rooms are generally cleaned in the morning. Not good experience at all. I recommend staying either in Venetian, Parisian or Galaxy. NOT SHERATON",10
"Sheraton Grand Macao is at par with the prestigious hotels in Cotai, Macau.  I had a little difficulty during check-in since the line was really long. What makes my trip special is the warm treatment of Sheraton staff at Feast during breakfast and housekeeping saying good morning sincerely everyday. The experience is worth every penny.",50
"My first visit to Macau (Cotai Area) and decided on the Sheraton amidst the huge choice of hotels to choose from. Probably the SPG membership and past stays at the other properties helped shaped this decision. Free airport transfer was a breeze that only took a 10mim ride but more signs and which bus to board would be helpful especially for first time guests. Selected the executive suite on the club floor and room was huge with all the amenities but the welcome fruit platter was only served on our first night. Stayed 3 nights there. As the hotel was huge imagine the check in process but thankfully there is a dedicated counter for SPG members. Only upon check out, we were informed that we can do the check in check out process at the club lounge. There should be a process of‚Ä¶",40
"My siblings and I would like express our appreciation for fantastic service provided by your hotel. We booked 4 rooms for a 2 night stay. We find the staff very helpful and really sensitive to our needs. My elder brother, Yong Quek Yuen, had indigestion and Miss Chen Lizhen noticed the amount of medicine he was taking, not only provided extra 2 bottles but also left a note to let know. Yes, she really provided a ‚ÄòWow ‚Äò factor for your hotel. We enjoyed our stay. Thank you. Mrs Chiang Cheng Pun",50
"We stayed st the Sheraton for 6 nights on route back to Australia. It is a very nice hotel with wonderful amenities, but we do recommend you research that yourself as there is not much room information. It is part of the Sands Resorts which includes the Holiday Inn, Conrad, St Regis, Four Seasons, Parisian and Venetian Hotels. It is mirrored on Las Vegas with an Eiffel Tower, Gondolas's and Canals, and various highlights at hotels. And of course nearly every hotel has a casino, and ones I mentioned are connected with walkways, even over the road. We stayed on the 20th floor and had a view of the Eiffel Tower at night with the lights which was lovely. The hotels have very good offers at lunch time particularly including unlimited drinks packs at a low price, but you really have‚Ä¶",50
"First timer to Xin to try the hotpot dinner buffet.  They have a good variety of food, e.g. seafood, sliced meat, veggi, etc.  Thank you Catalina, the Lead Supervisor; she is very caring that our family can sit all together in a table.  Very responsive team in general.  The complimentary drink is a bonus.  If you like hotpot, this is the place you should not miss.  All in all, a very enjoyable dinner!!",40
Nice food and good service at the Bene. We had a very good experience there. Amet provided very professional service to us and we had a very enjoyable time there. Definitely will come to visit again. It is highly recommended.,50
Great hotel. Great views. Awesome gym and pool area. 5 star. No complaints about our stay here. 10/10. Recommended. Food court in hotel shopping centre is great. Would definetly stay here again. Thank you.,50
"The price for of this hotel is relatively cheaper than those surrounding, and SPG member can get extra discount when booking through official site. My stay was less than HKD$1000 for one night stay on weekday.  Two days before check-in, the hotel confirmed the details of my booking, and my request of early check-in and late check-out is accepted.   The room is a typical 4-5 stars room. The room is quite clean but the decoration is a bit aging. The shower has sufficient water pressure.  As a remark, as it‚Äôs my first time to stay in this hotel, I didn‚Äôt realise there‚Äôs the sky tower and earth tower, and I just booked the lowest price. But the sky tower is closer to most facilities incl. the swimming pool and shuttle bus, therefore it‚Äôs worth to pay a little bit more to live in the‚Ä¶",40
"Overall stay at Sheraton Cotai Macau was comfortable except their housekeeping standards had dropped compared to my previous stay 2 years ago. My hubby and I stayed there from 28th to 31st March 2018. Our room were facing the Eiffel Tower, so beautiful, especially in the night when it lighted up.  The bathroom flooring was dirty and you could see black stains on them and vanity top was not properly cleaned either. There were holes on one of the bath towels. There were no bedroom slippers provided until we asked the chambermaid the next day. The coffee pot was not washed upon our check-in. We told the male chambermaid who came to make up our room the next day and he told us to wash it ourselves next time. He said he also do it at the basin in the bathroom. That was a very rude‚Ä¶",40
"If I will visit Macao next time, I will surely choose Sheraton again. I like the environment, and the price was reasonable. Peter Jung arranged this for us, he was very helpful! We need to say thank you.",50
"the hotel hardware is very classic sheraton but the hotel itself is very busy and a bit chaotic.  they have large area and queue posts for checking-in but only several counters opened. staff are not very helpful, they provide info but not helping.  the walk to hotel lifts is quite a walk, and the arrival hall and lift lobby are very dim. tho they have 8 lifts servicing each floor zone but with their vast amount of rooms hence guests.  you always have to squeeze in with many other guests in a lift.  rooms are spacious, sheraton standard but not well-kept.",30
A wonderful experience in the recent stay.  The staff are professional and helpful.  A free room upgrade was offered by the front desk staff.  The room condition is very good.  The only disappointment is the size of the swimming pools.,40
Sheraton Macau  great property one of the finest place in cotai macau.. Huge place .. very confusing .. but lovely big rooms .. great staff working there n very helpful .. 2 nights stay completely worth it .. As Macau is Vegas of Asia .. 37 casino in tat region .. lot to do in there .. enjoyed . Thanks Sheraton for ur lovely Hospitality ,50
"We (family of 4) recently stayed 2 nights at the Sheraton in Macao and loved everything about it.  The staff was super friendly already before our stay there and answered to all mails immediately. Location is great, the pools are super and we liked that there were several different pools. Rooms were as described. If we come back to Macao we will certainly stay there again!",50
"My wife and I decided to spend Easter in Macau and, having such a wonderful experience at the Sheraton Grand Hotel last time, decided to book our stay here again.  Having arrived early (we were able to catch an earlier ferry sailing time), we headed straight to the check-in counter to see whether we could check in at an earlier time. While waiting in line, we noticed one of the reception staff being berated by a guest.  The staff in question conducted himself in a calm and proper fashion and you could see that he was doing his best to assist them, but I guess some guests have that ‚ÄúI want xxx and I want it now!‚Äù attitude.

We stayed at the  Sheraton Grand Macao Hotel in  their Club rooms in early December 2017 for a week to celebrate a birthday. Our room was extremely comfortable and spacious.The Club Lounge was being renovated so Club Lounge amenities were available at the  different hotel restaurants.  Breakfast was in Bene restaurant. The selection of the buffet breakfast was one of the best we have experienced. The staff were friendly & welcoming each morning. Evening food and drinks were served at Xin restaurant. The service we experienced was more than excellent! Special mention to Karina who organised a birthday treat for us at the Feast restaurant. Karina went above and beyond with her customer service. Lester and his crew at Feast were amazing and even sang Happy Birthday!  Each and every‚Ä¶,50
"The hotel is clean, elegant, and spacious with its own casino on the ground floor. Good location with convenient public transportation to main tourist spots. Sheraton Macau has great staff service and we were fortunate to have the staff, Peter Jung, to help us out with our check-in, check-out and other room-related requests. As a first-time visitor in Macau, the staff service at Sheraton definitely made the traveling more enjoyable.",50
"Very satisfied with the services, especially the staffs! Thank you to Jetro and Stephen from the front office :) Our check-in was fast and they‚Äôre very accommodating. When we‚Äôre transferred to our room, Adrian, our bellman was very helpful and very attentive to our luggages.   All was great, we‚Äôll definitely book here again! ",50
I‚Äôd like to give high praise to the front office guys Stephen and Jetro for their excellent service. Also to Adrian for his willingness to assist us during our stay. Overall 10/10 experience. Thank You Sheraton for the wonderful memory!,50
"The Sheraton Macao is unfortunately, not all I hoped. It‚Äôs Himalayan theme is novel and unique, but full of plastic trees, plastic balloon dogs for the kids and the same smell you get in all other Macao casinos. Nothing unusual there.   Check in line was busy at 1:30pm but not a long wait. The lady at the check in didn‚Äôt seem amazingly enthusiastic to see us (but I guess it‚Äôs hard to have a smile 24/7)? When we asked if we could pay for an upgrade to a Club room, the answer was a flat ‚ÄúNo, you cannot. You have to do it when you book.‚Äù No offer of other options or room choices. Obviously they didn‚Äôt want / need our money. Our key cards didn‚Äôt work for the elevator (but did for our room), which was right at the end of a very long soulless corridor that takes 2 mins to walk from‚Ä¶",30
"On previous visits to Macau I have stayed at the Holiday Inn next door. They have the same model layout (a copy and paste of design for all three hotels inclusive of the Conrad) with slightly lower level facilities. Spacious rooms and well thought out power plug positioning and in room facilities. Having booked here for a tad higher in price,  I must say it was definitely worth it. The only regret is I wish I brought my gym gear and swimmers, as their gym and swimming facilities were fantastic. ",50
"Although the rooms of Sheraton Macao are not the most luxurious, but the staff service is the best. It is very important to us I am very glad to meet a name called ""Jamie Kao"" in the Executive lounge, provide us with a lot of services, let us feel very relieved when we arrived, and my wife and I also get unforgettable memories in Macau!",50
"We stayed at Sheraton Grand Macau Cotai for 3nights and really enojoyed it. The hotel shuttles made it easy to get around, and the surrounding shopping centres were exciting sightseeing adventures as well as the local traditional sites. We were keen to try the eatery on the top floor of the Sheraton shopping precinct, but never made it there as meals and drinks package was included and it was an unexpected highlight. The VIP service was wonderful. The cocktail lounge was closed for renovation at the time, so we were redirected to the Feast restarant. We ate numerous meals at the Feast Restaurant - and found the quality of the food excellent and service fabulous. A special mention to the staff there IVY and GIGI.

"My friends and I had a wonderful time at Sheraton and that‚Äôs because for the first time we were treated special by your staff, Jetro Pasamanero. From the moment we checked in up to the last minute, he was there to assist us and checked on us if we need anything.  I personally appreciate his customer service, his going the extra mile to make the guests feel that they are welcome, and his cheerfulness. We were very happy being assisted by Jetro and meeting him. With staff like him, it makes me want to go back and book again which we will do again this coming May. And we hope, Jetro will be there to assist again.  Kudos to Jetro‚Äôs excellent service and impressive hospitality.  Also, The cocktail at the feast was our favorite!! ",50

Our 1 night stay was totally amazing. The view from our room was perfect..it feels like we're in Paris and the staff are so accommodating especially to Mr Jetro in the check in counter. Thank you for assisting us and keep up the good work. Perfect location and smells like home. :),50
"Everything was so good about this hotel, Right from checkin to checkout, location exactly on the opposite side of iconic Venetian Macau. The casino , The Breakfast Spread, Everything was awesome, However the best part was they gave us a phone in each room wherein I can make any no of international /local calls.",50
We really enjoyed our stay! Everything was so convenient and accessible down to shuttle buses around all the hotels in Cotai.

"Sheratons‚Äô custumer service is superb! Way better that other well known hotels in Macau.   Everything is perfect in this place from proximity to airport/seaport until its rooms. With friendly and accomodating staffs, you‚Äôll be treated with warm hospitality.   Their guest service ambassador/s are the key players in this hotel.   We were constantly checked by Jethro, recommending best places and activities during our stay.He basically extended his service beyond required.   Look for him in your next booking.  Overall, Sheraton Grand is simply the best home away from home.  Looking foward to check into this home month.",50
"Stayed here for about 6 days and all I can remember were the people even though the amenities and the bathroom in the Deluxe suite was amazing. Came with my fiance and from the moment we stepped in, a young man called Christian could see we were having trouble finding our reservation and he helped moved our bags to the side and tried to assist. Then there was Jetro who was a real stand out and even though he was supposed to go on break, to take his break, he took the time to personally take the bags up to our room together with us and we got to know a bit about him as well.   The buffets were amazing although after the 4th day you get sick of it. Despite that, the people who bring you in every morning and every night you begin to build a rapport with so I want to say thank you‚Ä¶",40

Turned left from the entrance and a large, well-signed reception area is located. The receptionists were working hard but effectively to get through a decent amount of guests constantly coming by, and yet were always smiling and willing to assist however possible. Swiftly checked in and off to our rooms which were large and very comfortable. USB and power points beside the bed and desk and an amazing view of the Venetian Casino accross the street.

"Absolutely sensational hotel.  This was my 5th trip to Macau since June 2015.  First time staying at Sheraton but will always come back here.  Pickup from ferry was very friendly and seamless.  So was the check in.  We were greeted upon arrival and taken straight up to our room.  I guess one of the perks of booking the hotel car is they communicate back to the hotel.    The rooms are gorgeous and all brand new.  This is the best Sheraton I‚Äôve ever stayed in.  All the products are from Shanghai tang.  The shower pressure is fantastic.  And a wide range of tv channels.    The hotel has 3 major pool sections all with multiple pools.  Cold, heated, jacuzzi, plunge and kids.  Each pool is well supervised and had great drinks and dining service.    The bene restaurant and the feats‚Ä¶",50
We had an excellent and unforgettable stay at Sheraton Grand in Macau because of the outstanding customer service at the front desk agent- ERIKA MALLARI. She started our day by being so helpful from checking-in and getting the room that we want for our mother who is on a wheelchair. She gave us the details and information not just ablout  the hotel but the Cotai area as well. Her smile and sweetness  made my day better after a bad experience on the taxi driver.,40
"During the last few years, I have stayed at the Sheraton Grand Macao Hotel on many occasions. It definitely remains my hotel of choice in Macau!  During the last fortnight, I stayed at this outstanding property on two occasions. The first visit was for four evenings; the second for three evenings. As on previous stays, I was warmly welcomed and personally greeted by highly proficient receptionists. Check-in was quick and efficient, and I was taken promptly taken to my room. Each room was similar; elegantly furnished, very high floor [40th and 41st], most spacious, ultra-comfortable and especially quiet. There is plenty of convenient storage space. All amenities are plentiful and first-class. Views are inviting and spectacular. The Sheraton‚Äôs staff remains highly professional in‚Ä¶",50
As soon as the bell staff saw us they were tripping over each other to help us with our luggage. There was a long line (about 25 people) for check-in but it was cleared up very quickly. The check-in staff was very courteous and helpful and spoke very good English.The check-in staff is very attentive to your needs and tries their best to satisfy your requests. The food in the Club level was very good and of a high quality. You do have to help yourself and pour the batter to make your own waffles. Food is catered to Western and Asian tastes. Fancy coffees are served all day. Check out was fine. Service with a smile is what we got on our entire stay. Very well done Sheraton!,40
"I had an excellent stay in Sheraton at the Sky Tower on the 29th floor. The room we stayed in is very elegant, tidy and beautiful. The bed is very comfortable and we had a very relaxing sleep. The bathroom is also huge and clean. On top of that, we had a breathtaking and spectacular view of the Eiffel Tower which is just right across the hotel. Its delightful to watch the changing color of the tower.  The hotel location is also very convenient because there is a mall beneath it and we can go to many shops and restaurants. Outside the hotel, you can easily go to City of Dreams, The Parisian Macau and Studio City. I will surely go back again here with my family.  ",50
A huge and busy hotel but with fast service and clean rooms. Don't expect a luxurious tranquil environment but expect efficiency and convenience as the complex offers it all. Nothing to complain about and great value for money. Next time will try the Conrad next door though.,40
"I did stay at their hotels few times and their room are really good.  Especially of the bedding, bedclothes......so soft.  Our stays are mostly aim for leisure and for more is gambling (just for fun).  If you do like us I will suggest you for room allocated on their EARTH Tower which is just a few steps to the Casino.  Here are few pictures for their room setting.  To me for the future stays Sheraton is my first choice amongst all Macau hotels.",50
"I have stayed at the Macau Sheraton for more than 50 times (I think) since it's opening. The recent closure of the Sheraton Club has made the stay, especially for Platinum and loyal guests a big nightmare. Checking in and checking out is the worst experience one can ever imagine! The platinum line is always jammed (and I don't think many of them are gold or platinum members) and with one person serving that line, it usually takes up to 30 mins before I was checked in. (I stayed at the Sheraton 3-4 times after the Sheraton Club closed and I keep reminding myself I have to raise a complaint.)  Another big issue is the gym and the changing room. I think the hotel sells outside membership to the gym and hence the changing room is often packed, filthy and dirty. Claiming to be the‚Ä¶",20

Decided to stay at the Sheraton Macau due to its extremely convenient location and the fact that both sides of Macau are accessible from the Sheraton. A member of staff, Stefan Renziehausen, was extremely warm with my family and I. He greeted us politely and enquired about our stay. He also made a noble effort to ensure that we were comfortable and that he was always available if we were to need anything. We were surprised to find a fruit platter awaiting us in our room, as well as a few bottles of premium Macau beer. The room was luxurious and extremely lavish. Adorned with the finest furnishings and tasteful decor. It was definitely a trip to remember. All this couldn‚Äôt have been made possible by the kindness and‚Ä¶",50
We stayed at the executive suite for a couple of nights and had access to club benefits - the room was spacious and comfortable; service everywhere in the hotel was excellent. Location is central and therefore close to many other casinos and hotels so there are loads to see. It‚Äôs hard to pick the ‚Äúbest‚Äù hotel in the area as there are just so many new options popping up frequently but it‚Äôs great value for the price and we had such a pleasant experience at the Sheraton so we‚Äôd definitely be happy to recommend this to our family & friends.,50
"Stayed here for two nights, Sheraton Grand Macao is located along the strip amongst with other Las Vegas named hotels - Conrad, The Venetian, Holiday Inn, and close to other 5-star hotels such as Wynn, Hilton, etc. The place was always crowded with plenty of tourists from the mainland.  The hotel is relatively brand new but the not so high quality of finishing is beginning to show and the corridors smelt of cigarette smoke even on nonsmoking floors.",30

"Great value!! Very happy with my stay!   I have a big family so I booked 1 family suite, 1 Deluxe and 1 Club room for my Macau trip.   Club & Deluxe rooms, both were perfect and very clean. The bed (King size bed) and pillows were perfect. I had a good night sleep! For Club room, there was a complimentary afternoon tea and breakfast.  Note - I stayed one night in the Double bed Deluxe room as they were out of the King size bed for my first night. The double beds were two small Full size bed so probably not for two adult.   Family Suite - It was great because my nieces enjoyed climbing up and down the bunk. However, the room was not originally planned for kids so it wasn't very kid friendly and not really a suite, more like two rooms connecting with one decorated with kid‚Ä¶",50
"A perfect getaway with the family.  Room upgraded to a family suite. Welcome fruit platter  and Macau beers awaited us when we got in. Stefan Renziehausen, greeted us while we were checking in. Warm hospitality and friendly, he welcomed us, walked us to the lift and wished us a pleasant stay.  Temperature in the room was right, the work desk came in handy as both Wife and Son had to do some work on their laptops.  The view of the Eiffel Tower was breathtaking! Although we‚Äôve been to the real one! On our last day, bumped into Stefan again and he asked if everything was fine. Indeed, it was more than fine! A true hotelier who knows how to pamper their guests.  Mark Chang, Chief Concierge, and Aris Azhar chatted with us made suggestions of where to dine and places to visit. Kudos‚Ä¶",50
"The Cotai area of Macau is a bit of a grim wasteland of empty malls, yet another Eiffel Tower clone, and none of the wonderful character that makes Macau special. But luckily you can either stay in your beautiful room at the Sheraton Grand Macau and forget you're here entirely! As SPG Gold, I also got the upgrade to the Executive Suite which is one of the nicest rooms I've stayed in ever. Staff was exceedingly friendly, professional, and accommodating. It's everything a hotel should be. And luckily the real Macau is not so far - just walk 15-20 minutes through the incredibly tacky Venetian hotel to the beautiful Taipa village. It's the perfect escape if you're ever able to leave the Sheraton luxury behind.",50
We dhad team dinner at Bene.  Amy and the crew were so accommodative on our request.  We were served by Amit and hosted by Rich.  They were really friendly and the experience is really wonderful.  We'd love to be back again.,50
"Speaking for myself, I enjoyed my stay without any hesitation to return. Receptionist (Erica Mallari) is so friendly, welcoming, polite and very charming(like meeting new friends and not just encountering hotel staff). She was a great first impression of the hotel. Fortunately, everything about the hotel was exceptional. Room was clean, tidy, stylish and comfortable. I hope to be back for a longer visit in the future..",50
"Haven't been to Macau for little over a year. Visited last week and stayed at the amazing Sheraton again. Thanks to Kevin from the front desk for the upgrade! Awesome view and suite upgrade!

"This is one of the oldest hotels on the Macao Strip, with a great location. Macao city center is about 15 minutes by taxi or courtesy shuttle, the airport and ferry port about 5 minutes each.  Its age is starting to show a bit around the edges (especially the casino, which is very tacky even for Macao standards and definitely inferior to the newer offerings around). Also, the rooms could use an update. Still, they are very good, clean and comfortable. I was upgraded to a standard suite, which was huge, with a comfortable bed, a living room and an enourmous, glamorous bathroom. As always with such huge hotels, all public spaces are very busy and noisy, but that comes with the area and style. The hotel is good enough that I would stay here again out of loyalty to Starwood.

"Located along the casino strip with easy access to the Parisian Macao (mini Eiffel tower) and mall (Cotai Central + Venetian Shoppes canal). Had a family vacation for 1 week in December and had booked a family room.   Accommodation was 'as claimed'. Attention to detail was high. Certainly met expectation with upkeeping and quality. Similar notion on Feast restaurant where we had either breakfast or lunch  daily.   We checked out Studio City, Parisian Macao but Sheraton seems more 'happening'.  There's a centrally managed shuttle service that brings you around the Cotai strip but most of the hotels are within walking distance.   Would return to this hotel if visiting Macau again.",50
"Excellent pool facilities though if you stay at Earth Tower, it is a long walk epecially on swimming suit. Quiet and spacious room, good for weekend get away and staff are helpful with initiative to assist when asked.",40
This is the first time I stayed in Sheraton Macau and was celebrating my mum's birthday.   We had great moments in the hotel and thanks for the warm hospitality.    Would truly recommend Sheraton to my friends!,50
"Hotel is nice as expected from brand Sheraton locality is very much restricted just find hotels & modern replicas nearby, have to take a taxi for other part of Macau, casino is good, restaurant on breakfast time is too much crowded.",40
"My friends and I had a great time during our stay. Special thanks to Jetro, who assissted us during our check in and made sure we has a pleasant stay unti the last day of our stay . Also, our wonderful room staff Sue Mei, who took extra care of our needs even if we never met her ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è thank you :) we will visit again! ",50
"We had a pleasant stay at Sheraton Hotel. From hotel amenities to restaurants and shops. They were all great. The staff were approachable as well. Special thanks to Mr. Jetrix Pasamanero for being so hospitable. Hope to see you again on our future bookings. Look for him guys if you‚Äôre gonna stay at Sheraton Hotel in Cotai, he‚Äôll make sure that you‚Äôll have a comfy stay. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",50
"Excellent deal, low price, Sheraton standards are granted of course. Easy access from jet cotai harbour. Good for weekend.  Usually Macao offers good attractions as musicals, theatre, concerts, etc. For kids, there a good option named SHREKFEST, sharing breakfast with dream works characters ",50
"We had a really good stay at the Sheraton Grand.  The rooms are probably not the best we have had for a 5 star hotel, but the club room and the service certainly made up for it.  Nothing ever seemed to be a hassle for the staff.  Would recommend...",40
"I visit Macau quite often but this time, was out of my expectation in terms of the quality of the stay in Sheraton, Macau.  We stayed at the president suite celebrating my uncle's birthday for two nights. The room was extremely spacious with excellent conditions. Firstly, the wait at check-in counter was efficient by using SPG lane. The service was excellent from bday cake arrangement for my uncle ahead of time, to answering all inquiries, to room service, to a professional front desk services, especially mention Jon Yau. I had some issues with my booking and Jon was able to solve the problems promptly and professionally.  I will definitely  return to Sheraton Macau for my next stay.",50
"I must give my highest compliment to the guest relations team, especially Celine and Josie. I must admit I have a very high expectation on services and I have been staying in Sheraton Macau for more than 5 times now. Every time I would have small incident or complaint like drilling nose above my room, hygienic or someone broke into my room. They must have been done lots of training to improve their standard these recent years. This time my stay was perfect!  I was a bit worried when I received an email saying the hotel club lounge was on renovation, all my club access benefits are scarttered to different restaurants and check in lobby is usually crowded with people from my precious experience. However, this has been well thought and  enjoying their club breakfast at Bene and‚Ä¶",40

We had a memorable stay and happy time in Sheraton, very very appreciate for the impress prefect service!",50
"I stayed there for 1 night Feb 7-8. Impressed by the priority check in arrangement & flexible check out offer, very considerate staffs proactive to offer these services due to my elderly father. Ricky Trinh, our check in ambassador was super helpful & friendly in ensuring our desired room view & late check out, made us feel home. Room was spacious, WiFi was good, well enough amenities, very convenient location to other hotels in same area. Though hotel decor is not up-to-date, worth to revisit due to their friendly staffs!",50
"i would like to thank Jetro and Alrie for helping me for an easy check in yesterday, February 21,2018 and big thanks to the very accommodating staff as well. My family-friend likes the room you gave us and it‚Äôs awesome we can see the great view of parisian! The place is well lit compared to other hotels nearby. We‚Äôve been here a lot when my family and friends come to Macau before. Thank you Sheraton, all the best!",50
"Airport to hotel was a breeze....free shuttle runs every 20minutes.  Super easy check-in using SPG benefits and great room wit view of Venetian Hotel on 21 st floor. Ranks as some of the Best beds and beddings of hotels you will find anywhere.  The slots at all the hotels and casinos are exactly the same.  NOT many choices!  Definitely not like Las Vegas.    The best part of the trip was the Palm bar and Angga the bartender...who makes the best Margarita in China!  Using the right combination of Patron Silver tequila, Cointreau and lime juice.  Perfect!  Buses every 10-15 minutes stop in front and take you to Old Town or the near by old city...for just 3-5 HK $$ each way.  Make sure you have change before jumping on the bus.  The old city had many good restaurants ....to enjoy a‚Ä¶",50
I spent the weekend with my mother on Feb 10 and 11. The check in staff Raphael provided an extraordinary service and made our trip unforgettable. He is the best staff that I have ever met. The hotel is clean and the room is spacious. I recommend this hotel to everyone.  ,50
"We've stayed at Sheraton Macau for more than 5 times. Rooms were average and front desk staff were far from warm, yet the location of the hotel was nice. The shops inside the hotel were great and the Italian restaurants was awesome. Room price was reasonable, compared with other 4 starts hotels in Macau.",40
"The best thing about this hotel was it's very competitive price!  Priced at almost 2,000 HKD lower than its neighbors and offering just as nice rooms and suites, this hotel is an excellent choice for family travelers who don't need all the extravagant bells and whistles.  It is relatively quite compared to the rest of Macau and if you need some loud action, it's just right around the corner as it's interconnected with 3 other hotels that form the Sands Cotai Central system.  The Sheraton is situated at one of the corners with St. Regis, Conrad, & Holiday Inn occupying the other 3 corners.  The Sands Cotai Central mall is relatively average at best but every afternoon there's a Dreamworks All-Star parade which is exactly why we chose this part of the town over other, other than‚Ä¶",40
"The Sheraton Grand Hotel is easily accessible from the airport and well served by ""public transport"".  It is quite large--- and has 4 restaurants and 3 swimming pools-- PLUS a great Spa!!  One can also get an ""Executive Room?suite"" for a small additional cost--- but the benefits are ""more than interesting""!!  One can get free breakfast and lunch... and the free evening ""cocktails"" also include a buffet supper!!  The concierge service is very professional, knowledgeable and helpful.  Sometimes other services are a bit ""spotty"" due to the hotels size and myriad serves offered.  It is also good value since one can often get attractive "" internet deals""...",50
"Had SPG member, tried checking in during peak hour, saw that there was a long queue in the lobby, but was directed to a dedicated booth for SPG member, this is a plus point as it had saved me a lot of time.  Rooms are also nicely designed and spacious, room service was also great, ordered a meal during my entire stay of 6 days as well as made several requests such as replenishing amenities, requesting for additional pillows and all was done promptly and efficiently.  Checkout was also seamless, as there was key-drop system and we can leave thereafter. No paper work required even though had ordered room service.",50
"Dear Sheraton Grand Macao team,   Just wanted to kindly say a sincere thank you for all your kind arrangements for our recent stay with you.  From the gorgeous suite upgrade to the romantic setup and welcome amenities, our stay was nothing less than perfect. Your team has even granted us a late check out on the day of our departure when they rain poured and which was also very thoughtful and considerate.   Thank you again for a fantastic stay and we are already looking forward to our next stay with you. :-)  P.S. Special shout out to Vicky who welcomed us upon arrival with a great smile!",50
Stayed 13-15 February. Booked a suite but heard about their family suite. It‚Äôs basically connecting room for adults and kids. Very nice. Son enjoyed it very much especially the Xbox in the room. Unfortunately the club lounge is under renovation so during the day time we had breakfast at Bene. However the best was the evening cocktail which turns out to be a full dinner buffet. Fantastic. High quality. Room also very good. Service very fast. Whatever we request for came out fast and accurate. All staff very accommodating. We went for a drink after hours. Even those the Bene close to club members they still let us have drinks. All the staff were excellent. Will definitely come again and recommend to anyone. WiFi in the room was also very fast. No faults at all.,50
"Thumbs up to everything from the bus trip from the ferry to the check in procedure. All very polite, efficient, etc etc. Then we got to our room. The first thing I noted was that there was just one towel. It was double room with a King size bed. Why would there be just one towel? Already this inconvenienced us since we were in a hurry to shower and leave for dinner.  I called Guest Services immediately. There was a long message in three different languages about how much they valued our patronage and that the conversation would be recorded, blah blah. I asked for a second towel. The lady very sweetly replied that housekeeping would see to it immediately. Was it recorded? What do they do with the recordings?  Well, Sheraton housekeeping may have seen to it, but they sure did not‚Ä¶",30
"The overall guest experienced is exceptional and beyond compare. The Guest Services Agent, Ms. Josie Bilag was friendly and always helpful. She showed me to my room and explained some facts and features of the Hotel. I do appreciate her call as well on my second night just to offer assistance if I need any. She made me feel safe and comfortable during my stay at Sheraton Macau. She was very welcoming. I want to thank also Ericka Carman for a smooth, friendly and personalized check-in, as well as Jetrix Pasamanero for preparing my room prior to my arrival. The sweet and welcome fruits was lovely! Everyone were so warm and welcoming. Lastly, I would also like to thank the recreation team (forgot their names) who went beyond their call of duty to be helpul. You guys rocks!",50
Amet at Bene delivered exceptional service although he was new to the restaurant. I was feeling a bit under the weather and he offered me a pot of tea with citrus. Very thoughtful. I had a pleasant quick dinner.,50
"I had a good welcome from the front office staffs.Both Carmela and Erika were very friendly and gave the best impression of Sheraton Hotel when i checked in.That lovely and friendly smile really made our day..The room was nice and have a very relaxing view. Overall, its wonderful experience. ;) Thank you ",50
"Stayed for two nights there, check-in was smooth and quick. The staff who helped us was super friendly and gave us a special rate for breakfast which was not covered in our reservation. Hotel room is spacious and clean, the bed is comfy too which is a big plus. Location-wise, it‚Äôs conveniently located in Cotai area. There is a free shuttle bus taking guests to and from Macau airport every 15 minutes or so and it‚Äôs also very easy to walk around the neighborhood as hotels are inter-connected via covered hallway. Definitely would recommend Sheraton if looking for a decent yet reasonably priced 5 star hotel in Macau.",50
"We stayed here for one night (Saturday night).  It was indeed the largest Sheraton in the world with countless rooms.  The line at the lobby reception was a nightmare.  If you are not SPG Gold, not SPG Platinum, not booked in the Executive Floor, you can be guaranteed lots of time in the line.  But to be fair, on a weekday, it is probably better.  Upon check in at the Executive Floor, we were offered an upgrade to a room which probably is the Executive Deluxe Suite I guess.  It was gigantic and I felt like we needed another 4 or 6 guests to utlize it.  There is a spare entertainment room, a spare guest washroom and a large living area as you can see in the pictures.  You definitely won't feel lonely in this hotel with easily thousands of guests staying with you.  But given the‚Ä¶",40
"They don't have any upgrade.  For check in, I showed passport then need wait 30min until receive room key.  For drinking they don't have good lounge now also 1F tea space charged me 100%, ask asked AMEX SPG discount they don't know how work.  Just sleep here is ok because not expensive.  Room is clean, Bed is good.  But if want enjoy and have good feeling from hotel, you have more choices in here.  I had many experience with SPG but this time is most unhappy time in my SPG life.  Never come back here.",20

"We stayed in Sheraton the fourth week of Jan'18.I liked the hotel and its location, It is right opp Venetian Hotel and with a sky walk access.This place is very lively with Casinos and evening shows. Don't miss the Monkey King show played in Sheraton.  A free bee is that there is a smart phone available in the room to make unlimited free international calls, simply loved it and no hassle of busying a sim and running for currency recharge. Breakfast spread is ultimate,I'm glad that I chose this place. Thank you staff for providing a wonderful stay. Thank you Sheraton!",50
"We had pre-booked by a 3rd party, and so we were not ""eligible"" for the SPG check-in process. But, when I showed by card, they still allowed us to use the service, and get checked in faster. We had a high floor which was at the end of the hall to decrease noise, but still had a nice view of the Eiffel tower and Studio City casino. They had a really super buffet, which you could enjoy as either a breakfast or a lunch. Thus, if you slept in, you didn't have to race to get the meal. The rooms are large, with king beds and several plugs, which is more than can be said for most places nowadays. They had a minibar, that you could actually put your own things in. There was a great coffee service (French Press style), an in room safe, and a nice desk. Alas, only one seat. The‚Ä¶",50

He was  in constant communication wirh me in email, making sure my stay is a worthy experience from check-in to check-out.  Mr. Raphael, check-in officer at SPG elite check-in counter assisted me and my wife with early check-in accommodation and offered much more more extras beyond our expectations to make us feel very welcome at your mega prestigious hotel. Raphael is very professional, accommodating and helpful.  In my books, Alrie & Josie and Raphael are all confidently competent and customer service satisfaction focused. My sincere appreciation to their usual guests support.  üëçüèªüëçüèªTwo thumbs up to your team and amazing hotel!   Proudly new SPG member.  ",50
"I spent a weekend at Sheraton. Room is very spacious and the bathroom is fabulous. Our room is overlooking the ""Effiel Tower"" and Studio City which is good too. But we are disappointed by its lift. We would like to check out in the morning but all lifts did not stop at our level and down to the ground floor. We waited for 10 minutes. When we were planning to ask for the assistance from housekeeper, the lift finally stopped at our floor. I understand that Sheraton is very huge with like over 1000 rooms, but it's not an excuse to let customers waiting for so long.",40
"If you want to stay in a 3 star feeling US style hotel - then this is the one.  The redeeming features are the parts that make it 5 star, a very large and well equipped gym and heated pool.  Room service was prompt to deliver and some of the staff were enthusiastic, which cheers you up,  Staff in the cavernous corridors on route the the spa somewhat more sombre. Expect big crowds of people.",30
"The Hotel is on perfect location closed to other hotels, shopping malls, restaurants and casinos. We booked a deluxe room however the staff is very generous to upgrade us to a bigger room upon knowing that I am travelling with kids and the rest of the family. He even took time to notify us of details for our hotel reservation and informed that he was away during our check-in and endorsed us to a very helpful, accommodating and  professional hotel staff which again upgraded our room to one of their top of the line suites.  Thank you so much Mr. Alrie Rocamora.  The room was big, we feel like at home and the amenities were clean. I love the whole thing about our room.   I will be staying again here the next time I visit Macau  and definitely recommend to friends:)",50
"I‚Äôve been traveling with friends, family, partner and for business. As i can say this place will be best for all types of travelers... nice view. Very accommodating ambiance and attentive staffs...what i like most is their attention to details.. special thanks to Ruby who did my check in and always had this beautiful smile on her face..will surely recommend this Hotel to all my colleagues and friends who loves to travel alot...thank you for taking care of us during our stay..",50
"First of all my heartful thanks goes to Mr. Tilak Basnet from Nepal a Housekeeping staff who served us very warmly during our stay in Sheraton.The room was very spacious.My kids made the room so mess but our room attend Tilak changes the bed sheet, amenities and toiletries everyday and gives the room looks so fresh like ready to check in again. He is very kind and smart staff with fluent in english ~ after a few mins conversation with him i came to know that he really have very good knowledge of hospitality, as i am also of same stream.The way he communicate with me was very professional.

"The Hotel is on perfect location at Cotai Strip close to other hotels, shopping malls, restaurants and casinos. We booked a deluxe room with Cotai view. Unfortunately this room was not available, so we got upgraded to a suite without direct view to Cotai strip (but we could see it from the side). When we entered the room, there was a strong smell of cigarette smoke. As we didn‚Äôt like this we asked for another room, which we got. The staff in the whole hotel including restaurants is extraordinary. From cleaning-, reception-, porter and service-staff to the customer manager everybody treated us like kings. ",50
Very bad service at thin‚ÄùSheraton‚Äù . They don‚Äôt speak English! Go to st Regis! We stay there in two rooms and really was the worst experience we ever had in a hotel. Bad bad bad bad bad service! Or not service at all.,10
"When I checked in, I arranged for an earlier checkout than originally planned for the trip. I was told that it is fine and I will not be charged extra. Today when I was checking out, the staff was so confused. I was first told that the Travel Agent that booked the room will pay for the room, so they can't reduce the extra nights and I will have to speak to my Travel Agent, so I queried if that was the case, why did they need my credit card for payment? Then their story changed completely and I was told I still need to pay for all the nights because I am checking out early. So even with pre arranging it, it wasn't worth anything. So best is to avoid this hotel unless you are willing to waste your money. As a traveler for an international company, we use Sheraton around the world.‚Ä¶",10
Shuttle bus from Taipa to the hotel is available. Check in / out not flexible. Room is spacious but neither well-maintained nor any special.  Amenities was not attractive at all. Breakfast buffet was the best among odds.,30
Very nice big room in Cotai side of Macau. Conveniently located with many casinos and restaurants within the building and next doors. Close to famous nightlife club (Cubic Club) across the street. Venecian casino located across the street as well.,50
"This is the first time my wife and I visited Macao. We stayed at Sheraton Grand Macao Hotel, Cotai Central. We wished to thank Mr Stefan Renziehausen for the hospitality extended to us during the period of our stay. The service provided by the Front Office Staffs were excellent. Having a dinner at Feast Restaurant served by Miss Genevie Abuel was also awesome. This has enhanced our affirmation of the excellent service provided by Sheraton Grand Macao Hotel.",50
"I've stayed here at least a half dozen times.  We always come as our large family for a short 2-3 night stay.  The hotel has always consistently been excellent, they always provide us platinum guests with excellent service, and an amazing and huge club lounge with excellent breakfast and dinner.  The service is always smooth and every stay is always a pleasure. When in Macau we always stay here at the Sheraton.  I reccomend it definitely for anyone travelling with family.",50
"I went because I have got a good deal for Christmas. I still can book the room on Dec 3rd, and use points to exchange. The experience was that you have to search each day between Dec 21-Jan 2nd to find yourself a good deal if you want to take a short trip to Macau during Christmas. Last Christmas holidays. I had a 3 day 2 nite from Dec 26-28th, 2016.   Room is clean and service is good as always but the place has just started to get old. The shower area will need to do some maintenance.   Watch out, please book a family room if you have 2 kids who need 2 beds because this Sheraton only has 1 king and 2 twin beds in single room. Family room would be much better because it is compromised of 2 connected rooms and more room for kids to hang out.  ",40
"Beginning of this month we stay in this hotel for family trip to macau.The room been assigned to us was facing to the most beautiful view which facing to the cotai area and direct facing to Parisian tower.It gave us a very comfortable stay as whenever you look outside, the great view will make you relax.  It convenience as it attached in the Sand Cotai complex and there's is a link bridge to Venetian and Parisian.Few minutes walk to City of Dream for the House of Dancing Water show.  The Manager Jon gave us a lot of information about macau and which lead us feel the authentic of Macau.  We will definitely come back again.",50
Arrival experience was good. We taking complimentary shuttle bus from ferry terminal to hotel. Reached hotel after 10 minutes or less. Staffs were attentive. I was about to walk to normal check in counter but maybe one of the staff noticed that the queue there is Long therefore he direct me to check in at SPG corner. Assisted by Andrews. He was helpful and friendly. Check in experience was great and efficient. Room was spacious with 2 Super single bed. Each bed for one adult one child or two small size adults. Bathroom spacious and well equipped as well. Water pressure excellent especially after a Long day tour. Housekeeping staff did a great job. Not remember her name but surname should be Huang.

"Decided to try Sheraton Macao for one night during my recent trip to Macau due to the hike in room rates at my usual Conrad Macao.   This may be the biggest Sheraton hotel in the world, but it is definitely not the best. Nonetheless, it was still comfortable for a short stay.  The room was not as big as that of the Venetian or Conrad and there is insufficient sitting area. The deco was a little rundown too but it is quite understandable due to the high occupancy rate.  However, it has one of the best views, almost directly facing the Eiffel Tower of The Parisian, so one can watch the light show for free, in the comfort of the room.",40
"Stayed here for a company conference, about 1,000 of us. Apparently the largest hotel in macau with 4,000 rooms  I only got my key at 6pm, not great  ""Forest"" theme in the lobby and there's an ok shopping mall attached. Part of the giant cotai development, and linked to st regis, conrad, holiday inn, 4 seasons and sands  Got a suite so the room was fine. Showing its age a little. Overlooking the Parisian, with the gaudy multi coloured ""eiffle tower""  Gym is medium sized, with an ok locker/sauna area  ",30
"Running a large establishment like this will inevitably have it's ups and downs. However, the Sheraton never ceases to amaze me! My key stopped working during my stay and the staff, especially Wendy Lu, was quick to get me in the room and have replacement keys sent up. No matter how busy they are, from check-in with Cherry and throughout the stay,  every staff member that we have interacted with helps makes  each stay enjoyable. Thanks for the great work and we look forward to coming back again.",50
"The hotel is beautiful, perfect location and I found it to be the only affordable option in the area. But it was way too crowded! May be because of the same reason the staff was not able to attend well during the check-in and check out process as well. There are multiple elevator banks, the least that could be done is to have someone guide after check in, which one is to be used!",30
This hotel was average when comparing it to others in Hong Kong and the standard of them. The room was spacious however when you walked in it didn‚Äôt seem like it was immaculately clean like others in Hong Kong. The buffet breakfast was very average there aren‚Äôt many breakfast options and the quality wasn‚Äôt the best. The staff are all helpful and polite. ,30
"We visit this hotel for the family vacation, Dec 2017. It was so crowded and many guest was, but some of this hotel‚Äôs colleague was so helpful and friendly to us, so me and my family feel so happy and keep cool.  First the colleague of guestservice, Mr.Chris Sun was so nice service providing when we checkingin, and also follow up other request.

"I have been to this hotel multiple times, and this becomes our default choice.  We recently went for a family holiday and stay here for 2 nights. The room is clean, and the location is perfect for us.  This hotel has added a new device called ""handy"" (hopefully I remember it correctly). This is an android mobile phone which I can take and use when I travel in Macau. It has basic internet connection. (What I need is google map and some simple search). This is a simple, but great added benefit of staying in this hotel.  The mall that this hotel is connected to has some great restaurants. It also has a shuttle bus system between the hotel and the ferry terminal and some other places.",50
"Wonderful hotel and at a very reasonable price considering the location! Beautiful, big room and bathroom and the reception was kind enough to offer us a late checking at no charge. Breakfast was provided by a restaurant in the shopping complex which was delicious. Definitely recommended!!!",50
"Was in southern China for business and needed a place to hide away from the boredom and factories of southern China. Took a ferry ride here and it was simple and easy. The hotel has free shuttle from/to ferry station which was excellent and much easier than Taxi. The hotel is pretty new and very clean compare to other ones in southern China. It was very comfortable room to stay in and relax. Highly recommended. The SPG member benefit is also great here even though the lounge is under renovation, the hotel tried to make it up by letting you visit the buffet restaurants. Morning breakfast was OK and the dinner was like a true Vegas buffet. I was amazed by it. Again, highly recommend it. I would choose to return here if I get a chance in the future without a heartbeat. Great job!!",50

We were told that the new club facilities are going to be magnificent when finished.  Really, I'm not going to be around so didn't want to be told this at check in.  The alternative arrangements were not well explained and left us confused, we needed more information and assurance.  The rooms are ok and ours was at the end of an extremely long corridor that overlooked air-conditioners of a building, not great.  After working out there were 2 rooms we needed to use as our club room , one for breakfast, one for evening drinks we were then shocked at‚Ä¶",30
"Visited this hotel with my girl friend during her birthday, the hotel is very nice with quality service. They also arranged a great gift for my girl friend which was a box of tasty cookies, a great surprise for both of us :) View from the room was also very nice, strongly recommend for a short weekend trip!

"Had a memorable stay at the Sky Tower.  A very spacious room with comfortable king bed and huge bathroom.  Fantastic hotel  link to Conrad, Holiday Inn and Venetian.  Lots of shops, restaurants and one food court Koufu.  Free shuttle bus to and fro to both   ferry terminal to  hotel. ",40
"I have visited with my family. ERIKA MALLARI in check in desk, was very kind and explained detailed. She explained trip information with drawing maps. Thank you for your kindness & best service, ERIKA MALLARI.",50
"I really like this place.  To start though, needs to be appreciated that this is a hotel on the Macau strip, so all the hustle and bustle you would associate with a casino type hotel you find here, so come prepared.  That aside, really did have a great experience, and would certainly come back.  Due to SPG status, an upgrade was given to a wonderful room, without any drama.  A fantastic room, without going into detail, and one of the top rooms I have stayed in at an SPG property.  The lounge being renovated was a concern, but that was more than made up for how the breakfast and cocktail / snacks were accommodated‚Ä¶well more than made up for.  A great staff, extremely warm and welcoming with anyone I had contact with.  A great breakfast buffet with plenty of options, geared‚Ä¶",50
The Sheraton is centrally located on the strip and the hotel provides various modes of transport to get to the old town on the Macau side. The front desk staff and the bellmen (particularly Alexis Apo) were always welcoming and willing to provide us with any information we may have needed! Overall lovely stay for the price point!,40
"A luxurious comfortable hotel accessible through FREE shuttle bus from airport or port. Provide spacious and clean modern rooms. The hotel with huge swimming pool with view of the Eiffel Tower.  It has lots of shopping boutique and restaurant inside.  If you avail of room with breakfast, you will experience the luxurious buffet breakfast at the Feast located also inside the Sheraton Hotel. Access to different tourist spot is easy and FREE provided you ride the Shuttle Buses sponsored by different Casino Hotels in Macau.",50
"It is located on the cotai strip right beside the Sands Cotai Central Hotel. It consits of two 20 floor towers. Our room was on the 12th floor. The view from our room window was ""The Venetian Macao"". The Room service is great and apt. This hotel is walking distant from all the main attractions of the Cotai Strip like the Parisian, the Venetian. You will feel like you are staying in Las Vegas of USA. The hotel houses a huge Casino too where you can gamble like there is no tomorrow. The lobby is adorned with huge water falls and installations. The building also houses stores of various European Luxury brands. Stage shows are organised on all weekends. Food Court is available nearby which offers various kinds of cuisines at moderate prices.",50
"My husband and I had a very wonderful stay at the Sheraton Grand Macao! Upon check in, we were told that our room was upgraded to De Luxe Cotai room. Pulling back the curtains gave us a magnificent view of Cotai Strip especially at night! I'd like to commend Ms. Erica Mallari at the Front Desk. She was very helpful, allowed us to check in early (as this was included in my email prior to arrival in Macao) as well as late check out. She explained a lot of things in detail (like what transport to use, directions, meals/restos, express check out, etc.) that made our stay and tour of Macao very pleasant.  Sheraton gave a lot of freebies like eco bag, entry pass to Planet J, a voucher for an almond cake (which we were unable to get in Taipa), and complimentary ferry ride for 2 pax‚Ä¶",50

Fast check in & check out. I chose Sheraton every time i went to Macao. Good customer service and respond. I will choose Sheraton again. It is good price for such high class hotel. I will recommend to all my families and friends.,50
"It is located on cotai strip after the Sands Cotai Central Shoppes. There is a convenient shuttle bus from the Taipa ferry terminal. Due to SPG gold we got upgraded to a larger room with 2 double beds. The hotel has 2 towers and has a casino floor on the ground floor. It is connected conveniently to Sands shoppes which you can then take the covered bridge to the Venetian, Parisian, Four Seasons. Alternatively you can walk the pavements to crossover to Studiocity. The service in the hotel is top notch. There is SPG check in counters and check in counters for families too. The rooms are large with nice bay windows and I had a good view of the tower at Parisian as well as Studiocity. Turnover service was excellent as we requested for extra towels and bath amenities for the kids and‚Ä¶",50
"We had a great time in Sheraton Macau, the hotel is huge but it has dedicated check-in and check-out desks for SPG Elite members so the check-in and check-out processes were seamless and fast.  The Club lounge is under renovation at the moment but they have alternative venues that can be used - we really enjoyed our cocktails and drinks this time!!  The hotel is connected to the Sands Cotai Central mall so there a lot of options for dining and shopping. This mall is also connected to Venetian and Parisian so you really don't need to go outside for all the fun and shopping (which we really appreciated as it was rainy while we where there)  Many thanks to Peter J and Aris who helped make this trip really fantastic!",50
"Stay at Sheraton Cotai on Jan. 6th. Majority of the Hotel's frontier staffs are new faces Services of standard are good with no doubtfulness Great help and care rendered specially our Friends Mr Stefan and Mr Giulian Our daughter and her fellows really enjoying at Feast Despite it was a miniature Birthday celebration, but staffs at Feast shown warm blessings and they created a enjoyable moments with joyful atmosphere too Our kid likewise their friends were impressed such schedule,Of course they do appreciated for that celebration surprisingly scheduled by Giuliani, Allen  Geneva, Adda, Jade and Abby as well I sincere to take this opportunity to express our thankfulness to Sheraton staffs inclusion but not limited to gentlemen Stefan and Giulian  Spg Platinum member Garry Cheung",50
"We arrived to be told that the club lounge was under renovation and alternate venues were being used.  We were initially disappointed that we were not advised at the time of booking, however the alternate venue certainly made up for this. For pre dinner drinks we were also offered a full buffet dinner with no additional cost. The buffet was one of the best I have ever had and included lobster, western and Asian food.  The hotel itself is huge, in a good location and very comfortable.  ",40
Stayed at the Sheraton Grand Macao hotel for a conference for 1 week. Although the check in experience was slow and unnecessarily slow the rooms were well featured and large. The conference facilities were excellent and easily accessible. Other casinos were busier than this one but if your main purpose is to host a conference with above standard accommodation then I would recommend this hotel.,40
"SPG showcases some of their best service here. Mr. Wilson Webster took care of my check in smoothly and efficiently. Will definitely be back to stay here due to quality service.  It is an extremely busy Friday where all rooms are quite full. Due to some extra demands and difference in headcounts of visitors, we needed extra accommodation. It was handled well, given the best solution during such a busy night, and we ended up getting exactly what we wanted.   Thanks! ",50

"Very nice hotel with big, clean, well appointed rooms. Excellent customer service. Special mention goes to Josie Bilag of the Guest Relations Team who made the check-in process very quick and easy. She also sent personalized handwritten cards with our SPG membership cards enclosed  with fruit platters to each of us (4 rooms)! Location is perfect with the Sands Cottai Shops right below the hotel plus a bridgeway to the Venetian hotel and shops. Check-out process was very fast and convenient with the SPG lounge. This is our favorite hotel in Macau. The outstanding customer service provided by Josie and her team give Sheraton a good name!",50
"Awesome experience them, Ricky T. Upgraded us to a suite and considering we have three ppl added another free dinner and breakfast.   Really convenient given it's connected to the other hotels and shopping malls. Free shuttles are available to/from Port / airport as well as the touristy sites.   Would def. Come again! ",50
"stayed in Sheraton Macau for 3 days .... great hotel ambience and excellent rooms ... bathroom included a tub !!! all in all very neat and fantastic room experience ... check in was a extended event though , I guess it was due to the new year rush ..but I guess hotels do keep such things in mind don't they ?  All the hotels are interconnected i.e Venetian , Parisian , Holiday inn , Sheraton and it is a maze of interconnected walkways and shops...  room service is ok although we tried it only once ....the morning buffer breakfast at Feast was mind blowing ... fantastic number of choices for every palate... excellent ...  hotel has a in house casino as well as all other amenities a 5 star hotel would have... all in all a good and pleasant stay in the centre of Macau happening spot‚Ä¶",40
"It has always been my 1st choice when Staying in Macau.  Not only I‚Äôm a SPG member but also they provide very good services.  Mr. Wilson Webster at the check-in counter was very helpful.  He was polite, acknowledgeable and able to complete my check-in (free upgrade) within like 4 mins.  Again, thank you very much Wilson for your help, good job ...... keep it up!",50
"Dinner with friends at Feast restaurant was a ‚Äúwow‚Äù. We came for the promotional weekend they had. The Buffet offered an international cuisine and delicious desserts. Our evening was filled with hot served seafood, of course laughter. I couldn‚Äôt forget the professional and friendly staff during that night who delivered a truly heartfelt service. Welcoming smile from Eleen and Genevie at their entrance. Server name was Ivy Canoza who was energetic and full of life. Mr Lester and Amber was keen on checking on us and other guests too that I truly appreciate their gestures. There were other people whose names I can‚Äôt barely remember. Took time to finally give a review but here it is. Thanks guys !",50
"This is an amazing hotel right in the centre of Macau. Check in was very quick and easy and we were brought quickly up to our room which had an amazing view of the ‚ÄòEiffel Tour‚Äô due to an upgrade on our arrival by some very friendly staff.  It has every amenity you could ever need. My personal favourite was the outdoor pool with heated pools, Jacuzzi and waterfalls. The room was about a ‚Ç¨100 per night, cheaper than most of the hotels in the area. We didn‚Äôt plan to leave until four that day even though checkout was earlier. They were so accommodating. They minded our bags and even let us use the pool until we were ready to leave.  When we did eventually did decide to head back to Hong Kong there was a free shuttle service which brought us straight to the ferry port. We weren‚Äôt‚Ä¶",40

"There's free shuttle bus from the ferry terminal to the hotel. The hotel was grand and the room was big. The room view was fantastic. We can see Venetian Hotel. All the hotels were connected with lots of shopping. The location is great. We can walk from one hotel to another via the shopping gallery. The hotel is very packed, thus must booked in advance especially during the weekends. One minor feedback, some pieces of pomelo were found on the floor near the window.",40

My check in person was named Leon was excellent He greeted and communicated great then  gave me information about the area and while checking me in quickly  A great start to a great 2 night stay in a nice size suite. High floor great view plenty of fresh new towels and nice linens made my resting and relaxing perfect .Which was my main purpose of the trip. The buffet breakfast was was fresh with plenty options to choose from. The property itself was not one of the newer hotels in the area, and needed some electrical upgrades in the living room for cell phone charging‚Ä¶",50
I just love it. I mean the 4 nights in sky tower of Sheraton. Would expect to try out earth tower next time. Room on 41st floor is super and very private. Food in room service is quick n great quality. Casino floor is very near for access and success:). Food court on the top floor of mall is always great right next to toy store cool for my kids. Palm cafe right next to entrance is also my daily schedule of visit for the sake of their freshly made all kinds of food. My kids love it in Sheraton and my wife sort of got used to stay in Sheraton if come to Macao.,50
"First time staying at a Sheraton Hotel and I must say it was just ok. Room was spacious and clean, although some of the furniture were a little damaged by previous guests.  Big down point is that the mini fridge was empty (like in most Chinese hotels). The electric kettle was nasty dirty.. couldn't even fix a tea. The bathrobes in our wardrobe had holes!  I was expecting a 5 stars standard service that was not delivered.",30
"Loved the all about property, breakfast room does a wonderful service. Lots of option for Indian vegetarian food as well.  Nice shuttle survive. Connected to multiple hotels and shopping centre.   Wonderful staff! ",50
"First time stay with Sheraton Macau, it was a good and comfortable stay. Located among the many well known hotels and strategic location.  Convenient to go for meals as the location offers a variety of food. If you want a free transport to the Macau city, conveniently take the shuttle bus from City of Dreams which is located next to the hotel.",40
The room was quite spacious with 2 full size beds. It looks more like a boutique hotel rather than a luxury one. Easy acces via the connecting bridge  to other hotel such as the four seasons and the venetian. Might be a bit stingy on the extra pillow as we asked for 4 but they insist on only giving us 2. Call the housekeeping for more free bottled waters as they only gave you 2 tiny bottles per day in room. This hotel has a free in room wifi which is a big plus.,40
"Have always wanted to try their family suite. Stayed for two nights with our two kids and they loved their room with kids furnitures and amenities. Overall the service provided was excellent but the hardware is just average compared to other similar Macau hotels (hence the overall 4 star rating).   Some improvements we would like to see before staying there again:  - Better air circulation in the rooms esp in the dry weather (they did provide a humidifier upon request) - Non-glass cups for the kids room  - Get rid of the strong perfumes/ air freshener used at corridors, lifts and lobby  - More variety/ updated games in the kids room  - some scheduled kids activities would be nice (esp when the pools are closed)   ",40
"I was booked for 2 nights at the Sheraton Grand Macau.  Arrived at the hotel via the hotel shuttle and was welcomed by the courteous staff.  Check in was fast .  Assisting us to the room was  AJ Asaytono , who was hospitable and patient to our endless questions about the city.  It was not our first time in Macau but first time to stay in the Cotai strip.  We asked directions to Old Taipa and to Fisherman's wharf.   He assisted us on how to use the handyphone.  My family and I were as pleased with the hotel .  It has great location, connecting to Venetian, Parisian. Food assortment within the hotel vicinity was good.  Bakeshop, Mc Donalds, Chinese food.  The room was spacious with great view.   All 4 of us comfortably slept well and enjoyed room wifi.  We will definitely go back.",50
"Every stay at Sheraton Grand Macao hotel has always been a memorable one. Our recent stay on 27th  December is no exception. The room is big and very clean. All the amenities are available. We enjoyed work out in the gym, swim in the heated pool and a relax sauna. Using their recently introduced mobile check in and check out makes both process very efficient despite of this busy Christmas time. We enjoyed the buffet lunch at the Feast. Although it is a huge hotel,  all the staffs provide professional services and importantly, with smile on their faces. Any requests is no more than a phone call away. My special thanks go to Mr. Jon Yau who takes care of our reservation with prompt email response. This hotel has strong recognition of the SPG member.  So join their program before‚Ä¶",50
"The hotel provides a shuttle bus from the ferry terminals direct to the hotel which is very convenient. Check in could be quite a wait as there were approximately 300 people checking in when we arrived, however, our travelling companions had a VIP card and we sped through using the Priority Check in. The room was very good as was the bathroom. Our room overlooked the dancing fountains and the Eiffel Tower. Breakfast served a good variety of Chinese and Western food and was excellent, some of the food being freshly prepared. Service was very good with plenty of staff on hand. **Best to do a reccy as it took us a while to find, this is such a big sprawling hotel.

First time here Sheraton Grand Macao hotel feast Resturant.  We had the Christmas Day buffet.  It was great with variety of food.  The seafood was fresh and good variety.  Lobster was delicious and fresh.  Oyster was fresh great and crab was good.    The service was very good.  I would rate this as one of the best buffet in Macau.  ,50

Next time i surely choose Sheraton again in my Macao trip.",50
Very appreciated to staff service and attitude; they are professional and kind. The room is very large and clean and the view is awesome as it‚Äôs face to Parisian Tower. Definitely we will come back again.,50
"It‚Äôs our first time staying in Sheraton Grand, Macau.  We encountered some difficulties when checking-in.  Special credits to Mr. Jon Yau and Ms. Eva Yu for their great services and for solving our problems professionally!  Our stay in Sheraton Grand was very great! The rooms are clean and spacious.  Breakfast was yummy with loads of choices.  Location is convenient!  We will surely visit again :) ",50
"SPG checking was  very courteous, the bell service most efficient, the only setback was that because of the Christmas holidays all restaurants served buffet style. I would have loved to dine at Bene or Fiesta. However, in-room dining proved to be an excellent alternative: great food and punctual service",50

the room is large enough to have 2 twin beds with ample sitting space. bath rooms are decently spacious with bath tubs and separate shower area. access to room is through high speed lifts which needs room keys to access.,40
We went hotel-hopping to celebrate the 2nd birthday of our youngest in Macao.  First stop was Sheraton and we had such a lovely experience.    We emailed them about the celebration and they find ways to surprise our baby.  There were balloons scattered in the room as it was his favourite.  There‚Äôs also sweet treats and a personalized picture frame.    Buffet breakfast has good spread and taste nice.    What  a wonderful stay!    The staff were amazingly well-trained and courteous!    We will definitely come back to this hotel once we set foot again in Macao.  ,50
"Absolutely lovely hotel in the middle of many other hotels.  Took the ferry from Hong Kong airport directly to Cotai Island - fast and efficient - once there, a free shuttle brought us to the hotel.  We attended a conference - check in and out was on the conference floor but very efficient.  Definitely recommend the Sheraton Grand Macao for business or holiday destination.",50
"Great central location. Free shuttle from Macau ferry terminal. Large hotel with lots of restaurants, shopping and a casino on premises.  Also a theater with live stage shows.  Close to other bars, casinos. 15 minute walk to the Hard Rock Cafe. Check-in line can be very long due to the large number of rooms.",40
"Very much unlike many hotels I have stayed in. The room was comfortable and very clean, but it doesn't really have the feeling of a hotel. More a shopping mall and Casino with rooms - so don't expect a foyer and seating area, for example.  The best tip I can give is to join the 'Starwood Preferred Guest' scheme before you arrive, that way you can bypass the truly huge queues for check-in and go to a separate area (also means you can check in earlier. Because of the numbers of people checking out in the morning, they otherwise make you wait until after 3 - I arrived off a flight that got in at 10 and there was nowhere really to wait otherwise. Also, if you have left credit-card details and haven't used the mini-bar then you can go for an express checkout that way as well).",40

I couldn‚Äôt check-in early because of sudden meetings that I have to attend to so I called-up Sheraton to advise them that I will be checking-in later than what I‚Äôve indicated in my booking...Alrie offered to pre-check-in me and advised me to just approach the counter for my deposit and passport copy upon my arrival. True enough, it was a smooth checking-in when I came. He was very proactive in asking if there will be any celebration that brought me to stay in Sheraton and I told him that it‚Äôll be my farewell party with friends...to my surprise, I was placed in a Deluxe Suite! ü§©ü§©ü§© supeeer pretty room with a kitchenette‚Ä¶",50
"The shuttle bus dropped us at the entrance close to the mall despite us telling him that we are not here for gambling but to check in to the hotel. There is no bell boy to help us carry the luggage at the mall entrance, so we ended up carrying our own luggage and my 2 year old daughter and walk all the way from the mall to the hotel. Not happy.",10
"We planned this trip sometime ago so the wife and her nutty sisters could see the show next door. A last minute addition had me pondering what was more important - getting an additional place for the show,the return ferry or hotel accommodation. In the end, the ferry and the accommodation won. Upon arrival at the hotel using the free shuttle bus from the ferry port in Cotai, the Sheraton was on par with the Vegas strip. The Check-in has a queuing system reminiscent to the ones at airports. As all the bookings were made in my name and using my trusted Nationwide credit card, I had to take charge to check in everyone.

"The hotel is very well located on the Cotai strip, and is a stone's throw away from all the entertainment. The rooms are very spacious, with all amenities. There are multiple dining options at the hotel, covering a wide range of cuisines, at a reasonable price. The staff are extremely courteous, and specially would like to call out Wilson Webster (Front Office), who was extremely helpful and professional during both our check in and check out.",50
Good music. Good food. Good place to chill and hang out with friends. If you don't do casino. Come here at night and enjoy Macau differently.  Palms Cafe and Bar Manager Nico was very attentive to us and he was very courteous and polite. The staff were efficient and polite.   I enjoyed this very much. ,50

"Me and my wife had an enjoyable stay in Sheraton hotel because of one person he is Mr. Al that exceeded my expectations as we are celebrating our anniversary, Mr. Al surprised us with an upgrade and a cake for our anniversary and for our up coming baby we did not expect that at all me and my wife was really happy and even he noticed that my wife is pregnant Mr. Al really took care of us by suggesting some store that is available in the hotel for babies which my wife really love. Suggested us some fine dining restaurant and spa where the staffs are really friendly and welcoming.      I personally would like to thank staff like Mr. Al who is genuinely kind generous and for taking care of us from head to toe of our stay at the Sheraton he is truly a good example. ",50
"We always say a happy heart has to be surrounded by happy people and today, we have been delighted with the people around FEAST especially genevie who is very warm and friendly from the moment we enter the restaurant we are welcomed by a very cozy and elegant ambiance walking to our table is already a FEAST to our eyes so many choices of food from starters to desserts and everything is really a delight...coming to FEAST is an experience that we would always want to do again and again...everything is truly a delight from the place...the food the service and most of all the people who make us feel as the most valued guest special thanks to GENEVIE...EMILY ARIES AND IVY!!!!",50
"My Macau trip just ended up, and i stayed at Sheraton for 2 nights. Room is very clean and quiet, and seems there is a vendor machine in each floor (This is so cool. I am used to be hungry at midnight). Their receptionists are friendly and helpful (but others seems poker-faced). Their breakfast is great -- quite a variety of food to choose. I was really full every morning. Overall to say, I think Sheraton is very good.",50
"This is our favourite hotel in Macau with its spacious clean room and super friendly staff. We have stayed here on numerous occassions and written several reviews in the past. This review will be on the exceptional staff encountered during this trip. We wanted to book concert tickets to Yoga Lin show and were assisted by the counter staff by the name of Maggie Mak. She was exceptional, in guiding and assisting us to get the best value seats for the show. She deserved special mention for the assistance given. The staff at Bene restaurant also should be complimented for the efficiency and friendly service as the place was crowded during breakfast but yet very organised.

"Room is nice with view overlooking the Cotai hotels cluster, very nice night view ! Transport is convenient with hotel shuttles. Impressive upon check-in, was greeted and helped by Reception, Wilson, a friendly and helpful young chap.",40
The overall review of the hotels is great. The only thing bad is there club lounge is under repair so if you choose the club  room you cannot enjoy fully the benefit of the club lounge. And another thing is the breakfast. My book is free breakfast and free access to club lounges but the Reception will push you to have your breakfast at Bene which is very bad food. I have to fight it over and argue with the Chinese reception the feast to have my last day stay breakfast at the Feast. Good that there are the Filipinos Receptions/ attendant who help us and give us a very good service. I would like to commend Ms. Ivy Canoza and Ms. Genevie for the nice service they provided us during our dinner and breakfast at the Feast.,40
Hotel was huge and busy however all staffs are very friendly. There is a casino but I didn‚Äôt go inside. I was traveling with my wife for a honeymoon trip. Although you need to wait sometime for check in however it was really worth. I met Benny the front office manager during the check in. He gave me a warm welcome and upgraded my room to a suite. He suggested us a few attractions and restaurants which was really nice! The room was spacious and have a fabulous view. There was a mobile device provide free internet even you are out of hotel! Thanks again Benny for the awesome service and definitely recommend everyone to stay!,50
"This place is massive...but it appears most hotels in this area are the same way. This is not my type of location for vacation but I can't fault the hotel for that. Lots of good options for the restaurants and the quality is good. Good customer service from Maureen at the check-in desk. Nothing spectacular about the rooms, but they weren't bad either. Overall, this is your typical traditional hotel. Above average",40
"Very nice Hotel, and good selection of Indian Vegetarian food for Breakfast & Lunch. The rooms are quite decent size and the Lobby and Casino are also good. Can recommend, for large groups as well as family.",40
Dined at all 3 places this time. SPG member get discount and membership can be enrolled on the spot and discount applied immediately.  Staff (Paul and Aida at Feast) were friendly despite the busy environment. Food was good too.,50
"While the place was super posh and a higher end of the Sheraton chain hotels, we were quite taken aback by the overwhelming crowd that never seems to leave the lobby or the common shopping areas. Be prepared to be hit by an ocean of tourists.

"I stayed at Sheraton Grand Macao from 28th Nov to 30th Nov. I only wish I had spent more nights here.  What an amazing hotel with awesome facilities. As soon as we entered the lobby the fragrance which hits you is welcome, my wife was mesmerized by the beauty around. Starting from Check-In itself, me and my wife knew that we were at the right place. The staff is cordial, everyone tries their best to make you feel welcome.     Though we had checked into a regular room on 25th floor, sky tower ‚Äì on our request (as it was our anniversary) Guest Service Ambassador Mr. Jacky Xue went out of his way to upgrade our room.

"I am the Platinum member for the hotel, upgraded to deluxe executive suite. It is very nice and good view. Lounge is under renovation, but still have a place for happy hour and breakfast. Nice food and wine.",50
Great hotel with a casino. Interconnected with other hotels and casino's like the Venetian. Situated in the middle of a mall. So good shopping experience and access to eating joints in the mall other than the hotel restaurants.,50
I was blown away by our room. It was like an apartment. So much space. Such great value. Had lunch in the Italian restaurant there which was really nice as well. This was our 2nd stay and we loved it. Wish we‚Äôd stayed a few nights more but we will be back again next year. ,50
The Sheraton Macau is on the coati strip - it is connected to the Venetian‚Äôs City of Dreams via enclosed walkways- cheaper than many it still offers easy access to casino and shoppes-   I ordered room service several times when I retired too tired to go out again and was surprised when the food arrived in less than 20 minutes- piping hot and very tasty - not what I was expecting for room service- staff are extremely helpful- check in and out was painless and the room was clean and well appointed -I have stayed in almost all Cotai hotels and find this one the best value for $,40
"I stay here for 2 nights, book a deluxe room and was upgraded to executive room with club lounge access on confirmation. When I reach the hotel they told me only room upgrade, I show them the confirmation mention club are not inclusive but they say not indicated in their system. If it is not provided, please do not indicate on confirmation as I have false expectations before I come and when I reach, I was disappointed. I don't want to argue further because mine was upgraded.  Room is very big but seriously I don't need such a big room, I only stay like 8 hours in the room daily. What I appreciate is the wifi, really very great wifi, other than that, the rest are normal to me.

"Having an amazing dining experience at the Feast at Sheraton.    There is a wide variety of seafood (crab crayfish lobster oyster sashimi, you name it, they've got it!)  Staff are very attentive and friendly.  Special shout out to Angga their server/bartender for the refreshing cocktail trolley.  Your passion for cocktails is appreciated and admired.  Also special thanks to Jun Shen for the superb service.  Thank you so much Sheraton and hope to return soon.    By the way, I have time to write this while still at their restaurant because of their generous 4.5 hour dining time ;)",50
"The Sheraton Grand Hotel on the Cotai Strip is a big hotel with over 4000 rooms. It's so big that noone is allowed to check in before 3pm. This means that at 2.45pm every day there are queues of new arrivals wanting to check  in at the same time. I went to the casino for a couple of hours to avoid the check in queues and even then I had to wait in line for 40 minutes when I lined up at around 4.30pm.. The staff do their best but there are just too many people. The ground floor which includes the check in counters and casinos is always like shopping on Christmas Eve. Location is good, you can see 5 or 6 hotels without going outside and there are shopping malls amongst them all. Rooms and restaurants are typical Sheraton standard.",30
"I am platinum member of SPG. Didn‚Äôt mug feel like I‚Äôm platinum member no greeting when I check in, even no upgrade the guy said fully booked on Friday?  No welcome fruits either. I haven‚Äôt treated like this as a platinum member. Won‚Äôt go back for sure.   ",30
"Great hotel. Rooms are nice and clean. The hotel has excellent room service, I say this because hotel has 4000 rooms to look after and it's well managed.  They serve great variety in breakfast at "" Feast "" with limited veg options but good. The Italian restaurant "" Bene ""  also has lot of veg food options to choose from.  The casino inside the hotel is huge and atmosphere inside is electric.  Hotel has two towers a. The sky tower & b. Earth towers. Both the towers are good and has different views to offer.  From the sky tower one could be see eiffel tower and from earth tower - fountain show (Photos attached)  ",50
"My friend G and I had an amazing time in Sheraton Grand Macau!  Check in and check out was a smooth process.  Front desk service was efficient and guest relations officer Jethro made sure that our needs were being attended to, even as we have already checked in, and we were made to feel really special - thanks Jethro, you rock!  Our room looked fabulous with the Deluxe Cotai view and the facilities were at par with the best. Hotel location is also perfect which makes getting around so convenient.  It's definitely an unforgettable experience worth sharing.",50
"I am staying at Sheraton Grand Macau for about a week few times per year as I have cooperation with the University. The hotel is conveniently located on the Macau strip. Good for gambling lovers but also for visitors that want to enjoy this nice city with Portuguese flavor. I have breakfast included and I like to alternate Chinese food with western food. For both, there is a good choice, including cheese.",40
"I just wanted to say ""Thank You"" to Mr. Neil Chen who help me and my family check-in and also check-out.  Coming on a short vacation with a small kid on a baby chair could be stressful but he has gone extra miles to make sure everything go smoothly.  Inside the complex, they have many activities for kids. Also, other atractions are within walking distance.   Tried their Italian restaurant Bene. Great deal of weekday Semi-Buffet lunch at MOP138+/person.",50

"For such a large hotel, (over 4000 rooms), this property is a must for anyone visiting Macao.  The staff try their best at all times, nothing is too hard.  For a hotel of this size, you would imagine complete chaos, yet, the staff and management have fine tuned the property to provide you with the very best experience they can.  The food is fantastic and there is so much to do within the hotel complex. Shopping, watch a theatre show, visit the casino, let the kids loose in a safe environment at one of the Sheraton specialist kids adventures.  With a Starwood property, you can expect those personal touches that make a difference to your stay.  I recommend a meal at Benne, their Italian restaurant, also a trip to the spa to completely relax and unwind, a swim or the gym.  There is‚Ä¶",50
The room was very spacious. It looked clean except I saw some mold growing on sink. I didn‚Äôt know much about Macao so location of this hotel wasn‚Äôt too good for me. I just signed up for spg membership and the staff told me that I won‚Äôt get points for staying since I booked the room thru trip advisor/Expedia. I thought most people book a hotel thru travel agency like Expedia. ,30

They only care about the casino business, their English is bad, finally, I checked in, the room still ok, but the internet is slow. The showerhead is not working well. Not sure is it a real Sheraton standard.",30
"Stayed for a week for a business convention. Twice the toilet bowl was not cleaned properly but cleaniness generally acceptable. Wish they have more toiletries - given the longer turnaround time to cldan the room, the shampoo/bath gel not enough for 2 baths.",40
"A doorman helped for our car and suitecase since we arrived in the forecourt. Our reception in check in desk was helpful and friendly. We got a lovely suite in high floor with an amazing view overlooking cotai strip and the hotel pool. Hotel room has a handy phone device which come with a local phone number and unlimited wifi service. I have to say that was a big plus for a traveller. Room is clean and the bed was very comfortable. After all, I have to say that everyone is doing a great job in this massive hotel! Highly recommended! We will be back!",50
"This is a first for me. A sumptuous king size bed in one room and the adjoining room has a bunk bed with the bottom one being a double bed. There is an additional sofa which can double as a bed for 2 kids. So all in, this arrangement can easily cater to a party of seven.",40
"We stayed 2 nights at this hotel to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  The hotel is very well maintained and clean.  Bed and linen are very comfortable, services are good and efficient.  Location is very strategic, at the center of Cotai Strip, which makes it very easy and convenient to go everywhere, especially with the free shuttles.  Food selections at the restaurants are very good and nice, we tried both Xin and Bene.  Gym is spacious and well equipped, pools are nice.  Worth to visit and come back here again.  ",50
"The Sheraton Grand is a fabulous hotel in the Cotai strip.  The rooms are large and the facilities are very nice.  While its true that there are several nice hotels in the Cotai strip (some probably nicer), I still rate this hotel highly.  There is a casino, restaurants, pools, and a free shuttle to the Macau ferry terminal.  I think this hotel is best for elite SPG members because they will upgrade you to a one bedroom suite which is awesome.  There is also a special SPG check in area as well that is very comfortable.",40

"Yes, this is a grand hotel with 4000 rooms but that's pretty much where the Sheraton experience stops.  We went there for my fianc√© birthday and even after being a SPG member there was no SPG experience.  Firstly we were asked to checkin at the mobile desk and not at the spg counter which itself was weird but not a big deal. Then during the check in the girl at the counter forgot to tell us about breakfast and print the vouchers even though it was paid for. Best of all the system did not show it was my fiance's birthday even though she is a spg member and the booking was on her account and I had to separately go and ask the service desk if they could arrange for something to make her feel special.  The breakfast was at Xin and predominantly Chinese non vegetarian food and even‚Ä¶",10
"I visit this hotel 3~4 times a year.  Joe Huang from the Front Desk was super helpful in getting me the room I wanted.  Judith San Juan was also extremely helpful in explaining the breakfast and drinks setup while the SPG lounge is under renovation.  I really appreciate the service I received from Joe & Judith.  With their help, I was able to get the two bed suite I wanted and also check-in at a time that was most convenient to my trip plan.    Jesse from the guest service center also provided great service when I asked for extra whiskey glasses and a bucket of ice.  Everything was delivered in ten minutes.    While it's a shame that the beautiful and comfortable SPG lounge was not open, the breakfast at Feast was actually better than the breakfast at the SPG lounge.    It's‚Ä¶",50
"This isn't the first time I stayed here. I actually joined their SPG club because of my last stay here. This time, service is above & beyond.

Thanks Jetro & Brent for your kind assistance.",50

Excellent view and ambiance. Kudos to the staff specially Sanjieb who made sure that we had all the information and assistance that we needed during our stay. He even took an extra mile to make sure that we were comfortable after the long travel from Hong Kong. Will surely return and recommend to friends. Keep it up!,50
We spent five night in Sheraton macao. It was my first time trip in Macau with my parents but I didn't know that about tourist attractions. So I asked one of employees who is Peter Jung what is travel spot and delicious restaurents. He recommanded me very nice areas for traveling and restaurents. I was so impressive about his kindness untill check-out also he prepared welcome gift for my mother's birthday when we went into room. I would like to travel in Macau and to visit in Sheraton macao again. Thanks.,50
"We spent four nights in sheraton macao.   Deluxe Room looked old but it was cool and clean. We just had some problem to operate elevator due to the malfunction of room key but the reception figured it out very quickly.   Swimming pool is divided into several small areas and was crowded but kids are always like to play there.  Hotel is in cotai central which is great location. food court and stores are very close to hotel in walking distance.   The best part of sheraton is always great breakfast. As a casino hotel, sheraton macao served wonderful buffet every morning at feast. It is good to go to feast early in the morning berfore getting crowded.",40
"Took a gamble with Sheraton macau for our anniversary.  Paid handsomely and had a memorable stay at Sheraton macau..  Not just because of the amenities but more of the care of the staff of the hotel.  Jetro Pasamanero went out of his duties to make us feel welcome with his impeccable and truthful care with fruits and wonderful welcome card and anniversary greetings,  to our room with the Eiffel tower view from our window.  How romantic can that be!  I should also mention Rechelle and Erica who checked us in a jiffy.  To Sheraton, thanks a lot for having such wonderful staff.  All hotels in macau would have its advantages and disadvantages but none can replace  an excellent service.  It sets Sheraton apart from the rest!

Hotel room is spacious, well equipped with amenities, standard maintained very high Compared to other hotel in Cotai-Macau, its a bit outdated, however they did good job maintaining the high standard, in luxury, cleanliness and service. They have free shuttle ride from China/Macau port on regular basis. You can also hop on to downtown using their free shuttle service also. One thing you had to remember, this is Cotai-Macau, so prepare to pay the premium price for everything. You will have problems finding convenience store, the nearest one is you have to pass through Venetian Macau, and go across Galaxy resort. Even McD has a ""Macau price"" in here.

We had 5 adults in a group and booked 2 rooms .On arrival and on seeing the room ,three adults was not going to fit in it as we were all single females and I was not going to share a bed! Lucky go came to rescue and upgraded the room with much higher specification than I expected .It made the whole experience much more enjoyable and other guests of the group has since revisited several times .I enjoyed the pool but it was too cold for my Asian cousin and the Buffet in the hotel was brilliant and value for money . Great service all around .",40

This was disappointing seeing as it is advertised as the biggest and best Club Lounge in the world. On arrival we went to the makeshift SPG members check-in to large queues.  Our upgraded room to a suite was good however I had booked a room for 3 people as my sister-in-law was sharing and they had made no provisions for this ie extra towel, dressing gown, bathroom soaps, glass etc. The reception was pretty quick to correct this however.

He really attended to our needs and even added some extra special perks. The room was really nice with a good view of the Parisian. The bed and pillows were really comfortable and I slept soundly through the night. The bathroom was exquisite and complete with amenities.

"Sheraton Grand upholds the Brand. Spacious room and big bathroom, great support staff, amazing location. Its located in Cotai, and has access to most of adjoining properties and also to an amazing food court. As an SPG member, i was delighted with front desk services both during check in a check out.  the only let down was house keeping, which i guess is an issue in all Sheraton's (at-least in the ones i have stayed). Though the staff responds to your requests, sometimes it takes hours and multiple reminders. Also, room cleaning is only done when asked for, not sure if this was the policy or just a mild lapse.  Overall, an amazing stay and worth the value.",40
"Our recent visit to the Sheraton Grand Macao was quite pleasant. We were in luck in that there were no line ups and we were able to check-in quite efficiently and quickly. This is a typical very large property in Macau with nearly 2000 rooms in the one tower alone where we stayed. The rooms are quite large and comfortable with good value for the price. Our room gave us a great vu of the Eiffel tower which was beautiful at night.    I was pleasantly surprised with the level of service that we encountered at the reception desk, the concierge and also in the restaurants. All our inquiries were handled with good professionalism. We enjoyed a great dinner at the Bene Italian Trattoria. Overall a good experience.",40
"Had a wonderful stay at the Sheraton in Macau with exceptional service from check-in to check-out. Loved the facilities, huge gym, beautiful pool and clean comfy room. Everything that I expect of the Sheraton brand and more. Only downside was the buffet we had was exorbitantly expensive and food was not that great. ",50

"It was a most disappointing one night stay for us at the Sheraton especially after we had a very enjoyable stay at the same hotel some 5 years ago. We were quite shocked to find our guest room a little dusty and the carpet in both our guest room and in the corridor somewhat grubby. The bath towels that were provided to us were old and fray. We ate breakfast at the coffee shop Feast where despite having paid MOP$502 (AUD $80) for the two of us, we could not have been tempted to have more than just a coffee and a plate of fresh fruits.

Check-in was fast, as there was a separate check-in counter close to the bus stop entrance (east exit). Rooms were clean and spacious. Beds were comfortable. There was complementary bottled water (you can request for more). Hotel was centrally located, with internal access to the other hotels/casinos. Lots of restaurants, and the casino on the ground floor was very convenient too. Check-out was fast as well, even though there was a long line and a lot of people at the main lobby.  Would stay here again if we do go back to Macau!",40

Cons - Breakfast location is too far, housekeeping and room service speaks little english or don't understand at all.  This is a de-merit from my point of view since Sheraton is an international brand.",40

Conrad's weekend price was high due to upcoming event in Macau.  as I expected Sheraton's room and amenities are smaller and lower quality than Conrad. but I met so helpful and kind Filipino staffs.

Ms. Cherry Zhang of Guest Relations  had answered all my earlier emailed queries very well and also took good care of us for smooth check in process at SPG counter.   There are some areas  which Sheraton can improve::  1) When we landed at Macau Ferry Terminal, there was no proper guidance to direct us to the hotel shuttle. No one holding signs saying Sheraton hotel. So we had to walk around with our luggage from one side to another - finally somebody pointed us to a bus marked 'Sands Resort' - no mention of Sheraton on that particular bus. how is a tourist supposed to know Sands bus is same for Sheraton?  !  2) The bus dropped us at back of the hotel.

He even sent treats for my young daughter who shrieked when she saw her care package.

Ms. Rechelle Ann Sotomil of the guest services was most helpful and pleasant. He goes out of her way to accommodate my requests. You should include breakfast in your booking. It costs less than paying for additional breakfast whenever you change your mind and opt to eat buffet breakfast.

"The Sheraton is a huge hotel at the Cotai casino strip. It consists of two large towers and has three receptions to handle guest for the 4000 rooms. So it is rather an anonymous place, but service was still good and friendly.  The location is convenient for all the casinos and also meeting spaces in the area. The room is very comfortable and clean as expected in a Sheraton hotel. A free shuttle bus service is available to different points of interest, e.g. airport, ferry terminals or the Sands hotel on the northern peninsula.  The rooms feature a ""handy"" mobile phone, which allowed free local calls and - even more important - data service, as access point for your own devices.  The only problem I had was that at check-in an additional amount of ~800‚Ç¨ was reserved on the credit‚Ä¶",40
"Dear sheraton  Stayed 3 night form 5th to 8th November , got upgraded to a family room and everything was perfect! Clean linens, odour free rooms ..comfortable . But these are the lists of downs of the hotel  1.my friend's room got door knocks around 4am and it was a prostitute offering services. This shouldn't had happened as some travellers have wives and kids. This is so not nice. 2. House cleaning was good but it was so slow..went out in the morning and room wasn't clean till late noon. 3. Painting in the room is so scary. It looks like a lady crying with blood and has another look of a upset lady. Why place such painting in front of the bed? 4. On certain time of the days, there will be a large group of people crowding the lift lobby and has no regards for people carrying‚Ä¶",40
"We stayed here for 2 nights as part of a large group and enjoyed it very much. The rooms were spacious and luxurious. We enjoyed the easy access to the large shopping complex, particularly the Venetian shops. It was an easy walk to other hotels. We felt safe, although some of the other parents were uneasy with the attention paid to their blonde children (and many people wanted to have their photos taken with people in our group). The breakfast buffet was spectacular! and pool area had the right balance of relaxation and luxury. I would stay here again.",50
"Went to Macau for a single night and booked a package that included breakfast and 2 tickets to see the Monkey King show.   The shuttle from the port to the hotel was flawless, good and comfortable service. The check-in was a bit painful but as expected since the hotel is mobbed with people coming and going.  Very busy place.  I had the privilege of standing in the super special Gold/Platinum SPG line which was way shorter than the rest.  Nevertheless the place seemed a bit short staffed in comparison to the number of people waiting.  The room was not ready so we left the luggage and went for a walk, circled back within a half hour and were given a room on the club floor but were told the club lounge was being renovated.  Luggage was delivered promptly and to my surprise the‚Ä¶",40
The Sheraton Grand Macao is an excellent hotel both for a business and a leisure trip. The rooms are large and comfortable and the bathroom very spacious and clean. The hotel is situated within the Cotai Central mall and is connected to the Venitian so you don't need to get out when it's very hot when you want to move a bit. If you happen to be at a conference you can access the rooms directly from the elevator. Excellent gym open 24/7. Wide choice of restaurants.,50
"We lived here few times for business trip. The hotel was huge and convenience. Next, We appreciate their front desk service.They are efficiency & professional. We will visit here again with family for my vacation.",50
"Sheraton Grand Macau lived up to its name being a grand hotel on Cotai strip. Not to compare with its neighboring Venetian, Parisian nor Wynn it stands on its own class. Being a part of Starwood group, guest experience and product offerings are as expected. You enter the hotel lobby welcomed by a huge lobby with pleasant and welcoming staff. Check it was smooth except for the long que (being a peak check-in period) but it was bearable. Room was as advertised with comfy bed and its bathroom was spacious equipped with amenities. Breakfast spread was awesome while the only drawback was the egg station guy could have a better sunny side up. Hotel employees put up good effort to smile despite large crowd at the hotel. Only recommendation is that for your staff to be sent for basic‚Ä¶",40
"Checkin was a breeze, although the bell boy did try to dissuade me from checking in early but I went to the line anyway.  Was able to get a room via the spg desk even though it was only 11am.  Room was great, everything works.  Was gifted a lovely cookie set from Mariana who wrote a personal note and wishing me a nice concert experience, nice personal touch.    We ate at Feast, Bene and ordered room service as well.  Was a little annoyed that I was not informed of the 2-for-1 Crab Bash at Feast when I made the booking, would have been nice to be told and have some savings.  Bene's high tea was lovely.  Overall a good stay, the Sheraton is located so centrally so it is very convenient to get around.",50
"We stayed here for a night before heading back to Malaysia. The hotel was huge! We had arrived early at 1.00 pm and was actually asked to wait until 2.00 pm for check-in.  However, a staff of the front office was very attentive and called me back when he realized that the counters are open for check in a few minutes later. Luckily, we had not left the hotel yet. We proceeded to check-in, and I was attended by Kevin Ni, who was very professional and prompt. He speaks fluent English and took the time to issue me a membership card for Starwood Hotel Group despite the hecticness in attending to the great number of customers that day.

We were a group of 1300 people from india came here for the confernce. The rooms were really nice and big. The service was really very good. The hotel is a 5min walk away from venetian. We stayed a night at venetian also. Though venetian overall is bigger and better than sheraton. But the rooms of sheraton were better. Having said that it  is near to venetian so one can stay at sheraton and go to venetian for sightseeing and thus save money as sherton is cheaper than venetian. Though the pool was very small.,50
"Location: Sheraton Grand lies in the Heart of Cotai strip, This is also one of the largest Hotel in Macau having more than 4000 rooms with executive suites.   Rooms: The Room was very well maintained and spacious with a enough Furniture. Everything was still in better condition specially the bathroom is big enough for anyone to enjoy the rain shower and bathtub which was very neat and tidy. I stayed in SPG floor and from my room I could see a very good view of the Eiffel Tower, studio city and a natural greenery forest with hills from the window.  Service: Talking about the service i really don't have any words to mention. The service given for the Sheraton Guest by their staff was the top most service that i had ever seen.

"I rarely if ever write reviews unless someone goes above and beyond.  After checking in, AJ Asaytuno, the Sheraton Macau Guest Service Ambassador, brought my bags and accompanied me to my room.  I didn't realize that this Sheraton has 4000 rooms and the place is absolutely massive.  AJ went on to tell me about the services and the amenities offered by the hotel.  He also went on to tell me about the functionality of my executive suite.  Nice room!  Even better service!  Thank you AJ!",50
"I was here for their soft opening 5 years ago and the hotel still looks new and well maintained. Was upgraded to a corner suite as I am a SPG member which was a nice touch and appreciated by me and my wife.  Only stayed one night due to an Event at Grand Hyatt that I am attending but wish we could have stayed a few more nights since we were in the suite.  Only real nitpick would be that the elevators to the Hotel rooms (I think there are two different Towers) are a few minutes walk but without really visible instructions. But this is a very minor comment and  walking will be required for such a spacious hotel which is rare!!   There are many other high-end 5 star hotels (Grand Hyatt, Venetian etc...) but Sheraton is well worth the value!",50
"Like other hotels in Macau, the ground floor is always busy with tourists and gamblers. However, the reception is very friendly and helpful despite of the crowd waiting to be served. I stayed at Sky Tower, the light in room was a bit dim yet the spacious bathroom made up for it and there was an instant noodle machine right on the aisle if you don't want to spend a fortune on the expensive mall restaurants.   Overall a comfortable and welcoming stay with good location (easy access to Venetian, Parisian, City of Dreams...etc.), oh and did I mention the breakfast buffet with something like 50 different dishes you could try?",50

We stayed here for 3 nights for 2 rooms. Check in was faster than we expected as this is the biggest Sheraton in the world. Room was clean and big considering the money we spent. Staff are friendly and helpful especially the guest service manager Miko who gave us suggestions for sightseeing and restaurants in Macau!  We enjoyed every bit of it! Thanks Miko!! We will definitely choose this hotel when we visit Macau again.,50

"To begin with, the locality is splendid. You need not step out and just take time to explore within the hotel. The hotel is beautifully built with niche architecture. The staff is extremely efficient, my special mention for Hilary at the front desk who went out of the way to make us feel comfortable and at home. The room size is spacious and the add on was the spectacular view i.e the Eiffel Tower just outside your window. Enjoy king size breakfast and lunch at the Feast. Their bakery is to die for and one must save enough space to savor the scrumptious dessert section. Thank you Sheraton Macao for the warm welcome. Looking forward to seeing you soonest. Cheers!",50

We always dine here but this time was awesome.",50

"Arrived before lunch time and was ushered to the SPG counter, was served within 5 minutes by a lovely young girl (sorry I didn't catch her name). Our room was ready so off we went to the 32nd floor and into our Executive Suite - absolutely beautiful, spacious, great views, and a comfy bed. The Exec Club Lounge was ideal for breakfast if we wanted (did go downstairs to Feast once), during the day coffee and tea available. After 5pm the place became licenced and we could get beers, wines, spirits for free. The hot dishes were available and topped up regularly. Must say the Concierge staff were 1st class, always eager to help if you needed any directions or just advice. All in all a very enjoyable stay, made all the better by great staff.",50
We had a very nice stay. Room was very good. Excellent breakfast and very good choice and service at restaurants. Without a mistake by front desk it would have been almost a perfect stay. Definately can go again. ,40

We drink a lot of water- we didn‚Äôt hear the usual about complimentary bottles and you would be charged for. The only suggestion is it would be great to have 500 ml bottles.   The feast has an excellent spread for breakfast and lunch. Enjoyed both thoroughly. The sushi, bowl of soup, the ham, the clams, prawns - never ending spread and good desserts. Breakfast was sumptuous too.  A great hotel and great service.",50
"Very few people know that this hotel has 4200 rooms! I stay in this hotel since it opened some years ago and is impressive how they succeed to have a high quality of service! One of the best Sheraton in the world  The rooms are incredible, real large and in perfect conditions! The breakfast in Feast or Bene, really good. Also for dinner the Bene is very good with real Italian food.  My congratulations to all the staff in special to Mrs. Kathy Chen a professional that any hotel will be proud to have and Ms Lively Liv from front desk, friendly and efficient, one of the best I meet in my life.

But the exclusiveness was lost.  Anyway, Catalina at the Xin made every effort to ensure that our celebrations at this restaurant during the complimentary cocktail hours were moments to remember.  The housekeeping could‚Äôve been improved, but, we were having so much fun that we were in no mood to complain. ",40

You go into the lift and the floor number is there but when you put your card in the slot and push the floor number the button does not light up.  It took us going back to the check in desk twice to be instructed on how the lift system works.

An amazing hotel in an amazing part of Macau. We were given a free upgrade to the luxurious honeymoon suite upon arrival for mentioning we were on our honeymoon to the very helpful Vicky Yi at reception.

"Be warned that even if you pay for the CLub floor rooms, ordering anything (including a bottle of beer) will take them a minimum of 25 minutes to deliver, by which time you can expect the cold beer to be a bit warm. On a three day stay housekeeping will not bother to make your room or change the towels. You only get that service if you chase the hotel manager.

"This review is about the Deluxe suite of the Sheraton Grand, Cotai, Macau  The Sheraton Cotai Macau was rebranded Sheraton Grand Cotai Macau but the change is limited to the name only in my opinion, after having stayed in the Deluxe Suite twice in two months. Check in was done in the Club Lounge on the 4th floor instead of the main lobby which was less crowded but then the walk from the lobby to the Lounge took 10 minutes with a high chance of getting lost since the it was located amongst a spread of conference rooms and was not very clearly indicated. The check in process was painless enough but took much longer than average.   Upon entering the suite one would immediately feel the sheer size of it and it was actually quite tastefully decorated in bright colours. I would not go‚Ä¶",20
"This is our first time to Macau and had heard good reviews of the property.   We waited quite a while at the SPG check-in area, so my wife went over to inquire at the family check in as we had a kid with us who suffered from sea sick in the 1 hour boat ride (poor boy!). She was brushed off by an impolite reception staff who had time to look at his fingernails but no courtesy to greet my wife in her face.  Despite the above, when we finally did get to check-in (after 15mins), we met Jetro. He made everything fantastic with his warm smile, bubbliness and showed genuine concern for our boy who was getting impatient.  We got upgraded to a suite (a first for us) and the room was huge! We loved everything in the room, especially the gigantic bath tub in the middle of the bath room.‚Ä¶",50

Checking in may takes sometime too which however upon entering the room, am fully at ease and calm with the spacious and contemporary settings.  Basically, we need sometime to adjust to the culture andf practices of Macau where one will appreciate, enjoy the much conveniences of the interlink and connectivity of all the different theme hotel that is incredibly amazing.

"Getting to the hotel is easy, there is pick and drop facility provided by the hotel buses ( frequency is very good, I guess every 15-20min ) from ferry terminals. I have read in many reviews that they faced long queues at reception while check - in the hotel, lucky we did not faced any such issue. Coming to the room, it's huge, you get the luxurious feeling in every corner, though I felt the decor is bit old and need some renovation. We stayed here for 3 nights, food at the restaurant was good, they had enough vegetarian options to binge on. Overall I enjoyed my stay completely.",40

My family arrived at the hotel around early afternoon where there was already a long queue for checking-in to the hotel. Nearing the front of the line, we saw a Chinese PRC man blatantly cutting the queue in front of the 2 Korean ladies directly before me. A lady staff ushering guests saw him and confirmed his position in the queue and promptly asked him politely to get to the back of the queue.  I was also very impressed with the housekeeping staff. On the first day when we arrived, we were about to walk over to the nearby vending machine on level 29 to buy a couple bottles of water as we had run out from our ferry ride from Hong Kong‚Ä¶",50
"It's the small things that make a difference & there were many small issues that left us feeling dissatisfied. The room itself was good - clean, spacious, great views. Everything outside the room was difficult. Elevator system was annoying; 10:1 ratio of security guards:servers at the pool; no designated children's pool which meant noisy(but cute) kids in every pool area; advertised 15% discount for SPG members was not applied to my food bill; gym is way too small for a hotel of this size; SPG gold benefit here is non-existent...was offered a shocking 1 drink for 2 people for a 2 night stay! If you just need a room to rest after gambling then you probably wont mind this this sheraton but dont expect any special treatment here.",30
Staff at Sheraton Grand Macao were very professional and super accommodating for myself and my wife. We were there to celebrate her birthday and one of the hotel staff (Vy Canoza) arranged with a surprise cake and the staff stand around and sang Happy Birthday to my wife on our breakfast table in Feast Restaurant and moreover our room was upgraded to a suite by the Customer Relations Manager upon hearing we are here to celebrate my wife birthday on our check-in.,50
"Really good experienced and thank you front desk staff  Mr. Wilson Webster who was very nice and helpful. My mother needs to sit on wheelchair and he helped us priority to check in and arrange the room more near lift. After we went to room, it was amazing, because view was really nice.  Will stay again.",50
"Stayed at Sheraton two nights.  It was great for my family.  The room is clean and   tidy.  One thing was not very good that the water was not stable enough.  Dining nearby was good.  There are so much good restaurants.  We had taken our breakfast at hotels' restaurant, it was many people, but the food was good.  The swimming pool was good for children.  It is not deep.  It is good for playing with children. ",40
We stayed in the club room and wasn‚Äôt disappointed. Our experience from check-in to hopping on our coach to the Taipa ferry service heading back home was first class and nothing was out of the way. We were well looked after by Mary-Lou (?) at all the Sheraton owned restaurants and offered lots of great tips and hints. Five stars Mary-Lou!! A big thank you from us. A place that made us feel special and a home away from home. Looking forward to our next trip!,40
"Service was second to none other than I have experienced in lover view hotel in ngwe saung Myanmar. Shout out to Ann and Neil for being such understanding front office, would stay here again for sure , could not have asked for more. ",50
"I stayed with this hotel for several times. The hotel is facilitated above average but of coz u could not compare it wz Ritz hotel or Banyan Tree. It's very impressive during this stay that the service has improved a lot. The Housekeepers were nice and efficient, the security guards near the elevator landing lobby were very helpful for directions. Service Manager Miko was very friendly, Front Desk girl Vicky and Sasa were very helpful.   ",50
"My family had a mixed experience at this hotel. On one hand service is friendly and the hotel is clean; also, the Italian restaurant has an excellent Sunday brunch. However, the Family Suite we booked came with a bunk bed, the top bunk of which did not have a mattress - it had a stone-hard mattress base that was covered by a mattress topper.   After our daughter's very painful night on the 'bed' we complained to the hotel, who provided us a rollaway bed. That was nice but they really shouldn't have supplied such an uncomfortable / incomplete bed in the first place.  A real shame for what, otherwise, was a perfectly decent hotel.",30
"One of the worse swimming pool in a hotel we have ever experienced.  The water in the pool was murky and uncomfortable, the walkway along the swimming pool was narrow to walk.  Each child under 140cm has to wear life jackets or arm bands, each pool has at least 1 ‚Äúsecurity guard‚Äù standing next to the pool to watch the guests, yet there are no life guards.  The guests would probably feel a lot better with life guards instead of security guards, people at least would not feel been watched as criminals.  The pool area supposed to feel relaxed while we are on vacation, instead Sheraton Macau made the guests felt under close watch by the security guards, while the pool is only 1.2 meter deep.  When we sat down they did not offer any water, but made sure we did not bring any drinks of‚Ä¶",20
"One of the worst pool experiences at an otherwise not bad hotel. The water was dirty - felt like I was swimming in a river. This was at 11am - not enough time for otherwise unclean fluids to cumulate in the pool for the day. This was surely a water filtration/cleaning problem - either too infrequently done, or not done at all overnight. Waiters didn't take food or drinks orders or offer water at poolside. You have to walk to the bar to order. When I ordered and was about to walk back to my seat to wait, the waitress asked ""you gonna pay for that?"" - without explaining that unlike most hotels, here you pay upfront, not sign for it after. This is not because she has a language issue as a Chinese speaker. I speak Chinese - it would sound equally rude in Chinese. So I took my number‚Ä¶",30
Everything was great from the check in to the room and all the facilities that the hotel can offer is amazing! Love the swimming pool atmosphere and the Effiel Tower view. Definitely will recommend the hotel!,50
Our 2nd time to celebrate our anniversary and brought along our daughter. SPG family check in saved us so much time as the normal check in had long line for golden week and my kid was getting fuzzy.   Exceptional guest service officer Josie B was very friendly and accomodating. we booked 2 rooms and she made sure my requests were taken car of. We even got a box of madelines as anniv gift along with a card. we were so touched as the day we were leaving she send kung fu panda stuffed dolls to our room with personalized card.....really went out of her way to make our daughter overly happy. Unforgettable!! thumbs up to Guest Services!!!  We always booked for Kung Fu Panda feast and enjoyed every bit of it. Had early swim also but sad that the other pool opened quite late (10am) so‚Ä¶,50
"This hotel is well located in the heart of Cotai strip, in Sands Cotai Central. I stayed here a few times and the best thing I like about this hotel is the Suites - Executive Suites and Deluxe Suites have very nice interior, a lot of space and not too expensive, therefore highly recommended.  Their club lounge is really nice but it is a bit too busy (currently under renovation I believe), and the swimming pool is a bit small given the number of rooms this hotel has. The check-in / check-out line can be really long if you are not a Starwood Gold or Platinum.",40
"I have stayed at this hotel a few times in last 2 years. I am a SPG platinum member and had email exhange with Cherry about my upcoming stay and she helped to accommodate my requests. Ex: room upgrade and arranging a disabled shower chair for my parent on wheelchair. Thank you very much Cherry! The swimming pool is now opened again after closure due to Typhoon. The club lounge is under renovation so guests will need to go to Bene, Feast and Xin for breakfast and tea instead. A couple reminders: this hotel has two big buildings so make sure you asked which one your room belongs to and secondly this is hugh hotel so if you ask housekeeping for something during peak.....it can take awhile so try ask during non peak hours. Be sure to check out their package offer on their web site‚Ä¶",50
"We always visit Macau and my husband loves to play at Casino.  It is not the first time we have dinner at Bene.  But this time was a really wonderful experience.  The waiter name is Ronello Abuel, he really served the customer with heart, smiling face, attention to details and so friendly.   Food and prices are reasonable.  We decided to write the review is just because of the wonderful service.",50
"The best part was when  we stayed at Sheraton Grand Macau Hotel the check in was no hassle. just few minutes. We were also allowed late check out!!  We have never experienced such great service from your staff and how big rooms are! The room that we were in had a tower view and it was so awesome and somewhat romantic. We also enjoyed the amenities of the hotel & of course the executive lounge that made our hearts the happiest.   We enjoyed a lot, we like to hang out at the palms because it was relaxing like we were in the outdoors but still enjoy indoor feeling! Your staff who speaks English is also one of the most important part of our trip!! Kudos to the friendliness of Palms staff NICHOLAS, LETH & SEBASTIAN. They really made sure we were doing great and enjoying our‚Ä¶",50
"First time staying here - and quite typical of the hotels on the Cotai strip - think large and impersonal. These hotels are volume operations, geared to getting huge amounts of people in and out. These are not the type of places where staff will know who you are. Once you check in, unless you have a problem you probably won't speak to any other staff.  Having said that this property is a cut above some of the others I have stayed at. The suites are huge and tastefully decorated and furnished. I particularly liked that good supply of bottled water. Rooms were clean, and the bed was very comfortable. We slept very well, a change from some hotels in Macau that suffer from noise problems due to the large tour groups that stay here.  Overall a good stay and i would stay here again.",40
"Beautiful hotel. Shopping in the lobby and everything accessible via indoors. Get the package with ferry tickets if you plan to go to HK after your visit.  Great water pressure, clean rooms, nice pool!",50
"After several reconditions from our friends, I booked this hotel for my husband's birthday. He's always wanted to come to Macau, so we were excited for a weekend away. I booked Club Level as an extra treat so imagine our surprise when upon arrival, they informed us that the Club Lounge was closed. We were really disappointed. Alternative arrangements were made but we really didn't care for the large, noisy atmosphere of Xin. Breakfast at Bene was similarly chaotic. We chose the club lounge because we don't like large, noisy venues; it was therefore disappointing in this regard. The manager Stefan was very kind and accomodating and this was appreciated; however at the end of the day, I'm disappointed that we didn't experience what we expected to in booking the club lounge. ",30
"I stayed in this hotel for 1 night ( 30 sept to 1 oct). Due to the 10-1 golden week, there were long waiting time ( even though In SPG check in counter) which took around 30-35 mins.  I was served by Miss Hilary Phan in SPG check in counter, she is very friendly and helpful. There is a communication problem between me and the hotel from the e mail which really disturbed my original plan, but Hilary tried her best to help me solve my problem which is really appreciated & high flexibility & efficiency :) thank you very much.   For the room and food are all good, price is reasonable, definitely will come back again for next visit. ",50
"Stayed for 2 nights with my sister and we received the outstanding and amazing service from everyone especially from Jetro Pasamanero, a kababayan who showed  us an excellent hospitality and made our stay a memorable one. Our room has a wonderful view, clean and spacious. Location is perfect and convenient.  We felt so blessed and highly favored.  Highly recommendedüëç",50
"I'm very happy with the room. But hotel service definitely needs improvement. Food lacks variety, be it the breakfast at Bene or afternoon tea at Palms. I hope the food provided at Feast for happy hour later in the evening would not be disappointing again. There was no greetings when I went to Bene for breakfast, was left there not knowing whether I shall go in and find a seat directly all by myself or someone will usher me in. Finally a lady showed me in, but she was going to leave without asking if I want tea or coffee. That's a different five-star hotel breakfast buffet experience. In the afternoon as the free (of course, it's included in the room rate) afternoon tea provided really is not the type I expected (I am sure Macau as a paradise for food and entertainment can‚Ä¶",30
"Just checked in to the Sheraton last night. Was very excited to spend the week here in Macao. just now the Manager threatened to block the pool for my 7 year old daughter. Physically threatened to not allow us into the pool due to an archaic policy about swimming. Only because my daughter is under 1.4 meters she is forced to wear flotation devices. Even though she has been swimming for years and even had to pass a 3 minute water treading test to sail last summer. What kind of customer service is that. To threaten guests and not allow a 7 year old in the pool. Last time staying at a Sheraton. Would be nice to get some help from the management, but it seems they just like to threaten 7 year olds.",10
"As a frequent visitor to Macau, the Sheraton Grand Macao is my hotel of choice.  During my recent trip, I once again experienced outstanding service by all team members.  It was a pure delight to spend three days.  I was warmly greeted upon my arrival; the same continued during the entire stay during all interactions with the Sheraton staff.  The accommodations were superb and extremely comfortable.  Housekeeping was exceptional in maintaining the accommodations in first-class order.  All staff members were most accommodating and attentive at Bene, Feast and the Palms restaurants.  Check-out was fast and efficient.  The staff provided taxi information for my departure.  After a business trip to mainland China, it was a great pleasure to luxuriate at the Sheraton.  I look forward‚Ä¶",50
"Have not been to sheraton macau for a while. Recently stayed at the sky tower for 5 days, very satisfied with the room, it has been very well maintained after few years. Also the housekeeping was efficient at tidying the room.   However some bad things were that some people without the room key were waiting at the lift lobby for those who have to go up. I have encountered twice during the stay, i walked out of the lift as I was not sure if they were staying there. Next was those freelance ladies walking around the area approaching for business. And lastly was those who keep walking near to you and ask if you want to change hkd or draw money, it was so irritating!  Hope the hotel management can look into these matter seriously. ",40
"Last time on September 15th 2017, we have a great dinner at Bene Restaurant. We have served by an absolutely professional server there named Amet. He is very friendly, kind, and the service from him is great. And luckily we got a free welcome drinks from him too!!! Is a pleasant night to meet Amet and the food also great. Overall, we have a great dinner and was a fun night for us. We will never forget about the dining experiences there and also Amet who have served us very well. Recommended for it!!!...",50

I also like their pool and bar. I can lounge on the pool side the entire weekend, sipping their coolers and tasty cocktails.   Service is great too!",50
"After spending 3 nights in hongkong, we opted to stay for 1 night in Macau and we chose Sheraton as out hotel and WOW because it exceeded our expectations. Our bathroom alone was bigger than the entire room that we stayed in HK. The beds were comfortable as we were able to relax and regain our energy spent in walking the busy streets of Hong Kong. We had the view of the eiffel tower as well so the whole experience was amazing.  Since it was my mother‚Äôs birthday, we celebrated at Xin - one of the most famous Asian hotpot and seafood restaurants and the best i have ever been to. So many food to choose and the aroma when we entered was delightful.

Overall, I strongly recommend this hotel as I have satisfied with the service, location and the reasonable room rate.",50
"I and my wife checked-in on 24-09-2017 for 3-nights stay. Our room was upgraded to Suite on Sheraton Club Floor, which was a big and well-furnished room.

Our overall impression was near perfect for the stay and we are looking forward to come back as soon as possible.",50

"The only caveat with Macao is that because over 90% of the tourists are Chinese the staff speak Chinese and not English.  You may have to ask for a manager if you have trouble at checkin.   I received an upgrade and the room was incredible, over 1000 square feet.  The lounge was closed for renovations but they set up a temporary lounge in the ballroom across from the lounge.  The food was varied and plentiful.    All lounge personnel could speak English well and they were eager to help.  Ask for Maria or Eduardo.

We never expect the manager will come by and do ""the waiter's job""!! And maybe because of that, all the staff are very friendly and polite! Before, we dont think a hot pot restaurant would hv this level of service since it is a very Chinese and pretty much self-service type of cuisine.

Concierge service is helpful and bell service gladly kept our bags when needed. Breakfast was a major disappointment! After waiting in line for 30 minutes, we finally got placed at our table. I realized that this - never before seen - wait in line was not due to capacity issues but rather organisation. There were so many free tables but all were dirty and waiting to be turned and that is the reason we had to wait. No plates at stations. No be leans in coffee machine. No tea spoons. No constant refill of food at stations. We genuinely had a bad time here. Doubt we'll be back. ",20

"The Sheraton Grand Macau lies between the Wynn and the Venetian on Macau.   There is a high end mall that connect several of the hotels allowing you to remain indoors between the hotels. The shops in the mall are priced very similar to the malls in the US and carry pretty much the same products as the US.  I am SPG platinum but was not given an upgrade on check in as they said they were fully booked(I don't think they were). The rooms were very clean and the hotel itself was clean as well. The second day I inquired again about upgrading and was given a very large suite for an extra $149usd per night. This room was huge!

"My husband and I stayed and celebrated for anniversary at Sheraton Macau from 31st August to 3rd September. It definitely was a pleasant and unforgettable one!  Peter Jung did excellent preparation for my anniversary and advised us the tourist destinations and restaurants MUST go‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs much appreciated that he spent so much time on exchanging emails. Peter was patient, humble and professional !  Sheraton Macau should be proud of having Peter ‚ò∫    Thank you so much to Sheraton Macau and Peter to let us feel great hospitality we received and we will not forget it !  P.S Staff who assisted to check out (Her name is Maureen) was extremely helpful and love to have a chat with her! Thank you again !",50
"I got to the Sheraton Grand Hotel on what could possibly be the worst weekend with very large groups from China all arriving at the same time. I have never in my life seen a hotel lobby that reminded me of a marketplace. It was chaotic with over a thousand Chinese guests all trying to check-in at the same time. The line snaked everywhere. I had underestimated the size of this hotel and my mother who came with me had a hard time walking around the lobby as she has very bad knees. Luckily when I checked-in at the SPG counter, Jetro Pasamanero assisted us and was kind enough to secure a wheelchair so I could wheel my mum around the hotel. He helped us get to our room and was very helpful with everything even with how to get to places like the ruins. When we were checking out the‚Ä¶",50
"We stayed at sheraton grand cotai hotel and we are so happy coz we were entertain by a filipino staff name Pasamanero Jetro he is very polite and very accomodating ,,and also we are so happy in our room coz we have a whole view of the newly build tower nearby..we are so lucky to have this room ..our stay in this hotel is so perfect..",50
"We were travelling from HK to Macau for a 3-night stay. Before we travelled we were told by many that there won't be much to do in Macau and we would get bored etc hence we were apprehensive about the trip. When we got to the hotel, we were met by Hillary at the SPG check in counter and she was very friendly and helpful. She told us that we had a free upgrade of our room and oh my it was amazing! We were upgraded to a deluxe executive suite which has a living room, dining room, private home theatre and spacious bath in the bathroom. The only thing that I could fault is there isn't much view from the room but it's only minor. During our stay the club lounge was being renovated so the club breakfast, snacks and evening cocktails were being organised in the other restaurants within‚Ä¶",40
"I would like to share this letter of appreciation at TripAdvisor to all hotel staff of the Sheraton Grand Macao Hotel.  Thank you for contributing my stay a very special one with cherished memories!   My husband and I were all pleasantly surprised for all the best arrangement for my birthday celebration.   Here I would like to especially thank you Mr Saurabh BAKSHI, General Manager, Ms Boey CHEN and Ms Kylie HE, the Agent, Reservation ‚Äì ROOMS, and also Mr Alrie ROCAMORA, Supervisor of your Front Office.  Mr ROCAMORA is very nice and friendly, he is a great five-star hotel supervisor!  All staff of Sheraton are very helpful and professional willing to do extra miles just for guest satisfaction.  The service are awesome and the quality of the hotel was way above our expectations. ‚Ä¶",50
The rooms were really veer good.  Staff hospitality was nice. People in and around speak bad English.  It is connected to all near by attraction via pedestrian bridges and free shuttle.  They have Nice casinos. Charges for drinking water are not acceptable though. ,50
"Firstly, the location is convenient as it could be reached by shuttle bus to and from the piers and the airport. Secondly, as it located in the Cotai, which you can easily catch a bus to different major attractions in Macau. At this point it is important to mention the hotel is welly maintained as my visit was just two weeks after the typhoon HATO, which cause a great destruction in Macau, most of the facilities are unharmed and functioning, just part of the outdoor swimming pool is unavailable. On the other hand, as i am lucky, the view from the room is perfect, especially at night which the lights view is amazing. Additionally, the hotel restaurant, Bene, provides great dining atmosphere while the food are delicious. I would like to have a great thanks to NAM, whom is a guest‚Ä¶",50
"To whom it may concern, I have to say that I was very disappointed with the Concierge Night Shift Male Staff on 17th of Sep ! We were given the wrong information by him twice ! Firstly, we were meeting our friend who stayed in your hotel and thinking to have some drinks. So, we approached him and asked where can buy some drinks, was the food court still open ? The answer was NO ! Okay fine, we were walking around for about 2 hours just to get our drinks ! What happened was we saw two hotel guest were holding some drinks and foods with them, and I found out that the foods and drinks were actually from 3/F FOOD COURT ! Second time, we went to him and asked for midnight bus service, and his answer was NO again ! Guess what happened ? At the end, we managed to got on the public bus ‚Ä¶",10
The location is very convenient. There's a lot of great sites to see within the vicinity. There are shops and restaurants everywhere. We received a warm welcome from Jetro Pasamenero who went above and beyond in customer service. Our room was comfortable and has a great view of the Eiffel Tower and Parisian Hotel. Jetro explained the long check-in lines and that only shows that he values our experience as guests. He also assisted us during our check-out making sure the process was smooth and fast. I have high praises for the hotel and the staff. It was a short visit but something worth remembering.,50
"The staff at The Feast, especially Giulian Langone, Abby Chan, Andrea, and Justine are very accommodating. They see to it that their customers feel at home and contented. It's really an experience than can be counted on. It feels really like home to dine here. This restaurant is worth recommending for their kind of service.",50
The staff were very accommodating. I would like to commend the assistant manager Clark for being very professional and approachable. The food was well complemented by the nice smile of the staff. The variety of food choices was superb and of good quality. ,50
"We took a family trip to Macau earlier this summer and enjoyed our stay at the Sheraton Macau. The property is quite large and connected to casino and shopping spaces, so the staff were very helpful is showing us around. We had a large room with a great view of the Cotai Strip. Furthermore, we appreciated that the Sheraton-based restaurants offered discounts to SPG members‚Äîsomething we have not always found at other Starwood properties. Big thanks to Kathy Chen and staff for their hospitality!",50
"I visited this hotel about one month ago with my family. And this was one of the best experiences my family had!! The first impression was determined by 'Wilson Webster'. He helped me in various ways with full kindness even I took long time at check-in course. If I get chance to go macau again, I will choose this hotel again!! Hope Wilson remember me, Korean girl with NASA t-shirt :).",50
"It's a good Hotel, everything clean and nice. Room are of decent size. However as many have mentioned, it's a huge hotel with crowds of people.  On weekends it can take a long time to checkin or even take the elevator. For casino-lovers and shopping-fans it's a great choice, specially since the Parisian and Venetian-Hotel are connected with a bridge.",40
"It takes over two hours to check in. Sheets and rooms are clean and fresh. You need to come alot earlier to get the most out of the day. If you're going to the casino there is one that takes up a lot of space, it is right in front of the reception. ",10
Shabby. Poor check-in process. Lovely view of an industrial plant. Never again. Don't do it. Pools closed. Breakfast expensive and poor quality. Old room furniture nothing like advertised. Scuffed walls. Stained carpets. ,10
"The only thing I don't like it here is the issue with their key cards. It happened a couple of times which is really annoying. We are staying on 17th floor and I can't imagine if we are staying above floors and key cards doesn't work then you have to come down, queue or call the customer service but would take ages to get the new keys.

" Hi Lily (Guest Relations Team),  It was indeed the best hotel experience i ever had so far.¬† Your Guest Relations officer, Jetro Pasamanero made the difference with his very professional handling of his guests.¬† We're so happy that Jetro was assigned to meet us at the airport as he's the best hotel rep that i've ever met.¬† From the moment he approached us he already showed us how to really please a guest as he immediately welcomed us with his best smile and offered to carry our handcarry stuff and asked us if there were anything that we would like to do first like changing currency before we proceed out of the airport.  Once we arrived at the hotel, we didn't have to pass thru the hassle of checking in and line up coz Jetro did everything for us already and went on to bring us‚Ä¶",50
"The Sheraton Grand Macao Hotel is the largest Sheraton in the world and is ALWAYS very busy.  I flew into Macao for a few days over the break and enjoyed my time at the Sheraton.  There is a separate check in area for SPG Gold/Platinum so it helped to avoid the longer line at the regular check in line.   With such a massive complex, there is something for everyone and this Sheraton caters to kids much more than I have seen other Sheratons do. The rooms are very spacious and feel very new.  Just make sure you are going to the right tower.  The hotel is also attached to a shopping mall so it make it easy access to other areas of Macao.  There is also a free shuttle to/from the airport so getting around is very easy.  The price of the hotel is very good also and is always‚Ä¶",50

A box of Madeleine's cookies with its story. They are making our wedding anniversary amazing!  The Housekeeping staff look after us well. They clean our room well and notice that we drink a lot of water, the day after they set up additional water in our room. We feel special!! They also set op a red rose petal on my bath. Love it.  They  really helped make our trip super special and we can‚Äôt thanks enough.  We will recommend this hotel to family and friends.  Thank you",40

"Visited Macau to play golf with golf buddies, from Sep 8 to 11. Decided to spend my birthday in Macau as well, for a change. Stayed in Sheraton Macau for 4 days, and the Guest Relations Officer, JETRO Pasamanero was indeed a terrific ( A plus).  He made sure that he was available to assist us, we would call and text him, and his response time was so quick. Jetro also surprised me with some birthday treats in my room when i got back in the hotel from golf. A lot of the Sheraton staff are also friendly and always smiling. They would always greet their guests, i think most of the people Im describing are the filipino employees i encountered.  Would love to stay in Sheraton again, one day, aside from the awesome service, the hotel is actually big and the rooms are really nice,‚Ä¶",50
"Luxury hotel with a great service. Free shuttle service from the ferry terminal. Great location in the heart of Macau's casinos in Cotai. Rooms are luxurious, large and clean. Excellent hotel's services: satisfying & excellent-quality breakfast, beautiful outdoor pools and kind hotel's staff. Hotel to be suggested visitors coming to Macau.",50
"The Deluxe room comes with 2 Double Bed and is sufficient for my family of 4 (kids 9 and 11 years).  If you have kids, ask for fast queue for check in.  The hotel location is great as it is in the middle of cluster of hotels and there's cover walkway to Venetian and Parisan (in front) and Holiday Inn and Corad (on the right).  Studio City is also in front and walking distance (maybe 10 to 15 min), Wynn palace and City of Dreams is behind and further right respectively.   There's a food court at Cotai Sands, the hotel sign indicate to go via level 3, but it is quiet and winding path.  My preference is to go by Level 1 or Level 2 to Cota Sands Shopping and then take the lift or escalator to level 3.  Lastly, if you taking ferry to Macau, just take note to take the Cotai Sands‚Ä¶",50
One of the best five star hotels I experienced  Biggest lobby colourful and chandeliers  Casino facilities etc Everything was larger than life kind of experience  Free shuttle bus service to and fro ferry terminal  Near all leading Five star hotels and Venetians Hotel Just opposite Eiffel Tower of Parision  Loved this property Amazing Had great time to remember!! ,50

I regulary visit Macao and i always choose to stay at the Sheraton Grand. As always have large luxury clean rooms and very good service with a great spa and fitness room. I would like to mention one of the managers there Mr. Jon Yau who really looked after me as there was some noise from some renovation from the recent hurricane and he quickly moved me to a much better suite with no fuss and is a real credit to the Sheraton brand.  Look forward to visit again soon!  Darren J,50
"We had a really good time at Sheraton Macau, no doubt I would recommend this Hotel to all my friends and others because of its real value for money packages etc. Deluxe Room was really spacious for our family of four and the Bathroom was one of the biggest I have ever come across. They provided us with Milk Bottle warmer and sterilizer, we had also requested for a stroller which was duly provided. All in all it was seriously worth every penny.  However the check in was a real dampener. We were allowed to go to the Special Assistance counter as we were with an infant but on one of the counters the Lady behind took more than 30 mins explaining, laughing and giggling with a couple. Don't know what on earth she was explaining them for so long. This happened on 31st August between 3‚Ä¶",50
I stayed for 3 nights here the hotel is very big and very clean. The staff I found very helpful. The room was very big with bath and shower.  The wifi was ok. Also the view from the window  was really good we was on the 25th floor. We also had room service and the food was very good.  The gym is ok if you like to work out was helpful staff. So on this review I would recommend this hotel.   ,40
"I'm writing this review as a SPG platinum member and the guest from 1-3545 in the first week of Sep 2017.    I've lost count the number of times I've stayed in this hotel. I find the level of service at check-in, housekeeping, and at the Club Lounge consistent and good. Being away from home, I find consistency to be important; at least I know what to expect, and in Sheraton Macao, it has been good to-date. It would have been nicer had the room upgrade is the same as what I got in June 2017 but I understand that's the hotel's prerogative.  A comment for improvement for the Club Lounge is more guidance for its junior staff. I see a few new faces and believe their service level has room for improvement. To the senior staff, thank you for the good service and for remembering me.  I‚Ä¶",50
"Love the hotel!! We stay for 2 nights and we are on the 33rd floor. Really nice view of the area from the top. Its just a few mins walking to the city of dreams and opposite to the Venetians. The hotel interior is very nice and we were amazed the second time we enter the hotel. The staff are friendly and Front Office Manager Mr. Bensum Lo very helpful. The services provided is very good. Overall, it was a great stay and we hope will come back again here and stay longer.",50
"Was at Sheraton Macau Cotai from 2-4 Sept 2017.  Have stayed in this hotel yearly and sometimes more than once a year. As usual, everything was great. Special thanks to Renziehausen, Stefan for the wonderful arrangement made for me and my friends as we were having a celebration there. It made the travel there and stay all the more memorable.  Check in/out: Was a breeze as we did that at the lounge area. We arrived early and were given our rooms promptly.  Rooms: Well appointed. It was clean and looks modern. Toiletries were provided adequately. And, they have changed their complimentary water from the small bottle to the bigger ones which was helpful for making coffee/tea etc. The bed was very, very comfortable and clean, just as what we had anticipated. Window view was also‚Ä¶",50
"I arrived very late in Sheraton after cutting trip from HK. I was very tired from travel and first thing I notice is a warm welcome from the front lines of Sheraton special mention to Wilson Webster who assisted me in my smooth check-in process. I will definitely come back. He made my stay happy one. In hotel industry comparing one hotel to another, room accommodation, facilities are almost the same. The differentiation are the people the behind the Hotel. ",50
"During the 3 days staying, Cleaning service was poor that always not give the water then we requested the cleaning service.but  Sheraton havejust two merits. one is cheap amd another is good where to go other hotel. I am going to macau again I will not stay sheraton.",20
"After lined up over 20 minutes to check-in, the receptionists told us they couldn't find our bookings with 2 rooms. Therefore, we showed them the email confirmation, but they still took another 10 minutes to retrieve our reservation.  However, we were then informed both rooms had been arranged with king bed, which we did request twin beds instead, so they spent another 10 minutes to re-assign the room for us.   My brother already gave them both ID card and credit card once we approached the counter, but the receptionist still asked him if he would like to settle the payment by cash or credit card.   2 receptionists to handle one booking during the whole check-in procedure, it took almost an hour to get our room keys, totally not up to international brand standard.",30
"Rooms are clean and staffs are kind. The free shuttle bus was convenient. But the shopping area has too many luxury shops that it was not convenient to get normal items. For example, in Venetian area there are several kiosks but in the Sheraton area there seems none.  And the food court, we could not use our credit card(visa, master).  The view from the room was good!",40
"The hotel was what I would have expected from the Sheraton Chain. Clean and fairly large rooms. The decor however was not my cup of tea but your mileage may vary. Check-in was a nightmare and reminded me the days of when I visited Vegas with the long queues for check-in. I was also an SPG Gold Elite member and was using the SPG preferred line. What I was unable to see was that there was a SPG Gold and Platinum line but there was little to no signage for it, just a really old and worn out carpet with the SPG Gold and Platinum barely legible. After check-in we proceeded to our rooms, which were quite large and roomy and served me and my friends very well. Unfortunately, due to the damage of Typhoon Hato, the pools were still closed but all other services at the time were up and‚Ä¶",40
"We stayed here along with a good friend in early July. This time we got a suite in the Sky Tower while our friend was also nearby in that Tower but in an Executive Room.The service was as good as ever. Housekeeping had a pair of black shoes completed for shoeshine service for me within quarter of an hour, for instance. The 4th Floor Club was outstanding again. There was a nice Chilean sauvignon blanc on offer from the white wine list.",50
"The room was just perfect, equipped with all the amenities. Sleep quality without any complain, spotless clean, superb location of the hotel - only 7 minutes drive to/from the airport - free shuttle. But due to the fact that it is a massive and insanely busy place, the check-in process takes long time (super long queues!) - almost 40 minutes of waiting. Long waiting time also for the lifts. The hotel asks for quite high deposit (cash or credit card authorization) at the moment of check-in despite even the fact the room was 100% paid. It's advisable to use the credit card because it allows you to speed up check-out process through an electronic machines (no queue - hoooray!). Anyway it is impressive place with great service but if your are not a gambler or shopaholic spending‚Ä¶",40

"Stayed at the  East  tower on the 25th floor which  had  superb view of Wyn palace,Grand Hyatt,MGM and the airport. Excellent  location  as this  hotel is connected  to  land mark properties  in  Cotai  central like the Venetian and Parisian. Great  breakfast spread and convenient shuttle  service  to  move  around Cotai area are extra perks.",50
"Excellent location. Nice view from my room. A lot of entertainments, shopping and good restaurants around. Free shuttle to city and airport. Very pleasant hotel for a short vacation.  We will definitely be staying there when we come back to Macau!",50
"This is a massive hotel with super long check in lines. It's even busier than my downtown office building. This hotel is overflowing with people. Forget about a relaxing holiday here and be prepared for rush hour. Seriously, pay extra for clubroom check-in and keep your sanity.",30
Had a great stay at Sheraton. We were given an upgrade and we got a separate kids room which was the special attraction for kids. Hotel has nice pool and good restaurants. Room service was good too. Staff was courteous and helpful enough.,40
"I had the chance to enjoy a dinner with friends last night at the Bene restaurant in the Sheraton hotel in Macau. The food was really good, but the highlight of the night was Mr. Ronello, who really made us feel very welcomed. It is definitely a place I recommend and no doubt that I'll be back for more Italian delights based on Ronello's recommendations :-)",50
First I would like to say thank you to Ms. Josie Bilag for assisting as in our hotel accomodation and to Ms. Catalina of zin restaurant guest service ambassador for a superb assistance during our breakfast. Our family experience in this hotel is one of the best. I could not as for more. Looking forward to coming back in this hotel for another family vacation.,50
"Everything is here.   Everyone is here. The check in counter was a mile long. Be sure to sign up for a Sheraton membership if you aren't already a member to be able to queue at the courtesy counter. Otherwise spend 2 hours to check in.  Loved the room. We had a vew of the Parisian across the street. Very well appointed room, Sheraton sheets are the best. Awesome bathroom.   Loved the pools and the cabanas with Dreamworks themed decor. Daughter loved them too. Hit the jacuzzi at the end of one of the pools for a little more privacy.   Loved the Dreamworks experience. The parade was very high energy and ny daughter enjoyed interacting with Shrek, Fiona, Poe and all the other cartoons.  Caveat, everything is expensive, be ready with your credit card.",50
"Had a horrific experience with the front security (Subash) at the casino entrance in Sheraton today. Would like to commend and show thanks to Shirley Ho and Ramesh for their kind assistance to the matter. Even though the fault wasn't theirs, they took responsibility and apologised emphatically. Such display of attitude is a true exemplar of how every staff should present themselves. Despite the bad experience caused by the front security, my stay have definitely been tranquillized by their genuineness.   Would also like to thank Jessica Chai for her efficiency, making my check-in a fast and pleasurable one.   Hope the management will recognise and commend their work ethics because that is an important element to retain guests and maintain the good image of Sheraton Hotel Macau.  ",50
"It was a very short stay after the typhoon since my apartment experienced no electric and no water supply. I felt sad to celebrate my bday on a dark evening so I had stayed in the hotel rather. I am very pleased that they had accomodated my early check in request since i told them that I have to go to work at 3. They also provided me with a bday surprise and thank you for the great gesture.  I have to only feedback that upon check in, the agent was very stiff and have not even provided a warm and welcoming one. Did not inform that the pool was closed and room has limitted bath towel so need to call when needed. That would be very great to have this info in advance.  But overall i shd say thank you for a great stay! ",50

Arrived on a rainy day.Literally pouring out after we've checked into our room.Our room was very clean and comfortable.The bathroom was very luxurious and spacey.Thought it would be a pain to stroll around the area in the rain but it really wasn't.The entire Cotai Sands Strip and the neighbouring hotels are connected by air conditioned pedestrian walkways.You can walk to other hotels such as Parisian and Venetian without having a droplet of rain dropping on you.,40
First time to macau. It was 16c. We booked the family suite. My 2 kids were ecstatic!! The other issue for us was the breakfast. Food was below average & staffs were unhelpful. It was also convenient hotel to walk about with outdoor amazing views! ,30
"We had not been to Macau before, but found the Sheraton offered everything we could have wished for.  We loved the Friday night Portuguese BBQ by the Sala Pool, where we received excellent service from Lester.  We enjoyed our breakfasts and a dinner in the Bene restaurant, where the service was attentive and high class.  The Cotai precinct was eye-opening to experience in size, prestige and grandeur.",50
"We had a great stay with friends and family,the hotel is huge with lots of shops on the ground floor,casinos and jewellery shops. Due to the size of this hotel,the number of people throws you off upon arrival but you get used to it with time. The rooms are huge and spacious and the showers are great,excellent water pressure and the beds are comfortable. We enjoyed walking around the hotel in the evening after dinner and had several excursions during the day,we had the pleasure of going to the House of Magic, it was a nice experience. Lots to do and lots to see. Kindly look into this bit :Check in was a bit too long,after a 9hr + flight it could easily ruin the experience if not looked into to. Till next time!",40

We decided to stay on the 26th floor,  with two rooms one with king size bed and the other with two single queen beds.  Besides this the room had a sofa, coffee table, tv and a study table with chair. Even after furnishing it to required levels there was till enough space to put another queen size bed.  The room along with the washroom was spacious beyond imagination, it was actually bigger than my own living area.  The washroom had a closed shower area with a tube to relax in.

"Typhoon Hato swept through Macao, but the staff at the Sheraton, despite having problems of their own, made for a wonderful stay! Catalina, in the restaurant and Mark, the concierge, did an excellent job of keeping us aware, safe and happy with recommendations and accommodating guests. They provided extra dining in the Xin for breakfast and called many places to confirm if the zoo, science museum and Taipa houses were open. I noticed that the housekeeping staff provided a note apologizing that they couldn't change the sheets due to laundry services being down, which I thought was proactive. We ate at Bene and were taken care of by Candy, who was wonderful and accommodating when we decided to change from a carafe to a bottle. I was impressed at how much clean up work was‚Ä¶",40

"The hotel is as you would expect a Macau casino property to be, large, loud, and with all the amenities. It was good for the purpose we went for - overnight stay with access to the casino. Do not expect great service, etc, it's too large for them to manage this effectively (though not bad).",30
This was 1 of an excellent hotel I stayed in Macau on my recent trip... and it has 2 towers... Sky and Earth Tower... Rooms are good and spacious and clean... surely no complaint about that... room service is slow... but it's expected because it's a huge hotel... so a fellow room service guy takes time to come...  The view is also good from the floor I stayed. Their swimming pool is really good and also the Shine Spa.... overall it was a good experience to stay at this hotel... Food is no doubt awesome... I loved the food from Feast Restuarant which is in the lobby... and the Pizzas was just awesome and had excellent taste and not to forget the cakes and pastries... Overall the hotel is really good to stay .. with casinos in the main lobby and the best it's just diagonally‚Ä¶,50
"The Sheraton used to be a fairly decent hotel. It has gone downhill very fast. So many things that make a hotel stay great did not exist here! First of all, we are SPG members, so we SHOULD be able to check in at the SPG counter, but they would not let us check in as we didn't have the card on us at the moment. (Other hotels just refer to email to get it). The checkin service counter people were so rude, they actually told us to 'go away', come back later!  Also, the rooms were not cleaned, nor new supplies replenished. The pool is overcrowded, and a child was actually seen peeing in the pool from the side! All in all, very shoddy service indeed.",20
"We had a great time at Sheraton Macao where we spent 2 days, 1 night. I proposed to my girlfriend on Saturday night during our dinner at Sala Churrasco restaurant. Giulian and his team made our evening unforgettable! They gave us a romantic table far from the others, nicely decorated, by the pool with a great view on the Eiffel tower of the Parisian hotel and a waiter to assist us all night long. We also got the surprise to get a guitarist who played a song for us and a chef who cooked some chorizo in front of us. The food was amazing, very good champagne and wine...I was planning this event for the past 6 months and I have to say it was even better than I could have hoped for!",50
"I recently stayed at this hotel, the price was high and the service was low. They didn't even clean our room or replenish the coffee or tea. The check in experience was horrendous and actually had me near tears by the time everything was finished. I think the hotel is overburdened and don't care about you if you're not from mainland China. I will definitely be taking my visits elsewhere. Not worth spending my hard earned money on a place that I'll be treated like a pain for trying to book a room. ",20

Word that best describes this is hotel: ‚ÄúBIG!‚Äù  PROS :  -	Location - Cotai strip;;  -	Spacious rooms and bathrooms;  -	Good amenities;  -	Great bed and pillows; -	Great breakfast;  -	Great shopping area;   CONS:  - Rooms are a bit dated;	 - Check-in can be a challenge (too big of a wait); - Can be too big (it takes ages to get from one area to the other);   I really enjoyed my stay here - Truly 5 stars!!!!,50
"Booked at Sheraton Macau again for last weekend stay.  The experience this time was rather disappointed.  Being SPG member, I was eligible to check in/check out at their SPG member zone.  At check-in, not sure why, but I spent long time to do the check in (even I've booked the room via hotel website and got their email to remind me to send them my estimate arrival time..etc., I expected it should be a quick process).  Then, was told that the system down and moved different computers.  Requested my non smoking room, however, when I got into the room, OMG, the cigarette smell was very strong and am sure it's stuck with the carpet.  Moreover, I was able to find the burnt stain on the carpet (3-4 spots).  Housekeeping came to use the odor spray to try to cover the 'smell', and then‚Ä¶",30
"Speedy check-in as a SPG member and glad to be served by Ms. Lively, she is friendly and professional. The room was great with superb view of Eiffel tower and the bed was comfy.  Location is convenient as it is connected to shopping mall and other hotels. One of my favorite hotels in Macau.",50
"Rooms not delivered on time, banquet service was rude, unruly and uncooperative. Their banquet manager, a Gagan ----- , actually started shouting and abusing, very uncharacteristic of hotel management, no signs of hospitality at all. Overall a very sad and pathetic experience. Doesn't deserve a 5 star rating. Housekeeping had the slowest service.",10
To start with it doesn't deserve a five star tag because the kind of services they offer to their guest is pathetic ..called several times for towels which never  came called for extra bed which never till 3 am in the morning and above that staff is also very rude ...will try not use this hotel again .the banquet manager Gagan gupta is very rude and didn't accomodate our request !!!,10
"Hotel is very convenient, connected to other hotels and shopping places. Staffs are very friendly and helpful. Hotel  room is clean .  Though it is a very busy hotel , service is consider efficient. U can travel to other places from there conveniently. ",40
"I am still in hotel now. I am in Macau for 7 nights and visited three hotel. Sharaton hotel is one of best for family trip. It is perfect to enjoy inside hotel and many family kind shop, kids shop here which many Korean prefered brand. Bad is short of shuttle bus. Only going airport and ferry terminal and even ends at 10:30PM. I recommend who what a quite swimming pool and do not move other place. ",50
"Been in this hotel four times, Feels like coming home to your own place everytime i'm in Macau for a short vacay. Very homey, staff were so accomodating, Raphael Grafil, one of hotel staff is very kind enough to assists us, introduces hotel amenities & restos to dine in. Very good place to shop. Hotel's room condition are superb, clean, with complete supplies and quick response for your personal needs, one of the best is the fast internet connection. For sure i will recommend this hotel to my friends. See you again soon..",50
"I stayed here for 4 days and really enjoyed my experience. The check in was simple but I did have in room check-in and collection at the airport too. The staff at all levels where fantastic and always helpful no matter what the question was. I have complements for the staff at Palms lounge which I had daily meetings in. The staff are and where great and special thanks must go to the manager Loreileth and her staff Bella, Fancy and Summer who were always very helpful and friendly.  The all-day breakfast is something to behold and both times I had it I enjoyed, tasty and very delicious. The conference centre was very well organised. The handy phone that gives you WIFI no matter where you are was perfect when I was out and about and kept me in touch with everyone I needed to, an‚Ä¶",50
Stayed in this hotel and the facilities are superb. The hotel is consolidated with others in the area so you don't have to go street side to go from one place to another. The air-conditioned walkways allow you to leisurely go window shopping or try the restaurants. Walked all the way to the Venetian and tried their food court there. The housekeeping staff was outstanding in keeping the room neat and tidy. You are greeted with smiles all over the place. One drawback though was the difficulty in communicating with the locals. They still struggle speaking in English so eating out or buying something can be challenging at times.,40
"Have had a chance to visit The Feast and enjoyed the Lunch Buffet, too many people though with children playing (some crying) around. Our table is not the best area but comfortable. All staffs are good with special mention to Genevie Abuel, she is accommodating and attentive to our needs. Overall, it was pleasant.",40
"Great location and very good deal if you come here for holiday. Speed CI/CO service for SPG gold member.üñí Sheraton has a great gym and several nice restaurants. Highly recommend Bene, I am going to write another review for Bene.‚ù§",40
They have a separate area for SPG members for check-in/out which queue is much shorter and faster compared to non-members check-in. We booked 2 rooms and they managed to put us on same floor and very close to each other. They had balloons for kids which was nice to keep the kids happy during check-in.  Room was not as grand or as big as other new hotels in Macau but room was clean and enough for 2 adults and 2kids with a crib in their deluxe room. Price was reasonable included breakfast @ Xin restaurant which had decent food.   Sheraton hotel is at sands resort ... A kids friendly place.,40
"Have stayed here multiple times, and it's probably the best all-around hotel value proposition in Macau. Prices are (for Macau) at the low/budget end, while the pleasant, modern rooms are solid 4-star quality. Location is in the center of the Cotai Strip area, inside the Sands Cotai Central casino/hotels/mall complex, and right across the street from the Parisian and Venetian complexes. A few tips and observations on the facilities:  --The hotel is vast. It is supposedly the largest Sheraton in the world. There are two towers; two elevator/lift lobbies; multiple check-in desks; and all built around the casinos, restaurants and shops. Navigation can be confusing. For first-timers, don't try to wing it; ask for help to find your way initially.  --Two notable restaurants in the‚Ä¶",40

"This is the hotel consist of 4000 rooms, need to spend little time on check-in as many customers, breakfast buffet is average, swimming pool is nice with jacuzzi. I stayed at the suite, the living room is not big, bed room is regular size, but the bath room is great, a hotel suitable for family vacation, not expensive but can offer you vacation feel.",40
"To be honest, this is the most unforgettable birthday that I have ever had. I can never imagine a hotel like Sheraton provided nothing for my birthday, no birthday cards and not even a word of blessing which was very disappointing.  I still remembered we queue for check-in process which kept us waiting for more than half an hour. When we were waiting, I could see there were many staff presented while they refused to open an extra check-in counters ( 3 counters are closed and opened after we had wait for 20 minutes) We bought a package with breakfast, I would say the check in helper had ignored this. If we didn't remind him, he totally forgot and treated us with no breakfast.  For the whole stay, I appreciate the fast speed and response of the housekeeping and customer service‚Ä¶",30
"The hotel is located in Sands Cotai Macau with two towers,namely Earth Tower and Sky Tower.Rooms are spacious and well equipped.Ideal both for adults who may try their luck in casino and kids who may enjoy the swimming pool and the play room.",40
"The price is right, the location is central - what more could you ask for! A lot of people talked about staying at the Venetian which was more than double the price - maybe their rooms are bigger but the Sheraton is nothing to sneeze at either. We had a room with a view of the pools and Studio City - a great view at night with the light show on at Studio City. The hotel is well connected to the Venetian - we pretty much walked the entire strip- the furthest hotels on the Cotai Strip were Studio City and Wynn Palace - which were still walkable if one felt like it, or you could use the free shuttle or get a cab for around 20 HKD  (though cabbies only prefer to be paid in MOP). The breakfast was good- though not a lot of variance in the menu from one morning to another.",40
"My wife and I celebrated our anniversary by staying in the Sheraton Grand Macao Hotel and it was fantastic. We have two small children so we reserved their family room and we were very impressed; it is HUGE with two separate rooms complete with bunk beds. The staff went beyond all expectations by writing ""Happy Anniversary"" in rose pedals on the bed before we arrive, but the highlight of our stay was our 2 hour couples massage at Shine Spa followed by THRILLER LIVE; a spectacular theatrical concert paying tribute to Michael Jackson. It was overall an amazing experience complete with delicious meals at Bene, an upbeat Italian restaurant, for dinner and an extensive breakfast buffet Feast.",50
"A large group of us spent the weekend in Macau and we had a very pleasurable stay at the Sheraton. They were very accommodating to our needs, staff were really friendly and the BBQ buffet was fantastic and a great price. We would definitely go back.",40
"Thanks to Mr. Jetro, the front desk staff of sheraton grand macao hotel for being so kind, for a warm welcome and for giving us the best side of the hotel where we enjoyed seeing the dancing fountain. The room is really conducive for relaxing and i like the express checked out. It saves time. I will definitely want to book again in sheraton grand macao hotel if given another chance to visit macao. Thank you",50
"Hey friends I really liked the place. It was very nice and clean. Lots of things to do here. It also houses casino though casino of Venetian is Grand big.  It is also very cost effective as compared to Venetian. So stay here and enjoy casino at Venetian. All big hotels like Venetian, sheraton, Holiday inn are inter connected so it feels like city in itself",50
"Definitely by far the best decision we made in terms of redeeming Airmiles rewards for this room. Despite it being just a deluxe room, it was extremely spacious and the room itself was bigger than any other hotel I've stayed at so far.   Location: Located along the so-called strip of hotels, the location of the building itself is definitely in the middle however, Sheraton is located at the end of this building so it's a walk to get to if you're coming from either end of the intersections. The good side is that this requires you to walk through the collaborating building of Conrad and Holiday Inn and you'll get a chance to explore those hotels while being indoors.   Room: Ok let's be real. When I mentioned that this was the largest room that I've stayed in, the washroom will feel‚Ä¶",50
I stayed for Two days. The hotel is really amazing. The Room And the staff is really good. The Only thing Thats not good is the big que to check inn. Prepare to stay 1 hour i que to check inn. And Its a litle bit confusing the first time you Take the elevator. But u see staff And security everywhere Who is happy to assist you,40
The restaurant is spacious however there is less selection of food. Family with small children will surely enjoy because of the kids friendly dessert. The staff are friendly and accommodating especially Genevieve. She patiently assist us on our needs and responds our inquiry. Nice talking to you Genevieve Abuel.. You are very suited to service industry..,50
"I was travelling with my kids, husband and mum. Took us 2 hours to checkin because we arrived on a very busy Friday. I liked that they have ammenities that my kids could enjoy like the dreamworks parade. The rooms were neat and spacious but there‚Äôs something about the smell that I cant figure out about. The attendants in the lobby were two things. I asked a guy where the toilet was and he just pointed it with his mouth without saying anything as if im interrupting a very important conversation with his buddy. The guy Martin was a different story. Assisted us with our luggage and was really nice and friendly. He made a connection with us by talking in french when he noticed the tag in our luggage. His english was also really good for an Asian. He told us the best places to visit‚Ä¶",30
"Located at a very beautiful cotai strip bang opposite the Venetian. A big and beautiful mall at the bottom along with a casino in the premises shared with other hotels like the holiday inn. Very good service,a little slow but manageable.neat, clean, well furnished interiors and spacious bathrooms with all the required necessities. A Mobile was provided with required pre loaded listings of everything to do with Macau ,also which can double up as your portable wifi by using its hotspot facility anywhere.only drawback was that it was too slow. Pros: Great location Spacious rooms and bathrooms Beautiful interiors Good wifi Cons:  Nothing to complain about actually",50
"Well if you are looking for casino, shopping and plenty of activities you can just stay in any hotel in Cotai area. Sheraton Grand is one choice. Nice outlets like Palms, Bene and Xin. Great service especially at the pool. If you look to be accommodated properly ask for Angga. Great guy. However, rooms are a bit outdated although they are big. If I will come back? Sure",40
Longest checked in I had but staff were nice. Try XIN hotpot restaurant and look for Catalina-she will ensure you'll have a memorable dine. Relax and unwind on their swimming pools and be assisted by Angga-very friendly and accommodating. Recommended to stay in Macau.,50
"This is a review of the superb customer service experience during reservation enquiries via phone and email communications. Reservations Agents Rachel Fu, Yvette Ye and Shelly Li had given much needed reassurance that our upcoming family holiday will be nothing but the best. The information and clear explanations provided regarding room categories, joining rooms, theme breakfast, shuttle bus, kids/elderly friendly arrangements, check-in, etc helps to reduce the stress of planning a perfect family holiday. In fact, it was their genuine and friendly service that made a difference in selecting between many hotels - eventually choosing Sheraton over Okura, Hyatt, Sofitel, Galaxy, etc. Now, just weeks away from our travel dates, I am really excited to visit Macau and stay at Sheraton!",40
"I was here for a 3-day business trip, attended a convention. Seamless transaction during Check-In and Check out, rooms does not smell cigarette smoke and were kept clean. Housekeeping concerns were immediately attended.   The Palms lounge located at the hotel lobby had great selection of TWG teas, paired with their yummy cakes and pastries. Did not have a hard time talking to the staff since most of them speaks well in English.",50
"The hotel is part of the Sands Cotai Central, and is situated right opposite the Venetian within 10 min walk. We took the Sands Cotai Central (SCC) free shuttle bus from Taipa Ferry Terminal and reached within 15 min. The check-in process was a breeze, and receptionist was friendly to point out some places we might like to visit. We stayed in the Sky Tower (there are two towers: Sky and Earth) on 24th floor, non-corner, non-smoking Deluxe room facing the Conrad Macao. The room was spacious, clean and tidy. The bathroom had a separate shower and bathtub with all toiletries provided. There was also a vending machine along the corridor that sells food, drinks and some essentials. Value-for-money for such a luxurious experience. Overall a very pleasant stay in Sheraton Macao, highly‚Ä¶",50
Recently took advantage of the summer package at the Sheraton. Overall this package is great value for money. We stayed in the executive suite which was a good size for a family of four. Overall service was great. And there is lots for kids to do. In addition the room attendant was also excellent. I would highly recommend this hotel. And will be back again soon.,40
"This could be the largest Sheraton property. There is free shuttle from the ferry terminal to the hotel. The check in is pretty cumbersome. There was a long queue. The rooms were pretty big, clean and comfortable. There are food/soft drink/essential dispensers in the corridors. The food court was quite expensive though. The house keeping was extremely helpful. One night (very early in the morning, rather), we faced certain issues with electricity. On informing, the issue was immediately addressed.  There are multiple pools (I guess around 14) of various sizes. You are provided with pool towels, free of cost. We enjoyed the poolside barbecue, as well. I will always remember this hotel as the place, where I tried my hands at a casino for the first time.",50
"Stayed in suite for one night, the unit are big. Abit rush for the stay to maximize the ultilities. Good control of smoking area thus you don't smell ciggrate all the times. Price are reasonable for the stay.",40
"There is a shuttle at the ferry but no signage for Sheraton, need to ask someone there.   This huge hotel took almost an hour to check in, very long queue and each queue also take such a long time.The hotel need a lots more check in counter.  Room are spacious and clean with a nice pool view. Compare with the price of venetian, I still go for Sheraton.",30
"This should be my fifth time staying in this hotel. We booked an Executive suite and they upgraded us to a Deluxe suite (perhaps nobody booked large rooms in this middle-class hotel). Compared to the rooms that I stayed in during my last visits, this one was a bit dirty and old. The bathroom, especially, was a bit rusty. Also, the hotel is extremely crowded and noisy, which is not welcoming to hotel guests. Don't stay in this hotel. If you stay in this hotel, remember to book a room with access to Executive club lounge for better service and fewer people.",30
"We have already been several times in Macau and our last stay in Sheraton was so far the worst.  The facilities are great and well maintained, that's not the problem.  When we arrived we had to wait around 1h45 before being able to check-in.  They mention that it's possible to checking starting at 3PM. We managed to reach our room at almost 5PM. Our plan was to enjoy of the swimming pool in the afternoon.... we arrived at the swimming pool when the sun was almost already gone (and the swiming pool was closing at 6PM...).  Everything seemed normal for the staff... that was not very helpful.  That's the first time that we experience such a bad service in an Hotel of that standing. We were all very disappointed. We understand that Sheraton Macau is huge hotel but that's not normal‚Ä¶",20
I love everything about the hotel. Made sure to buy everything in the nearest supermarket by taxi ride because there's no convenience store nearby. The hotel room has everything. Our room was very clean and comfortable. Staff are great and helpful. We love our stay.,50
I stop there for waiting friends to come.  The staff were very attentive and friendly. Specially Thank you Angra and Lester:) we had a very interesting talk and I didn't wanna go. I would definitely be back again and recommend this place to all my friends. ,50
"Had a great birthday memories in Sheration last month 20/7!! Sheraton relations team was so helpful and replies email promptly!! It was a birthday celebration trip for my husband and so I requested a better view room. The room i booked is only deluxe room, but it was so amazing that they arranged a great upgrade to the executive suite!! The suite was so big with a great bath tub. All furniture and renovation looks like newly furnished.  Apart from it, Sheraton staff also arranged a tasty birthday cake with a sweet birthday cake for us! We must come back next time!!! ",50

The room is big, clean and tidy. The staff are polite and helpful. The shopping malls are a bit crowded but it is usual for Macau. There is bus stops nearby the hotel which is quite convenient.",40
"Nice as always, this is our 3rd time stay already. Previously we stayed in Suites for birthday celebration, but this time was an ad hoc trip to stay in standard room that book by our friend.  Great location as usual, foot bridge connected to Venetian and Parisian. Room size is adequate among Macau hotels, and good to have Handy for free network on the street.   We found that SPG members can enjoy 20% discount in 5 restaurants in Cotai city, and we tried buffet in Feast this time. Great appreciation to Ivy who take care us very well and offering us seamless service, even  she's very busy around on Sunday night.  The only negative thing is the queue for check in on Sunday is too long, every one waited almost 30 mins, but I could see that Front Desk worked very hard, as almost all‚Ä¶",50

Was here on late July 2017 for a Ruckus Big Dog conference. Smooth check in (dedicated counter for conference-goers) with crowded lobby with endless people. Large casino (and expensive too!). There is a mall attached to it with high-end branded ware and Mcdonalds too. Lotsa restaurant option but pricey. Room is large and the bathroom is larger! Good toilet amenities and cleanliness is top notch. Room view is some empty field. Lift is fast. Food served in conference was good and aplenty. Its a large hotel and you might get lost within the maze.,40
"Despite management's claim that they are trying to improve their check-in process, the line to check-in is still indeed one hour. The clerks were pleasant and apologetic but there is absolutely no excuse for any professional hospitality group to not have planned for accommodating their room capacity - certainly not an established company like Sheraton and certainly not one well past their opening days.   That's lack of hospitality, a nuisance, but what's inexcusable is the lack of housekeeping!  We stayed for three nights and had been offered the ""eco-friendly"" option of trading in housekeeping for a late checkout. Since we are Marriott Rewards members (late check-in already a given) with supposed reciprocity with SPG, we asked for housekeeping. The first two days, we had no‚Ä¶",20
We stayed at Sheraton for 2 nights. Check-in took an hour inspite of us being an SPG member. There wasn't any place to rest/sit in the reception area while we were waiting for our turn to check-in.  The front desk staff was not at all warm and flexible during check in. Same was the case with staff at luggage and conceirge service - they were neither friendly nor helping. We were greatly disappointed with the service.  The room allocated to us was modern and clean but not luxurious. There are other better hotels to choose from at Cotai center.  They had a mobile phone for guests to use inside and outside the hotel area. It provided unlimited internet access and both local and international calls (to 10 or 12 pre-listed countries).

"This is the world biggest Sheraton which provides good variety in entertainments and foods; while i found more than often the bigger hotel cannot maintain consistent service, Sheraton Macau is a pleasant exception. The check in line was long, but the staffs were very courteous and thorough, also went beyond her regular duty to ensure our needs are met. Also the housekeeping staffs were very efficient and polite too, which was a big surprise! The only minor complaint was about the shuttle -- it provides shuttle bus to both ferry terminal and airport, which was great.

"Overall, we enjoyed our stay at the Sheraton Grand, particularly the accommodating and pleasant demeanor of three of our Guest Service Ambassadors, Wilson, Webster, and Paula. They were incredibly helpful and were able to give us advice that greatly contributed to our stay in Macau, offering us directions and tips on the best places to visit. They were also kind enough to upgrade our room to the Executive Suite. As such, we were able to enjoy our stay at the Sheraton Grand quite well and comfortably. We would like to acknowledge them once again, Wilson, Webster, and Paula, for their wonderful service, and we extend our many thanks to them and the Sheraton Grand for our enjoyable stay.",50
"The hotel was clean and well maintained, and staff were outstanding. Nothing was too much trouble for any of them. Lots of variety in terms of eating and shopping, and the connection to the Parisian and Venetian hotels mean that you're never short of restaurant choice. There are regular shuttle buses to main transport hubs, but we caught the local buses from the stops outside to other areas in the city. The buses are cheap, frequent and entertaining. Our room in the Earth Tower was a very long walk from the pool, but maybe this is a good thing as it burns off calories? We definitely ate a lot of Macau's stunning food! Tip: Try the Portuguese tarts in the food court.",50

Sheraton has always been our top choice in Macao whenever we travel with our young toddlers. Check in was a breeze if you are Spg member else the main reception looks pretty crowded at all times. We booked the executive suite this round and were offered a complimentary upgraded to family suite. Everything was perfect! The kids loved the bunk bed and the cute little amenities in their own washroom. Try  to get the club rooms if you can. It's totally worth it! The breakfast buffet at the club lounge were good and far better than the war zone at the Feast.

Sheraton. Big hotel. Summer crowds. I was bracing myself. But was pleasantly surprised.   Check in: massive queues. Separate area for spg members. But still loads of people.

Lama take care of us the whole time, Raymund one of the managers also approached our table and check if we are happy, he explained more about mercato and they doing it every last weekend of the month featuring different regions of Italy I strongly recommend mercato in bene is a must try if happened to be you're in macao on the end of the month.",50
I have stayed here many times and have often been bothered by communication problems and things not going write.  I can really see they have upgrade their customer service.  I was staying in one of their large suites that even has an entertainment room that I like the room is very nice wit a good view and nice bathroom.  They have a bunch of pools and as I have discovered on other trips to Asia this summer lots of families liek to stay at the Sheraton.  You will be overwhelmed with no seats in the club lounge for cocktail and snacks.  It has many small pools that families take over preventing you from swimming. The location is great with easy access to the Cotai stip. It has a nice health club.,50

We found out the next day that the initial breakfast restaurant had more choices of food.  Because it was so busy, getting service can be challenging.  We were saved by Ivy (thanks Ivy), she was attentive and efficient, and she was helping us with a smile, which I really appreciate as most of the other staff looked like they were forced to be there.

"My wife and I had a pleasant stay in Sheraton Grand Macao Cotai . Hotel had good location with clean rooms and very friendly and helpful staff. We also enjoyed the buffet breakfast at Xin hot pot restaurant on the ground floor. Good food and friendly restaurant staff , special mention to Supervisor Catalina for her added efficiency and good service.  We would surely come back to stay here and will highly recommend to our friends . ",40
"I attended conferences in venetians a few times and it's my first time to attend conference in Sheraton. Although it is not as exciting as the other venue like studio 8 that has a ferries wheel or Parisian that has an Effiel tower, it is a good business hotels with lots of room to do big or small meetings.  Food is better than usual conference food. Room is spacious. I do have problems with my door access card where this happens to a few people but not a lot of people have this problem.",40
Ideally located at the heart of Macau and it is interconneded to the other resorts nearby which makes it very convenient to malls and restaurants. Excellent view and the rooms are nice too. It is a big resort and it has its drawbacks.  Don't expect room service or house keeping at your convenience they are pretty slow.  But overall worth the price. ,40
"We are SPG Platinum members and we are deeply disappointed with this hotel. We came here for some rest and relaxation but instead of relaxing by the pool, the security at the pool has been haranguing us nonstop. They have a new (and STUPID) policy where if your child is under 140cm, they MUST wear arm bands and an adult MUST be in the pool with them. Our children are (unfortunately) under 140cm but they are all on the swim team, having years of (very expensive) swim lessons that they could probably save me from drowning in the ocean if they had to, yet because of their height, they cannot swim and play in the pools by themselves. After an hour of arguing that they cannot make us go into the pool with them, they have to be in our line of sight. The Sheraton has multiple small‚Ä¶",10
"Stayed in several big hotels in Macau before, I quite like Sheraton except from a few things,  The check in was taking quite a long time, I timed it was around 10 minutes per reservation, some take longer. There was a very long queue. The services was very nice tho. And they were really trying to help, giving you suggestion and all, you could say it's time well spent. But then again their check in time is 3pm, which is quite late, for us was fine as we went to Macau too many time we was just looking to chill,  but if you are on right schedule and wanting to grab every second to see everything.... you might spend quite a lot of moment queuing for check in. We have waited in the queue around 30 to 40 min give or take.  Their TV was quite bad signal.... as we were just relaxing so‚Ä¶",40
"Stayed here for 2 nights for business this week and the hotel truly exceeded all my expectations. I was upgraded to the Executive Suite upon check-in (which obviously made the stay automatically X times better!), but it was actually the service of the staff that impressed me most. The staff (specifically the event/ conference ones) were extremely attentive and helpful throughout our 2 meeting days. As a new mom who's breastfeeding, I needed to pump every few hours. The staff (Rosa?/ Male) who was looking after our meeting was very helpful in terms of helping me find a room to comfortably pump in as well as storing my milk in a proper fridge. I really appreciated his efforts!   The food options were very good at the hotel as well. We had the hotpot lunch at Xin and breakfast‚Ä¶",40
I am a platinum member and stayed your hotel many times.  I want to thank you your staff Ms Lively Liu.  This is the second time I met her.  She is so smart and always smiling.  Feel so comfortable.  Hope to see her next time.,40
Very nice hotel but only one thing must be remembered and pay attention to  Check in time !  Either you go there to do the ore registration provided no need to queue. Then come back after 3 to collect your room key.   Otherwise you are expect to wait for hours to finish your check in procedure. I don't understand nowadays with the technology what Sheraton did not offer e check in service.  Since they are so popular otherwise it's not worth to pay over 1000 dollars for such short period of time.  Since check in time after 3. Mostly you will be able to get the room around 4 and check out time is 11am next day. The rest of the facilities are meeting the standard.,30
"We stayed at Sheraton for 5 nights and we ate hotpot at Xin's on two nights...it's that good, you'll regret it if you don't eat there when you're in Macau. Just talking about Xin makes me hungry and want to eat it but nothing like that exists in Australia. The service received from Catalina is exceptional...haven't seen this kind of customer service in a long time. Actually it's very rare to come across!  So don't miss this restaurant if you're in Macau everyone....enjoy! we definitely did...",50
"Its not my 1st time i stayed in this hotel but the worst experience i have ever had. I booked the cotai view room and assigned to the normal deluxe room which was HKD500 difference on the room type. The check in staff was not helpful and especially when i asked if there any pamphlet for the restaurants provided that the sheraton is connected with other hotels as we want to stay in the block such that my colleague and i can work in the restaurant. He gave me a look and asked me to go to the concierge, so i did and got a quite not useful one as the map was for the Venetian chain.  After i got into my room, my blanket was dirty and i have to call the operator to send someone over to change it while i was out for dinner.  It was 12am when i back to my room and ready to bed, 2 rooms‚Ä¶",20
"i normally wouldn't write anything but i think it's useful for other parents to know about a few things.   My husband and I stayed in Sheraton Macau over the weekend and I felt the good comments i read previously was quite misleading. In conclusion, it's not a baby friendly hotel.   First of all, it takes forever to check in, we arrived at the hotel around 12 pm, they said the check in time is 2pm but my baby needs to take her nap soon, so i asked if they would allow me to check in first, and they said i could try at the SPG member check in counter, i waited in the line for half and hour and only to find out it's not possible until 2pm. so i had to come back at 2 and waited in the line for another 45 mins before we could get our key.. and baby has become over tired and cranky,‚Ä¶",20
"We are a party of three, including an elder in wheelchair.  We experienced a smooth transfer,  fast check-in at the room instead of queuing at the reception.  The room is spacious. The view is gorgeous.  Washroom is specially designed for elders/disabled with shower chair, hand rails and raised toilet seat.   I find it very useful to have a free local mobile phone for calls and wifi hotspot.  Customer service personnel at Concierge was very helpful to assist us as my mom lost her wallet during the ferry journey.  They helped us calling the ferry company and reported the case.  Since T8 typhoon Roke swept Hong Kong yesterday and all ferry services HK/Macau suspended, they extended our check out time.  All in all a wonderful experience.  Will certainly stay at Sheraton again on‚Ä¶",50
"we were on business trip, hence the 8 rooms were booked under one name. Nevertheless, the hotel staff did ask for each of our passport to be scanned into the system to identify which room for which person. On the 3rd night, exactly at 2am, the room key for unknown reason was deactivated. Went to the reception only to be told that they need confirmation from the person whom the name was booked under, until then the key could not be issued! It was 2 am, you have a copy of our passport, the person whom the booking was under could not be contacted. It was ridiculous and at 2am , we were not pleased. Sheraton needs to improve this. It is very inconvenient esp when it was not even our fault. Other than that we are pleased with the location and the state of the room.",40
"Was here on a business conference, and Sheraton is huge with 2 towers.  Walking from one to another or even to the conference rooms could be tiring.  The hotel is pack with tourists, with long check-in queue and noisy lobby.  Guess this could be similar situation for all well known hotels in Macau.  At the Cotai strip, most hotels belong to the same owner and are well linked to one another.  Thus walking to Conrad, Holiday Inns, Venetian, Four Seasons and Parisian are all link.  Full of shopping venues and affordable food courts.  Room at Sheraton is huge and comfortable, and noise insulation is perfect for a good night sleep.  The concierge is especially helpful in assisting us finding excellent local foods.",50
"Sheraton Macau is conveniently located in the middle of Sands casino, it's the biggest Sheraton I've been to.  Club Lounge is huge and interior is nice and well-maintained.  Given the size of the hotel, I still got really good service from the entire crew, from house keeping to concierge and check-in.    The service by Joe Huang is particularly great, he tried his best to cater to my preferences (I'm SPG Platinum), patiently explained the details for the facility (which is quite impressive) and recognized my status.  Given the complexity (multiple wings and elevators), Joe went into great length and details, which I really appreciate.  It's incredible that a hotel this size can provide such personalized service.  Thanks Joe for your hospitality.",50
"After our last complaint and very negative feelings during our stay we were contacted by email and assured the experience will not repeat again. A month later we stayed again at the Sheraton Macau ,Cotai Central. We were asked to use the 4th floor executive lobby to avoid issues with checking in.This time everything went smooth. Check in 5 minutes time staff friendly and attentive. Room was superior with a nice fruit basket and welcome note from Alrie which was handled nicely.Room was clean, tidy and we had absolutely no issues this time, keep it up Sheraton team !",50
"Check in at the club lounge was slow.  Might be understaffed.   However the staff was polite and courteous.  Our room was on a higher floor.  It was roomy and clean.  The reason I gave a 3-star rating was the poor design of the shower and the breakfast situation.  First, there was no shower mat (you have to ask housekeeping for one).  Otherwise it was very slippery.  No handle bar.  Also water ran outside the shower door because of the shallow ledge.  Secondly, there was not enough table for breakfast seating in the lounge.  We finally found a table but was next to the outside area where people went in and out causing a draft.   Food was ok.",30
"nice stay with friends. The room is clean and spacious.  free mobile for guests to use in macau, very handy and convenience. There is a bit slow when checking in, and also check in time is quite late at 3pm.",40
"Although looked huge hotel, we went back to eat restaurant  ""Bene"" Italian restaurant: first night on our arrival after checked in heavy rain outside. We tried this restaurant. People there are from many many countries, but their nice smile and food for appetizer oyster were so fresh, and crab from a Hokkaido Japan. Main meat was cooked in a special tool for over 12hours, so smooth so soft melting in the mouth with the special sauce. Wine we choose was not what we wanted, immediately they brought what they recommend to go with the dish. Not pricy good for dinner. We had lunch next day in there. They remembered what we like ( very unlike for that sized big restaurant) Italian chef is new but he I hear from famous hotel chef for years. Good to listen what he recommended even ‚Ä¶",50
"First, the good news: Most of staff we interacted with, with the exception of the grumpy, over-worked concierge lounge people, were friendly and responsive--within their province. The bad news, there weren't enough of them. The rooms were clean. The bathrooms very small.   But my biggest complaint was the price gouging. I attended a conference with a group rate and decided to stay on to enjoy a weekend in the city. I asked my daughter and friends to join me. In order to accommodate this, I needed to make a second reservation and decided to do so on the club floor. My friends booked the club floor themselves for the same weekend. Once I arrived at the hotel I decided the room I was given was adequate and asked to change the reservation, cancelling the second and extending my stay‚Ä¶",20
The slowest check in I have ever experienced. It was the long weekend in China so understandably busy but then the hotel did things like closing one of the pools which did not make sense. Pool ran out of towels no drinks etc.,20
"Like other Sheraton hotels, the rooms are very spacious and clean. Toilet was also very spacious and have a separate bath tub.   One of the feature that amazed me was that the room has a mobile phone called handy located on the desk for us to use in and outside the hotel area! The phone has different recommendations on where to go and what to do around in Macau. and the most wonderful thing about this phone is that it provides unlimited internet access and both local and international calls (we tried to call back to HK and it worked). This feature was just wonderful and had lighten up my stay with Sheraton!  Highly recommended!",50
"The Sheraton Cotai is a very good hotel. One of the more inexpensive hotels on Cotai Strip but very nice. It is a bigger hotel with casino, restaurants, shopping mall etc. Location is very good as it is right on the Cotai Strip and connected to the network of the Cotai Strip. Rooms are very big and very clean. Not luxurious but modern, newer, and updated. The AC climate controls worked excellent since it is a newer modern hotel. AC climate control is often overlooked but in Macau, Hong Kong, and China it is a very important aspect to rooms comfort. Free WiFi. Pretty good pool area with several pools and towel service. Shuttle buses are not as numerous and frequent as some of the bigger hotels on Cotai Strip but you can always catch a shuttle to another hotel and walk over. Very‚Ä¶",40
"My parents and I visited Macau for a couple of days and stayed in the Sheraton. It was very easy to get to the hotel, both by the shuttle bus and by public transport.  Everyone at the Sheraton was amazing. Staff could speak several languages, but English seemed to be the most common. They were all very polite and well mannered and well dressed. There was nothing of fault in the rooms, staff, or general areas either. We stayed in two twin rooms, both with spacious bathrooms and great services. The beds had silk covers, making it a very comfortable sleep.  The air conditioning in the room was wonderful too, as it changed immediately after you change the settings. Furthermore, each room provides free coffee and tea, along with a kettle, mugs and a hairdryer. The rooms were‚Ä¶",50
"Good value. Pretty decent service and a good location in Cotai. I'd stay at the Sheraton Macau again, and would recommend to anyone looking for a good value hotel. I paid up for the deluxe suite, which was huge. Definitely worth the extra money.",40
I was having a two-day trip to Macau in early June.  This hotel is well connected to both Outer Pier and Taipa Pier as door-to-door shuttle bus service is provided.  The room is pretty wide while there is a good scenery.  The check-in process was pretty fast that I did not need to wait for a long time for check-in (probably it was Friday afternoon).  I would definitely choose to stay there again when I go to Macau.,50
"I recently booked two rooms to celebrate my wife's birthday and requested the possibility to check-in early. The staff during check-in were very fast and efficient, and we did not wait long until we were able to go up to our rooms to put our bags down and get ready for the day ahead.   The room was large enough, bright, and clean. I definitely loved the bathroom - with an enclosed shower area and separate bathtub, it was also a bit larger than standard. A couple of minutes later, the doorbell rang and we were greeted by a member of the staff with a box of madelines for my wife and a birthday greeting card.  It was also a plus that the hotel was connected to other hotels and made it easier for us to go around. The concierge staff was also very helpful when we were asking for‚Ä¶",40

"This time we booked a family room and had a pleasant stay at Sheraton. Room size was big, price was reasonable, services was good, good location. especially of the handy room in the room this time that we can have a free call back to Hong Kong to catch up with my family. We will visit Sheraton again for the next trip to Macau and hope can leave good comments again.",50
"First things first, check in was great. Huge queues but the SPG area was swift and efficient.   Facilities are good, but not a huge amount for kids besides the pools.   Pool area is nicely done. Lots of small pools with varying depths. Didn't like told kids MUST wear armbands though. That should be my decision. Also rather odd was the dozens of ""security"" staff around the pool but no lifeguards. Presumably an insurance thing.   Breakfast was great... But took about 10 minutes to get to. And I'm not exaggerating. The scale of the hotel is incredible.   There are a ton of different entrances. And it's impossible not to get lost! Being a casino, it's designed to disorientate you, and it does! Just to get to the check in desk from the shuttle bus drop off was a good few hundred‚Ä¶",40
Booked directly with the hotel online and arrived before my expected timeframe. There was already long line even for SPG member designated area.

The staff who took care of me had no problem even I could only show him the screen capture of my membership upgrade notice. Late check-out. / Room upgrade (high floor w tower view of the nearby Parisan) / and detailed instruction for complimentary breakfast (voucher / venue) The most wonderful thing is he could recognize me the next day at check out !

A short trip to Macau having an affordable stay at a luxury hotel to get fully charge. One more counter for SPG members to check-in / check-out. Connected shops and restaurants help as I just want a relaxing time to recharge myself before visiting family members living in Macau.,40
My wife and I stayed there for 2 nights in April this year.  We were pleasantly surprised how attentive the staff were to our needs and eager to please. We found our bedroom so relaxing to be in that we wished we could have stayed one more night. The food was equally  superb and had the variety to suit all tastes.,40
"My husband and I stayed at Sheraton for his birthday celebration and we are very grateful with almost all the staff. Upon check in, guy named Alrie started our wonderful day with his sweet smile plus a fast and hassle free check in process. And because it was my husband's birthday, the management was generous enough to upgrade our room and they even sent him a gift with personalized card.   Every request that we had was immediately granted. We couldn't ask for more.   One thing irritated me is upon check out, the guy who checked us out is a bit rude in my opinion. He was a chinese guy. The way he conversed with me isn't same as other staffs were, who is polite and warm. So it was a great checking in but a thumbs down upon checking out.

"I have just spent 2 nights at the Sheraton with my friends and had a good stay. The hotel lobby area is nice and spacious even though it's pretty busy. The staff was very friendly indeed and the room was comfortable with the big and clean bathroom, if slightly old fashioned in their decoration. House keeping was good and efficient.   Have tried two outlets in this hotel - Feast for the buffet and Xin for the hot pot. The Feast was fabulous with a huge choice of seafood - everything you could think of, lobsters, oysters, salmons and a wide selection of desserts, you name it and it's there.

"I went to Macau solo from July 1-3. It was a great experience. When I got to the lobby after arriving via the ferry terminal bus, I patiently waited for about an hour to check in. It was a holiday in Hong Kong during that week, so the line was long.   Anyway, I approached the receptionist who was very professional and patient. She told me the room wasn't available, so I had to wait another hour. I finally got the room, but they compensated me with a free late checkout on my last day.   The best thing about Sheraton Cotai is the convenience, location and most importantly, the affordability of the hotel. The other casino hotels besides Holiday Inn and Sheraton are overpriced in my opinion. I had breakfast at Feast and it was delicious.   As a tip, I recommend spending some extra‚Ä¶",50

The staff over there are really enthusiastic, especially Christen Wu. She gave us a free upgrade to a suite, and that suite is enormous. The food in the lounge is magnificent, especially during happy hours. Location is prefect, very close to a shuttle bus station that can go to Macao peninsula and to the Lotus Checkpoint or Border gate. If I visit Macao again, I would stay here. ",50
"I was locked in the room on my first night there due to the faulty lock and my friend who came back to the room later was locked out. Took the maintenance/staff almost 40 minutes to dismantle the lock from outside. Staff at the reception didn't give priority to my call when I informed him that I was locked in my room. I had to call twice.  I was given a different room but no compensation whatsoever was offered to me until we asked. As a 5 star hotel, I believe they can do better.",30

What I can say about this hotel. Everything is perfect!! I was staying in this hotel during my duty trip with my group last June. Check in process was easy and the FO staff was very cooperative.

From check-in to the phone operator, room service attendant to check-out, everybody was courteous and made sure I had everything I needed. The Sheraton Grand Cotai Central is definitely my choice hotel in Macau.  Thank you for a great stay!",50
Spacious room with a wonderful view of the Cotai strip. The hotel is well connected with the rest of the casinos (e.g. Venetian and Parisian) as well as a short walk to the City of Dreams. The room offered a free internet phone that allows you to be connected outside of the hotel - but the one in my room failed to work. In terms of food - there are many high end restaurants to be had - so don't expect anything in the lower end range (even the food court prices are extravagant at best). Easy access to the  airport and/or ferry by complimentary shuttle buses - this is a good (and pricey) getaway.,40
Overall it's a good experience to stay in Sky Tower of Sheraton. Especially to dine in the Xin restaurant with very nice hospitality from Catalina. We did enjoy the food and to go twice within 2 days.,30

At that moment, I was very disappointed since no other guests over there and I wonder whether the staff there don't know how to do check in. Other hotels that I stayed before would allow me to do the registration and assist with luggage. Well... but no such service in Sheraton Macao.

"To start off this hotel made a terrible impression when I had to cue up for 50 minutes to check in.    While this hotel has a rather large casino in the middle they fail to make space to accommodate their guest in their breakfast halls often seeing out their customer in 30 minute cues just to get seated in the breakfast buffet. Furthermore they fail to realise that many guests have cued up for much time and they very quickly start removing the breakfast buffet at 10:30 resulting in many not receiving the package they paid for.

The Check-in service is a bit slow as by waving hands to get attention of the queuing customers. Dated! I got my room upgraded to an Executive Suite on 35/F as part of  birthday staying without charges. A really comfortable room with sitting room. Neat and Clean. There is a surprise,  after we finished watching the show of  ""Monkey King"" and got back to our suite. A handwritten birthday card and a box of Madeleine were placed on the coffee table. Thanks for the Guest Relation Term of Sheraton Grand Macao Hotel , Cotai‚Ä¶",40
"We stayed in this hotel on my sister's birthday. The Guest Relations Team was kind enough to prepare something in such short notice to make that day special. One of the team (I think named Josie) with her very genuine smile who also helped us check-in was kind enough to escort us to  the elevator and shared some valuable information that made our stay memorable. So from my family to yours, Thanks to you and the entire team!",50
We stayed in Sheraton Macau for a day with my family. Upon check-in Josie Bilag from Guest Relations was kind enough to listen to my request. She was also kind with our kid and gave him a tumbler with characters. The room was quite spacious for us with a great view. Would definitely come back again.  Note: They do have 4000+ rooms so you should expect long queue specially during weekends,50
"I stayed here for a business trip in Feb of 2017.  The hotel was an excellent place to stay for my business trip.  I was greeted upon check in and recognized for my status.  I was upgraded to a suite room on a higher floor.  There was a nice dessert waiting for me in the room   The rooms were nice and the bed was super comfortable.  The staff was very friendly and the food was good.  We ate in the main restaurant for the lunch buffet.  The choices were plentiful with western and local options.  The gaming area was nice and if you are into gambling, can have some fun.  Overall, I would recommend this hotel for a business trip.",40
We celebrated our 32 years of anniversary at Sheraton Macao recently. We were very delighted to receive the first class service from the hotel staff during our 2 nights stay at this beautiful hotel. We have great time of enjoying excellent breakfast and amenity surrounding the hotel. This is the perfect place for you to celebrate your important date with your love.,50
"We had a great stay in this hotel with my friends. I would like to mention Ms. Vicky Yi from the SPG Reception who is very professional and friendly. On that day when a typhoon supposed to hit Macau, we had an abrupt changes on our plan where we decided to stay for another night and Ms. Yi made it sure that we won't be hassled of moving to another room since I have to make a new booking. We appreciate so much this service and extend it to Ms. Yi our appreciation.",40
"Great hotel in a great location, excellent value for money. We stayed for 2 nights in June, in the middle of a typhoon,  so couldn't go out but it didn't matter. The hotel complex is vast with a central area of shops, restaurants, coffee bars and casinos. Lots of other hotels connect to the central mall so easy to explore and enjoy the different themed hotels. Would definitely recommend.",40
"Whenever I am in Macau, I will dine at Xin hot pot restaurant.  My mom loves it.  The food is great especially during weekend with extensive cooked food, i.e. congee, barbacue etc.  Most of all, the service there is excellent.  Catalina leads a great team.  All the staff are great, very attentive and always have a pleasant smile on their face.",40
Well appointed & large hotel/casino with all the facilities you would expect. The food & drink is quite expensive. It's part of the sands group which allows you to be a member of most of the surrounding properties as well.,50
+++ staff very welcoming and warm despite the size of the hotel +++ upgraded to amazing suite with high class bathroom +++ lounge staff and lounge quality really high standard +++ brunch at bene on Sunday to recommend +++ gym very good and modern   --- the hotel is so big it is always crowded --- sometimes some choices are too adapted to the Chinese standards,40
"I checked into this hotel not expecting much, just trying to find a place to camp out until my flight left 4 days later.    Much to my surprise this property is outstanding and by far the best value in the Taipa area.  If you are an SPG member be prepared to be treated like gold, no strike that platinum.    My stay started off by being escorted from the busy lobby to the Sheraton Club lounge were a fresh drink of my choice was served to me during the checkin process.  Eduardo and Celine (Sheraton Club Hosts) offered me some of the finest service I have experienced world wide.  ATTN HOTEL MANAGEMENT: These two are very strong assets for the hotel and a large part of the reason I am writing this review.    My room was nothing short of spectacular. Another benefit was almost every‚Ä¶",50
This hotel has good size suites and fairly reasonable in price. Also is connected to the Venetian and cotai central. Rooms are clean casino isn't too busy. However isn't a 5 star hotel good place to stay in Macau. ,40
"Very clean and tidy, quiet environment for a good rest, very good seafood buffet dinner in its restaurants at ground floor, many restaurants and shops in the mall, walking distance to all nearby hotels and casino.",50
"When I arrived at the hotel, I didn't realize just how big the hotel actually was - the lobby is large but retains a bit of an intimate feel. And this idea runs through how the entire hotel operates - it always feels like personal service and attentiveness - just the right amount. Yet for such a large property, the excellent team manage to deliver that personal feel.  Front office staff are superb (notice how many other reviews of this hotel focus on this as well). Check in was quick, well organized and welcoming - yet there were tons of tor groups arriving at the same time : none of the staff went into a flap - all were remained cool and in control, never losing the personal touch.  So a great first impression indeed.   I stayed on the top floor, corner room with a nice view of‚Ä¶",40

"My family and I stayed at the Sheraton Grand in Macau last week from Thursday the 15th through Sunday the 18th of June.  I am a very frequent business traveler having worked in the USA, South America and Asia for the past 20 years and have frequented hotels from 5 star to others that shouldn't even host guest and everything in between.  We are from the States, but have lived and worked in Macau for the last 10 years.  Usually when I take my family on trips with me, we stay at nicer hotels for the Wife's sake and the kids enjoy having their own room next door.  Although we have stayed at several other hotels in Macau, we decided to try the Sheraton Grand to see and compare their services and amenities.  Upon arrival, it is certainly one of the more busy front desks in Macau, but‚Ä¶",50
"About one to two weeks prior to our trip we requested to have 3 rooms that should be close to each other, but when we arrived we could only be arranged  with rooms about half a minute distance from each other. The worst thing appeared in the lift. They install a security system that requires the use of room card to get access to the floor we lived, but that system often malfunction. For quite a few times we could only take the lift back to G/F and scan the room card again. The elevator is really a mess.",30
"Enjoy two day trip at Macau, short but sweet, especially we had enjoy the dinner buffet at Feast restaurant very muchÔºåthe sea food was great and the service was excellent, staff Genrvie and abby(I don‚Äôt know if the name was correct) they offer us with quiet seat, and especially the staff who call Tony was the best, he take good care of us whole night long, and gave us lot of good advice and recommendation. Very impressive.",50
"The services here is very good, fresh seafood, with very different types. food very good, enjoy the time with friend here. Special Ronald Sison offered very good service! And they all very friendly to offer when ever you need. I will come back with my friend again for sure. ",50
"I stayed there for 2 nights to celebrate my daughter's birthday. Before my stay, I sent email to the hotel to let them know my main purpose of visit and order a birthday cake. It's a big surprise, they upgraded me to a family suite where my daughters loved the room setting very much (the theme of Madagascar movie). They just want to stay in the hotel but don't want to go anywhere:)",50
"I came here with family because of the ""buy 1 get 1 free ""promotion on Facebook. Good service and great food. Got an enjoyable night in Feast. The environment is so cozy. I hope that I will be here again. ",50
"Most hotel casinos are within walking distance, there are free shuttle buses to the border and the ferry terminal. Close to the Macu airport. Foodcourt offers a wide varieties of choices. Lots of nice resturants at the lobby level",50

"We have a good experience during stay Sheraton Macao this time and thank you again on the birthday surprise.  At first, front desk's workmate (sorry that, I cant remember her name) reminded me to entitle 20% off discount which is I have meal on hotels outlet so that we have afternoon tea set at Palms as well.  Secondary, handy is really a simple tools to connect Internet access all the time and make local call, it is very warm's tools for tourist.  I thought I will stay Sheraton Macao for next Macao trip.  ps. I like yours gym and sauna room as well. ps. madeleine very yummy, and the b-day card very cute.",50
On my stay at the Sheraton hotel I had an amazing time. At the elite check in Lively was very helpful. When I went to dinner at the Feast restaurant Ronald was our server and he was very nice and you can tell he works hard. Kevin and Clark were very nice too and am definitely coming back to visit very soon. ,50
"I have stayed at Sheraton & Parisian Hotel in Macau and I loved both :) Room was quite bigger than I expected with great view and bathroom was luxurious as well.  I was impressed by how they made the pool area interesting by dividing it into smaller sections, which felt like I'm in a more private area :) They even left us a box of cookies for my mom's birthday. (How sweet of them!) It is right next to this huge shopping center with great selection of brands for shopping and amazing restaurants.  I loved Yumcha for casual dining and Xin had a variety of fresh ingredients to have a mini hotpot like shabu-shabu.",50
"We had a great dinner buffet. You can't ask for more...cozy ambience, quality and lot of food to choose from, well trained and accomodating staff, esp Genevie, Ivy, Leo, Tony & Piaopiao. Kuddos! keep it up",50
"Room is spacious with big comfortable king bed. Wifi is complimentary and fast. Went to the club lounge but felt that the staff at the counter was not very helpful and friendly.  Breakfast variety in club lounge is quite a lot but we saw some flies hovering over the donuts and avoided that dish. Speed of replenishing food is quite slow. Taste wise is only passable and disappointing as compared to other countries like Beijing and Taiwan.  Also had breakfast at Bene, one of the restaurants. Variety wise is not as much as club lounge. Taste is ok and would say that ambience is good as expected for an Italian restaurant.  Lifts are always crowded and as the hotel is quite big, you will need sometime to orientate yourself.",40
"Most of the staffs were very friendly. Helpful when checking in, smiles from the staffs at the Palms cafe, the kind of service that would make you want to return. Except for the concierge desk. Pretty unapologetic bunch, considering they are usually the people who are supposed to make everything happen for the guests.",50
My overall experience in Sheraton Grand was excellent. All the staff have great pride on their job. Especially the Feast restaurant our server Ronald take great care of us make our Father's Day dinner special. The manager Mr. Clark remembers us and stop by our table.,50

"This hotel  has nice rooms apparently this is the largest Sheraton in the world with more than 4000 rooms  All the hotels are connected to each other like the Venetian, Parisian , holiday in and city of dreams in 2 mins walking distance  All the hotels u can't miss the grand lobbies and the shows that happen there I loved the Wynn , MGM and Venetian shows ..  If u are going to Macau over a weekend the. Be prepared to spend atleast 2 hours in the hotel checkin .. as this place gets very crowded over weekend  ",40
"I had booked the Deluxe room with Executive Lounge access, and also booked the 90 minute spa treatment for 2 on special for Hong Kong and Macao residents, which qualified for a room upgrade also, so we ended up in the Executive Suite.   Now, living in Hong Kong, I have to say that the total size of the suite exceeds by far my 3 ""bedroom"" apartment in Hong Kong.  Very confortable. Maybe lacking some finer touches we are getting used to, a bowl of fruit maybe?, and the selection in the mini bar was really limited.  The rest is as usual in a hotel of this category: excellent services, efficient and nice staff, and masses of people and other guests. I find it a very convenient value for money destination in the Cotai strip, and you have direct access to the Parisian, the Venetian,‚Ä¶",40

Very attentive, assist us setup our food on our tea table. Dislike club sandwich served in lounge lobby. Is too hard. Overall is good an experience for stayed.  ",40
"Hotels overseas are always questionable especially since hotel standards differ from one country to the next. Five star in one country is not the same as five star in the USA.  We tend to stick to a hotel brand that gives you the same standards that we are used to in the USA. Sheraton is a great business brand that offers all the amenities and services that we have come to expect. However, Sheraton Macau has far exceeded our expectations and is better than we could have ever hoped. The check-in process was fast and efficient. Everyone spoke English besides their native tongue. Hellen at the front desk was courteous and fast. Jessica, her associate provided us with information about the hotel and made suggestions about the local attractions. The room is clean and updated.

"We went on weekdays and received a free upgrade to a family suites.  My 2 kids absolutely loved.  The room was nicely furnished, as you would expect from a top-chain, newly built hotel.  Beds were super comfortable.  We picked Sheraton because it was kid-friendly, with cartoon characters roaming in the mall.  The concierge Koki was quick and efficient and answered all of our questions.  Convenient locations to other attractions and the mall.  The buffet was reasonably priced and had good selections.  Gym was nice.  The swimming pool was adequate for lounging around.  Excellent experience all around.",50
"Ok I booked via a popular booking website. I booked a No smoking, King sized bed. Should be self explanatory and if this was not available I should've been told at the time of the booking. So, not sure who's fault this is, the hotel's or the website's.  I just know that when I arrived to check-in I was asked by the clerk if I wanted smoking or non smoking so... communications problem!  Then I am told that there were no more King Bed rooms in the Non Smoking section... Even though I had a booking for exactly that!  Anyway, about the stay. The room, aside from being  outfitted differently than what I asked for was fine. Clean non smoking room.

Thanks everything.",50
"I'm used to better from Sheraton, this was a surprising disappointment. Try another NEWER Hotel I suggest, such as the Venetian or Parisian. I stayed in a Club Room on the 31st Floor of the Sheraton. The rooms are Nice and reasonable, however, an Older style. Pillows are those super soft falls away type, that you either love or hate. The Internet speed is good and free in the Club Rooms. The Room Service and the Food options are expensive and NOT the highest quality. The Minibar in the room is a bad joke, but it is Asia.The food in the Food Halls is just as good and  1/3 of the price, and a 10 Min walk. Try the food hall in the Parisian or Venetian. The pool area is nice, but most hotels have nice pool areas. The Club Room Lounge is a waste of time, the snacks at Lunch time are‚Ä¶",20
Had a great stay! Stayed with other families with kids and we spend most of the time at the pool.   Buffet breakfast was really good but advise to get down there before 8:30am over the weekends. Was a long line outside when we left at 9.  Will definitely be going back. Very good service and reasonable room prices.  Staff was friendly and very helpful and even made sure to have an extra bet in our double room without knowing it comes free of charge.  But best part of the weekend this couple (girl) kept the husbands wide awake at the pool. (My wife taking the pic of my girl photo bombing a romantic moment!)ha,50
"Had my reservation booked through by an agent by the name of Elsa Ho, she did a great job by ensuring my reservation went smooth and would like to thank her since it was also my birthday on the day i stayed. I would say the whole concierge and bell team were outstanding in their roll, was at the lobby when i was greeted by a gentleman with a black jacket with gold keys which i believe is the chief concierge. His presence help me in the check in process with precise effeciency. Everywhere i walk in the lobby of sheraton i could see the bell team assisting people or are seen approaching people whenever they see someone in need of help. Great job concierge and bell team, can only see this kind of service inly in sheraton grand macau. Next, i had my dinner in Bene, i was attended‚Ä¶",50
The check in staff was very kind to upgrade our room to make our stay very special after knowing that it was our first stay with Sheraton despite being a rush time due to holiday season. Room was very comfortable. Other staff was also very hospitable.  Hotel is very grand so you must take out time to explore the property. Definitely a leisure feeling.,40

Sheraton Grand is just 10 minutes away from Macao Airport but is a typical massive casino style hotel where the lobby is like a busy shopping mall and it takes forever to find where your room is as the place is just too big. If you like massive casino style hotels this place is perfect. I dont.,30

We booked the hotel with our SPG membership, and even before the trip began, we have received such a wonderful service from all the emails to remind us about our next trip to question if we have any request to make our stay enjoyable. The hotel is located at the Cotai Central, and having arrived from the Macau ferry terminal, it has a shuttle service going back and forth between the hotel and the ferry terminal. The property is very well maintained despite having been around for 5 years, but still feels like brand new. It has both Casino and shopping centre within the same complex, and just a stonethrow away from Venetian and Parisian Macau.

He is friendly,outspoken And willing to assist guest when they need advise he is there is assist so I recommended to stay at this hotel",50
This is a great place to stay in Macau with excellent service. We stayed here for a couple of days. The place has a lots of shops to shop in or a casino if you intend to gamble. it is readily connected to the Venetian/Parisian casinos if you want to visit them.,50
This hotel is very good in terms of infrastructure and also the facilities but I was very disappointed in terms of service  I did share with the management and they promised to improve  Hope they do so  I normally have warm water with lemon and honey in the morning and they first say will try and then asked a exorbitant price for a this (which normally is free),30

"Must say that the room is comfortable and spacious. However, I think there is need to improve the front desk and the concierge service. Some of the front desk staff cannot understand either Cantonese nor English. Though I believe that most of its guests are from mainland china but as a international hotel, I think having staff who can speak English is very important. We have asked the concierge to book a particular restaurant for us. Though the restaurant was closed on that day, he did not inform us and only left a message giving us the time of the dinner but at the other restaurant. If we had not gone back to the hotel to double check, we would have gone to the wrong restaurant.",40
"Was expecting better service, cant really blame the staff who tried there best to serve considering the high crowd flowing into the casino. I along with my friend were staying in a double bed room on 34th floor. The view was great.  A clean and conveniently located hotel right in the center of Macau. I don't mind checking in again into this hotel.",40
"The beds were very comfortable. The room was clean and the cleaning service did a good quick job. It was easy to get between hotels. Staff were generally helpful and had good English.  Breakfast one morning had a very big queue so we had limited time inside. The tea ran out very quickly. The room service was more expensive than we normally would have  expected. The hotel is very big so a lot of walking involved- fine for us but bear in mind if you have mobility issues. Customer service was good, listened to the complaint that we made and made reasonable adjustments for us. ",40

There were many kids amenities such as bathrobes, toiletries, decorations and generous goodie bags. They even had kids games and Xbox to keep the kids occupied during their stay. The entire suite was huge. The kids bed was so comfortable even my husband can't bear to leave.

Beware that the hotel needs HKD 1,000 per-night for a deposit which's returnable at the end of your stay.  The Sheraton Cotai consists of 2 towers: SKY and EARTH tower.  During our stay, we asked for a room facing the VENETIAN and exactly given that @ SKY TOWER.

I stayed at Sheraton for 2 days and its just amazing... The hotel is very huge with beautiful rooms having amazing view.... Food was not an issue at all.. Good vegetarian food... I was really impressed with the connectivity that all the hotels had in Macao with each other.... We enjoyed the Venetian suites that had a way from the Sheraton hotel itself.... I would surely recommend it to my friends and love to stay here again.... :) :),50
I've always been staying with Sheraton Macau.  It's a really nice place to be with a reasonable price.  It's quite convenient to go nearby and your around cotai.  The room is comfortable and clean.  My family loves it.,50
"The hotel is huge! Very nice and individualized service though. When we returned to our room on our first night, we found a box of cookies and a handwritten note from Josie Bilag, the person who checked us in. What a nice touch. The only complaint I would have is the casino did not have any video poker machines which is the only thing I really play. But after going to around 6 other casinos, found that there were none there either. guess it is not a popular game.",50
"The hotel was defintely good for its value. The room was spacious. It was also generally clean. Check in was quick. The internet was quick. The view was ok. The guy from the philippine who was standing in the lobby was super helpful. I am sorry I forgot his name already but he was the best service staff so far I have encountered in Macau. However, most bell and concierge staffs were so rude and unwilling to help. The concierge were chatting among themselves while I went approach them to ask for questions and they made me feel like I was disturbing them and was not helpful at all. That's not the worst. The worst was the bell service. The staffs there did not speak English or Cantonese. They kept making me feel like I should speak Mandarin to them. And if I didn't understand, they‚Ä¶",30

I would personally like to thank Alrie Rocamora for assuring us that we can give him a call or email if we need anything. The handy phone inside the room is really a big help for us to navigate around Macau. I will definitely book this hotel again. Thank you so much! :)",50

It seems all the staff are well trained especially concierge team and guest service team. The team is such a real international team.

"I had stayed in this Sheraton for 3 times already.  I found this hotel very busy and crowded all the time, and sometimes it was difficult for guests to get the assistance from the staff.  The hotel area was very big, but the direction signs were somewhat confusing, so guests could easily get lost.  We stayed at a suite with a living room and a bedroom with club access.  The suite was very spacious with the view of the Parisian.  Like many chained hotels in Macau, this Sheraton is good for guests seeking just nice, comfortable room/suite with lots of shopping and restaurants inside the hotel.  But if guests want more personalized service, they will need a high degree of patience to get it.  If my husband is not a Platinum SPG member and could enjoy extra member benefits during‚Ä¶",40
Our first stay with Sheraton Grand. Nice stay and good breakfast at the hotel cafe Palms. The room is spacious and the view from our room is nice. The hotel is just opposite the Venetian and Paristian with good location too. ,50
"i have held/hosted and attended several different events at Sheraton Grand Macao.  These include organising private events on the pool deck and taking over the whole restaurant, as well as attending functions in the various restaurants and meeting/ballrooms. From the outset there is always a positive ""can do"" attitude from the events and catering teams and we get good value for our money. The staff are happy, dedicated to their work and attend to all our needs throughout the evening to ensure the function is a success. Next time you have an event or function in mind, don't hesitate to contact Sheraton Grand",50
"I've booked 4 rooms for my friends and I. It was a holiday so the 30 mins long queue was expected. However, the reception desk was very stupid and slow. It took us 15mins to complete everything.  At night we rang the room service and request for a dozen bottles of beer. it took quite a few minutes to be delivered. I rang the room service again and she said they were busy. Well, it was 2am...  The other day, 3 rooms were checking out and 1 room will be continue staying. I asked the reception desk lady if I have to pay for the drinks that we have ordered last night. she said the guest checking out will be paying so we sorted out the bills ourselves to the guest leaving the next day.   And the room didn't cleaned up properly. The left over of the beer bottles were still on the desk‚Ä¶",20
We had a wonderful birthday celebration. Thank you for the great arrangement of the guest relation team members with wonderful happy surprises.    The room is clean and tidy with timely respond from the housekeeping team.   Wonderful hotel! Keep it up! ,50
We stayed in the Presidential pent house Suite on 35th floor. An enormous appartment with every facility. & especially having the Club access. This hotel is enormous & if you are just booking a room one has to wait quite a long time for check in as the place is swarming with people. Due to our Membership with this hotel Group we were able to have an immediate no fuss check in on a different floor. After an overnight flight this was very welcome. The hotel is situated in  a huge shopping complex with casinos galore . no need to face the humidity of the exterior,40
"Our suite is clean, furnished very tastefully, and even has a view of the water display at the Wynn. Plus, there is a half bath off the living room! Service has been great. Location is convenient to a plethora of high end shopping. Nice casino, not overly crowded.",50
Excellent Property. Good Location. Connected to Hotel Venetian through a road over bridge from the 1st floor. Very spacious and clean rooms. Every room is provided with a 3G enabled smart phone which you can carry with you during your stay and also make local and international calls and all this absolutely free. The highlight of the stay was the Spa treatment at Shine Spa. One of the best till date I have ever had. The breakfast spread at Feast was very huge and tasty.,40
"we have a great experience in here! Really appreciated front deck staff Mr. Wilson Webster who accommodating and being so nice. i need to check-in again after our group of clients left. 19 rooms have to check-out individually, he helps with patient and friendly attitude. i have great experience stay in sheraton with good pool view and late check-out because of Mr. Wilson!!! thanks again!!!!",50
"Great hotel, absolutely no complaints. Room was spacious, modern and very well stocked with all that a lightly packed traveller could ask for. Was here for a stag weekend and have to say we never needed to travel more than 10mins away to find all the entertainment we needed!! Great hotel for a weekend stay!! ",50
"We had a wonderful weekend here and were definitely delighted to be promoted to a suite on the 39th Floor of the Earth Tower.It was Perfection itself. There was a separate centrally located TV room in which we could relax and catch up on the latest bad news. Outside was the lounge with ornate writing desks upon which I could catch up with work planning. My wife loved our separate bathroom with ensuite. The bathtub was the ultimate in luxury and a liberal sprinkling of bath salts made for a very relaxing soak. There was a second bathroom near the main door as well. The staff were superb. Nothing was too much trouble for Housekeeping. Shoe shining, delivering extra soap -you name it. The Gymnasium, Sala Pool and Sheraton Club Lounge, all located on the fourth floor were also‚Ä¶",50
"My family and i checked in for my daughter's 3rd birthday. It was a wonderful stay. I was upgraded to a family suite,Nice room! Definitely great for kids. I would like to thank Josie for the wonderful surprise and Cristina at SPG lobby for helping me check in with sincerity. Will definetely come back! Thumbs up for the great service.",50
"My brother has held his wedding party at the Macao Sheraton Hotel. When we found the wonderful wedding decoration and it has brought the bride surprise and happiness.It's a memorable and impressive wedding party for her.   Have to express ""big thank you"" to the  HouseKeeping Team for their warmest and considerate services. as well as the banquet team, F&B team have provided the best and most excellent wedding Party and dinner with lovely foods.",50
"Great hotel, friendly staff! Thanks to Webster (FO) for being so nice and accommodating. As soon as he saw my passport and realize it was my birthday he made a really unforgettable gesture and personalize our stay!  We had our lunch at Feast, great food lots of entries and most of all very friendly and attentive staff! Special mention to Ivy and Paul, thank u so much!",50
"well, it needs to be expressed and written down again... ""Coming home"" is what this stay (this May) describes it as best.... warm welcome, all prepared (still being gold SPG member, but not in all hotels a given that this helps...therefore needed to be mentioned) for easy check in etc., etc. and therefore easy start in a busy week I was facing in Macao (no holiday of course) Aris Azhar, Mark Chang and last but not least Stefan Renziehausen ""JUST DID IT AGAIN"".... not to forget the team they have with them making my life - as I said - like coming home and treated like being at home.... this Sheraton (altough the biggest in the world from SPG group) is setting standards for me which should be used as sample for many others, much smaller and much easier to be handled hotels....‚Ä¶",50
We had a good check in; staff was efficient and pleasant. Room is spacious and bed is firm. Everything is good but we feel the cleanliness of the bathroom could be better for a 5 star hotel. We were disappointed to see mould in the shower area.,40
"My first stay at the Sheraton Cotai as a quick Birthday getaway weekend. Thought would give this a try as Sheraton is usually good for value!   Getting around is no problem, there are shuttle buses from almost anywhere to any given hotels in Macau. A taxi would be around MOP 50 to the airport or ferry terminal.  Reception  Unless you are an SPG member, do not stay here as it could be a good hour before you get checked in. As a member, I queued for around 20 minutes which has never happened at any Sheratons I've stayed.  Lobby It was a very busy lobby with all sorts from shopping, caf√©, promotion, casino. This is something not preferred personally, as I expect some quiet moments but it is Macau so I should have expected it!  Room The hotel seems to have a few wings, and we were‚Ä¶",30
When we arrive we were led to a small check in area with three staff. All three staff had a guest but we were next in line. I swear 15 minutes later we were still waiting. I was so upset i was going to cut in and ask what they were talking about. Finally when our turn came I understood. The check in process was relatively slow anyway but then the receptionist went through a barrage of sales pitches. from flogging their loyaly card to wanting to provide late checkout on Sunday if we agreed to no room cleaning on the Saturday. really? I suggest Management review their check in procedure. Creating long queues of arriving guests is not a good start to the vacation.  Anyway that was the worst of our experience. The room was clean and large. We found the location very good. Very easy‚Ä¶,30
"The hotel complex itself is humongous! it is very impressive yes, but the attention to details get lost with a mega structure like this. I don't really have anything ""wrong"" to say, it is just too big and too ""mass produced"" Buy if you are into the gambling and shopping then the location is ok.",30
"Prior to 2016, Sheraton club lounge was one of the best in Asia.  It used to provide lots of selection of hot and cold dishes for breakfast and evening canapes.  They have revamped the club lounge by giving out noodle in soup and cold sandwiches.  In addition, they will hunt you down and charge for your children.  Pay a bit more and go to JW Marriott Hotel in Macau instead.",30
"We stay at this hotel to celebrate friend's birthday and they are so nice and warm. They have assigned a connecting room as per our request in advance and we received a fruit basket and some sweet, it really makes our journey unforgettable.  The staff are very friendly and location is good. Rooms are clean and will definitely stay again next time.",50
"On my  third stay in Macau I decided I would stay on the Cotai Strip for the first time. I have previously stayed in Macau (Grand Lapa and Grand Lisboa). So I discovered a problem with Cotai, there is no such thing as a 7/11 or supermarket anywhere in Cotai, so if you want a snack, or a drink you will be paying Hotel, restaurant or bar prices. In central Macau this is not a problem, as there are stores everywhere.  The other problem is it was raining non stop, could I find a reasonably priced umbrella anywhere in Cotai -no. This became a problem meaning I had to take the free buses between the casinos (even if they were just across the road.  I guess I can't blame the Sheraton for that, the hotel was everything I expected, room was large with full bath and shower, everything was‚Ä¶",30
"Like other Sheratons,  Room is spacious, clean and tidy, bed and bedding are very comfortable, and the service is great.   Participated in an international conference here.  The  convention center is large and equipped with excellent hardware and software..  There are some drawbacks: 1) The door of shower room opens inwards.   it is quite inconvenient.  2) WiFi is free, but disconnected intermittently. It should not happen in a 5 star hotel. 3) The hotel-shopping mall complex is so huge.  There are many direction boards.  However, I found no map in the building.   Actually, a map board is more helpful sometime.",40
"I would never choose any mega size hotel in the future unless there is a better solution for check-in. I moved to this hotel from another hotel on Cotai Strip around 12 pm, and hotel front office was very strict that check-in only starts from 1pm, so after I stored my luggage in concierge and came back around 3:30, I have to wait in line for 50 minutes to check in. The lines are just crazy as airport checkin counter, the craziest I have ever experienced. I understand such wait I s inevitable for a 4000 room hotel like this, but they could had been more flexible on taking check-in to reduce the waiting line.  Apart from this, I booked my room through Agoda and I was assigned to a room with poor amenities. There is no drinks in fridge, and the minibar is at economic hotel level.‚Ä¶",20
The check in and check out took forever. The lobby is too crowdede and most of the staffs do not speak english. The breakfast was great. Many food selection that we can enjoy and it very close with shopping center,30
"I always have a preference for SPG hotels when I travel. However, I stayed in Sheraton Macao for 1 night and it was highly unsatisfactory, and from now on I will always second guess myself when I book a SPG hotel.   First, the room was quite old, and although the room description said there would be refreshments provided - they were very minimal and highly unsatisfactory - there was nothing in the fridge and there were no snacks - only several tea bags and instant coffee were provided - this is definitely not up to standard of a luxury SPG brand hotel.  My most unsatisfactory part was that the next morning at around 10am, the next room was under renovation, and I have heard people drilling and banging the wall at 10am and I could not sleep at all. I really did not expect a‚Ä¶",10
"This hotel has provided me with the greatest experience compared to the many hotels I have been over the years. Despite the fact that our trip was booked last minute due to our unexpected family reunion in Macau, I informed the hotel of our special occasion. I did not expect much at first from my email to Sheraton, but I was given a prompt reply regarding the information to enhance our stay at Sheraton. When we first arrived to the Hotel, I was shocked by the large number of staff committed to the check-in and check-out process. Moreover, as I checked in, I was greeted by Peter Jung who came out to give us the brightest welcome and hospitality. As we were overwhelmed by the structure of Sheraton, Peter gave a brief explanation of the hotel and provided us with a map and a guide‚Ä¶",50
"This hotel is a very ""cold"" hotel. Check-in process takes forever and staffs are pretty ""plastic"" and have no sincerity in helping you out. I have no complaints about the hardware of this hotel BUT the software of this hotel is absolutely disappointing. Location wise, it is definitely in one of the best areas in Taipa and there are plenty of shopping and F&B outlets around this place. I am disappointed that this property is nowhere near the high standards that Sheraton Hotel group has set. Massive rooms for improvement.",30
"The hotel has got a great location; attached to the huge Sands Cotai Central mall, a walking distance to the Venetian, Parisian and Studio City. However, the quality of service crushed my holiday experience. I am an SPG member and there is a special place to check-in for the SPG members. The receptionist did not greet me, not welcoming and not smiling; might as well check-in online; I felt like talking to a robot. The room is quite spacious with a nice pool view, but there was a weird smell in the room. The only decent experience I had was during my workout in the gym. The gym staffs greeted and smiled.",30
"Experienced the longest ever hotel check-in ever, took almost an hour and the front desk was pack of people. Never had this experience before where the front desk was so full of people waiting and sitting on the floor in a 5-star hotel.  But once you got over the check-in, the stay was decent. The room was clean, comfortable and rather big. The gym was spacious with enough machines to satisfy most gym junkies.  A good stay if it wasn‚Äôt for the long check-in. One of the cheaper 5-star hotel in Macau and in a good location.",30
"The Sheraton is located in the Cotai strip which is the area where new casinos resorts are built. Numerous resorts have sprung up, so there are options to find places to eat and shop.. The hotel offer world stands, it does have a fridge in the room, wifi is good, and spacious. Taipa the historic village is walkable distance and offers a retreat from the casino. Bear in mind this a large hotel so check-in can be chaotic because of the peak times. Hotel provides free shuttles to the ferry terminal which is really convenient. Recommend!",50
"Have stayed in several Sheratons and this was pretty good. SPG members get that little extra that makes it a pleasure to visit. Check in was smooth and quick. Staff friendly and helpful. I stayed in the ""Earth Tower"", room was spacious, comfortable and free wifi worked well throughout.  Room service was quick and friendly Several restaurants available, and if this doesn't suit your taste there is a food court area walking distance as you walk through the shopping area. Casino facilities close by as well. ",40
"This is my second time at Sheraton Macao. Friendly staff, great prices and proximity to all attractions in Cotai Central. Great suites, awesome breakfast and the list goes on. Staff always happy to extend the check out time. Before the stay they send an email asking if there is any special requests. Always my first choice.",50
"This is the second time for me in this hotel in the last one year and have experienced just the same issues as i had in my previous stay. Let's start with the positives - big rooms and nice ambience and unfortunately my list of positive stops there. Having worked for this brand in the beginning of my career, I find it very hard to believe the bad attitude of the staff at reception desk and the restaurants. They made us feel that the only thing they bare interested in money, not the service they should give us. We don't get water served till we order something. We don't get the rooms till we pay a deposit for other services even though the rooms are paid fully in advance, doesn't matter if you have travelled for 24hrs and you reach at midnight, they won't give you the room till‚Ä¶",10
"Great selesction of suites at decent prices, with lots of space and nice lounge, dining room and ''cinema room'' in deluxe suite. OK Lounge but not spectacular, offering could be improved. Pools and restaurant choices on site not great, but loads of decent restaurant choices in nearby resorts! Great value for money!",40
"Was very happy with the room though it was only a night stay. Hotel Staff was helpful to extend the check out time as we our sight seeing trip delayed our returning plan to hotel. Exterior of the hotel was not very attractive but the interior was very well maintained, looks & feel new. ",40
"I stayed at the Sheraton in Macau in May with my nephew and we had a fantastic time. As an SPG rewards member I got a good rate online and we were upgraded to a room with a better view on check-in. We were in a deluxe room which was plenty big enough for the two of us.   Getting to the hotel is easy and free. Just jump on the line green shuttle bus from the ferry pier. We checked in at the SPG members desk - the staff were cheerful, friendly and very helpful.   We ate lunch at Bene Italian restaurant which is inside the Sheraton shopping mall. The food was good and SPG members get 20% off.   All of the big hotels on the Cotai strip are interconnected and easily accessible. We walked to City of Dreams to watch the House of Dancing Water which was amazing.  Coming out of the show‚Ä¶",50

The communication skill of the team is a bit on the lower side but they all posses good intentions to help . The rooms are large and well cleaned and well maintained . That must be mentioned to the whole hotel regarding Maintanance , well kept . They have a huge casino at the ground floor which is the heart of Macau hotels .

To be a SPG member make you to check in at the SPG counter which provides comfortable area for your family members to sit and wait.  The sheraton hotel counter staff help us to check in earlier at noon as my reservation asked for early check in.  It is pleasure to become SPG member.  I highly recommend to join SPG if you are booked directly from the hotels.,40

My friends wanted a high floor room and were given a 26th floor room at the same Tower. Another couple on the other hand were shown the Sky Tower which had access to the Business Lounge.

Pros: Hotel is wonderful.Rooms are convenient and breakfast is lavish. The location is perfect . Cons: Front Desk staff  Their attitude is completely unacceptable. They are unable to communicate properly in english . I asked them for their manager and the staff bluntly replies that the manager sits behind in the back office without lifting his head. Their policy of 5000 HKD as deposit is from the 17th century . There is however a better way of enforcing this than allow their untrained front desk staff communicate. Somebody needs to drive the fact to their front desk staff that hospitality is all about being pleasant and warm especially when we arrive after a long humid day. Never would i visit this hotel again nor recommend it to anybody,10
"This is our favourite hotel in Macao. This time , we were upgraded to a deluxe suite which was massively spacious and beautiful. There was a TV room, a dining area, lounge and not forgetting the bedroom and spacious bathroom. There was even a nespresso coffee machine. The suite was clean and well decorated. Staff at the Club lounge were most helpful and the breakfast and pre dinner cocktail spread was plentiful and tasty. Special mention to the Club lounge staff for the excellent service, especially Benedict and Gigi. We will return.",50
I considered several different properties as many hotels in this area are very nice. This was the first time I stayed at this Sheraton and found it to be excellent and at a better price than the others I had considered. Location is great. The room was good size and very clean. On property restaurants were great.,50

The lobby was very crowded and it was understandable that the hotel took in countless tour groups but it added to the chaotic atmosphere with echos in the spacious area and high ceilings. The huge groups that end up congregating at the lobby area truly added a sense of chaos to an otherwise organised check-in and check-out system in place. It could have been due to the Easter weekend with people on holidays.

"We encountered a slight misunderstanding during the room reservations process but this was cleared up quickly and service recovery was prompt and nothing short of professional.  Because we had a young child with us, we were invited to bypass the queues and check-in at the club lounge, a space normally reserved for executive club guests. Alternatively, there is a dedicated check-in space on the ground floor for SPG members. Otherwise the lines at the regular check-in area were pretty long for a weekday.

There isn't any drama that happened just my check-in took an hour ten minutes to complete even though I was a SPG member on the fast lane and spending most of my time dining in the Sheraton restaurants, I actually felt there isn't much difference dining at the food court as 1) no one cleans the table after a patrons leave, 2) it takes them quite awhile to attend to your needs and 3) there isn't much smiles or greetings anywhere you go in the hotel...

The breakfast is served in the Executive Lounge  the complimentary drink and snack sessions throughout the day,  evening cocktails is good Thank you for this wonderful experience! We will be returning next year.",50
Its a grand Hotel with an attached mall and connected with Parisian Macau . Beautiful hotels with luxury rooms. Restaurants were amazing with global cuisines. Access to other places via shuttle. On top of all very large casino but still i would prefer Casino in Venetian Macau. Nice place for vacation,50
"I live in HK, and the Sheraton is probably the go-to property to stay at for me and my friends for trips to Macau. It is a great property, located right in the heart of the Macau strip.   You can't beat it for its value, especially with SPG status, and is better than any Sheraton I've stayed at elsewhere.  Definitely a wise choice for mid-range hotel (on the upper end of mid-range for sure).",40
"Background: We are regular patrons of spa getaway overnight stays in Macau. As my wife and I are based in Hong Kong and 10 minutes away from the pier, we nip over for some pampering whenever the mood calls for.  Usual stays: Four Seasons, Mandarin Oriental, Banyan Tree and Ritz Carlton.   For this trip I thought to try the Sheraton Grand for my wife's birthday getaway as I had never been before.  Big mistake.    What could‚Äôve been quite a good experience was tarnished by hotel staff who were uninterested in providing hotel service.   I booked the Deluxe Suite (1,345sq ft) directly via the Sheraton website so note that my booking was not one of those ‚Äòcheapest deals‚Äô on the net or via any third party website.  ¬∑ Decent hardware, our suite was very nice. The layout of the suite‚Ä¶",10
"Amazing facilities, great staff and fantastic rooms...They always manage to exceed my expectations. Executive Lounge something not to be missed and Bene has one of the Best Italian food in Macau, highly recommended for families and business travelers...",50
"Great Hotel, very huge property with very good infrastructure and facilities. It was really great to spent three days with my family at Sheraton Grand Macau. Thank you for the room update as a Platinum SPG member and for the good service. Great time!",40
Room was well located . Huge property . Experience of a hand phone during your stay on the house . Well laid out variety of food . Great service and hospitality . Beautiful surroundings of the malls and other hotels .,50
It was the most unreal experience at the Sheraton from entry to exit. One of the largest hotel that I have ever stayed at with awesome dining and conference options. We had multiple choices of food and services in different locations but all clustered and could be charged to your room. So in nutshell you were not required to carry your wallet everywhere and could just direct the outlet to post the bill to the room. Another beautiful thing about this place is that the hotel is connected to all the nearby hotels and you are not really required to go out and take the public roads for visiting another hotel. Dreamworks are always available and your kids will be engaged throughout if you are travelling with them. The hotel has an awesome casino space where you can try your luck and‚Ä¶,50
Pretty much like Venetian and cheaper  Downstairs mall is the same  They are all interconnected through pedestrian basement or overbrige They jointly have super connected malls and their own casino So I would prefer Sheraton over Venetian cuz it's cheap and the same   ,30
Hotel is located in a very good location for shopping as it is only 10 minute walks to Venetian. Free shuttle bus available to Galaxy area. Concierge team are nice and very helpful. Room is quite small and look a bit old. The rest was just ok for my stay.,30
"Had a wonderful weekend at the Sheraton, checked in by the very efficient and kind Mariana Conceicao who carefully explained all the amenities. The room was superb and the hotel had covered the bed with roses petals and there was an anniversary cake and fruit plate which made us feel very special.  We had gone for a club room which included breakfast and cocktails at the club floor and We were expertly cared for by Celine Chen who kept us well supplied and helped to make us feel very welcome.  I also had a amazing massage at the Shine Spa from a lovely woman called Pic who was very professional and helped to really make it special.  Great weekend and made a great celebration by very caring and welcoming staff.",50
The largest hotel I have ever stayed in...Massive and huge...Loved the overall ambience and grandeur! Huge casinos and multiple restaurant options. the best part is most hotels here share their walls and are mostly inter-connected making it easier to commute between hotels and restaurants by walk itself,40
"Hotel had provided a perfect service and assistance for me and my family from reservation, check-in until we check out. Rooms are very nice. There are 8-10 different sizes of pools will meet your requirement. We also went to see the show, Monkey King, the show was good.   The hotel Guest Service Supervisor, Mr. Samuel Go had treated me and all my family so nice which I have never had before.   The location of this hotel is also good. We can walk to many different hotels and casinos in a few minutes. Shopping area is huge and very nice.  I believe I will go back to the hotel again soon and I will also recommend my friends to stay at the Sheraton Hotel in Macao.   Johnny Wei",50
"We stayed in the Deluxe suite, it was clean and big. Personally if travelling to Macau again I would look for cheaper options because not sure it's value for the expense, the lobby was v crowded and the hotel lacked a personal touch. Also having booked the room for two people with breakfast I was a bit surprised that the breakfast was for only one and I had to supplement the extra cost.  Location was good though.",30
"Location close to airport and they provide free shuttle bus. The area is now a bit alive now as there were few hotels and casinos opened. This a very big hotel with 4,000 rooms. Good for large conference events. Hotel is attached to a shopping mall. The room is ok--- spacious and comfortable. The guest lift is quite confusing at first as it is divided into high and low floors but as time goes by, you'll get familiar. Overall, good for business and leisure. ",40
It's a city in itself! Very efficient and crisp. Very specious and well appointed rooms. Surrounded by many other large hotels. Lot of shopping and restaurants. Casino is quite a good size and enjoyable. Daily parade in the afternoon is must see. Helpful and customer friendly associates. ,50
"Five Good things, 1) Smooth check-in and smoothest check-out 2) Stayed in higher floor Earth Tower but seemed very secluded and honestly a bit scary. My tip refrain from watching horror movies 1 week before the stay :-) 3) Had all amenities one could ask for - really grand in true sense of the word 4) Connected to nearby Hotels like Venetian Macau 5) Pretty busy casino floor  I forgot my fitness tracker in my room and the staff was really helpful in having it delivered to my friends place in HK.",40
"Attended a fantastic conference at the hotel with 1,800 delegates from all over Asia Pacific. Rooms are good staff very helpfull and always on hand to guide you around the property. Great selection of restaurants and within easy walking distance several of the main attractions of Cotai. The suite rooms are well laid out and spacious had a great stay. Free shuttle from the airport is very convenient.Highly recomended",50
"Revisited this great hotel again on convention purpose this time. They still remember my room preference - high floor, close to elevator and off course quiet room. Great amenities, attentive service, awsome breakfast and seemless convention service arrangement. Overall, a successful convention with great support from the hotel team in every espect.",50
"I chose the SGM for its pool area, and was assigned a room in the Sky Tower. Found the rooms to be smaller than comparatives, clean but my room had a musty smell.  Our water was shut off without notice one morning for about 30 minutes, with one of us amidst a shower.  Not cool! Will likely stay in the Venetian next time around.",30
We stayed overnight and it wasn't really our scene. Massive casino / conference type accommodation. Asked to come back to check in 3 times (and SPG members) because it was fully booked. Good average. Room was grand. That's about it. I'd probably stick to day trip to Macau unless you enjoy casinos...meters away from reception check in.,30
Great place huge banquets and impressive food & beverage. That casino is dull compared to others around but rooms are well organised and practical.well connected to malls and other important locations and has great restaurants ,50
"This hotel is provided free Handy Mobile, we can bring it out with Wi-Fi connection thru hotspot and free Local / IDD Calls with some countries included in the phone. It is very convenient with internet access all the time during our stay. Besides this, their staffs are very polite and very good services. We will recommend our friends to stay this hotel and come again next time! But we found that the services of Bene Italian Restaurant is not good. We are waiting for some improvements!",40
"It's the type of hotel you would typically find around a casino - large enough with the normal things you would expect to find in a Sheraton, but really quite bare. The TV was of suitable size and with the expected channels, but little touches like a charger-cum-radio for USB devices was not there as is the norm in many hotels these days.   Having said that, there was plenty of options when it came to dining,  Kids will be thrilled to see Kung Fu Panda roaming around the complex at designated times and checking in and out was quick and efficient.  Also great for the ferry to Hong Kong with a counter where you can get the tickets in advance and a free shuttle.  Wouldn't mind staying here again if I was heading back to Macau anytime soon.",40
"The lobby of this hotel is a bit intense - as its actually part of the casino and it is chock full of people, kids, suitcases - its not relaxing at all and there's certainly no luxury 5* feel. When you get to the rooms, they are nice enough, simple and straightforward and do have a luxury feel. Staff are very well trained and professional but there isn't really any personal feel to the service, i guess because it is so big. The pool area is nice but the food available there is distinctly average which is a shame.  There's a very handy shuttle bus to the ferry terminal. Despite some average comments above, i have left my review as very good as we always choose to stay here when we come to Macau - it is after all a casino hotel so you need to accept this aspect of it. Overall its‚Ä¶",40
"Check-in and check-out were very convenient because there is SPG member desk. It was Easter holiday when I visited, and I was able to check in quickly and conveniently at the SPG member desk. The staffs were very friendly and had no trouble communicating in English. There were a lot of great restaurants in the hotel, and there were plenty of different promotions available at a reasonable price. The shuttle routes connecting Macau Island and other hotels in Cotai were well served and very convenient to use. And although it was a standard room, the view over the Parisian hotel, the studio city, and the pool overlooking it was so spectacular. If I go back to Macau next time, I will definitely use this place again.",50
"Like every other hotel located in cotai, Sheraton has shuttle bus to the ferry terminal. This hotel is always busy especially at the check in counter. The room is spacious with comfortable bed and big bathroom. Everything is comfortable and luxurious, the staffs are friendly. Such a great experience, no complaint at all.",50
"I was upgraded from lowest room to a 5 room/2 bath suite so that put a nice smile on my face and the fact that they have a huge well stocked lounge that has a great breakfast and dinner was such a nice surprise. The Spa was excellent, I had a signature massage from a Thai masseuse named 'Charm' that did an incredible job and would request by name the next time I go. I don't know how they treat everyone but in this hotel SPG Platinums are royalty.",50
"When I told Janet (the Managing Director) about my situation of failure to redeem ferry ticket promotional offer, she responded quickly and was trying to resolve the problem.  Thanks to Janet Mcnab, Kathy Chen and her team, my room was upgraded to suite with free lounge access. Spacious room and fantastic view facing Parisian hotel.   Location is good and convenient. Easy access to other casinos such as venetian, parisian, city of dreams, studio city and wynn within walking distance.   Front desk staff were very helpful, and also  arranged express checkout for me during rush hours. I do really enjoy the stay, and will definitely come back again.",50
"Macau Sheraton was an enjoyable experience from the moment you step in; the Sheraton Club reception was very friendly, and the setup is with everything you can ask for plus a bit more.  The room (executive suite), with full glass windows, has two TV, two toilets,  large and comfortable bed, wifi, service pad, many bottles of comp water.  The bath room is big with separate toilet and bath, and has a big tub right in the middle.  Sheraton Macau has thought of almost everything during my stay.  The next morning breakfast is also very good, first time I've seen an automatic pancake machine.  At lobby level, all kinds of restaurant, even a food court!  Many shops, and casinos.  One thing that impress me was the free shuttle bus to airport, ferry terminals, and the other side of the‚Ä¶",50

"We stayed in room 2244 for one night over the Easter long weekend. We got off at the Cotai ferry terminal, and then very easy access to hotel through free shuttle bus. The room was clean and the size was generous. Bed was also very comfortable. As a sound sleeper, I especially love the hallway design where the entrance to the room was a couple of feet from the walls of the hallway, meaning noises from the hallway were more difficult to get into the room. And with the use of carpet instead of marble in the room‚Äôs foyer area, the room actually was pretty quiet dispute a full floor with plenty of kids. Location of the hotel was just great as it was just above the Cotai Central Mall complex that was also linked to Conrad, Holiday Inn and St Regis hotels. There was also a footbridge‚Ä¶",40
"When we booked this, we had no idea that this was the worlds largest Sheraton property. We quickly woke upto that when we reached the hotel and the Check-In area looked like a train station ! Took us 2 hours to check-In.  That aside, I think the property overall was fantastic. Good views of the entire Cotoi strip. Connected thru temperature controlled walkways to the Venetian.  Good breakfast spread. Although they have a Shrek breakfast menu too - not worth it unless you have kids.  Swimming pool areas are particularly nice.  This place is a hotel on steroids ! HUGE",40
"The Sheraton Grand Macao Has everything you could possibly need from a hotel.Gym, Pool, great rooms all at a great price.  The staff were very helpful especially Charlene on reception who even upgraded our room! Will definitely come back when in Macao next time.",50
"We loved our time at the hotel in this Casino driven city of the East. We came in by ferry from Hong Kong International Airport and then caught the hotel's free shuttle bus from outside the Macau terminal. This was very simple to use. All of the major hotels/casinos have their own shuttles. HINT: You can get around most of Macau using someones free shuttle. Don't pay for transport if you can just enquire and use the free shuttles instead.  Check-in was very simple and porterage efficient. We booked a Deluxe Club Suite and later found out we could have gone to a different exclusive floor to check-in, but it didn't matter, we were looked after very well anyway. Our room was excellent being about double the size of a normal room for not to many more dollars. Great King sized bed,‚Ä¶",50

"We checked-in on April 16th at 4pm,  I was so shocked to see the queue was tremendous long.  It finally took me ONE hour to check in.  It was no fun at all as I was bringing along with 2.5 yr old boy and he has to running around and my husband need to keep an eye on him. I have no choice need to remain on the spiral long queue myself!  As a brand hotel, I felt so disappointed on the holiday arrangement as simple as just for check-in & manpower! I have been told most rooms are still waiting to be cleaned & tidy up!  Room is clean and spacious, the bed is big and comfort. My kid loves the pool.  However, there're numbers of sharp edges inside the room which parents might need to keep an eye on little ones while they're playing and wondering around.  I would say it's a hotel good‚Ä¶",30

"I have stayed at 17th floor at Skytower on 16 April 2017, around 4 to 5 rooms are under renovation, one of these room is next to my room, it's so noisy and dirty in this floor, dust is full of my room door.  My daughter can't sleep in the room.    There's a woman called me and said that she's the Manager and understood about the noise of 17/F., she said it's just a regular check, no maintenance work.  I told her it is a maintenance, the brick was broke on the floor and dust is full of the corridor.    Her attitude shown that she is not care about the guest comment/complain.

"Went to the Sheraton Grand, Macau over Easter.  Was checked in by Lively Liu who remembered us from previous stays.  Lively is very friendly and helpful.  She is a credit to the Sheraton. The hotel lobby was very busy but with 4000 rooms you have to expect that.  Check in at the SPG counter was however very quick.  The room was very clean and the bed very comfortable. Had Sheraton club lounge access which was really good.  The lounge was very busy but the staff coped well.  Breakfast was good and had many choices. Also a good choice of food and drinks in the evening. The Sheraton is one of the best hotels in Macau at a reasonable price.",50

After informing us the price for the upgrade, the guest service agent Ricky immediately let us know that we could enjoy the upgrade to family suite if we got the spa massage for the two days, just needed to add few hundreds HKD. We were Ok with the offer and the room were immediately available after our check-in at the SPG counter. We were all happy with the prompt service with Ricky.

We are so touched by the team's caring and dedicated service, the have prepared for the elderly friendly bathroom aid, welcome fruit basket etc without our request. We had a wonderful stay in Sheraton Grand Macao and definitely will come back again!",50
"This rating is reflective of value for money and an extremely efficient management. Sheraton is huge hotel with 4000+ rooms.  You def feel like you are with 1000 downstairs of the lobby during busy seasons.  However with that said the club rooms are very quiet and comfortable. Room service, housekeeping and check in all super on top of it especially considering they had 3000 check ins the day before.   Bravo management of Sheraton",50
"I've been here a couple of times already. But this is the first time I didn't feel the warm welcome back and the front office lady who checked me in seemed to be quite unhappy don't really know why. Not even a smile from her. After check in, I went to the room, the room seemed like was made in a rush with a few amenities missing and the air isn't fresh enough. In conclusion, I'd still recommend this hotel as it is still great consider the service you expect in Macao. But seems like it's going downhill. Need some work to keep a great property. I'd still stay here and recommend others to do so simply because of the loyalty I've build up and the trust that they will actually deliver a great service and experience. The loyalty comes from all previous experiences. As I've said at the‚Ä¶",50
"We were early and unfortunately could not early check in.  It wasn't a problem, as we went to explore the shopping mall. I noticed the check-in area, was huge.  Normally hotels have 2-5 check-in desks. This had at least 20. I was not looking forward to check-in.  Luckily when I did check-in, there was a SPG member area.  This saved at least 30 mins. It was mayhem in the regular check-in. The busiest I have ever seen.   The room was spacious and well appointed. The bed was very comfy. The bathroom was large as well.  Considering how busy the hotel is, I was glad the room was quiet, could not hear the other guests or the lifts. The only issue, was the shower.  You needed to be very careful, with where you direct the shower head, as the shower curtain is too small and the water‚Ä¶",40
"Having just completed a stay at this hotel, I must admit the overall guest experience was a surprisingly pleasant one.   Although at first apprehensive about the condition of the hotel given how overutilised hotels in Macau can be, the room turned out to be amazingly comfortable with a bed that you would want to take home with you! The location is at the center of the Taipa side of the island with decent connectivity via shuttle bus to other parts.   On the final day, we met a superb Guest Service Ambassador, Francis Plandes who went out of his way to take us and our luggage to the other end of the hotel to catch the airport shuttle, making us feel utterly pampered and not just another guest in a large hotel. Talk about an amazing way to round off an already perfect Easter‚Ä¶",50
Everything was just fine - the location of the hotel is in the middle of other huge hotels group. Close to the evening show of the dancing water. Check in in the Sheraton Club division was quick and highly friendly. The breakfast and the evening lounge were wonderful. The suite was very clean and comfortable. The hotel staff was very friendly.,50
Good value when booking from India. This is the most basic Sheraton I've ever stayed in. But in Macau you spend less time in the room and more out in the casinos or shopping. The rooms have everything you need. Wi-fi isn't great but the handy phone is very useful. Coverage inside rooms is poor. I stayed on floor 30 in Earth 2 tower. Some rooms have bathtubs and some only showers. If a tub is required please do ask specifically.   Located opposite the Venetian and adjacent to the Conrad and St Regis. There's is nice shopping mall on the ground floor. Also shuttles to Macau pier are available from the East Lobby. A small walk away is where shuttles to the old Portugese town start from.,30
"I recently  spent three nights in the sky tower executive suite. From check in to check out I had a wonderful experience. Check in at the executive lounge on the 4th floor was was efficient and friendly as was check out at the end of my stay. The suite was spacious with a comfortably furnished living room, large bedroom, and a wonderful bath area including a deep soak tub. The hotel offers all the amenities anyone could imagine and the location on the center of the cotai strip makes it a great choice.",50
"We came here for the Dreamworks experience. Check in was reasonably fast. Rooms were spacious and clean. Only thing is since the hotel is so big it is so far to walk to anywhere. Rooms were far away, shopping mall was far, breakfast was far and swimming pool was far  Beds were comfortable with good views from the rooms.   Breakfast was good. Bit of a wait for tables. Big selection of Western and Eastern foods. My only gripe is that there are lots of Mainland tour groups. They inevitably have ways of ruining other people's travel experiences  The hotel is attached to a large shopping mall. It has a big food court. Food is reasonably priced.   The Kung Fu panda breakfast was entertaining. It's a buffet breakfast with some entertainment from the Dreamworks characters. You could‚Ä¶",40
Very centrally located hotel - it's massive.  Rooms were great - large and spacious. Staff was courteous and helpful.  There are multiple pools which is great for kids. They also have some dreamworks experience with Kung FU panda and crew going on. Not sure how it is but thats an added attraction for kids.  The casino is not too great. Better ones at Venetian - Wynn - Parisian.  Overall the hotel is really good. Well connected to the other main hotels.,40
"The Sheraton is a huge hotel attached to a big mall (guess most 5 stars in Macau are) and a real busy place. If you expecting personal service and interaction than this is not the place  The rooms are lovely huge with great views. The bathroom also is very spacious. I will not comment on service as everything was very structured with zero personal touch. Good location on the Cotai strip with entertainment, shopping, casino etc all within",40
"Sad that I started to write this review in total darkness... We booked 3 nights & 4 days, the first two nights in a suite & the last night in a smaller deluxe room because my mother was staying with us on the 1st two nights before flying back to Canada. On our first night, we found one of the main ceiling lights couldn't turn off in the room so my mum had to sleep with it on. On the second evening we called the technician who said it would only take a few minutes to get the lights fixed. So we waited.  Here comes the nightmare... suddenly all the electricity in the room went off. No aircon, no tv. No internet. And, of course, no lights whatsoever...

Bunk beds and welcome gifts for the children and some personalised touches added too. Separate bedroom for parents with plenty of space.

Rooms are spacious and upper floors have great views. The pools are fantastic except like many pools in Macau the prevalence of massive high rises all around means they struggle sun even on the days or does emerge from the haze of Macau's smoggy air. The gym has just been redone. You get a smart phone with free data and calls which can also operate a wireless hotspot for your won device both inside and away from the hotel complex. You probably won't need it with most hotels, casinos and restaurants having free wifi. A word of warning it's not that fast but far better than roaming speed from‚Ä¶",50

"I stayed at this hotel for a meeting I had.  The meeting was inside the hotel and we had more space than we needed for a meeting of over 1,000 people.  This place is big.  Because of my status, I was upgraded to an excellent room on the 41st floor.  The only issue I had, is to get tot the 41st floor, you needed to take an elevator to the 40th floor and then find another elevator for the 41st floor.  But the views there were great of the Macau strip.  I did not go to the swimming pool, because I didn't have time, but there were free shuttles to/from the ferry terminal as well as the airport that I did use.",50

The Family Suite was spacious and the kids loved the bunk beds. They also enjoyed the cookies and kids welcome bags.  We had time to enjoy the two lovely pools as well. The larger pool was more for lap swimming but the kids managed to play ball games too.  The gym was also very well equipped.   We were once again greeted by caring and attentive staff at check out.  The Sheraton was fabulous and we would definitely recommend it to those visiting Macao. ",50

I was to receive a gift as well, due to SPG, but I did not. I was promised and given an upgrade to a suite the day after on my four night stay. I also inquired about the spa, and was noted and sent a reminder about a $1200 HKD package fir 90-minutes that would have granted me club/lounge access for my stay.

My most recent experience saw me staying in room 4061, the last room at the end of the 40th floor corridor. Despite the long walk to the room, the corridor was quiet, free of noise from other guests and directly accessible by the lift. Guests staying on the 41st floor need to transfer at the 40th. Room 4061 was extremely luxurious and with a bedroom, lounge room, dining room, entertainment room,1.5 bathrooms and the highest ceilings I've ever seen in a hotel room, it offered plenty of space for a variety of relaxation and entertainment activities. It was great to be able to check-in at the Sheraton club and enjoy the amazing evening hors d'oeuvres and‚Ä¶",50
"I was very impressed with the efficiency & pleasant personality of every staff. The staff of the room service also was very joyful & prompt in meeting my requests.  I would always recommend Sheraton to all my friends & family.  The only complaint I had was that the in room dining was extremely expensive. Had it been a bit lower, I would have considered ordering in.",50
"I am a frequent visitor to Macau.  My choice of hotels is the Sheraton Grand Macao.  Once again, my recent stay was extraordinary in every way.  I give the hotel a perfect score in all categories!  I was warmly greeted upon arrival and quickly checked-in. My accommodations in the Sky Tower were absolutely outstanding, spacious and especially comfortable.  Housekeeping services were timely, efficient and complete.  The dining venues were varied and first-rate.  Shopping is within minutes and truly exceptional!  All team members of the Sheraton Grand Macao were helpful, courteous and most professional.  A quick express check-out.  Many thanks, and I look forward to an early return.",50
"Good comfortable hotel, the evening shrek parade is a must of kids, Nice casino although not the most happening one. The food court (its built like a mall) offers multiple options to eat - you have choice of veg and non veg food. Connected via a pathway to other hotels on the strip.  Has great shuttles to the macau city",50
"A 40th floor suite is awesome at all times and ours here does not disappoint. Being at the front of Earth Tower views of Studio City and The Parisian immediately in front and China beyond are priceless - a wide window seat offers endless moments to just take in the view. A roomy lounge, full bar and powder room caters for guests, the bedroom beyond features a very comfortable kind-sized bed with luxurious bedding. Marbled walls in the ensuite with its free-standing bath in the middle is very decadent and double vanities with separate shower and toilet lend to that luxurious feel. Being at the end of the long corridor means that we are away of midnight foot traffic and closing doors. However, (and this is a BIG negative) the lack of front desk service made making our way up here‚Ä¶",30
"Booked 2 rooms and ask for connecting rooms. Checkin time, Mr Bensum(Front office manager) upgraded us to a 2 bedroom suite which exceeded our expectations. It's very very nice, comfortable and enjoyable for my family. Thank you. ",50
"Grand , true to it's name, beautiful property. Spacious rooms and Massive Infrastructure. Good Casino's and shopping options. The housekeeping service is very good and breakfast is good. Overall a excellent experience.",40
"Stay at this property 2 yrs back and this the 3rd time I‚Äôm w them; what I like about is it‚Äôs location, it‚Äôs within walking distant to most of the other hotel in the coati area and if u don‚Äôt like to walk, they have a free shuttle to bring u around (exit near Mac).  check in at the SPG counter was a breeze. We took a night flight and our arrival was very early, I asked and they allow us into our room in the morning (way bf the usual check in time), we‚Äôre most grateful as this allow us to freshener up bf heading out for our adventure.  Was given a room in the Sky tower on the 30FL w a view of the swimming pool. From an angle was able to catch a glimpse of the Wynn famous fountain. I required a firm pillow for my sleep and put in this request and they were able to accommodate,‚Ä¶",50
"Recommended if you travel on business and your conference venue is at the Hotel or close by. Conveniently located near the town, eateries and great tourist sites/activities of Macau. Bus shuttle service is very efficient and well organised. Concierge and Reservation staff are very helpful, friendly and their Housekeeping, way tidy and efficient. Special mention/commendation here for Mariana Conceicao and her team. Excellent service! With the room rate you charge, it would be good though to package your accommodation with some breakfast deals and the $1,000 HKD per night up-front deposit is way too much! If I had the chance, I will visit Macau again and who knows, a repeat stay at the Sheraton Cotai Central, but Sky Tower.",50
"Stayed one night with my girlfriend and we had an overall excellent experience at the Sheraton Grand Macao Hotel. The amenities are top notch and the staff was very accommodating from check in to check out. We stayed in a clean, spacious room with a pool view. The hotel manager, Alessandro was very professional and took excellent care of us during our stay.  If you have a chance, I recommend eating at Bene Restaurant for dinner. It was an great dining experience before catching an evening show. The pizza was mouth-watering delicious! Would definitely stay here again.",50
"I chose this hotel because it was in the next building to City of Dreams, where we had booked to see a show. However, both buildings are huge so getting from one to the other requires a lot of walking. I chose the wrong day to stay at the Sheraton. It was the day before the Ching Ming Festival so lots of people were enjoying their public holiday. I also joined the check-in queue at 3.30pm (the worst time as check-in opens at 3pm). There must have been about 100 people ahead of me. It took over an hour to check-in! It was my fault for not realising there was a dedicated SPG desk where my elderly parents (who don't usually need any type of walking aids) could've sat down and we might've been able to check-in quicker. When we reached the floor our room was on, we realised the lift‚Ä¶",40
"Registration was very simple. Checking out was even simpler-just dropped the key into the drop-in box. This was a true 5-star Hotel. This hotel is linked with Holiday-inn and Conrad with a common Podium. Travelling to other premises was very convenient. Shuttle buses to Macau and Cotai Ferries. Connecting buses as well as connecting bridges to City of Dreams, Parisian and Venetian were well organized. Places for F and B are: Edo ,Pacific Coffee ,Tao Yuan and McDonald.- Edward Chan",50
"Stayed two nights at this hotel with the wife and three kids.  Booked the family suite as it featured a bunk bed for the kids.  Hotel lobby area is a quite hectic and I think they should have more staff in this area to guide guests.  Breakfast area was at a different tower and so it took a good 10-15 minutes to get there, which is not a great way to start the day....  All in all, not recommended!",20
"It is my 2nd time to visit Macau after 30 years and have a pleasant stay in Sheraton Grand Macao. I choose Sheraton is because everywhere I travel, Sheraton brand is my top priority place to stay. I celebrate my 38th bday in Sheraton Grand Macao with my beloved friends. Beside a big room , clean n lovely swimming pool , I gave a credit to Ms Joyce Alfonso ( receptionist ) for her excellent services. It is what I call a hospitality services from heart. She greeting me with her sincere smile and welcoming me to do registration first as because I came to early by 10.00 am ( check in by 15:00 ). Then she offering me to leave my bag in concierge by telling me which way should I go ( because the lobby is so big ).  At 17:00 I came back to hotel to collect the key ( this is a memorable‚Ä¶",50
"Enjoyable stay although didn't really make use of their facilities. The room was very huge and comfortable, relatively good view. They have a casino which is located at the ground level, which wasn't very crowded, didn't play though. No breakfast provided.   Pros:  - Friendly staffs. - Shuttle bus provided to ferry terminal & airport (shared service with other hotels in the vicinity, take the Cotai Strip one and wait for it to turn to Sheraton before getting down). - Large rooms and large toilet. - Huge twin bed for 1 pax. - Free Handy Phone to use, able to use it as a WiFi Hotspot.

"It's often referred to as the biggest ""Sheraton"" hotel in the entire world. It truly stands upto the expectations and anticipations.  It's HUGE!!! LITERALLY !!! And the love for this hotel is seen right from the moment you enter.. WITH A HUGE LINE in from of the reception. Yes, people have to line up to check into this hotel especially in peak season. But the guys behind the desk are swift and helpful.  We happen to had a room on the club floor which came along it its own sweet advantages.  Don't be ashamed if you find yourself lost in the hotel on the first couple of days. The fact that there is a mall attached to the hotel make it difficult to find your way back into your room.  The dinning area is superb and so are the preparations.  Concierge service is excellent.  The rooms‚Ä¶",50
"It is probably the largest Starwood property that I have ever visited. The setup is primarily for gamblers to hide for couple days, instead of for holiday makers. Once you are in, not easy to get out. Anyway, the management has done a good job in maintaining the service standard. I feel much better after realizing that the room rate was highly subsidized by the other revenues of the owner.",50
We stayed here for 2 nights. The rooms are value for money! My family loves it for the large space and cleanliness. This is a really huge hotel but check in and check out was a breeze.   Great place to R&R. Housekeeping was a bit late in cleaning our room though but it's fine as long as it's cleaned up before bed time.   They gave us a box of Madeleine  for my hubby's birthday which was ok but would have been better if they had entered when we were in the room instead of us being out for security reasons. Imagine if I have things missing from my bags during that short few minutes of the staff entering to give us the gift. I was actually hoping for a proper cake instead though but I guess because I didn't register as SPG member so we wasn't given something better.   The front‚Ä¶,40
"We used our SPG member and got a good rate.  We arrived into Macau airport and took the free shuttle bus to Sheraton directly.  The luggage storage counter was fast and easy.  The check-in queue was long, the SPG dedicated queue was also long.  Our room was at the Sky Tower. Our room was comfortable and big and was facing the pool.  The Kungfu Panda Parade was at level 2, start point at Marks and Spencer.  We also had breakfast at the Kungfu Panda Characters which was accessible from level 4, same level as the swimming pool.  We also ordered takeaway from one of restaurants outside Sheraton and they delivered to us at the lobby. It was the Fei Chai Man and they are famous for their crab porridge.  The food court at level 3 was of Singaporean style and prices are reasonable.  We‚Ä¶",50
"Stayed here for 5 nights for a conference, the hotel is part of Sands Cotai and is usually packed with China tourists. I expected the crowd to be unmanageable and the rooms to be lousy but was pleasantly surprised by how quiet the rooms were. Except for the bunch of generators next to the pool. If you are a light sleeper like me, make sure your room does not face the generator/pool, ask for Cotai view, I had to change my room on the last night as the generators suddenly hummed very loudly at 340am and I could hardly sleep. I filed a complaint but engineering responded that it would not be a quick fix and guest services suggested I moved my room which I did with the help of friendly Sally from the SPG counter.

"I had wonderful stay at Sheraton Macao again! Always loved to have staycation here! Big rooms, bright, clean and spacious, comfortable bed. My daughter always loved to sit at the window looking to the Eiffel Tower at Parisian and this is the main reason make us return again and again. BIG thanks to Mr. Chiang Tin Wai who answered my requests and provide all helpful information before I check in, and in a polite and friendly manner over the phone before I checked into the hotel. Also thank you to Mr Stephen Lei for the smooth check in process and the little present to my daughter. I will definitely return.",50
"We decided to book here for two nights, it was everything you would expect, 5 star accomadation, good service and clean hotel. They gave us a room overlooking the strip and the Eiffel tower which was lovely and also left some freshly cooked cakes surrounded but rose petals and a lovely note to congratulate us on our honeymoon. The room was well appointed and the bathroom perfectly cleaned each day.   Even though this resort has a casino it was never loud.   We don't gamble but really enjoyed walking through the different venues looking at what was going on.  We booked to see the monkey king show which we really enjoyed:)  The free shuttle bus that runs is excellent.  Would stay again",50
"Check-in smooth, everything fine, the room is big and a view to the Parisian. They have handy phone which got free IDD call back to HK, China, Taiwan etc., which is very good for us. it can use as hot-spot for WIFI. They have heated out door pool but the weather is too cold for us so we just go and check it out. We'll definitely come back again for summer holiday. If you have SPG card, the restaurant come with 20% off.",40
"This hotel has 4,001 rooms, when you check-in process, need more time for queu for check-in. Overall the hotel is great! With casino and great location and mall.  Facilities for transportation also great, from ferry pier to the hotel, there is shuttle bus available. ",40
"I received wonderful service! I require a gluten free diet and notified the hotel in advance. The manager of the Feast restaurant personally met with me and arranged with the chef delicious meals -- each and every time!  In addition, the manager ensured that all the other staff in the restaurant knew of my request, and they all made a great effort to make me feel very welcome.  [I was at a business conference, and all of my work colleagues were very envious when the manager would come to the table with my special meals.]",50
This hotel is one of the best hotels in Macao. Staff is soooooo good & co-operative. I found their staff even better than Venetian. Club Lounge staff & evening cocktails at club lounge are perfect. They could even arrange Indian vegetarian dishes for us on special request. Must must must stay in this hotel. So many things for the kids in this hotel. A perfect family place for a holiday.,50
"Check in service was fast, efficient and personable though there was a long queue.   The team was friendly and courteous; proactive and flexible and quickly responded to our questions.   Our special request were attended and smoothly granted.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, the room facilities and the hospitality of the Sheraton staff. Thanks again for the exceptional services. A very memorable stay. We must return to your property on our next visit.",50

Cristina Pascual and Jack Zhao took care of the room arrangements and offered us complimentary upgrades to the Executive Deluxe Suites. So happy! :) Thanks very much guys!

"We stay at the Sheraton Grand Macao 2-3 times a year.  We like its location and easy accessibility to restaurants, shopping and a shuttle bus network that connects you to most places of interest in Macao.  Room rates are attractive and in-house guests can enjoy various spa and dining promotions during their stay.  Housekeeping is efficient and the rooms are comfortable and quiet. With 4000+ rooms, it is not surprising to find long queues at the check-in counters, and the hotel is notorious for its slow check-in process.

The hotel is in Cotai central and the complex has many hotels and mall with lot of options to shop and eat.   The rooms are good and well maintained and the bathroom is also of decent size. The buffet breakfast is expansive and has options for a few vegetarian dishes. The buffet lunch is again grand and the dessert options are really good with all the candies and marshmallows along with ice cream. Kids would really enjoy. There is connecting walkway to Venetian and Parisian and lot of casino options around.  Big conferencing facilities inside the hotel and lot of meeting rooms ,50
We visited Macau during Christmas and chose to stay at this place. From airport they have pickup buses at frequent intervals. Even though there was a big queue at check in the staff was extremely well organized in managing the crowd. The check in took almost an hour but after that everything was smooth. The room was extremely clean and spacious. The view from room is amazing.The room delivery options for food and beverages were good and fast. The hotel has connectivity from within to other attractions near by which makes exploring the Cotai strip easier. During checkout they had option of express checkout and took us only 5 minutes. Again drop off to airport was provided as part of service.Overall it was an amazing stay and worth the money.,40

He did a fantastic job in assisting us althrough out our stay in this hotel. We still look forward on coming back and staying here again. ,50
"Really surprised by how dated and mediocre this hotel is, especially under the Sheraton brand name and on a relatively new property. Long queues to check in, followed by a lengthy walk from elevator to room (admittedly I was warned about this), keycards that worked pretty sporadically, especially in the elevator. The room was pleasant and spacious, but lacked even a kettle to make coffee. The minibar wasn't stocked (although I don't mind so much). The bright spot was a friendly staff member who took my keycard and told me I didn't need to wait in line to check out. Much better available for a similar price point in the area (inc Holiday Inn in the same building)",30

If you choose this hotel for your trip for any purpose, you won't regret it.",50
The hotel located in the Cotai central but only casino area and there is no shuttle to the central.

The club lounge is fantastic with plenty spaces...,40

The room and bathroom were large and expansive and come fully appointed with mini-bar, kettle, cable TV, in room safe etc. In addition the room was exceptionally clean and room service made sure it stayed that way. The air conditioner easily coped with the hot and sultry Macau summer and was very quiet at night ensuring a great nights sleep.   Whilst this is a large hotel, I seldom heard another guest although occasionally Chinese guests could be heard chatting as they walk down the corridor.

Rooms were huge and clean and good view of the other hotels as well. Hotel is of walking distance to Venetian shopping mall through a link bridge. I find that there aren't alot of cafes or restaurants in this hotel. Have to walk over to the other mall (Venetian side). Hotel has shuttle bus service to and fro the ferry terminal and to the old macau where the ruins of St Paul's cathedral is. Have to ask the concierge.",30

My elderly parents are always treated with respect and the staff recognize and treat my parents accordingly. I am grateful for their concern. I find the rooms comfortable, clean and well furnished. Facilities within the hotel are suitable for families and there is always something going on to join in with. The rates are reasonable and you can get desirable deals when booking in advance. Sheraton is loyal to its returning customers and I always look forward to staying at this hotel. Professional staff, excellent rooms and great locality. I'm a loyal fan.",50

"This is one of the busiest hotels I've ever visited. The lobby is a zoo and there are almost always lineups if you need to speak to staff. When checking in or out, I'd allocate an extra half an hour just in case. The hotel is located in the heart of where other high end resorts are situated. Rooms are spacious and pretty well appointed. Overall, a comfortable stay as long as you are ready to deal with the crowds downstairs.",30
Excellent stay in the Sheraton.  Hotel is huge but everything worked very well.  Staff were excellent and the pool was great.  Would be very happy to stay again.  My room was great - bed very comfortable and a large bath.,50
We visited this hotel with our family and other families.   The hotel is nice and clean though it is a very busy place due to the size of it. It is massive. HUGE.   The pools are good though probably not the best for young children but the poolside service is great.   The rooms are quite good. We stayed in a family room. The kids side is naturally more worn out then the parents side but they are in great condition.   The bars are ok and the buffet breakfast is pretty good.   Steer clear of the gaming hall if you are not much of a gambler. Nothing to really see there.   The Kung Fu Panda activity is good for the kids too. ,40
"What an interesting place Macau is. Everything is oversized including the lines for everything.   Spent a few nights at this hotel over Christmas and the checkin lines were like no other I have seen. As a 4000 room property it's to be expected but waiting in lines of hundreds of people to check-in, best to avoid the 3pm check-in time altogether. Arrive late or well in advance and sign up for the SPG membership for a shorter check-in line.   Can't fault the hotel facilities, the pools and spa were amazing.   Food service and selections in the main restaurant were top notch. ",30
We could've stayed at one of the many Hotels this area offers but decided to stay at the Sheraton. Everyone that we encountered from employees to work staff was very pleasant experience. Also the restaurants in the Sheraton seem to be pretty impressive. Although I would so the casino in the Sheraton seems to be a bit small compared to some of the other hotels. If I returned again I would definitely wouldn't mind staying at the Sheraton very clean very nice room.,50

The shops are located at the 2nd floor and food court is on the 3rd. Was not able to visit the pool but it looks nice from our room.

"Sheraton Cotai isn't a bad choice if you don't mind staying on that side. we stayed here for a weekend away us one couple and its not our first time staying here, its usually around USD200-250 a night on average for weekends which is pretty cheap compared to the main island.  Convenience is so so, its walkable but not really that close to say Hard Rock, COD, Venetian but there is a big mall, many restaurants and a casino in the complex. There is free transport to and from the ferry, its not easy getting a taxi here.",40
"Takes quite a time at check-in.Hotel collects HKD 2000 per room as security amount at the time of check-in.(Other hotels collect only credit card info and save with them ) If one happens to get off from the shuttle bus, at the wrong entry gate, then, be prepared to walk a lot, within the hotel itself.

"The Sheraton Grand Macao located central cotai near the Shoppes and across from the Parisian is a cozy little hotel that is also family friendly. When I stayed last night, I noticed a lot of families were there, so if you are traveling with your family, this would be a good spot. Its central location on the cotai strip, like most other hotels, allows for walking distance to any and every attraction you would want to visit if you come to the cotai strip. The price is a bit cheaper than the other neighboring hotels, and the rooms were clean and cozy. No bar in the rooms though, unlike some of the neighboring hotels; you have to order your items from room service that they will then stock in your fridge for you. I prefer to join just have a stocked fridge and be charged for what I‚Ä¶",40

"Was in Macau 3 days as part of a Hong Kong trip. We where very compfy in the 3 room suite - 3910. Nice upgrade for platinum status. One of the best Sheratons I have stayed in. The Club was also very good. Evening snacks actually replaced a dinner one day. The heated pool (29 degrees) was also a nice, and the kids had fun. Be aware that dinners, coffees, shopping is generally overpriced in center that the hotel is placed in. Service was very high in the Club, good advise for old town trip etc.",50
"The Sheraton in Cotai is definitely good value for money.  The bed & blankets were extremely comfortable compared to other hotels that I have stayed at.  Rooms are nice & clean and the complimentary Smartphone to use during our stay came in handy, especially when used as a WIFI router.  Only drawback were the 2 small bottles of complimentary water provided & the difficultly of finding check-in line for SPG Platinum & Gold members. ",40
"I'm sad to say the Sheraton just isn't as good as a lot of the other Cotai options that are cheaper. It's very large, and I believe it suffers for that.   The rooms aren't as nice, you always get a smoking one no matter what you say, and the service suffers from the scale.",30
"We were travelling with a 3 year old and a 10 month old and were attracted to the Sheraton because it offers a family room. We were not disappointed. The family suite comprised of 2 rooms, 1 of which is a normal room with a king sized bed and the kids room has a bunk bed, a child desk and child sized table and chairs. Our kids room has a kung fu panda theme. There are also small touches that made sure little people feel extra special, such as children bath robes, slippers, toiletries. A smartphone is also available for loan which is handy if you don't have data roaming or a local sim. Free wifi is everywhere in this and all other major hotels.  The hotel is conveniently located with easy access to nearby hotels and shopping malls. There is no children's play area at the Sheraton‚Ä¶",50

"Just realized I haven't turned in my review!  This hotel is in the perfect location, even though it is quite a distance to the downtown Macao. It is close to the airport (around 10 minutes) and the hotel provides free shuttle. If you are not into gambling, there are plenty of dining and shops in the property or within walking distance.  We stayed in a regular room on our first night due to full occupancy. Being Platinum, we were promised for a room upgrade follow-up the next morning, which we didn't hear back. We tried to follow-up and were ignored until we asked for the Manager.

Went to Macau for a hen party. There were 8 of us.  At check-in we requested an upgrade and were advised that we could get an upgrade for a total of 4KHKD. The clear understanding was that the price included everything. We insisted on that point. Once in the room we were called by the hotel and told that the 4KHKD was on top of what was quoted for the rooms we had originally booked.  To top it all  it took several hours to get a cable to plug in an iphone and they could only cater for Iphone 4!   Complaints to the hotel have lead me nowhere.  Overall I feel we were misold a product and I do not recommend this hotel.,10
"If you're elite with SPG, don't bother with the ground floor check-in, but head immediately to the club room on the 4th floor. This will save 30 minutes and is an extremely pleasant first experience with the hotel. The club room is one of Sheraton's best and includes a full bar. I've had great luck with upgrades at this hotel.  Despite it's size, it lives smaller. The elevators are fast. The service is prompt. The place doesn't feel crowded, except for the lobby. The pool area is spacious and lots of good space for families. It's a quiet hotel and the security near the elevators is ever present and diligent checking room cards.    Finally, it's amazingly inexpensive for what you get.",50

Free wi fi everywhere They provide 2 mini botles of water In front of the hotel, you can walk to Studio City, parisian , venetian etc No worries, a lot of eatery or store. Just go to the lobby, we can find from mc donalds, souvenir store, coffe shop, bar, casino. Up 1 floor from lobby, we can find beauty store, fashion store, etc. and also connecting bridge to Sands cotai & venetian",50

The room is as pleasant as it was and staff is helpful. I went to the gym room this time, and then recalled i actually had been to their fitness centre some years ago. Facilities are well maintained. And this time i found there's a handheld gadget in my room so visitors could use it to go online. Price is reasonable. ",50
"Bene Italian Restaurant was recommended to us by my dad's friends and it did not disappoint us. The staff name Nello Abuel is super friendly, helpful and attentive. It made our dining experience memorable. I would recommend you to try their carbonara and gnocchi pasta. It is one of the best! I go to Macau often for business trip and would definitely try their alfresco dining (recommended by Nello) the next time I visit. Thanks Bene Italian staff for a wonderful experience.

Perfect 10 out of 10 from check in to check out. SPG recognition beyond outstanding. Thank you for making our stay so memorable and one of the best SPG stays we have had in 12 years.",50

"Overall, the accommodation was great. Big room and very functional.  But since I arrived there on December 27, 2016, the hotel was fully booked and very crowded!! Only Check-In time (from3pm) took almost  90 mins, plus I got only one room after another 1 hour, and another room after 2 hours later!! It was Holiday Season, though  so I understood. There was no Convenient Store nearby, so you should prepare you own necessary food and drinks.  Otherwise, you would be starving because most of food&drinks are quite expensive!!  You can find a big Foodcourt in the area too.",40
This is the place to visit if you want to get a real feel for what it must be like to be a farm animal.  As one of the world's largest Sheraton Hotels they now have management of their guest stock down to a fine management practice.  On arrival you are greeted by a very lengthy roped off pen and staff to tell you 'check in is closed and you must return at 1.00' to be queued with 300 others to be processed.  In the meantime you may line up at another processing station for baggage storage.  In the afternoon when you return you are roped into a very long line for processing.  Once satisfactorily processed you must exit along a new rope line in accordance with their direction.  When you find your way to the rooms it is a reasonable size but quite basic.

Rooms are clean, toilets are well maintained.  This is a good hotel if you get budget deals from various webaites.",50
"I have stayed in other hotels in Macau and Sheraton is just ok. Nothing fancy. Many tour groups from China and other mass tourists which probably cheapens the whole check-in experience. Noisy, crowded and just kinda crass behavior of guests. Perhaps because it is a cheap hotel compared to other hotels in Macau so I shouldn't complain too much. Next time I will stay at the Ritz or equivalent instead to avoid mass tourists who are just too loud and unpleasant. Room is old and lack character, very basic. Many other better and newer hotels in Macau, Sheraton is just too old for package tours only. Stay at your own risk if you don't mind mass tourists ruining your experience. ",30

"Stayed at Sheraton Macau for 2 nights as the prices were way reasonable compared to Venetian. Once you reach the Macau Ferry Terminal, look for the green bus across the road - its the same bus which goes to Conrad/ Sheraton/Sands and few other hotels - ask someone for the bus which goes to Sheraton and just confirm with the bus driver again.  We reached an hour before the check-in but the room was made available to us. The check-in took time and stood in queue for almost 20-25 mins before the keys were handed over. The rooms are spacious and bed comfortable. From our room (30th floor) we could see the Effiel Tower at the Parisian.

What an awesome hotel !! Bigger than I imagined with two towers and massive casino in the centre. I thought being across the water it would be an hour from zhuhai - try 3 by the time customs is complete . I had a standard room on the 36 floor - extra large bed and wonderful bathroom-  very spacious!!  Best was the blow dyer - it was a real dryer 2400 watts I felt like I was at home . The bed linen was absolutely beautiful .. The service from staff was exceptional - concierge was very helpful booking ferries changing flights and arranging sightseeing. The Sheraton connects thru to Venetian and the Shoppes@ four seasons - these are both mind blowing to see Next time 3 day stay !!!  ,50
"The hotel is huge with more than 4,000 rooms, the check-in/out was swift despite the long queues but be prepared to walk some distance to your room. The room are spacious, clean with usual amenities but a little dated. Specify Non-smoking rooms while booking as it may be a problem for non-smokers. Staffs seem busy, but friendly and helpful in general. The Gym is big with updated equipment. Breakfast can be quite a wait, so be early. Location is good as everywhere is within walking distance. It‚Äôs connected to mall, restaurants and various Hotels. The hotel also provides free bus services to ferry terminals and airport. Worth the stay!",40

The check in queue were long but if you are an SPG member you do get a special area for check in which makes it a bit quicker. The good thing is that near the check in area there was a lady who makes baloon animal. This was provided by the hotel which keeps the kids entertained for a while.  The hotel itself was nice and the room was clean. Just be careful when you press the do not disturb button to undo it before you leave as it was not very clear.

I'd stayed in newer Sheraton properties so I believe the rooms in Skytower need upgrading. Great location though and all other things are easily accessible. Good restaurants around, choices of shops, and free shuttle tobpther casinos and hotels. It is just across the Parisian Macau and a short distance to City of Dreams, Benetian, Wynn, Galaxy and even to Taipa.   I enjoyed again my Macau visit staying at the Sheraton. Nice spread of food too for the breakfast buffet.  Good swimming pools, and spa to pamper your body.  The hotel must be less than 10mins from the airport.

After checking in from lobby, it was usually very confused to find the correct way AND the correct elevator to the room. With all the traffic (Lots of people pass by the lobby all the time!)

"The Sheraton Grand Macau is part of the original three hotels (the Holiday Inn, Sheraton and Conrad)that initially made up the Sands Cotai Central complex. The St. Regis was added to the collection recently. This Sheraton the largest hotel in Macau and supposedly the largest in the Sheraton portfolio with about 4000 rooms.    Being such a large hotel it does has its advantages and disadvantages. One of the advantages is that the prices of its rooms do not fluctuate as much during off- and peak- seasons (such as Christmas, Chinese New Year, or Easter) ‚Äì when the prices in some other hotels could go up by 200% - 300% during peak seasons - because of the abundance of rooms available, which makes this Sheraton one of the best valued hotels in Cotai.

Too many people and in one occasion we had to dine in a ballroom, converted into a dining area. Not very pleasant. The room had nothing special, Club rate wise.

This statement could not be further than the truth.  We traveled from HK by Ferry. Met at the Ferry terminal  by a Sheraton staff member and assisted to the car and then taken to the hotel.

However, the whole Sands Cotai complex reeks of cigarettes smell, including our non smoking room. They tried to deodorise whenever we told them of the smell, which only mask the smell for at best for 5 minutes. I can understand that the hotel is powerless when faced with clients that ignores the non smoking rules, which there were many. So I am not really faulting the hotel staff as the staff are hard working and tries to provide a service given the limitations. ",20
The hotel is right in the center and very well connected with other properties. We upgraded the room to the suite but the view was of the back side not facing the hotels. We lived with that as the service was good and the food options at both breakfast and dinner buffet reasonably well. One of the pools were under maintenance and we were a little disappointed but overall the stay was decent and totally worth the amount we paid.,40

Have visited this Hotel many times over the last few years.  This time check in at the SPG counter was very quick and the room was ready.  The rooms are quite big and have everything you need. Did not have any room upgrade for being SPG Gold.  The hotel is easy to get to from the ferry terminal by free shuttle bus.  The l restaurants are good especially Bene their Italian restaurant. Definitely worth a visit.,40
"Let me start this by saying that I currently have no elite status with SPG, and part of the reason I started staying at this property was due to my platinum challenge.  Since I have no status, I walked into the hotel expecting mediocre or average treatment and pretty much figured that the rooms will be your typical standard hotel rooms.  Well, let's just say that I've been pleasantly surprised.  Yes, I didn't get any complimentary upgrades or special perks (you don't get that with SPG until you've at least hit gold), the staffs were helpful.

The hotel stay and the service was really great. Worst part is the membership which I don't recommend as they don't credit any points if you book through an agent.

The location is just perfect on the cotai strip, adjacent to city of dreams and opposite to venetian, which makes moving around the hotel a lot easier. There are even grandeur hotels than sheraton, with a lot more facilities, but for the price we paid, i think we got a lot more and better than our expecation.",50

"This was one of the worst hotels I have ever visited in my life!  1. When I came through the front entrance, I was mind-blowen by how nice it looked as first looks. When I went inside, then I started to stare and could not believe my eyes! Almost half of the check-in area was completely ruined by a large casino! Right next to the check-in desks! They used a seperator to seperate both areas which completely ruined it. This was not what I was thinking, since I was with my family.  2. I had to spend an hour waiting in the line until I finally reached one of the desks. The lines were too long. It took me another 30 mins to get my room, which I previously had booked.  3. When I reached the room, it was filled with a disgusting fish smell, it was unbearable. The walls and floors were‚Ä¶",10
"Spent a weekend here with work colleagues, unwinding after a week of meetings.  The room was a good size and the bed was comfortable.  Unfortunately it rained most of the weekend, but the hotel is connected to a large complex of many shops & casinos & restaurants, so we had a lot of convenient fun without ever going outdoors.  The buffet dinner in the restaurant was impressive.  On the last morning I went for a swim despite the rain; the pool was nice and I imagine it would be terrific in sunny weather.",40
"The Sheraton Grand Cotai Hotel has exquisite decor that typical 4-Star hotels have. The best part is that its price is reasonable among all the exquisite hotels along the expensive Cotai Strip.  To get to our Hotel, we took one of the free hotel shuttles just outside of the Taipa Ferry Terminal to The Venetian, which was the last stop for the shuttle. The ride was about 20 minutes. We then crossed over from The Venetian to our Hotel via the link bridge.  Staff at the hotel, ranging from receptionist to security personnel, were courteous, patient, and professional.  The hotel has 2 huge swimming pools, a warm jacuzzi, and 2 casinos that were run by Sands.  Our room was well-appointed. The room was huge and came with an arm chair with leg rest. I used this as a additional bed.‚Ä¶",40
"We decided to spend the New Years weekend in Macau. It was the first time we stayed at this hotel. We were however taken aback by the size of this hotel, very mass market and impersonal. The staff was well trained and experienced to handle the huge crowd checking in. Rooms were clean and quiet. ",30
"Wonderful stay, together with my group... My Team Members enjoyed this unforgettable experience. We would like to go back someday. The hotel service is excellent. No wonder there is a long queue in the lobby while registering.",50
First impression is very important for every hotel guests. It's our first time to stay at the Sheraton Macau Hotel and we were surprised to see how crowded and chaotic it was at the check in area. I understand Christmas is a peak traveling time and Sheraton Macau is a big hotel. But having to wait in line for 45 minutes to check into a hotel room is just unexpected. We walked around other nearby hotels but seems their check in process were more efficient and organized.   The hotel room is up to standard. Bathroom is spacious. Breakfast was pretty good. Staff can add a bit more smile to welcome their customers. Customer service was ok.  ,30
"Check in was a bit of a mess, because there are two large lines, with no indication of which is which, the wait was rather long even though it was nearly 3pm. Check in interaction was non-existent but at least we got the keys without much hassle. Was assigned a high floor room at the Earth Tower, which is quite a trek from the check in counters.  Upon entering the room was the smell of air freshener, while we didn't bother changing the room, the smell took quite a while to ease off a bit, using full blast of air conditioning. The room was sufficiently sized, with a partial view on the Cotai Strip plus the Eiffel Tower at the Parisian. The bathroom was reasonably well-appointed as well.  The room wifi speed was ok, but it was quite annoying that every time your device is locked,‚Ä¶",30
"Me and my family booked a suit for New Year stay couple months ago at Sheraton Macau. We were expecting very warm and nice stay as we traveled so far away to celebrate new year 2017. First of all when we approch the front desk at 3:40 Pm our room was not ready. We were staying at the reception untill 6Pm in order to get the right suit which we booked. Due to the reservation unprofessional mistake we could not get our suit which we reserved couple months ago. Eventually, front desk gave us the suit which we booked but in the evening they asked us to move the rooms as our type of room was reserved by other guests, however we reserved the same type of the room. As we expected front desk employee would not even care about the guests. Didnt even apologized for their own hotel‚Ä¶",10
"the sheraton grand macao is a monstrous hotel, thousands of rooms......this in itself i think is the bigest problem. check in process is difficult, even as a platinum member i had to que for 45 minutes.....and check in before 1 oclock.....impossible, they dont even allow you to que.  everything else is just massive,....u want to get to elevator....u gotta que, u want go to concierge, u gotta que.u wamt breakfast? thats an hours que at least...i know its high season, but at the sheraton its impossible to avoid due to their massive size.  getting a taxi ??? thats another 45 mi ute que  the room themselve are very average, not bad.....but more a 4 star then a 5 star....if you compare it to Crown or  grand hyatt which are in the same street.....it falls behind alot.  stayed 1 night‚Ä¶",30
Its a big hotel so navigating takes a while.  The beds were typical signature beds so it was a saviour for my bad back and insomnia.  The hotel supposedly has 2 pools but only the smaller pools were opened and there were so many children playing in it that it makes it impossible to do some swimming in it.  Checking in was quite slow but the checking out was a breeze.,40
"I have been staying with Sheraton Macau for the last few years quite frequently. I am very happy to report that in the past few months, the quality of their services has improved so much that it is almost a total transformation. Congratulations to all the people who have made this change happen.   The guest relationship has improved almost to perfection. Every single request is attended to with a prompt follow-up. The attention to the overall services is just excellent.  The staff at all levels and in all departments are courteous and attentive to the guests needs.   I personally want to say thanks for the excellent care and attention given to me, over the past many visits, by Ms. Nadia, Mr .Benson and almost the entire Guest Services team.   The room rates are very reasonable‚Ä¶",40
We had a very large clean suite. Hotel is in the middle of all the action on the coti side. It's attached to a very nice mall and other hotels. Great to walk around and check the hotels out.  There is a casino on site.,40
I have stayed in this hotel for so many times due to their great service and competitive room rate.  I would like to thank for the upgrade room and special amenities offered for our anniversay and birthday celebration from your Guest Relations Team.  This was really thoughtful and impressed for our stay.,50
"Having been to Macau many times and having stayed at different hotels, I am quite informed as to what a well-known hotel in Macau should be like. I have also stayed at Sheraton hotels in Shenzhen and Bangkok, so I do know that Sheraton usually delivers a high quality of service, thus I'd like to think that my poor experience deviated from the norm.  Travelling in a large party of 20+, things can get quite chaotic, but this time it was wholly the hotel's responsibility. Upon check-in, we were informed that one room had been cancelled, which we did not request for. We had paid the full amount (including the room that was ""cancelled"", and had no record of any refund or cancellation). We were then told that a room would be available at 4pm. Understanding that it was peak season‚Ä¶",30
"Its the most reasonable hotel in Cotai area. Free shuttle from Airport, and we also took the free shuttle to Lotus Port! Our room has 2 double beds so can fit 2 adults and 2 smaller kids. Pretty amazing. ",40
"3 days 2 night Christmas Unforgettable Christmas in Macau!  Haven't been there for more than a year. This time I use Ctrip early bird promotion, it only cost us less than $4000 to stay at Sheraton Executive suite including breakfast. For Christmas night, that the best offer I got on Internet.  About check-in, it only takes few minutes in queue, make sure you register as SPG member, it cost you nothing but keep you away from the long queue while check-in. I got a gingerbread man while waiting for check-in :) Guest room is ready when we check-in at 4:30 pm, setup as usual but two additional gingerbread men in bedroom. There is free mobile with unlimited local airtime and data usage, you can use it as wifi hotspot while you in Macau. ( Bad luck, I already enable my data pass with‚Ä¶",50
"This was our first trip to Macau. This hotel location is good and link to shopping mall at Cotai, very convenient. Stay in a club room. Check in on 21/12/16 3 - 4 pm at the SPG counter, the lady who serve us very good but forget her name. She change our room when we told her about the smell in our assigned room. Use the club lounge, find that the lounge understaff and not very helpful. we went there around 9-10 pm. No Staff to serve us drinks. DIY! Went 2 days for the evening cocktail, limited food varieties. Went for the breakfast, Please assigned a staff to make the pancake & waffles, Is terrible to let the guest do it. we struggle during the process. Strongly recommend to improve the standard of the club lounge staffs.",30
"This was our second trip to Macau and we stayed in an executive room at the Sheraton.  On Christmas day the chef's in the lounge provided Turkey and all the trimmings.  A very welcome and pleasant surprise. We would like to add special thanks to Eduardo  C and Marilou Meren who both worked tirelessly over the Christmas weekend at the lounge and we're happy and attentive the whole time , making our Christmas happy. It's really appreciated that you work so hard to make our holiday time special. The hotel is in a great location and recommend the Sheraton. ",50
"Great location to go around Cotai. Room are confortable enough and staff is efficient. The big issue, as it seems from other reviews, it was not just us: it took us an hour to check in,even using the SPG counters. With young kids it felt like an eternity!  On the plus side, the Italian restaurant Bene was a great surprise both with the food and the kindness of the staff making sure the entire family was having a good time.",40
You will be impressed with the massive lobby layout. Very busy traffic. Luckily we were check-in at the SPG Desk with much lesser guest. The family suite we stay equiped with Sony Xbox gear at the kid room with 2 tiers bunker bed. Room in good shape and well maintain considering a busy hotel at much higher occupancy through the year. The shopping arcade houses more shops than before and the food court food quality has improved with few new offerings.,50
"We picked this hotel in our family vacation in Macao and we truly enjoyed our stay. The room was top notch and international buffet dinner was fantastic. The only issue I had was the horrible crowd during the weekends and an unexpected diversion to another restaurant (a Chinese restaurant called ""xian"" with much limited variety in its buffet spread) for our breakfast. I am OK with another restaurant in the hotel provided that the variety of food selection is equivalent and comparable. ",50
"First time in Macau and since this is a 5 star Hotel, we were expecting for a 5 star treatment. But upon entrance, we were dismayed that the Lobby was packed and crowded and there's no lounge area for women nor elder tourists to sit while their companion is on the longest que to get checked in. Guests were sitting everywhere. That's so far the most stressful Hotel Lobby I've been into. ",30
"Planned for a no-casino, just vacation with my kids in Macao for a few days. Picking Sheraton Cotai was a good choice. Took an executive suite with club lounge access but was upgraded to Deluxe Suite upon arrival. The stay was made sweeter with this unexpected upgrade for the next 5 nights. Well-appointed room with living space, music room (doubled up as second bedroom), a large sized bathroom with two toilets! Sheraton Cotai is strategically located. My kids and I walked to almost everywhere in Cotai strip and making full use of the hotel shuttles available. There is even a huge toy shop, Planet J,  Koufu foodcourt & Mcdonald's. But the lounge benefits are so good, we saved quite a bit on dinners by leveraging its evening refreshments which are good enough for a full meal.‚Ä¶",50
"From the day we booked the room (Club Room) to the time that we checked-out had been amazing. We were upgraded to Executive Suite which was a pleasant surprise to start our holiday. We loved our room, it was big, spacious and well maintained. The Club Lounge never disappointed us.. it's as if you would never have to leave the hotel because everything is already provided.. Food (breakfast buffet, afternoon snacks and evening cocktails with food that's big enough to be a dinner), pool, and gym.. Although we had difficulty finding the bus going to the hotel when we first arrived in Macau but that didn't spoil our impression and our experience in Sheraton and Macau. Highly recommended. Great value for money and great customer experience.",50
"Hotel is big and connected to the Venetian through a shop bridge located on the 2nd floor.  Room is spacious with 2 double beds for family. I got the view of the venetian, which was nice for evening sight. The queue for normal check was very long, seems like a 30 minutes queue. I used SPG line which was instantaneously got served.  The main pool wasnt opened during my stay, but they have smaller pool for the kids to play. The water also warm, which was good during my stay. Gym's equipment is also looks new and instructor stood by during my visit in the morning.  Setting aside the food, i guess everything is expected from a 5 stars hotel.",40
"Called the hotel 2 weeks before to add my Platinum Number to my reservation.  Bluntly told by the hotel manager, I will not receive any SPG benefits at all since my room is booked through CTRIP!  I understand that sometimes I do not get any points at a lower rate but this is the first time I was told my loyalty of staying over 100 nights a year is not considered if I ever booked at a lower rate.  I am also a Platinum member for Marriott and I have never had this problem booking through any channels.  I would have cancelled this reservation if it is not for the non-refundable rate my wife booked.  To make the matter worst, my wife called to reserve a crib for my baby and was told it may not be available!?  So my baby will have to sleep on the FLOOR?  5 Star hotel Service!?  Never‚Ä¶",20
"Had a great stay at the Sheraton Cotai back in September. Found the location to be fantastic, right on the strip and across the road from the Venetian and next door to City of Dream. Huge rooms, huge pool, top class restaurants, nice gaming floor, fast food outlets and a plethora of shopping options. Have already booked a second stay there in April!",50
"Check in took about 30mins in queue, nothing to rant about as the hotel is very huge with too much rooms, i guess this takes time to process each check in. Service with smile although the crowd is never ending. A free extra bed in the room. thumbs up to the the housekeeping dropping a letter informing us of the free extra bed as we put a ""do not disturb"" sign whilst we were out on the first day. Request for extra pillows, extra towels and bottles of water were granted without any questions asked. Will be back again.",50
"Finally find time to write in this review. I would like to compliment Cristina of front desk which have made our first time visit to Macau, a very memorable one. Thank you for listening & the extra mile rendered in our request and yr advices on the logistics to HK. Thumbs up for your patience & Excellent service!!  Rooms are spacious, clean with good view of Cotai. We are able to catch glimpses of the performance lake from the window. Beds are comfortable and bathroom comes with bathtub and shower head, with good water pressure. Soundproofing of the room are good. Highly recommended for family with children. Location is good with linkage to the nearby shoppes & hotels.   There's a mini parade at 4pm with Shrek & other characters. My children were very elated to sleep in the bunk‚Ä¶",50
"Good choice especially if you are a SPG member. SPG member has a separate check in counter. The club room is fantastic. Comes with ""Handy"", a mobile device that we can bring out to get wifi connection for free. Very comfortable room and location is pretty good as its connected to the cotai strip shopping and nearby hotel. Airport shuttle to the ferry terminal is convenient as well. ",50

My rooms comes with a city and lake view. The bathroom area is big with strong water pressure which I like the most. The casino is just at the Lobby area. The hotel hv a shopping mall and it is connected to others shopping mall of hotel like the Parisian, 4 season and the Venetian at this hotel which make us spending the whole day shopping in this area instead of going out. The check in and check out time is fast as I done it at the SPG desk. The normal check in desk had quite a long queue. I even request a check out time at 1:00pm at no charge.

"In the main Casino strip of the new Macau, stands the Sheraton Grand. in amongst the maddening world of casinos, the Sheraton positions itself as a family friendly hotel that has partnered with Dreamworks to bring the kids face to face with some of their favourite characters around the hotel like Fungfu Panda, Shrek and many more. While the hotel could go a lot further to really create entertainment zones that specifically cater to families and the magic of Dreamworks, they only really have random meet and greets and a parade that runs through the shipping mall. They could really develop the partnership and drive it to a real tourist stealer if they got it right.

On the morning before checked out, as we could not find the express check out on the TV, we asked Eduardo C. at the lounge, who right the way printed out our folio and advised we could drop our keys at the express check out station around the corner of the elevator,‚Ä¶",50
"I stayed just a night here and was lucky enough to be upgraded to a king bed suite as an SPG gold member. It was a smoking room as that was the only available upgrade they could give me. I didn't mind so I took the upgrade. The suite is huge and has a very nice bath tub and dressing area. The bathroom amenities were ordinary though, slippers given were nice and comfy. The room does not have good view but I could see the water show at Wynn from the window.   This hotel is linked together with other big hotels such as st. regis, holiday inn, Parisian, etc. After asking around at the ferry terminal, I was told to take the holiday inn branded bus. The free bus did not drop me right in front of Sheraton's main lobby but instead at somewhere close by and took me about 3-4 minutes‚Ä¶",40

I really loved the room - comfy beds, great and complete amenities, luxury bathroom.... you'll just want to rest in the room.  The shopping mall was great too. Plenty of things to buy.  Plenty of restaurants and even a food court for more economical choices.",40

As with all Macau hotels it has its own casino, very popular, were an amazing ammount of money seems to trade hands  every minute! Excellent rooms very well appointed , good mattresses, correct amenities. Wifi working well. Absolutely fabulous breakfast, really unusually good.  Reasonably priced establishment. Not a lavish lobby with quiet surroundings where to relax or brownse but breakfast and room are indeed excellent.",40
"Overall the room is bigger than our expectation, and the bed were quite comfortable too. Most importantly is that the toilet have a separated standing bath area which is good as in total there is 18 of us including the kids, young and old, so if the shower area is to be directly on top of the bath tub, the kids and old people would have problem taking the shower as they will need to climb in and out of the tub and as tub area will be slippery it pose as a hazard too. The hotel staff is polite and their service is good, they tried their best to give us our requested connecting room and offered to bring all our luggage; which is really alot, to our room.

I checked in via Sheraton Club and everything was smooth and we were shown to the rooms! The rooms were nice! Great toilets! Great bed and best of all, the room had a smartphone that I could take out and make it into a mobile hot spot.  Convenient if you are walking out and still want to have data connection.

"The hotel is huge just like most big brand casino hotels so be prepared to walk some distance to your hotel room while dragging your luggage if you had refused the bellboy's assistance. Overall rooms were spacious, clean and it was a rather fuss free stay. Good for those looking to get into some casino action as the casino is just located below. However as tourist numbers have declined, number of tables opened in the casino were not as many with many dealers only dealing with one player. Minimum Bet amounts on the casino were also rather steep.",40
"I am a SPG gold member and used to stay in some Sheraton hotels. This hotel give me a very different feeling. Maybe because it is built in a big building with casino. The materials used in room are off lesser quality than other Sheraton hotels. For example, the water control in the shower only have one direction. The hotel is very big with lots of customers. I only appreciate the pool area with warm water area.",30
"So big you can see it from space.  This is a massive casino hotel, sits alongside the Conrad, st Regis, hard rock hotel and Holiday inn, and opposite the Venetian and four season.  Everything is in walking distance, great shopping and restaurants.  Book early if there is a big band or show in town and enjoy.  ",40
"Very big hotel with casino and huge mall in the complex.    The big checkin area with multi-queues looks more like going immigration..a bit too stressful for holiday trip.  Luckily we could drop our door card during checkout which avoided any hassle.  The breakfast at the Feast is reasonably good, but need to book early otherwise no seat.",40
"This is for their FEAST buffet review, we went and ate there because we search in the internet that it was the best buffet in Macau, the food preparation was poor, not enough seafood selections, and the customer service was poor, most of them don't speak English and for $50 US dollar buffet, you would think it comes with unlimited beverages, you can only have either hot tea , coffee or warm water. Even the dessert was poor selections. It's not the same how they made it look excellent online photos. We were disappointed ",20
"It's our 3rd stay here. Every stay is just as good as the last one. Superb customer service, and luxurious rooms. No complaints here. Just a very happy customer. While you are here, I high recommend dinning at Bene Sheraton Hotel restaurant. The food and service is top notch. ",50
"Hotel is located in cotai strip and integrated with other major hotels like Conrad, Holiday Inn, Four Seasons, Venetian, etc.  You don't have to get outdoors to do any shopping. The room was clean and spacious with twin queen beds.  My kids enjoyed the space.  There was also free shuttle service to HK-Macau ferry terminal.  Will definitely consider staying again.",50
"Checked in for a 3D2N with my family and was greeted by friendly front office though they double charge me for the deposit (I paid cash and charged on my debit card). Requested for a Cotai strip view and was told they will try their best. To my amazement, the room had a view of the Eiffel Tower and the Parisian. Though the family suite is actually an adjoining room there's plenty of room for the 5 of us  and the room is fully equipped with kids' requirement (games) and cartoon characters. The bed is definitely their signature and the minute I lay on it I was deep in my slumber. Location wise is on the Cotai strip and shopping and food are never a problem.  Would definitely visit it again and fully recommend it to other travellers.",50
"This was my first visit to Macau and did not know what to expect. I am very impressed by the size and quality of hotels along the Cotai strip. We chose Sheraton because they offered a two bedroom family suit, with a Dreamwork's themed bedroom for the children. There was also the Dreamwork's breakfast and Kungfu Panda Academy for the kids.  The hotel is huge, catering to a large crowd. But even with so many guests, they managed to maintain the quality and service of a high-end hotel. They have a few check-in areas, with the main one having about 10 counters and long queue separators, giving you a sense of the large number of guests at the hotel. The staff were helpful in shortening our check in time. There were about 10 people ahead of us, and upon seeing our big group (8 adult +‚Ä¶",40
"I reviewed this hotel 3 years ago....said it was my ""Best Experience Ever."" How far this place has fallen in such a few years. Carpet worn and stained and torn in the room. Furniture scratched and dented. Room was clean, but felt dated and spartan...towels strictly rationed. Check in staff was less than polite.  Room keys didn't work, TWICE! Pricing now out of sync with Macau....better buys at other properties.  I am very sad that my favorite hotel now feels like a downmarket roadside Holiday Inn from the 70's.",20
"This is one of a very nice hotel along the Cotai Strip. The rooms are big and clean, very nice atmosphere.  Staffs are friendly and helpful especially when we need to ask for directions.  The hotel is located opposite the Venetian, Parisian and Studio City which is within walking distance.  In fact most of the major attractions are located within walking distance.  There are free shuttle buses to the airport and ferry terminals.  However, the shuttle bus drivers are not too friendly.  If you'd like to go to the old Macao city to visit the Senado Square or St. Paul, you may hop into a free shuttle bus in City of Dreams or Studio City (look for the bus which stops at Hotel Sintra and walk about 5-10mins to reach Senado Square).",50
"I have been staying in this hotel 3 years ago and I was satisfied with them.  During my visit this time, I found their room condition, staff service and food quality were still at a satisfactory level.  When I checked in on a Friday later afternoon, initially I was told that the hotel was pretty full and that I could not be arranged a double room.   Upon my request, I was soon arranged a double room -- though on the smoking floor. When I entered the room, I was delighted to find no smell of  cigarettes and the maintenance of the room was good. It had a spacious bathroom which I was very pleased.    I have no hesitation to recommend Sheraton Cotai to anyone who is going to visit Macau and new hotel is not on their top priority.

Concierge staffs need to pay more attention to guests, and attitude, most of time they don't offer help with luggage, when you ask them a question, the attitude and answer seemed like ""that's it, I am too busy""  Room is spacious, comfortable bed and pillow.

Its price is unbeatable when you realise you can book a club room to obtain better service and yes, avoid the rush hours during checkin, checkout and breakfast. The room is of good size, and the bed is simply irresistible. The hotel has great connectivity to anywhere you wanna go, be it the other hotels, shopping malls or the lovely Taipa village. If you have read enough reviews about the other hotels, you would know that you have to pass through the casino in order to get to your room or out of the hotel. It is quite a hassle as I have experienced doing so at the other themed hotels. For Sheraton, it is just amazing. Firstly, you don't need to walk through the casino.‚Ä¶",50
"Fantastic suite which had an amazing sound system in the entertainment room, perfect for leisure trips with friends! Sheraton Club check-in and check-out was great to avoid the long queues at regular (and SPG) reception downstairs. Staff were incredibly helpful with my various transportation and room requests, 7/7 would stay again!",50
"I read some many comments about the hotel but finally the services are over of my expectation. I strongly recommend to apply SPG member and you can get a fast check in from SPG counter.  In addition, wake up earlier for breakfast and avoid the peak time and you can enjoy your time. This hotel is worth to stay and the price is attractive.",50
"Services at this hotel was terrible.  Here are a few examples:  1. When we arrived at the hotel via shuttle bus from the ferry terminal, there were no staffs welcoming us or help us with the luggage.  It's quite a long walk from where we being dropped off to the reception of the hotel.   2. When we make our booking, we requested that the fridge to be emptied out since we were travelling with a 2 years old and hence she will definitely play with it.  Moreover, we needed it to store some food for her.  Not only it wasn't empty and when we try to call house keeping to do it.  They said they can only lock it (which means we cannot use the fridge at all)  and emptying the fridge will require an extra charge.   This is totally unacceptable.

"My first time stay at Sheraton Macao, room is clean and roomy . However, the experience of checkout and breakfast is worst, where during the checkout only 2 staff on duty (along with 20 empty counter..) on a Saturday morning, which I takes 10 plus minute to simply checkout.  The even worst part is the queue for breakfast are extremely long , with over 30 people queuing outside . There are staff around however they are unable to provide any resolution options , which I end up skip the breakfast and leave straight to pier.",30
"the thing that strikes me was the spaciousness of the room for the normal room with 2 beds for our family of 2 adults and 3 young kids, the view was great with the new eiffel tower especially at night. Easy access to nearby hotels via sheltered walkways and attached mall and eateries and entertainment places for the kids. Would recommend for familes and join the SPG for faster check in and check out to avoid jostling with mainland crowds...",40
"Beautiful hotel with friendly staffs. Feel welcomed by the front desk staff with a big warm smile.

It has very good location, close to venetian and it sorrounding with malls (so many malls).  It has shuttle bus pickup from ferry terminal and always rotate every 10-15 minutes. The check-in process is fast and the staff is friendly.  My kids enjoy the lobby because it has many dreamworks character such as kungfu panda, etc. (even it has casino entrance too in the lobby, but it commons in macao's hotel).

"We travelled with small children and stayed in the Family Room (aka ShrekSuite!).  The connecting room for children was cleverly adapted for little travellers and made the hotel environment very easy with kids.  This was certainly our most successful and enjoyable family holiday yet.  My children still talk about it weeks after returning home.  The hotel team were very friendly, everyone wanted to help us, and Macau as a destination is convenient and ideal for families. I cannot recommend strongly enough the Sheraton for family trips to Macau.",50
This is a beautiful property and we were upgraded to the 39 floor on the Earth Tower. Hillary at the front desk help us and made sure we got all the information we need.  Mind you - this is after we had issues with checking in from another person.  Our kids love the pool and the tub in the bathroom.  Would love to come back again.,50

Hi..we visited the hotel from 21st nov to 23rd morning...the hotel is amazing but we have an issue with the security deposited...it has been deposited through cash as well as through debit card..we got the refund of the cash deposit but the card swiped by the hotel staff accidentally thinking it to be a credit card needs to be refunded back...we have sent an email to the hotel regarding this also but have not received any reply as of now...hopefully will get a response from this forum,40
From check in to check out the service was outstanding. We checked in on my birthday and the friendly staff member offered us an upgrade which we thoroughly enjoyed (10/11/16)...even the Madeleine cakes left with a birthday msg that night.

"I've been here a few times before, so know what to expect from Sheraton.  Pros: Room is spacious, and feels grand especially with the gold and cooper decor. We were traveling with a baby and they quickly delivered the crib to the room.   Cons: Checking in process is horrendous with the volume of guests they need to process. Not sure why there aren't more counters to service the guests -- felt like standing in immigration all over again.    However, having said that the check out process was very quick and a simple logging in on the electronic machine in the Lobby (if there is no expenses associated with the room).    I highly recommend you just pay as you go at the hotel (if using hotel services) to avoid a line up at the end so there is no need to line up!   Bene Italian -‚Ä¶",40

The room is big but a little upset that is noise when I stay what is my birthday night. The bed&pillow are comfortable, the shower bath strongly especially, oh, soooo nice for shower, this is the one I special deep memories in all hotel I stay.

We'd used a suite upgrade, and the kind check-in clerk in the club lounge upgraded us another category to the most amazing room I've ever stayed in, a 1,200 square foot executive suite. Hotel was well-equipped with everything you could want. Even our room service dinner was outstanding. Lovely decor, attentive staff, and an amazing club lounge (I'd recommend a club level room). Beautiful pool and fitness facility. And pricing was very reasonable for the value. Highly recommend!",50
"We were originally supposed to stay at this hotel for two nights, however a typhoon warning and canceled ferries altered our plans.  Instead, we arrived in the late morning and stayed just one evening.  First off, I need to commend the hotel for doing what was right and not charging us for the lost night due to the typhoon warning.  With ferries canceled for the day, there was no way we could have made it to Macao for our first night.  I didn't even have to discuss our lost night with the staff - they simply informed me they would not charge me for the first night due to the weather.  This was an incredible display of good judgement and customer service, so thank you.    First things first, this hotel is huge.

However, my husband said, we will still go anyways because we will just stay in Taipa area and not have to depend on taxis to go to Macau side, we should be ok. And sure enough, despite a super busy weekend, everything was smooth and very good for us. Even waiting for a taxi at the hotel's taxi stand was not more than 10 minutes wait. Not bad.

Stayed in this hotel three times now. Every time it has been a pleasant place to stay in a good location but every time it has taken an eternity to check in. They just cannot cope with the numbers. We also had lots of friends and colleagues in the same hotel and everybody had the same experience. Room service also took a while but otherwise the rooms and service are fine. Good option for checking out the Cotai Strip.,30

Central location on Cotai Strip, so convenient to walk to other properties for functions, meetings etc. Clean and tidy. No complaints on room upkeep. Check-in took time. There's about twelve queues, each aimed at different reservations staff - so if you get in the wrong lane you can watch the other lines disappear while you still stand there - as happened to me due to an argument by those in front at the counter. Either the hotel should take problem guests aside, or implement a single queue system to be fair to all guests.

"I stayed at this hotel for a couple of nights on my first trip to Macau. The hotel offered me a really cheap deal online and it was so cheap that I couldn't even find a YMCA accommodation in Singapore for that rate. The hotel, like all others at Cotai strip, offers a pickup from the ferry terminal and I was blown away by the gargantuan size of the lobby cum gambling place cum a lot more. It's really huge. There was a long queue for checkin, a characteristic feature of this hotel. But since I was an SPG member, I had a separate queue. The room was really big and spacious, but you needed to walk a mile through long corridors to reach there. Once there, it's very comfortable and well appointed. The view was pathetic - of a construction site. I could see the airport in a distance.‚Ä¶",40
"First time in Macau, but it was over a busy long-weekend.  Like other hotels and casinos in Taipa, the free shuttle bus service came in handy, were easy to find at the airport, and took no more than 10 minutes to get to the hotel.  Although there were lots of tour buses and crowds in the check-in lines, there was virtually no one in the SPG member check-in area, which is a raised circular platform in the middle of the main lobby with four attending check-in personnel; further, within the special check-in area, a separate line was dedicated to Gold and Platinum Elite SPG members.

Had had a great sleep, uninterrupted by unnecessary calls, room service, etc. and woke up fully refreshed. Check out was also efficient, since we've opted for a quick checkout and dropped our key to a box, with the help of hotel staff.

The check out queues in the lobby and the SPG areas are like dragons, terrible.  Hence I just gave the key to one of the lobby staff on duty.  Having said this, they have express check out on the TV in the room and a few check out machines in the lobby so do use that if you don't want to waste your time.

Reasonable ok with the room and bathroom. However upon check in the room was not ready and only after signing up as a member the room was available. Next day the room was not cleaned and after we approached a cleaner in the late afternoon and requested the towels to be changed we were told it would be done. Arriving back late at night it wasn't done. The breakfast buffet was disappointing. Clearly only aimed at please the mainland Chinese visitors. Most western buffet dishes were near empty and the bread was stale. Not coming back here. On a more positive note the gym was really well equipped.,30

"Stayed in Deluxe King room for a night. I love the comfy bed and fell asleep easily. The bathroom had a separate tub / shower area and bath amenities were provided. For SPG members, you get free WIFI and points accrued.   The hotel is located in the middle of Cotai Strip where numerous malls and hotels link up. It's shop, game and feast til you drop! Getting around in public transport was fairly easy and inexpensive.   Do not expect service to be top-notch of a 5* hotel during peak period.",40
"Stayed here for 2 nights and the hotel is huge, but almost all hotels in Macau are huge. Love the room, it is spacious and comfortable. Big bathroom too.  Enjoyed my stay here. My room was in the Sky Tower.",40
"Hotel is massive - on a scale rarely seen, but the staff were still great across the board, so quality is maintained. Room was comfortable, wifi free, USB charging sockets by the bed and well soundproofed, gym also good. Club Lounge was great in the evening in terms of food choice, but too busy in the morning - it's just not big enough for a hotel of this size. Only other downsides were the signage was a bit hit and miss, busses to the ferry terminal were signposted to entirely the wrong side of the hotel, and the lifts were woeful, one day they just decided to stop working in both towers on the second floor, so you had to go downstairs to get one, then the way they're arranged means you can be waiting for ages to finally get one, it was all a bit odd for a new hotel.",40
"I came to Macau for conference and picked Sheraton as my hotel of choice as I'm a SPG member. I'm surprise to find that the room quality is nice - it is fairly spacious, nicely decorated with all the necessary ammenities, and the price of the room is very reasonable (I pay around USD 120/night).  The hotel is located within a shopping complex - so, it is good to walk around for eating places or a bit of shopping if you've time. And it has a large lobby (but usually it is packed with tourists, hence it can be a bit overwhelming if you expect a quiet peaceful lobby). However, you can gain access to public transport like Taxi or private chartered car easily, and get to other places like Galaxy or the older part of Macau easily.   If you're travelling from HK or HK airport, do‚Ä¶",50
"I have stayed in many hotels in different countries but never been given this kind of treatment:  1. Booked an executive suite for 2 adults and 1 child that comes with breakfast but was told only by the front desk I need to top up another Hkd220 per day if my son wants to eat since he's 6 years old. She was quiet when I asked her if she expected us to leave my son in the room alone while my husband and I go to eat, but didn't suggest any other solution. Of course I was also not able to use any club lounge benefits since I couldn't possibly leave my son alone. 2. Requested for late check out at booking. While I understand this is subjected to availability, the counter staff suggested to me to give up room cleaning service to get a late check out to 2pm. I was under the impression‚Ä¶",10
"Throughly impressed with the public areas of the hotel and located in a convenient location. I emailed Sheraton a week before to explain that it was a special day for me and my wife but felt it wasn't taken into consideration, asked for an earth tower room with a view and was told it was possible through email, but on the day of check in the staff seems unaware that I have even asked for an earth tower, eventually I got an earth tower room but the view was of a construction site. My room has old soap stains on the taps which I easily washed off with water and some scrubbing myself, was really disappointed with how much effort was spend into cleaning my room. Otherwise everything else was fantastic, the staffs I interacted with were knowledgable and friendly, casinos are clean.‚Ä¶",30
"We were disappointed at the service and quality of the hotel.  The rooms were quite basic and stank of cigarette smoke even on the non-smoking floors.   The service was not great. The ""club lounge"" was so overfilled at breakfast time that we were moved to a charmless unused overflow ballroom.  At the Italian restaurant Bene the seaters told us they were full even though we could see half a dozen empty tables. When we did finally get seated 50% of our order had to be re-done as they were out of much of the menu. The Filipino waiters were fantastic on the other hand.  There is a big pool area but half of it was closed when we were there. The other half had only one pool in the sun which was absolutely packed.  Overall, a poor experience.  We would not go back.",30
I stayed here for 3 nights after getting the boat across from Hong Kong. The hotel is a short ride away ad there plenty of busses that go to the hotels or if you don't want to wait around the taxi is very reasonable and an easier option. the hotel was very nice and clean and we were greeted by a friendly reception team. We were In on of the suites which was very large and had a very nice modern/grand d√©cor and 2 bathrooms plus lounge/dining area and an extra room wit TV and pull out sofa bed. Like Vegas all the hotels are linked so its easy to get around and walk out to where you need to go.  the club lounge was also very large and nicely done with a nice bar and seating areas plus a separate large inside and outdoor area for breakfast.

Have a a wonderful stay at hotel. Arrived in Macau from HK by ferry. Very difficult to find Free shuttle to hotel. It was the very last bus on the end of terminal on left hand side. Hotel employees hold up signs informing you of their hotel . Sheraton is included in Cotai Central Coach (lime green bus) but was not clearly advertised. Once we arrived at hotel we experienced a speedy check in. Our room was large and roomy. We had access to Club lounge which was excellent value providing breakfast and evening drinks and canapes. Pool area lovely. Easy access to surrounding Casinos and shops.,40
"That Hotel was a bit too expensive for what it offered. The stuff was quite friendly and everything was clean, but the room was really small, the view was bad (construction side) and the pool closed really early. Not again in this Hotel. There are many other Hotels in this price category which offers more.",20
"The Sheraton is a large, twin tower hotel located right in the middle of the Cotai strip. There is easy transportation from Ferry or Airport. It‚Äôs a large hotel within a massive shopping Mall which spans several hotels, including Conrad, Holiday Inn, St Regis, and a short walkway across the road from Paris and Venetian. All other area hotels and attractions are a walk or free coach ride away. Spent two nights at the Sheraton for our first trip to Macau. The room was clean, spacious and very comfy. The facilities of the hotel is good and new, great gym area and nice outdoor pool. The breakfast was great with large selection of food. Really a good place for shopping or enjoying shows in Venetian theatre, the city of dreams house of water and the studio city. All together a GREAT‚Ä¶",40

There is only a outdoor pool so in winter the water was very cold . The entrance is beside the casino . The staffs was very nice and polite , the room was clean , though . The place was also convenient to Venetian and Galaxy .",30
"The room is spacious, even for 3 adults, complete with a big luxurious bathroom. Free shuttle buses to nearby hotels and ferry terminals.  The Parisian and Venetian are just across the road. The food court offers a good variety - we are glad to find our favorite breakfast place, Ocean Empire there. Only 5 mins taxi ride to Taipa Village for yummy pork chop bun and crab congee.",50
"Sheraton has been our go to hotel whenever we are in Macao, but we notice that service has slipped a bit on every visit.  The club room attendants were friendly, but we noticed that they do not offer as much variety as before, and it got to be a bit of a zoo and over run with people.  We had several rooms on different floors, so the elevator banks were a bit confusing as they have signs clearly marked in the lobby level as to which elevators will stop on certain floors, but when we are in our floor trying to get to other levels, we have to go into each elevator to see if it goes to the floor that we want. . .which in turn slows down the passengers on said elevators.  Better signage and elevator bank management would be beneficial.  We also noticed that in our 5 days there one‚Ä¶",30
"The room are top notch in design, house keeping and ambience. As it is my first time in Macau I am pretty lost but when I was checking in at the huge lobby, I am very impress that it is very well managed with crowd control and the customer service may be the best I ever encounter.  I have to really thank Mr Benson Hill for his excellent customer service as he not only gave us informations on how and where to go, he also patiently explains to us about many facilities in the hotel that is very helpful to us.  Thank you so much for all the assistance you had given to us and we will definitely ask our family and friends to stay in this marvelous hotel.",50
"Lots of activities inside the hotel. location good. Pool of course not as spectacular as Galaxy's. Kids still have fun. Kung Fu Panda activities my daughter loves v much. However, my son is afraid of the Panda. So even that is not for everyone. ",40
"Stayed here for 5 nights. Pricey but i can understand why. You don't really have to go out much since almost everything is here, the Cotai shops & restaurants are within the complex. Although the other hotels are just a LONG walking distance away, if you want to explore. Lots of walking. And you can always find a way to visit the old part of Macau via the free shuttles the hotels offer. The breakfast has good choices but a couple of times we didn't even bother & just had Starbucks pastries & coffee. Overall a nice experience & i wouldn't mind staying there again.",40
"It was my first time to Macau after 20 years. I travelled with my elderly parents to this hotel from Zhuhai/GongBei port. I read from the website that the hotel provided free shuttle to/from the port. Instinctively, we expect a vehicle with Sheraton logo on them. When we arrived, there were no staff to greet us and point us to where we have to go(unlike other hotels in Cotai Central). There were no signs and directions either, 3 of us had to walk around with 4 suitcases to actually find the bus stop. Eventually, I saw a minibus with Sheraton logo on it(as well as other hotels like Conrad). I asked the driver where is the bus stop, he pointed us to a direction. We still couldn't find them, we walked back & forth few times in the rain before going back to the driver. The driver‚Ä¶",20

Stayed there for 3 nights when I had a conference in Macau. It was a maassive hotel so understandably the service might not be attention to details. It did not offer turn down service and your room was not tidy up until 4 or 5pm each day. Staff could be cold and unflxebile.  They did offer me a upgraded room which is very big but I did not have a chance to enjoy it due to my busy meeting schedule. But I did appreciated.,30

The Sheraton Macao was in a great location accesible to other casinos and lots of shopping and great restaurants. Casinos were a bit small but there's a bridge that links it to the big Venetian hotel and casino. Rooms were comfortable but average sized. Overall a nice stay,40

There are multiple kids pools which easily accommodate families with kids.  The day I visited had a lot of people but there were still enough sunbeds.",40
"This place is truly behemoth. Built on top of cotai strip mall which it shares with 4 other hotels. This is a self contained city. If your only desire for going to Macao is to relax & gamble then look no farther. There are a lots of different casinos with all the usual games like baccarat, casino war, roulette & blackjack. The rooms are really spacious & well furnishes. They even have free shuttle to the ferry piers (terminal & Taipa) at regular intervals. Avery nice place to stay",50

Due to many flight delays, I checked into the hotel at 4:00am, but even at that hour, the staff was gracious and attentive.

As my company was hosting a conference at the hotel, I had the pleasure of working with the conference staff members as well.  Each and every team member treated our group as if we were the most important customers of the hotel, and all of our conference attendees had wonderful things to say about the service.

"We stayed three nights at this hotel, it was great location as the shops and entertainments are all located within the complex or connected to one another. It was great as we went in May and it was very hot and humid already. Travelled as a family with 2 kids (3 and 1) so they weren't happy to go outside too much due to the heat. However it was easy to get around to the other hotels like the Venetian. Only slight issue with the pool was the temp, it was a bit cold for the kids (although it was 30+ degrees outside). The breakfast was great with large selection of food. The kids loved the daily shows within the shopping centre where Dreamworks characters danced around. Unfortunately I didn't get to go into the casino so I can't comment on them. For us, 3 nights was plenty in Macau‚Ä¶",50
"One of four connected hotel along the east side of the strip in Cotai. It also joins the Venetian/4 seasons via an enclosed walkway. The hotel looks western and the beds are comfortable. We stayed during the busy Chinese Golden Week celebration so it was packed. I had booked online so the check in was quick. No baggage help was offered at the counter. There was help as the elevators to the tower as it can be confusing what elevator goes to what floor. The restaurant in the large lobby next to the casino is overpriced and offers limited items. There is a food court on the third floor of the central corridor. Overall if you are going to the Cotai are of Macau, you are just looking for a place to keep you clothes and sleep. With so much going on, there are many places to explore‚Ä¶",50

For the facilities, the gym is also good, spacious and well-equipped. Only the pool is little bit small, it is better for kids and babies, or for family. For the hotel room, room size is okay, mattress and quilt are also good too. Compared with other hotels nearby, overall is good.",50
"We spent the last weekend in Macau and stayed at the Sheraton Grand Cotai Central, because it is kind of new and within the complex of Cotai Central. From the moment we left the ferry terminal and waited for the shuttle bus, I noted that one from Sheraton was less frequent than others. We waited for about 15 minutes for a shuttle bus to get to the hotel. We arrived early and they could not accomodate early check-in because the hotel was pretty full. That's understandable. Our room was a delux twin. The room was clean, and the bathroom was spacious. But for a 5 star hotel, you couldn't believe that there was no comb in the bathroom for use.

However, nothing can be arranged (What if they could just arrange two connected rooms for us, it would be easier for us to stay close) and the hotel staff suggested us to stay separately in different tower of Sheraton Grand today. As a well-known brand hotel, the communication skill and interpersonal skill should be in a professional manner.

Now first, let me say in all honesty, my stay was during Chinese Golden Week, which is probably the worst week of the year to travel in China.

This was an exciting trip. The closure of the jacuzzi on most days was a bit annoying but on the 2 occasions really nice. The language was a bit problematic.  Ask for a Porter you get water. Ask for a sewing kit get a shaving kit. Again a Porter and they ask you looking for your daughter. But the service was great and the concierge especially the Allan was extremely helpful in shopping advice. The food great . The rooms superb.  ,40
"Stayed here for 2 nights at the end of September 2016. Prior to arrival, Sheraton prepared a useful info email on checking in and the access to the hotel via various shuttle buses. These were great and helps us in reaching the hotel. The room was clean, spacious and very comfy with an additional bed requested. We could see from the window  the ""Eiffel Tower"" across the Parisian hotel. Nice! There were many shops around and we did indulge in some of the dining and shopping here. It is quite central with short walking distance to the various hotel resorts around. Overall it was  a great stay and my family of 3 truly enjoyed our trip staying here. Will definitely come back.",40

"The Sheraton is a large, Vegas-style hotel in the Cotai district, surrounded by many other familiar hotel names.  It's comfortable and busy, with many eating options.  The room was comfortable and well appointed (although no tea-making facilities), but I suspect you have to upgrade to club rooms for additional comforts that would make the experience stand out.  The view from the window was a rather depressing building site, but with all the construction in Macau, that is hardly surprising.  It's close to shopping malls and other hotels (esp Venetian), all accessible by foot.  Staff were helpful and everything seemed to work.  Huge queues for taxis at certain times - although that is a regular problem in Macau.  All in all, it's a good hotel, but difficult to work out what makes‚Ä¶",30
"1st time in Macao, choosen this hotel not because free shuttle bus from the pier, But I love this hotel one of starwood member, just take a quite bit long waiting the line to reception, where I check in with the group. overall the service is good, the wifi connection is good and free too. I  enjoy to stay along 5 days at this hotel and I like the breakfast so many variants everyday. ",50
"We purposely chose to stay at one of the hotels in Cotai Central considering the proximity to other demanding malls and the chaos around them. Sheraton was a clear choice due to its prior experience. the hotel is well maintained with a busy lobby throughout the day. It is well managed inspite of 1000 s of checkins and check out with a happy smile :) the rooms are well equipped and are spacious. We stayed here for 2 nights, it has interconnecting walk way to the Venetian. Cotai Central had many good option for shopping and had an elite crowd. They have a newly opened kids play area near the food mall worth the try. my little one enjoyed a lot there. The individual pool idea in Sheraton was a need of the moment to relax.The casino at the G level was huge and extremely tempting.‚Ä¶",50
"I stayed for 4 nights.  My room is a suite so you got a lot of exercise when moving around the room.  Good thing is that I could have meeting with my colleagues in my room after work.  I did experience some problems (key card failure and pumping problem causing water leakage) during my stay, but who knows, it can happen anytime.  Most important is they got fixed promptly.  I saw many negative comments on the staff attitude.  My experience with all staff are very helpful, proactive in offering information and always wear a smile.  Sometime people interaction is two directions, it mirrors.    It is a big hotel connecting to those big hotels in the zone.  It is unavoidable that you got large group of PRC visitors talking loudly at the lobby and shopping arcade.  So, be prepared for‚Ä¶",40
"As one gets into Cotai, the property identifies by itself. The tower having a side entry to its welcoming lobby and one of the largest receptions encountered by us in the hospitality Industry.   Our check in formalities were fast. Room allotted with a little wait, but worth the wait. As we entered the room, a feeling of warmth awaited us  with the ambience surrounding it. A great view from the room of the Cotai along with the numbers of properties all around.  Room was very well furnished to taste with great pillows and a very comfortable bed. Amenities excellent, obviously to Sheraton standards.   Though the property doesn't have a conventional lobby, as Casino being part of it, but the concept calls for all the great selling brands right their.  Breakfast was great. Lounge‚Ä¶",50
"Your typical 5 stars hotel with gaming, expensive restaurants and lots of shops next building.  If you are ok with walking, then Venetians, City of dreams are all accessible by foot. Getting to and fro airport and jetty is easy as they have shuttle bus. The dates that we stayed so happen is during school holiday so there are lots of kids and pretty noisy (merry). We travelled with senior and it is quite difficult to walk around and taxi is a headache as most will complain if destination is just nearby.",50
"Most staff were polite.  I'm quite confusing in talking which language to them, Cantonese, English or Mandarin.  Wifi in room was failed in these 2 days even they had reset again.  The shuttle bus service is not so comprehensive compare with other hotels in Cotai.",40
Room is large and comfortable. The housekeeping staff is helpful! The only thing is disappointed was the shuttle service. Way too long to wait for it! The shuttle gets full usually and stopped for a while without reason for every stop although it was full,40
"My first trip to Macau  and we stayed for 4 nights.   We had a huge room  so much so it felt empty, wish it had a sofa /coffee table set.   Probably one of the largest bathroom  that i've been  but for me it lacked hanging space.  Slightly mouldy shower area.  Not so much of gambling for me but perfect for shopping , there are a plenty of shops/boutiques to keep busy.   Went sightseeing  around Macau ,  unfortunately  for me there was not much to see.  Been to europe  a few times , hence St Paul Ruins did not impress me. Last but not least, worth  going for a show at  The House of Dancing Water Show.  Overall , we had  a great time shopping in Macau (hence the Very Good rating! )",40
"Stayed here a couple of times for business. The lobby is always crowded and packed with people, not relaxing if you are on a holiday. Room are decent size but quite run down and quite dim. Good location close by shopping malls and restaurants but wouldnt be my first choice of hotels in Macau.",30
"My wife and I spent 3 nights at the Sheraton celebrating our 15th wedding anniversary. We were very underwhelmed. It was our first time to Macau and booked this hotel based on the reviews of trip advisor and also the advice of a friend. We upgraded to the club floor for the breakfast and club access for happy hour. The room itself was fine. The view was not good. We looked directly out at the other tower, the roof top in between the towers and the construction that's going on in the area. If we look directly right we could just see the Eiffel Tower at the Parisian but that was all. On our first night we were tired after walking and gambling. We decided to order room service for dinner (not our usual but not uncommon for us either). The menu was very short so we decided on the‚Ä¶",30
"I have not been back to Macau in 10 years since I am not a fan of a Vegas like atmosphere.Prior to China taking back Macau I had lived in Hong Kong and owned a beach house on Hac Sa( Black Sand) Beach which is part of Macau. It was my weekend retreat for peace and solitude.I sold the house and moved from Hong Kong for personal reasons.Coming back to Macau this past week was quite a shock in some ways and quite pleasant in other ways.The center of Macau still has it's charm despite the endless construction of high rise apartments that seem empty.The Vegas part of Macau is situated on a strip of land called Cotai where most of the gambling luxury hotels are located.What I liked about The Sheraton is despite having 4000 rooms,being fully occupied and located on the center of the‚Ä¶",50
"The Sheraton is a large, twin tower hotel located right in the middle of the Cotai strip. There is easy transportation from Ferry or Airport. Its a large hotel within a massive shopping Mall which spans several hotels, including Conrad, Holiday Inn, St Regis, and a short walkway across the road from Paris and Venetian. All other area hotels and attractions are a walk or free coach ride away. We had a Club room on 24th floor, with Lounge access included. Rooms were clean, spacious and well equipped. The view from our room included the Fountains at the Wynn. Another privilege was check in and out at the club lounge rather than waiting in the huge queues at the front desk. The negatives were 1. The non -exclusivity of the Club Lounge access. I've never been to a hotel where this‚Ä¶",40
"The hotel is located at the city center. Bright lights, tall building, busy place to be. Since this place is huge, you can easily get turned around but there are staff almost at every elevator and doors to help you find your way. Concierge plays a very essential part of your every day stay since they will direct you to which bus/coach terminal you need to go to get to your destination. Hotel food is great, however, do not miss to taste the local food of Macau esp the egg tart. Hotel rooms are very beautiful, view is magnificient. It is truly great to be here atleast once in a lifetime.",50
Spent three nights at the Sheraton for our first trip to Macau.  The hotel is in a great location.  Directly opposite the new Parisian and with a view of the dancing fountains atvthe Wynn from our 24th floor room. We paid for an executive room which included a free buffet breakfast and free drinks and snacks between 5.30 and 7.30 pm.  The food was good but the offer open to so many people it didn't really feel exclusive or special.   The rooms are spacious and the bed linen was luxurious.  However the room wasn't cleaned until after 4.00 pm which was just the time we wanted to get changed for the evening.  There was a range of pools but not all were open and most were shallow which wasn't good for swimming.  On the whole good value for money but there is plenty of competition‚Ä¶,40
"If you like glitzy, flashing lights, this hotel is not for you. It is s a little away from the neon and affords a measure of sanity despite there being a casino in the hotel. Nothing flashy about the property but it connects to Cotai Central (where high-end designer shops abound) right through to Shoppes at Venetian where you will find mid-range boutiques and more reasonably priced buys.  A bit of a language problem with service staff at the Sheraton who generally are unable to cope with English, but gesturing does help a little. Rooms are good size and the 32nd floor offered views of surrounding lights from hotels. Great deal of bustle surrounding the upcoming opening of The Parisian complete a day after our departure.  Macau town is really a delight of quaint shops and old‚Ä¶",40
Got the bus from the HK ferry and after the 40 minute shambolic check in got to our room. It was clean and large with enough space for the three beds we had requested. The only less clean areas seemed to be the lift lobbies but when you consider the numbers using them it must be a never ending job. The view over to the Venetian was good and the bathroom came with separate bath and shower. We did some sightseeing by taking a local bus from the stops outside and across the road. Food in the food court is quite expensive if you are watching the cash to spend in the casino.,40
"I recently visited Macau and stayed at SHERATON hotel. It's in a complex with other two Hotels but as per my experience, I think the SHERATON is best out of all three. I have stayed here before also and the quality and service is as good as always in Starwood branded hotel. It's Recomended specially in the sky tower ",50
"Cotai is a luxury area that everyone is coming to spend! Sheraton Grand Macao Hotel is the cheapest hotel among those luxury hotel. The room is very new and grand, The bed is comfortable as usual Sheraton style. According to the price I have no complains at all but lack of personal style.",40
"Although the hotel is huge and seems to be crowded all the time when you go to the lobby, it is easy to find seats at the restaurants or at the poolside. It offers free WI-Fi connection. The room was spacious, the bathroom has shower and bathtub. The personnel is friendly and helpful. The Guest Service is excellent and speedy. You are very near the shopping malls, have a large casino on the ground floor, pools on the 4th floor, restaurants, meeting rooms, ball room, spa. It is also located very close to the airport (5-10 minutes by car).",50
"Second time stay there with friend for short trip. However, a bit disappointed to stay there for two days. This time the room very smelly. Requested to change pillow and do house keeping again but have old people smell. A bit disappointed since last time is not like that. Will try to find a nice hotel in Macau instead.",30
"Visited for a business conference so had limited time to explore all facilities.   Overall stay was comfortable and the rooms are very spacious. Room service is slow, may be since the hotel expanse is huge. Facilities are at par with best of the world properties.  Views around the hotel depend upon which room do you manage to get, Venetian view gives best view on the front side from higher floors.  Being a large property, it will involve a lot of walking around though, would not be recommended for senior citizens.",40
"It is five star hotel. WE visited two years before.Very good hotel with spacious rooms. It is luxury hotel with good service. There are all big brand shops under one roof,so you can enjoy shopping also . It has very big lobby and situated in Cotai Centre.",50
Ambience & modern look beyond words. Speechless !!! Huge larger than life hotel.....conveniently located.....well connected to the malls & casino. Check-inn & Check-out facility although courteous....but it's a huge time consuming activity. Rooms are fantastically decorated with good amenities.,50
"Yea; that's the highlight of the Sheraton :) that it's across the road from the new Casino-Hotel-Mall: The Parisian & 'The Venetian' and the City of Dreams. Just realized that being a SPG gold member did not account for much with them either as I was hoping for a room with a view at least.  What we liked as an experience was the Xin restaurant in the complex and their 'Hot-Pot' dining experience where one had to pick the seafood and meat they desired and have them dropped in the choice of broth. The breakfast or the dinner at their other restaurants were just average.  Like I mentioned in the subject, the proximity to the 2 major casinos is a major point as one usually comes to this part of the world for the casinos and maybe shopping -- even though I got lucky at the Sheraton‚Ä¶",30
"We stayed for a night with our little one. The room was very big, especially when we had just came over from Hong Kong. It was a comfortable stay, everything was clean and well-maintained. Called for top up of towels and they responded very promptly.   The property itself was huge, so the crowd at the various lobby areas can be quite daunting. At check-in, the queue was long but they had entertainment in the form of balling scrupling for my boy. at one part of the lobby, There was also a small booth giving out cups of marshmallow and popcorns for kids. My boy was given a cup of marshmallow which he didn't want so we asked for a popcorn on the spot but was rejected.  With the large property, one would have to be aware of the walking distance. It should not be an issue for older‚Ä¶",30
"Sheraton Grand Macao is one of the luxurious hotel located in Sands Cotai Central. it's new, trendy and very comfortable. and the pool is a place must visit specially overseeing the newly built Perisian across the street. the only draw back is the super long queue lining up during check in (they allowed check in at 3pm) suggested to plan a head, as for check out, it's very quick (just do the express check out)",40

Really nice view. We had enjoyed a lot our stay, the staff was very professional. It worths the price ",50
"this hotel is very big and crowded, of course you can not see a quiet hotel, the first ground is the hotel casino and there are shopping centers around, i have stayed in Sheraton sky tower , luckily the view was perfect and wonderful, the hotel was really clean and modern, i didnt have chance to go to casino but next tiem i will try it",50
"It was my first time in such a huge complex. The hotel looks really clean and nice from the outside. It many different restaurant, a casino, an entire shopping mall attached to it, a spa.. It is a city inside the city. You can spend your entire stay indoors.  The room was spacious, but rather old. As my second hotel stay in Macau it wasn't my favourite place, and I wouldn't book there again.",30
"Sheraton beds are so comfortable! It's in a great location and awesome outdoor pools.  Coming from Hong Kong , it definitely worth the trip over. The website always has good packages and deals. We also went to the spa, they have great body scrubs and the massages are simply divine! ",50
"Sprawling, somewhat impersonal and very average in service-- though generally clean and comfortable.  The enormity of the place is a turn-off-- makes you feel quite lost.  Bfast is also not great-- but ok otherwise",30
"This hotel is huge!!!! But it feels just like another huge Vegas hotel with no soul. We had a huge room, but the room was nothing to write home about. It was big but bland. Check-in was crowded and the priority line was slower than the normal lines. The club lounge has a decent breakfast and happy hour but again, nothing spectacular. Service was spotty and ranged from good to meh.... Overall, nothing much to write home about.",40
"You will find the services there very pleasant.  The staff I met at the SPG counter at the G/F, at the 4/F Business centre, the lounge and those from the housekeeping team are all polite and attentive.  Their pleasant manner will make you feel very comfortable.  I must say that both Mr. Joe Huang and Ms Mariana Conceicao possess the top manner in serving customers and their pro-active manner in dealing with situation are highly appreciated.   I also find the suite I stay at is of good view and well decorated.  In all, I find a very nice and worthy stay at Sheraton Grand Macao Hotel.  Thumbs up!!",50

The Bellman, the concierge,the front desk employees,  the security officers the housekeepers the poolside attendants, the entire staff at Bene Restaurant (Mandi was great). What a great experience. Nick yang the room service guy. Everyone was so polite and so helpful I had a great time here",50
"The hotel is situated on Cotai Strip with free shuttle bus provided. Check-in was unbelievably slow at 3 pm during the peak season and it took me over an hour to queue up in the lobby. The lobby was overcrowded with guests but front desk staff are helpful luckily. The room was okay and definitely worth its price (ard 700 hkd through travel agency). Room is spacious but it is just within expectation. Wifi was slow and disonncected regularly and I found it frustrating. Anyway, if you can spend 1000 hkd or more, don't consider sheraton macao.",30
"It is a grand and flashy hotel. The complimentary breakfast spread is huge. Indian breakfast items are available. However, vegetarians need to be careful as most of the food items contain meat or eggs. The hotel is inter-connected with other hotels like Venetian, Conrad etc. There is free shuttle service (pick-up and drop) from the hotel to airport / jetty. There are no hotels or shops in the vicinity and one has to travel all the way up to the old town for shopping. Food is extremely expensive in the hotel. For guests, the pool facility is complimentary. There is a counter for booking ferry tickets and for local tours. Watch out for tour discounts from the ferry operators.",50
"Surprising that Sheraton has such an average hotel and casino in Macao where luxury and style are common themes for any hotel I have stayed at Venetian and Marriott in the past and they are miles ahead in terms of everything   Very standard fare which you should not expect in 1500 hkd a night. Check in is a nightmare with queues miles long , wifi slow and disconnects when you move in and out like old technology and room just ok. If you can spend 1500 hkd or slightly more then Sheraton is not a place to be in Macao ",30
"Too expensive for what you get,  250 euro per night and no breakfast included. Very noisy room with a massive on going construction site outside. Slow service and staff english very poor. Too crowded cheap casino atmosphere.",10
"The hotel is best value of money. The location is awesome very close to all major attractions. The room is spacious and all amenities are top class. Many swimming pools catering for young children, Venetian 300 metres away. I will love to stay here again. The view from 28 floor was amazing it appeared as if I am in Paris.",50

Got to my room, looks ok, very weird smell, no snacks except for a vending machine down the hall, that's a 1st. But ok.  Went out first night in Macau, got back to my room at 4am, slept about 5am, then at 8am was woken by a loud BANG BANG BANG BANG, sounded like construction upstairs, waited an hour, still going, fed up, called the front desk, they said they would look into it, 30 mins later, nothing... i call again, they say ok they will send someone.

"The hotel is very well maintained with great service. We had booked Club Room and the club experience was satisfying.  The hotel has free bus shuttle service from Macau Ferry Terminal and Macau Airport. Being a large hotel, check in usuallly takes 20 to 25 minutes. The hotel is connected to mall and the guest have option to go out for shopping any time of the day.   Rooms are clean and tidy and the room service is also quick and prompt. The hotel has  assorted food options, but being vegetarian we did face some poblem as the buffet did not contain anything strictly vegetarian. However, upon request we were provided with vegetable sandwiches and the staff was more than ready to help.  The hotel's swimming pool is one thing that must not be missed. The pool is very well maintained‚Ä¶",40

As SPG member, we received a better service such as different reception area; which is great because of the shorter queue.

I highly recommend this hotel and surely will be back if I ever visited Macau again in the future.",50
"When we entered this hotel, me and my friends were all astonished by this splendid view! Also we loved employees we met here, who were all very welcoming! Specially thank to Siska who impressed us with her big smile, and very kind offered us such a great room. Room was tidy and neat, in addition, you must try that cozy bed! We plan to come back in next vacation thank you all:"")",50

The all you can eat buffet dinner at the restaurant place called feast was a little expensive but it was very well worth the money as there was a large variety of food to chose from. I particularly liked the seafood the most, there was a lot of it and it tasted very nice and was fresh. The hotel beds were good. Nice and soft and comfortable. I highly recommend this place.",50
"I always wanted to stay in a large hotel, and you can only do that in Las Vegas or Macao!! This is why I selected the Sheraton, located in the center of the Cotai Strip. My Sheraton Club Room was lovely, specious and clean. The access via the dedicated check-in makes your experience even better. The food in the Club Lounge was very good.

However, Sheraton Grand Macao have it all very well managed in some way! Awesome work! I've stayed in standard rooms as well as suites in this property, also had the access to the lounges. In my humble opinion, the breakfast at the club lounge was better than the one at feast. However, it is my own opinion. Sheraton Grand Macau is suitable for all purposes, no matter if your here for a quick getaway or on a family trip or even for business.

The Sheraton is very central, with other hotel/casinos next door or over the road, including Venetian, City of Dreams, Wynn Palace, The Parisian and Studio City.  Ideal for those wanting to walk between the casinos.   If you search, you can find some very competitive prices for the Sheraton which are significantly cheaper than similar quality hotels.

Overall a pleasant experience and good value for money. ",40

There were several gray marks on the wall.  The chair was not clean too.  The swimming pools there all small ones.  It may not be suitable for someone who wants to swim a longer distance.

"We have a problem in the hotel, but they try to solve the problem as hard as they can. It was important traveling other cuntry. The hotel's swimming pool was not crowd and it was divided that's why. If i visit Macau once more I will stay at Sheraton again. But refridge was not cold, cool too!!",40
"The property is very nice, suite rooms are large, well appointed and the sleep quality is exceptional. The bathroom is huge, with a nice bathtub, and very comfortable shower, linens for the bed and the bathroom are exceptional and furniture new and quite elegant, even in the excessive style of Macau.  2 Large swimming pool areas with decks and a large fitness centre. The club serves good food, and a very nice snack selection before dinner. Location is right in the middle of Cotai Stip, walking distance from all the attractions, and connected to Cotai Central. Very nice. The only problem .. it's just too crowded.. swimming pools are full and noisy, the lobby is always more alike to a Suk in Marrakesh than a hotel lobby, even the club lounge is overcrowded despite being the‚Ä¶",40
"I stayed here from 14/8-18/8 for an insurance congress, and it was a great stay!  The bed is big and comfortable, clean and nice!  The hotel is connected to the shopping malls, many other hotels. There is a walkway to The Venetian, where our congress took place.   There is food court on the 3rd floor.   I was looking forward to have my swimming on the last day before checking out, unfortunately it was closed down due to strong wind.  Thank u!  Jessie  Malaysia",40
"I stayed at Earth Tower 13F .  Room was clean but 1 key card needed replacment took me standing in front of room door for  n3arly 15m!!!  Yes, the hotel was too complicated to get lost ... (no clear signage from 4F meeting room to guest room...why??  I didn't know my room was in ,""EARTH TOWE"".  The key card cover only handwritten ""2-1334"".  2 = Earth Tower, how would a guest know it!! And I found there was a tiny imprint on the original keycard  but a much more bigger font on the replacement keycard....   The meeting room was huge, good for hundreds people group. All the meeting room staff were of great service but a bit timely... the hotel was too big and complicated to getting one point to another.",30
"We booked the deluxe suite for one night at a reasonable price and the room did not disappoint. The following explains why the rating is not higher.   Wonderful place, that is, when you finally get past the nightmarish queues at checking in at 3pm and the check-in counter girl advising you to come back for your room key at 6pm.   Upon one's reasonably justified  protests, and insistence to speak with the management, the delay was to some extent alleviated by a later checkout time authorized by the customer service manager in order to commensurate with the delayed check-in.   Had one not been so persistent, the check-in counter girl would have fobbed you off that all the managers were too busy to see you.   The hotel pools look better than they really are. Access to them from the‚Ä¶",30
"Good hotel very comfortable but do not put any clothes in for laundry , it will cost you a fortune , but everything else well worth a stop over. The staff are very cheerful and to go shopping in the malls is easy and there are a lot of good restaurants within easy walking distance .",50
"Check-in took over an hour due to hundreds of people all trying to check in mid-afternoon after check-in opened. Hotel and room were nicely appointed and comfortable. The hotel location is good in central Cotai part of Macau. Food choices are limited if you're a westerner and don't want to eat Chinese food every meal. We ended up walking 10 minutes to the Hard Rock cafe for lunch on two days, which was very good. Dinners on both nights were at local Portuguese style restaurants.  Overall, not a pleasant holiday experience due to way too many people---we won't be back to this hotel or Macau ever again.",30
"i attended a conference in Macau and stayed at the Sheraton. the hotel is everything to offer from casino, shopping mall to good food. the other advantage is it is walking distance from Venetian. nice big rooms the only challenge it is so huge that one gets confused on how to reach the room",40
"There's nothing that leaps out about the Sheraton Macau when you compare it with all the other hotels of a similar level.  Check in and especially check out takes a while because there are not usually enough people manning the desks, but the rooms are clean and well enough equipped and for the price I think it's a pretty goos choice. The gym isn't as good as I was expecting, and the hotel is so big that it can take a while to get from A to B but breakfast is varied as is their brunch.",40
"My fiance and I decided to go to Macau for an overnight stay as she had never been there before. We booked the Sheraton as it was good value. Ctrip appear to be the best price to promote people to go to Macau.  We arrived by fast ferry from Hong Kong. At the ferry pier there are a number of shuttle coaches to take you to the various hotels. It can be a bit mad and feel like shuffling sheep onto the various coaches, but at least there was complimentary transport to the hotel.  On arrival, the hotel is part a huge complex that includes the Holiday Inn, so we had to walk through the mall to find the Sheraton check in. There is supposed to be a downturn in Macau at present but it didnt appear that way at the check in counters. It is possible that it was school holidays in China.‚Ä¶",40
"A 5-star hotel with nice staff. Making guests feel at home but with exciting and relaxing holiday mood in such a busy and large hotel in such a tourism city is not an easy task. Well done, Sheraton! I have stayed here for more than 20 nights up to now this year.",50
"Stayed at Sheraton again this year for the annual pool party pilgrimage in Macau. Check in took half an hour - way too long! Apparently they can't find a suitable room even though we have included them in our reservation. When we landed a room at the end of the (long) corridor, its toilet has a sewage smell, probably due to old piping.   The taxi queue is so long mainly due to poor design. They should have multiple loading bays so we don't get stuck behind big families with many luggage.  Checkout experience wasn't perfect either. The bell service didn't even bother to address me when we took our bags from  baggage service. He simply handed me the bag tag and a pen without actually telling me what to do - apparently I had to sign it. Terrible customer service. ",20
We were there just for a quick break and the hotel is so different than every other hotel in the area and is really suitable for families and as we enjoyed the hospitality from the time we arrived at the hotel and wonderful reception in the Elite check in area from them associate who checked us in and her anticipation of our needs and facilitation of the same was superb and I felt I should have taken notes of her name etc but nevertheless it was a wonderful stay and we enjoyed our time with the kids doing Panda show the next day and as we after we checked out and were  having our late lunch in the food court area that we heard the sounds of the parade which takes place at 4 pm and in the confusion our daughter went missing as she ran towards the parade is what we thought but she‚Ä¶,50

"Been there for 5 days 4 nights to attend seminar, the hotel place is very big and crowd of people.   The room is clean, big, and comfortable. The housekeeping also very nice persons.    When you visit there in raining season, please remember to borrow umbrella from hotel when you going out to explore.  They provide free wifi every where inside the hotel. You can take taxi to everywhere in Macau which only cost you within 100 mop. Their common trade currency are Macau mop, Hong Kong dollar and China RMB.  Inside the hotel you find over 600 shops and casino of course.  Regarding foods, they have a food court as well, you can find lots of Asian food there.

"We had a business trip to Macau from 13/8 to 18/8. The check- in was a breeze. The room amenities were complete and it was a good rest every night after our hectic day schedules. The bed was incredible! On top of this, the services rendered was impeccable, from the bell boy, the front desk and the housekeeping. They were always ready to help, to answer to our queries, not flustered by the many guests in the hotel. I am duly impressed and should I return to Macau, I will definitely stay in Sheraton again.

"Just spend a summer holiday weekend with 2 families at SGMH, it will great fun with all the Kung Fu Panda activities and the kids loved the family suite. Also, we hit the pool for the morning and all fun for the kids. Although it is not the cheapest room in town but the family suite is really special for the kids. Great friendly staff and reacts very quickly with our needs.  Overall, awesome stay and will return for sure!  However, the downside is the water pressure of the shower could be higher and the water temperature fluctuate a little. Also, other guests smokes in non-smoking floor!!",50
"Macau: Gamblers' paradise. Monster hotels. Entertainment shows. Asia's Las Vegas. All that came to my mind, when I planned my trip. It was a bit of a trip down the memory lane... ten years ago I was the last time in town.  The Cotai Strip, was a road, which had 2 lanes in each direction decorated with sculptures representing the Chinese zodiacs, in the middle of a mud land. Today: The world's largest shopping mall (Shoppes) connects at least six hotels with each other (Sheraton, St Regis, 4 Seasons, Conrad, Holiday Inn and The Venetian).  The Sheraton, in which I stayed has more than 4,000 rooms. It has two towers, and good signage, preventing you from getting lost. The lobby feels a bit like a very busy train station, there seem not to be any quiet times. The rooms, are‚Ä¶",50
Stayed there with 2 adults and 2 kids. Lovely room with views of venetian hotel. The Ac was good and could cool and warm the room equally.  Breakfast at Feast restaurant had so many options to eat  Check in was very busy and had a long queue. Luckily I has a starwood membership which made it faster.   The shuttle bus service to cotai and ferry terminal is good and frequent Overall macau is pricey but overall great  Pankaj,50
Great hotel! Connectivity to Venetian makes it live. The sands shoppe is awesome. I dont think i have missed a brand of fashion here. The casino is worth spending time here. Indians can spend time for food at the indian spice treat. The information kiosks are handy ,50
"My wife and I stayed in the Sheraton Grand for two nights. We arrived very early for check-in and our bags were taken care of very professionally. After check-in our bags were sent to our room within 15 mins. The bed was extremely comfortable and the shower was a dream, as well as a deep bath. The rooms were equipped with all amenities. The swimming pools were amazing with able room and enough sun loungers for all with complimentary large towels. Staff were always at hands to help with any problems or to answer questions. very busy at this time of year but staff coped with the sheer number of guests. Only draw back it was a little pricey but expected in Macau.  Shuttle buses to ferry pier, Sands Casino and Fisherman's Wharf.  An excellent pampering weekend !!",50
"The hotel is located in the Sands Shopping Mall in the heart of Cotai Strip, the newly built casino area. The location is very convenient. The hotel is big and within its complex there are lots of amenities, including restaurants, shops, and of course casinos. The room is a bit dated. Room rate is very reasonable. To me, it is not a luxury hotel, but rather at the high-end of mid-range. It also has convenient shuttle services from the airport, ferry terminals, and historic downtown.",40
"The executive suite was probably one of the most luxurious rooms I've ever stayed in. The living and dining rooms were huge , luxurious and tastefully decorated.   What made the suite unique was the music/Tv room. This was actually a room in itself with a nice sofa bed and a home theater sound system connected to the very large flat screen TV.   The bathroom was opulent with individual cubicles for the shower and toilet. What was weird was the position of the bathtub which was right at the center of the bathroom.   Happy hour at the club lounge was not always a pleasant experience due to a high occupancy during the holiday weekend. It felt more like a Chinese buffet restaurant rather than a lounge, with long queues at the food counters and people standing and waiting for tables‚Ä¶",50
"Beautiful hotel. Lobby is super busy. I was lucky to have check in with in 5 mins.Rooms are big and clean. Beds are very comfortable. we could see Venetian Hotel, city of dreams and Wynn hotel from our room. We took the free shuttle bus from Ferry Terminal to hotel.  All the hotels are next to each other and most of them are connected and you walk from one lobby to another.  We did not spend a penny on transport while staying in Macau. We enjoyed free bus service. We got all the information about the bus/shuttle service at the concierge desk. I highly recommend this hotel .",50
"A short weekend trip to Macau and we stayed at the Sheraton Hotel.  It reminds me of hotels in the USA, classic rather than the newer style theme hotel. Room was comfortable, spacious, large bathroom with shower as well as a bathtub. Casino downstairs and shopping centre next door, extremely convenient. Shuttle bus connect to other hotels and shows.",40
"This August marked my first ever visit to Asia's answer to Las Vegas. My first impression of Macau and the Sheraton was a rather pleasant one, it being the free shuttle transfer from the border station to the hotel. The service runs very frequently and the buses are clean and modern.  Check-in was a little bit messy, as so many people enter the hotel at once, when coming off the bus, however a member of staff quickly stepped in and escorted us to the premium check-in desk.   Our rooms were decent. Don't expect any novelty items. Its just like any standard 4 or 5 star hotel. But that said, it was spotless and well-maintained.  Another positive attribute of the hotel was the excellent English knowledge of the staff. Literally every single member, from casino security guards to‚Ä¶",40

(Price at the hotel restaurants were reasonable and food was delicious!) ",50
"I would like to express my appreciation of the excellent services we received from our initial contact with the hotel up till the moment we departed on the last day.    I arranged a birthday party for my husband at the hotel's Italian Restaurant - Bene, and a lot of our family members and friends came over from Hong Kong for the party and spent a night at the hotel. The Guest Relations Team made our stay a very enjoyable one, and the F&B team at Bene made the party a most delightful evening.    Everything exceeded our expectations - from room reservation, spa reservation, liaison with the restaurant, room reservations for all our guests (including some very belated ones) and so on.

"The hotel itself is great, however it is extremely overcrowded. Luckily we could check in at SPG counter, otherwise i would of had to stand 30 min in line just to check in. There are 10 check in counters! It is difficult to walk in the lobby area due to the vast amounts of people, mostly Asian .  Breakfast was great! Even though there were hundreds of people in the dining room, we were seat quite fast. I recommend u get there early.  The hotel service is great and everyone is very polite and helpful.  If casino is your thing be prepared for Chinese games, western roulette and blackjack only.  Overall the stay was nice. Pool was nice too.  ",40
"I was travelling with my mother & my husband for a short holiday in Macau & the August period coincides with the school holidays in China & Hong Kong. So many Chinese tourists were there for holiday & the hotel was super crowded. If you want to relax & swim in the swimming pools, it is totally impossible as all are packed with people & children.  There was long queue at the taxi stand too & bus queues. So be prepared to wait with lots of patience. The room is clean & overall is not bad though it is not as superb as Galaxy which I have to admit. For the rate we had paid, this is not a bad choice as location is nearby to many popular hotels like Venetian, City of Dreams etc.",40
Huge casino in the lobby. Check in and check out queues can get really long. You can book ferry tickets to HK or HK airport from the concierge. Really helpful staff. Interconnected with Venetian so no need to step out in the sun. Free shuttle bus service from ferry terminal.,50
"This is one of the biggest Sheraton hotels in the world and it really feels gigantic - less like a hotel and more of a luxury residential complex with a casino in the middle of it. The hotel is designed to accommodate a LOT of people, the check-in area is massive; it feels like a queue for an attraction at an amusement park. That being said, the quality of the hotel is top-notch. The place is clean, if somewhat maze-like, and the furnishings are classy. The restaurants were surprisingly good (highly recommend the Italian restaurant with the semi-buffet). The swimming pool area is nice, if a bit crowded. Free/fast internet with easy login. The gym was one of the best facilities I have ever used at a hotel - fully equipped with machines, free weights, and various areas for‚Ä¶",40

We first met Jessica (manager) at the Club Lounge on the 4th floor and she welcomed us so warmly and when we needed any accommodations she and her staff made sure it was promptly taken care of.   We stayed at Jw Marriott in Macau last year(really good hotel but staff is horrible.) and we've never received this type of 5 star service.  We have made long life friends through this experience.

Our second stay here and this is a good hotel with comfortable rooms. The staff all seem eager to help and engage with guests. It was our sons birthday and when they noted this they immediately gave him and his sister a whole collection of Dreamworks gifts. It made them feel very special.  The hotel is crowded at weekends and when there are Chinese holidays so expect to wait for checkin but even this is well handled.  My only gripe is i can never get the express checkout terminal to actually work.  The weekend bbq buffet at the pool was good.,40
"Every time I come back it gets better. Stayed in a BRAND NEW Suite, nothing else to say. Club Lounge egg station improved a lot since my last visit, very fast check out for this size hotel. Enjoyed bar in lobby and local specialities for tea time",50
"We booked for one night a family room, which is a classic parent bedroom plus a kid room with bunk bed and kids deco.  First, the checkin experience was long, so long... We had to become SPG member while we booked, so we went to the SPG member checkin counter and we had to wait 45 min before to finally checkin, there was less than 10 people in front of us. Second, the kid bedroom was disappointing, no toys, a xbox with no game and no gamepad, the only tv channel was cartoon network and there was no sound only for this channel... So we had to call the guest service to get all sorted. 30 more minutes wasted.

Across the street from Parisian and Studio hotels( just finished) and walk across the street from the City of Dreams.  Sheraton has better value a suite for the same price as the hotels for a room.

"It's now the third time I stay at this Sheraton hotel.   It is impressively massive and offers all the facilities you would expect from a high end hotel chain like the Sheraton.   Pools are great, choice of restaurants excellent and location in Cotai perfect.  Only downside is the check in can take a bit of time but that is compensated by the fast check out (takes about 15 seconds).  Will be coming back soon. ",40
"Breakfast buffet: unexpectedly disappointed, not many choices. Crowded with long queues all the time, I have to queue all the time like check in, waiting for taxi......  And services were also out of my expectations, I supposed I can get service like other same level hotels",30

The check in system is lengthy and messy.we spent 25 mins to get the rooms sorted.  The queues are crazily long and the lobby was filled with customers.  The hotel is barely of 3 star standard.  Why? When we get into the room,it's worm out and dirty. There are lots of dirts on the carpet and the bathroom was wet like someone just had a shower.  The bathroom floor was not clear and most surfaces in the room was dusty.

Because this is such a big facility, they can do this for their preferred guests.  Special mention to the front desk attendant who checked me in, Camille, she made sure that I was aware of all of the benefits that this hotel can provide for SPG elite members.  The concierge desk (multiple concierges) then help make arrangements for the shows and even got me referral discounts and arrangements for transportation, dinner reservations etc. However, if you do not have any status within the SPG family, I can see where the check-in/out process would be tedious as the Sheraton Grand Macau is a huge place.

Will definitely come back for another weekend visit.",30

On the 2nd day my room was made up just around 6.30 pm after I complaint.It is unbelievable. It seems to me the hotel has a shortage of cleaner staff because their face looklike very tired at that time. Location this hotel is good and close to restaurants and foodcourt as well.",30
"This is the best hotel that i ever stayed. I got a smooth check in when i arrived. The Room was very clean and superb spacious. It was too bad that i only stayed there for a night. It's directly opposite of Venetian Hotel. Near to all the shopping area. If you wish to go to the casino, there's one just below the hotel which is less crowded.  When checking out, you could just drop your key at the express check out counter. When travelling from macau ferry terminal, just look for the free shuttle bus where they will drop you at sands @ cotai central. After which jus follow the sign and you will be able to reach the hotel within 2-3 mins walk. ",50
"It was so fortunate we managed to check in quick - by a private channel.  If not, the queue is horrifying - even with a SPG, the long queue probaby took you an hour or more.  The swimming pools setting at the Sheraton are also area of concern, the pools are simply twist & shallow that only fits for kids playing for fun.  The room is ok though",40
"The hotel itself is okay but too big. The rooms are nice and comfortable with great beds and air conditioning. We had no coffee/tea etc in our room and it took ages for housekeeping to finally get some sent up. It took us 45 minutes to check in which is pathetic. Only one of the 3 pool areas was open and was overcrowded and over run with screaming kids. Breakfast was in a restaurant in a shopping mall far from our room and mediocre at best. The overcrowding was bad especially in the lobby and lifts. I think it's too large to run properly. Hardly the relaxed atmosphere one would expect from a 5 star resort, not recommended if you want to ""get away from it all.""",30
"service is good, clean place, nice room. Room price reasonable among hotels in Taipa area. The only bad thing is lack of restaurants. No more selection. If you feel hungry at night, only one Chinese restaurant inside casino. For children, even McDonald closes at 10:00pm. You need to take taxi (M$ 80) to downtown area for food.",40
Check-in was very quick considering it was a big hotel in Cotai Central.  The room (3057) was really nice with great view. The pool in the hotel was quite disappointing though looking at the overall hotel.  Venetian is about 10-15 minutes walking and it is all inter-connected. For visiting Senado Square you can walk to City of Dreams and take the free shuttle bus to Sintra hotel which is an easy walk to the Senado Square.   Breakfast had a lot of choices too. Overall a very good family hotel.,50

The room is nice and clean and the bed is very comfy and the bedroom is huge.  The only complaint I have is, to go back to Macau, you need to go either to Studio City or City of Dream which is a fair walk in the heat.  They should have transport from the hotel to downtown, not just taking you to the ferry terminal or airport",50

Let'e be honest, this  hotel is overrun by the Chinese tourist who have never been familiarized with what is proper conduct and behavior in truly western hotel (Sheraton is still western, I think!).

Though they offered free internet for visitors, it's almost the worst internet I've ever used among all sheratons ( I've been at least 5 sheratons in the world... Well... I guess maybe this is the world's largest sheraton...but this hotel provides the slowest speed for Internet?!) Anyways, Macau is a city just like Las Vegas.... So you can easily find out other five star hotels are really BETTER than this one.... I'd say this sheraton is pretty much like the Holiday Inn next door, just different brand names and‚Ä¶",20
"We had twin adjoining rooms on the 17th floor of the 'Sky' tower.  They have two towers "" Sky and Earth "" . Very easy check-in with polite staff.  The rooms were massive and very nicely decorated but the real piece de resistance was the view . Impressive during the day but at night you can spend hours just enjoying the view of Macau. Very comfortable !!! No negatives regarding the room.  .   Staying at the Sheraton You have to be aware that this is a 5 star hotel with 5 star inhouse restaurant prices !!! Best to eat out if You are on a budget like us.    The hotel is actually based in a premium Shopping centre so there is plenty to occupy yourselves if gambling is not your thing. Overall I can highly recommend the Sheraton....",50
Stayed for 3 days at Sky Tower 1929.   Pros: Room was spacious.  View not quite good.  Bed was comfortable. Free two one way ferry tickets to Hong Kong  Cons: Long check in line queue Toilet has no bidet Television has few english channels.  No docks for latest iphone models Can hear noises from outside  The stay was okay. Too many people at the lobby though. Staff was friendly and accommodating.   ,40
We came here for a 2-day-getaway trip. We hv redeemed one night suite night award to have our room upgraded to suite. The suite is very spacious and got fabulous view. The King size is very nice but I cannot say the same for the sofa bed that my two kids were sleeping. I am not sure if the sofa bed has been worn out or designed that way. It was so flimsy to the extent that I was worry I will collapse the whole thing by just sitting on it.   The bathroom equipped with an enormous bathtub that my kids had their relaxing bubble bath after a day of fun.   The location is wonderful as well with lots of attractions within walking distance including the brand new Ferris wheels one.,40
"great hotel with wonderful location, ambiance, and surrounding. will pay some visit at my next trip in here again. i stayed at the club room. the room was perfect, the staff was polite, and you can play at casino if you bored in room. wifi works well. thanks",50
"Sheraton is one of the biggest hotel in Macau with a casino that can seat more than 1000 people ...rooms are spacious , food is just above average and service is excellent ..but the interior of the hotel is not at all exciting and you don't feel like you have come for a vacation in Macau..",30
"Staff was helpful and we were staying in the deluxe suite which is spacious and really comfortable. I love the environment here , such amazing places in the city of Macau. Bed were soft , living room was so pretty and rooms are silent as well , even there are some constructions doing outside.",50
"We had been to Grand Sheraton Macau for our annual vacation enroute Hong Kong. The check in process is so fast & hotel is really huge having 70 rooms in each floor of 39 floors with two towers. The room sizes are big @ 50 sq m with all modern amenities. The bed quality is also excellent. The bathrooms having a bath tub & a separate shower area. The hotel is having a mall at the basement area & interconnected to other hotels through the mall & a foot bridge. One can go to Holiday Inn, The Venetian . They have 7 swimming pool at 2 floor level which is having an open bar adjacent to it. The food & breakfast quality also awesome with lots of variety.  The hotel is having a casino at the ground level as well. I must appreciate their jesture as it happened to my daughter's birthday on‚Ä¶",50
"Had a great stay in the Sheraton Macao.  Free shuttle from ferry terminal, second stop, check in and out was smooth, family suite was great.  Basically a connecting room so two bedroom, two bathroom.  Kids room was great  TV, play station, double bunks, kids table and chairs, Madagascar theme - kids loved it.  Location was great attached to shopping centre and Venetian.  Hotel also offered the Kung Fu Panda Academy which my boys really enjoyed.  Room service was good and rates reasonable.  Restaurants were great - Bene was brilliant.  Will definitely return.",50
"A short two nights break. We had a family room which was great for us. Kids loved it, we had the Dream works Madagascar theme with all kids amenities. The hotel is a very big, Vegas style property. It is good for families with younger kids. Don't miss the all the Dream works theme activities, especially the kungfu panda breakfast.   Do not expect it to be a five stars hotel with top services and amenities. Check in was quick with SPG, but only for SPG. I saw people waited for almost an hour at the other check in lines. Swimming pools were crowded and I dont really recommend this hotel if you are looking for water fun. Food choices are limited, but there are many hotels within walking distance, so no need to stick to the Sheraton only.   Will stay again only because of the family‚Ä¶",30
The Sheraton Grand is very centrally located and was a pleasure to stay at. The beds were very comfortable and the hotel is very luxurious. The breakfast buffet was included on our rate and was a good selection of Asian and Western style breakfast items. The attached shopping mall is quite expensive for food and purchases but that is to be expected over most of the central area of Macao casino district.,50
"I stayed here for a work conference. I was quite looking forward to the stay at the hotel.  However unfortunately it was another soulless Macau hotel.   Pros - large gym with a lot of equipment - room wasn't bad  Minus - limited food options. For example there wasn't really a bar for drinks and snacks in the hotel - conference food wasn't very good - the decor inside felt the same as the nearby Venetian!  Recommendation - if you are staying in Macau for a holiday, try to find a smaller hotel for a better experience, not one which focuses on just on conferences and gambling.  ",20
Love this hotel rooms large and clean. Great location on the new side of macau Tapia. Only issue is room towels are to small for an adult. Check in and out very smooth plenty of plsces to eat. If I return though I v will stay on the old macau side. More charm.,50
"I had a fantastic weekend stay in this hotel in January 2016. It was recommended to me by a friend in Hong Kong. For a solo traveler it had all I required- very large and very comfortable room and bed, excellent restaurant ( Italian) and very good breakfast buffet ( short walk through mall). Staff were extremely friendly and helpful throughout my stay.",50
"We were a group of 4 adults and 4 kids with two rooms interconnected and checked I at the club lounge. Due to the confusing hotel booking packages, I was told by the staff that additional charges should be added for kids. Later, we talked to another club lounge staff Miss Rebacca, she patiently explained the hotel some promotion packages. She kindly assisted to seek the manager special consent to waive additional charges for kids. I highly appreciated Rebacca's kind and quality services.  We had a very memorable holiday in this hotel.",50
"I had stay here for 5 nights business trip , the room dirty I feel itchy while sleep the bedsheet with stain and housekeeping daily cleaning miss replacement and change , slipper without change for since the first day I check in , after clean the bathroom amenities without replacement while I want to comb my hair need call housekeeping ask where they throw the comb and no replace really feel up sad return to stay here.   Make me feel wanted to check out like can't stand for another few nights",20
"We loved our stay at Sheraton. The location is really convenient with shuttles to all transport and attractions. Staff were friendly in all areas. Highly recommend the club experience- great value for money. Pool areas are very family friendly. A visit to the nearby Venetian are worth it just to say ""I've seen it""!",50
"I am a Starwood member and have stayed in many affiliated hotels.  When it came to small details, this hotel was not at the same level as other Sheratons in which I have stayed.  Don't get me wrong, it is very clean, very professionally run and the rooms, although a bit underwhelming, are spacious and very comfortable.  However, ALL the hotels in this area of Macau are at this level, so what differentiate them is the small details.  For example, in this hotel in a room for two people, they only had 2 bath towels, 2 hand towels and two face towels.  That is it.  In any other Sheraton, there would be four of each.  Now if you know Macau and how hit and humid it is, then you know that one takes more than one shower a day and using the same damp towel is not very pleasant.  Everyday‚Ä¶",30
"As a casino is located on the ground floor, this hotel is crowded by lots of tourists which made me feel like not in a usual Sheraton hotel. However, room and facility was great and quite comfortable. Playing casino for a couple of hours was also a good experience as well. I think people can spend a day in the entire facilities as it has eateries, shopping malls, pools and casino and recommended for families too. Cons for me is the distance from the main tourist area in Macao peninsula - which takes nearly half an hour by bus, and not many restaurants are nearby.",40
Absolutely the best hotel! Love the fact that these hotels share access across the shopping and entertainment areas. Sheraton Grand  was by far the most personalised and professional.  Enjoy the free coach service to all destinations across Macao! ,50
"I have stayed here 4 times before and have always had a hard tiem getting the room I wanted and the preferences right.  I got in later then i expected with one whell missing from my suitcase so I was not in a good mood.  The manager of the club was able to calm me and although they had not reserved the room they keep telling me will be mine when I visit he was able to get it for me.  It is a phenomenal room with a view of the Eifel Tower at the new Parisian Hotel across the street.  Huge room, nicely furnished living room, nice tub and, what I really like is, an entertainment room that I was able to catch up on Game of Thrones .  I told them when I wanted my room serviced and they did it right on time every day.  They also brought the water I asked for.  The bedding was great‚Ä¶",50
"As expected, the check in line for the non starwood guests was HUGE.  Luckily I spotted a small sign for Starwood preferred guest and saved myself apps 30min in line. The room is located on the top floor, even though i requested a non smoking room / floor, the corridor still smell faintly of smoke. Such is life in Macau. The room is clean but slightly dated, especially in the shower.  However, this is a very solid hotel and the taxi line was orderly. I did not spend much time within the resort therefore I have no comments on restaurants or bars.  It is connected to the Conrad Hotel and you can find a decent glass of wine and away from loud tourist families.",40
"It is a pleasure experience for staying in Sheraton Grand Macao Hotel. We are not the first time staying over there since her Grand Opening on 2012. This time, we stay there on the weekend of 1 Jul 2016.  We appreciate very much for the Reservation Agent Rachel Fu to provide some useful information and arrangement before our arrival. The overall services of the hotel still maintain a high standard for two towers (Sky and Earth Tower) by comparing it during its Grand Opening (just Sky Tower). It is quite satisfy during the stay. Surely come back again while next visit!!!",50
"Been to sheraton a few times and had stayed in both the north and south (?) Towers. There's a shuttle bus stop right outside cotai pier, which makes it very convenient to commute. Room was spacious though the carpet now looks duller than before. Buffet breakfast at Feast was great and the casino was just next to the lobby.   Will there be any shuttle bus service in the future that connects the hotel to Galaxy or Goon Ya Street though (guess first time visitors would love to go to those places)? ",50
Went to Sheraton Macau for a weekend trip. We booked a connecting room and kids loved it. Hotel is connected to the cotai mall and there were quite a number of restaurants to choose from. The walk to the house of dancing water was about 20 mins. Good location. We spent quite a bit of time at the pool and service at the pool side was excellent. Good for a mini weekend get away. ,40
"Wonderful place. Free shuttle bus from Taipa Ferry Terminal (or Macau Airport) to hotel. Check-in was average (but thumbs up to a staff for seeing the queue and allowing me to check in at available check out counter).  Sheraton Macao was not expensive compared to hotels in the area. Location was great, connected to Shoppes, situated opposite the Venetian, walking distance to Taipa Village. End of first night, rtn to hotel room and staff had laid a heart out of orchid petals with a Anniversary card + a box of madelaines. Yes, I'll consider staying here again if I come Macau.",50
"Have stayed here several times and always enjoyed my stay. Apart of very good location, rooms are very comfortable, in room dinning at late hours is fast and with good price. Early check in was allowed. Many shuttle buses will take you at any destination in Maca you need. 5 star hotel at this price is just must to do.",50
"My girlfriend and I (late twenties) stayed at the Sheraton Macau for one night in July 2016, and our overall experience was very good.  The check-in staff could be a bit friendlier and more hospitable for a hotel of this status, but the room was clean and as we expected. We stayed in a standard room with a king bed, and the view we had was good; over-looking the pool on the 4th floor. We could also see the under-constructioned Eiffel Tower of the Parisian.  The best thing about our stay at the Sheraton was the Feast Buffet. It was OUTSTANDING in terms of food selection. There was lobster, oyster, shrimp, king crab legs, and much more! They also had US-Grade A angus beef! We got a 20% discount for being hotel guests, so the price was around 350 MOP++  The accommodations was quite‚Ä¶",40
Like the room setting with lots of space. Could hear people loud talking from the corridor  inside the room. Most of the staff were helpful but there were few not energetic and not well trained.  Understandable given the busy flow of guests in the hotel during summer peak season. Wouldn't take the buffet breakfast if I needed to pay separately. The lobby bar Palms was not attractive at all for pre dinner drink. We ended up enjoying ourselves at the bar inside St Regis hotel. Swimming pools look pretty nice and big but we didn't try this time.  ,30
"Stayed at Club lounge for 4d3n & enjoyed the daily breakfast & evening cocktail at the lounge. Even my 2yo son had fun time at meals üòç The staffs have been very helpful & we loved their 4star services very much ! However need to bring to Sheraton attention on 2 things...  1) swimming pool is highly contaminated due to the massive crowd. Need to improve maintenance to ensure everyone esp children is swimming in a hygienic pool...  2) the taxi service at your taxi stand. My hubby claimed that the taxi driver was dishonest & took us for a long ride when we were rushing to airport with our 2yo son early in the morning where taxi is our only option. The driver took us 15 min ride charging us an amount of HKD55. In fact, my hubby argued with the driver halfway when he noticed it's‚Ä¶",50
"I stayed in this hotel for several times, overall is good, rather new compare to most of the hotels in Macau, and reasonable priced. Since this is the largest Sheraton, with 4000 rooms, the check in procedure is ALWAYS busy! Always crowded with long queue, really need to consider to have a few more check in locations. The person who help me to do the check in is Claire Pan, very nice and polite girl and the check in time for me is quick (but waiting in the long queue is slow....).  Really do hope to have few more check in counters to accommodate 4000 rooms in busy Macau.",50
"We stayed at the Sheraton hotel for 2 nights.  The hotel has convenient shuttle schedules that can take you to the terminal, and other parts of the city.    It was reasonably priced, and the rooms were very comfortable.  We would be happy to stay here again.",50
"We stayed in this hotel for two nights on the Club Floor in July which was our fourth or fifth visit. We had usually enjoyed the food and service of the Club Lounge as there were usually good selections of hot and cold food with drinks. But this time, the variety of food served over the evening cocktail was a lot less than before. There was no hot western food served and only dim sum and sandwiches were available, We found no pastries nor cakes served apart from cookies. And only one kind of fruit was served compared to three or four in the past.  For breakfast, we were much disappointed to fine no egg stations but just precooked fried eggs and boiled eggs placed over heated trays for self serving. I have not seen any 5-star international hotels which serve no omelets for‚Ä¶",20
"I think this hotel built in a convenient location, which near most of the attractions, such as the Studio City, Rua do Cunha. Besides, there is a huge shopping halls right at the hotel.  For the room, I like the decoration, which is modern and classic. Even I just stayed 1 night, I felt impress too. It is worthy to stay in Sheraton Hotel in Macau.",40
This is my second review of the hotel and also a much better review as i was upgraded to a one bedroom suite on the 37th floor. Thank you to the uber efficient and accommodating Sam from Reservations who assisted us in this birthday stay of mine at Sheraton. The room was divine with the space it accorded me: a living room area with space to have a small meeting or party of 5-6 people comfortably. The bedroom and the extensive bathroom was such a welcome treat it was difficult to leave the room. Details were excellent as well as the service rendered by the staff. The only thing that was a not so good experience was the swimming pool area on the 4th floor. We stayed over the weekend and the pool area was just an impossible place to stay in And unwind and rest due to the volume of‚Ä¶,50
"Excellent place to stay, get Indian Breakfast at hotel and other meals can be had at Shoppee, Venetian. One can shop all the brands at local shopping centre.   Get your HKD converted into Pataca at Bank, you get better exchange rate.  Also try your luck at Casinos.",50
"We went to Macau with a bad reservation, and had to quickly work a plan B at 2am. The Sheraton Cotai came to the rescue. Many thanks go to Mr. Randy Xu. He worked a great rate, gave us a beautiful room, treated us as a VIP, and worked a refund with the other hotel ... all at 2am. During the 5 nights, the hotel staff was fantastic, and an honorable mention goes to Mr. Wilson Dam for helping a great vacation even better.",50
"The room was spacious, weren't a lot of visitors during my visit. However, there were lack of food options in the hotel area during midnight and yet room service was EXTREMELY overpriced.  The bed and the blanket were comfortable though! Had a good night sleep. Managed to arrange for check out at 3pm, LOVED IT.",40
"Nice and modern hotel - very good location in central Cotai, Macau. As with all casinos in Macau, they are all very accessible from the ferry terminal and airport. Shuttle buses are readily available. The shuttle bus for Sheraton is also the one for Sands Cotai. I think they are a part of the Sands group here, together with Conrad and St. Regis. Its very near City of Dreams Macau, which is another group of hotels clumped together in one area. The Venetian is on the other side. Worry not as all these hotels are all connected via a network of multi-level high-end shops (aptly called The Shoppes). You never even have to set foot outside at all as you traipse around in all its air-conditioned glory.   The lobby at the Sheraton could get a little too crowded but the staff are‚Ä¶",50
Stayed at Sheraton Cotai during a family vacation. The rooms looked fresh and clean. The kids enjoyed the pool area. A shopping area is adjacent the hotel. Free transfer from the piers to the hotel. Will stay here again.,40
"We knew it would be a busy day in Macau. But it appears no one told the Sheraton. The line to check in took 1.5 hours! The room wasnt available until 5pm, No cot for our daughter. The inroom dining childrens meals were a pile of stodge with a bit of dressing. Even the egg on the fired fried rice was undercooked and went straight into the bin. The rooms were cramped, corridors dark. It was clean enough, but nothing to distinguish it from a mass market 3 star hotel. The check out took 30 seconds, but had to wait twenty minutes in a queue to do so. There was not even the usual perfunctory 'did you enjoy your stay?'. The pool was nice, but very busy as one of the two was being used for a private function. The queue to order and pay for food at the poolside was 10minutes after which‚Ä¶",10
"Ok 1st of July Weekend which is a holiday in China and Hong Kong so I knew it would be busy. It was busy but actually not that packed, the problem is the hotel just does have enough staff and management are not very switched on.   On what must be one of their busiest weekends, 4000 rooms fully booked, they decided to only open one pool. They have three pools but apparently one is only for events( more on that later). So on Saturday the one pool was packed, they had one waiter for poolside drinks and two pool attendants which was nowhere near enough. Only after I complained to Lombok, the pool manager, did they open the other pool which was still dirty.  On Sunday you would have thought that they would have learnt their lesson but no. When we got to the pools one was again closed‚Ä¶",10
"Sheraton Grand Macao is part of the interconnected Sands complex of Sheraton, Conrad, Holiday Inn, St Regis and Venetian in Cotai. This is one of the largest hotels in the world and popular with large tour groups. Be prepared for long check in and check out lines depending if your arrival coincides with them. There are two towers linked together till the fifth floor. Rooms are nice and beds comfortable. There is not much happening here besides the casino unlike Vegas. Historic Macao is a short $10 USD taxi ride away",50
"The hotel situated in very good location ( close to shopping area, food court, restaurants, the Venetian, etc)   We stayed in Deluxe room for one night and like it so much, especially a bathroom which was very big and beautiful. We had such a great stay. ",40
Stayed for 5 days first time. Buffet breakfast was ordinary but the rest could not be faulted. Room large with all requirements. No milk for a tea or coffee. Staff were excellent knowing our drinks after a few days (Same Bar). Pool was well set out avoiding over crowding. Buses to & from every 10+ minutes with no fuss. Overall a very pleasant stay.,40
"Everything a Macao hotel should have ... A casino , great restaurants , bars n huge rooms . An excellent executive lounge ( a bit too much of a walk to it ) , but a great spread üëçüèº.

"This is not a cheap hotel but it really should not be considered 5 star. First off I could not find one picture on their website that looked like the room I was given. Small, cramped, beige, scratched and dented furniture. Not worth the $$$. The pools (that were open) were fantastic! Ordered pizza from room service, very expensive cardboard.....just awful!!! Concierge/manager was very kind and understanding.",30
"We stayed at Sheraton for two nights, everything was great! We loved the room, the swimming pool area, the fact that there is a shopping mall and many restaurants integrated into the hotel.  Only bad thing worth mentioning is that there was a long waiting time for check in and sometimes, it wasn't easy for non-Chinese speakers like us to communicate with some members of the staff.  It's a great value for money, lovely place to stay in Macao, I highly recommend it!",50
Wanted a mini weekend getaway for wife's birthday. I booked the hotel via Ctrip and called their hotline to ensure they put down a remark it is a birthday stay. I also emailed starwood customer mailbox just in case Ctrip missed. I got a reply from starwood saying they cannot locate my record as of that moment and it is likely Ctrip has not send them the details so I asked for a follow up on this when details are delivered over to Sheraton's system. I thought this was sufficient but it is not.  Check-in day: We took a shuttle from the pier to City of Dreams which is hotel complex next to Sheraton's hotel complex to have a walk around before we check in. We walked into Sheraton's hotel complex and tried to look for Sheraton but there were no clear signs on how we can reach it.‚Ä¶,10
"Was there at the hotel  launch 3-4 years back. Have visited almost every year after that , twice last year and once again recently in June 16.  Huge property, probably the largest, it's people around everywhere. Opposite Macau landmark the Venetian , Sheraton still remains a poor cousin inspite of good rooms, the suite is awesome. The Italian restaurant Bene is awesome, breakfast at Feast needs to be seen into.",40
"Everything about our stay was very good and memorable, the location, the service, the room, all staff were very very helpful, I remeber the name of one of them in the breakfast restauarnt at sheraton club Lester Lindo, he was very helpful. We highly recommend this hotel.",50
"We had a great stay.  The pool area is done very innovatively, with small pool areas separated of you want to have fun with your family. The rooms are great. We were at the lounge access room so we gas a great time@the lounge in the evenings. Breakfast shad was nice, although with limited vegetarian options. The one thing that they need to improve is that they did not have a live egg station. I thought it s a must for any five start hotel breakfast spread.",50
"We had a fantastic stay at the Sheraton Grand Macao. Upon our arrival (via ferry from Hong Kong), we took the free shuttle to the hotel. The shuttle dropped us off in the back of the property, so the check-in desk nearest that entrance was not very busy. As we booked a club room, we also had the option of checking in at the club lounge, but since the queue at this check-in desk was short (versus the one at the front of the hotel, which can be quite busy) we opted to use this desk.  We were given room 3103 in the Sky Tower. If you have a choice, the Sky Tower seemed to be quite good in terms of location and views. Our particular room overlooked the pool (which was undergoing maintenance during our stay) and the neighboring Studio City Resort and the upcoming Parisian Resort. Our‚Ä¶",50

It was quite a Long walk from the shuttle bus drop off to the lobby especially if you have big luggage. Nonetheless the check in area was very huge and swarmed with lots of people.

We spent 3 nights here. Wow is this hotel big. Our room was a great size with a lovely big bathroom. Beds are big and very comfy. I was very disappointed in the pool area. Yes it does look lovely with lots of little pools to choose from but the pools are too warm. It was 34c days and it was like having a hot bath. Plus there was no control over all these kids running around from pool to pool screaming. I know kids have a right to play but when you are paying a lot for a hotel there should be some area where adults can relax in quite without kids screaming and splashing from pool to pool. I loved the walkway across the road so you could go to other casinos or shopping centers  to look around.,40
"Considering the prices of other hotels such as Galaxy, or Banyan Tree, it is an excellent choice. It has similar comfort to the rooms in other hotels, but is a lot cheaper. The bath tub might not be the biggest and the shower might not be the comfiest, but it is definitely one of the hotels with highest value per price. There is good internet connection, not the fastest, but good enough. The staff is friendly. The shuttle service is super useful. And it's connection to Venetian and other hotels make good for tourists. Also, there is a McDonalds for the midnight cravings for a McFlurry. ",50

With a hotel of over 4000 room and a huge entertainment/shopping mall, there was not shortage of things to do. However we did venture to the Macau Tower to do the Bungy Jump and Fernandos Restaurant which is a favourite of ours when we visit Macau (both excellent and also reviewed on Trip Advisor).  We booked a suite for our 2 night stay which was fabulous with a seperate entertainment room.

The second time was a bad experience. We called for assistance from the floor lobby phone and a bell man sent the new key cards up. When as why is this happening, he said, ""don't ask me, I am from bell services. You ask FO"" (literally said FO) .  Entered the room and called guest services, spoke to the agent and he got a manager on duty to call back.

"Stayed here overnight mainly for its price and location, and it did not disappoint. The hotel is centrally located in the Sands Cotai Central resorts, an easy 10 minutes walk will take you to Four Seasons/Venetian or City of Dreams, very convenient to get around town. On the passage to the shops at Four Seasons there's a deck that gives you a great view to the Parisian under construction. The Eiffel Tower is already finished so it's quite a sight during the night.  We were put in the Sky tower on the 30th floor, which also has a view to the Eiffel tower. The room was spacious and clean throughout. Amenities are nice enough, pools can get crowded though as we're barely able to find a chair. I'd say it's great value for money if you'll be out exploring most of the time.",40
"Room and customer service in this Sheraton location in Taipa is OUTSTANDING! I have stopped by Macau many times (instead of staying in Hong Kong a day or two, Macau is much better option). Stayed in hotels in Macau, however, Taipa is much better for English speaking customers then Macau.  Gigantic hotel-casinos on Taipa are all interconnected, and offer is outstanding. Italian, French, Japanese, Chinese cuisines are all available in the complex. Cubic club is near Hard Rock (in the City of Dreams), and Venetian is across the street (connected with Sheraton complex, you do not need to get out on the street if you don't want to) with Blue Man Show.  Only drawback I have to report is: ESPRESSO coffee shop is NOT available after midnight. This sucks big time, for me. I wish their‚Ä¶",50
"Great Hotel, Big rooms, Casino, 3 to 4 big swimming pools, Food Court was small but decent options are available. The location of the hotel is excellent and it is linked with the Venitian hotel from inside. There are also free shuttles available from city of dreams which is located near this hotel. Check in Process is little hectic but manageable. We got Cotai View Room, upper floor. It was awesome.",50

"Macau has a new destination now....Sheraton Grand.  Huge property, multiple food options at various restaurants, beautiful rooms, nice and impressive casino, very well trained staff...  Off planning to stay in Macau, must stay with them.",50
Expect the Sheraton standard at this hotel. When choosing a hotel in Macau take note that a lot of them on the strip actually join together. This is one of four all part of the same complex. I was overall happy with our stay except for the cleanliness of the shower. There was black mould half way up the shower. Disgusting. ,30
"1. Shine spa is very good which can relieve my physical tiredness. I haven't planned to take spa initially. It was just by occasion & for fun to try. 2. In my several previous stays, Guest Relation Team Ms Mandy Yap helped me in arrangement. She was off on my arrival day. Surprisingly she dropped a welcome card with cute drawing & words on the second day in my room when she was on duty. Such a responsible lady & behaved more than a hotel staff & guest related, feel like meeting an old friend. 3. Another surprise was the gift of bath oil! The surprise was, was this gift given by occasion or through CRM system to know my spa booking? I appreciate to Sheraton's GR management very much. Thoughtful, caring, creative, give me the right thing at right time especially I have never‚Ä¶",50
"I stayed at the Sheraton Macau for 1 night and the stay was extremely comfortable. As a platinum member sheraton provides lots of benefits like priority checkin, lounge access and upgrade options. property is very well situated at cotai central and internally connect to the venetian and many more hotels. staff is friendly and helpful. There are no shuttle by sheraton and one has to walk till city of dreams (500 mts) for local commute. overall a very nice and luxurious property.",50
travelling with family end of May 2016. First time stayed at the Sheraton. Nice and huge rooms. Check in and check out was fast. The staff and housekeeping are very courteous. Overall a very pleasant and comfortable stay.,50
"A courtesy bus delivered us from the port to the back entrance of the hotel. The staff were very thorough, which was reassuring. Finding our rooms and choosing the correct elevator was assisted by one of the helpful employees. Very nice rooms, spacious and well appointed but maybe they could upgrade their towels. We never arrived down to breakfast until after 9, but after queuing awhile, we were treated to a pleasant breakfast.Plenty of choice. Enjoyed the pools, a variety of pools and nice bathing was had.  Very helpful staff, very clean and huge! We took awhile to orientate ourselves as there were so many corridors that you could take.But signage was really helpful.",40
We visited macau for a couple of days in Dec 2015 and stayed at the Sheraton. This is a huge establishment with very nice rooms . has good diligent staff who checked us in the night hastle free.  The rooms are huge and lavish. The staff and housekeeping are very courteous.  Overall a very pleasant and comfortable stay.,50
"Nice grand hotel. Chk-in for families was fast. Concierge was very accomodating, assisted us regarding our tour of Macau and our return ticket to the Intl. Airport. They also have a food court located at the third floor. Covered bridge connecting to Venetian is available.",50
"Visited Macau for a friends birthday and decided to stay at the Sheraton.   Room size and amenities were good.  I think a little more attention to quality needs to be taken. The towels in the bathroom were so old that it was starting to fray  and  then ripped when I wrapped it around me. Hairdryer was also broken.   Checkin lines were massive. Felt very un personal.    Check out was very easy. Just drop the room key in a box.    I would recommend this hotel only if your going to gamble or for a quick trip. Prepare to be surrounded by tour groups from mainland China.   Overall it did the job as I just needed somewhere for 1 night, but I probably wouldn't stay here again.   ",30
"I have visited Sheraton at end of May 2016. There were 6 of us, including one pair of couple. I booked 2 rooms for 4D3N, one room for 4, and another room for the couple.   This is the first time I stayed at a hotel under Starwood. Same as other same ranked hotel, they don't recommend 4 guests in a 2-twin beds room. Yet, it was annual trip with my girls. I wanted all of us to stay together and to have pillow talk. So I ignored the advise from them, and made the room reservation for 4. As our flight to Macau was landed in morning, we managed to do early check in about 12.30pm. After put our luggage into the room, we started our tour to Sands Threatre for musical show. We went back to our room after dinner. Once we entered the room, wow, the housekeepers and hotel management people‚Ä¶",50
"I stayed in this hotel in December 2015.  It's very well connected with the ferry terminal (I arrived from HK and got back to HK after my Macau stay).  From the hotel you can walk to the near strip cotai casinos (venetian, city of dreams, ...) or take the super cheap cabs to reach the other casinos (mgm, wynn, ...).",50
"This is the third time we stayed at Sheraton Macao. Great staff, helpful and no question asked on our request for room type change at check in. Room was ready when we arrived and it is great. Smiling staff are all around including great price for the sumptuous buffet lunch. Room is good size and very clean every time we stayed. Pools are nice and.",50
"Weekend getaway for hubby and I, check in was busy but staff were efficient and we didn't wait long.  Room was very good, clean and comfortable.  Mini bar was very average which was a little disappointing.  The facilities of the hotel are great, umbrella at the door as it was raining.  Rooms are still in good condition, bed very comfortable and curtains kept the room nice and dark.  Used the outdoor pool which is very nice, long way from our room but that was ok for me.  The pools were lovely and well maintained and serviced.  The buffet breakfast was very average.  Not much healthy food, lots of fried or sugary items.  Egg station was fine.  Stayed only one night.",50
"Being our third stay there in as many years, we were aware of the service level to expect and we were surely not disappointed.. the Sheraton Service levels were there to be experienced.  This time, we (family of five including our parents) opted for the Club Suites  (2 Suites) and it was worth the extra money... the spacious living area with a large Sofa (which also served as the additional bed for our daughter) and Chairs  along with enough crockery and unending supplies enabled us to spend enough time together over light snacks and coffee rather than being confined to individual rooms.  The bed, clean / crisp quality linens and luxury toiletries replenished daily in abundant quantities continued to be a Sheraton Service Standard.  What makes us return to Sheraton is the‚Ä¶",40
"Stayed 2 nights at the Sheraton in Macau.  They offer complementary shuttle service to and from the ferry terminal. Check in was very smooth, done by a very service minded guy. Booked a club room, was assigned one on the 31st floor. The room was large and spacious. The bathroom came with both shower and a tub, fully equipped with nice amenities. The club loung on level 4 offers both full breakfast service and cocktail our as well as access to the pool and complimentary coffee, tea and soft drinks during the opening hours. The casino in the lobby is large and offers a nice smoke-free environment. From the hotel you can walk indoors both to the Venetian and the next door mall. This is a great hotel I truly can recommend.",50
Located in CotaiÔºåMacau Ôºåthe hotel has provided a suitable place of entertainment for whole family.The rooms are spacious with satisfactory design.Staff are friendly and pleasant.Kids will be excited to see the cartoon character parade in every afternoon.,40
"The hotel is Grand in every sense. The service is excellent, the food is amazing and the property is huge. The attached shopping mall is an added benefit for the shopaholics. Also, with all the hotels interconnected, the vast expanse of shoppes can take up your whole day. For those who like to gamble, there are 2 huge casinos in house.",50
"As a Sheraton group hotel, there are certain expectations that one may have..and all I can say is that they would be exceeded in your stay here...the first wow is the room size , then the bed size and ofcourse the other facilities...if it doesn't leave you with a wow...then you are in the wrong trip....then the view overlooking the Macao Airport Well connected to the Venetian Mall and City of Dreams with its own food court,,,you couldn't ask for more Flip side....the lobby is a it difficult to locate and you may wonder off yo any of the connecting hotels Sands, St Regis or Holiday Inn Cotai...well best of luck to you then....",50
"There are many amazing hotels on the cotai strip and Sheraton is one of them. My wife & I enjoyed our stay here. The size of the room is decent, soft queen size bed. Bathroom good too but I missed the shower. View from our room was not that great. I guess the rooms on the other side offer a better view. ",50
"Our 2 nights stay at Sheraton Grand Macau was a memorable experience. The room had a great view of the other hotels in the area. When we went to the concierge to ask for assistance re: tourist attractions on June 3 at 10am, a male staff was very helpful. He even told us that we could do ferry reservations to Hongkong via the concierge. However, after we checked out on June 4 around 10 am, the male staff was no longer there. We approached a female staff and asked re: free shuttle service and tickets to the taipa ferry station. However, the female staff was very rude and told us that we could line up and pointed outside the hotel where the waiting area was. My wife had yo go back and tell her that we just checked out of the hotel and we were previously informed that we could‚Ä¶",40

The design of family suite is great for a family who have 1 couple + 2 child, XBOX in the room make the kids feel so happy and the resturant called Feast is great too. Will come back again.",50
"Stayed at the hotel twice before and had a great experience. The third time was a bit mixed. Firstly, the front-desk staff informed us that purchasing food vouchers for the hotel restaurants at the front-desk would be cheaper than paying at the restaurants (even with the SPG member discounts). This turned out to be false at one of the restaurants (Bene).  The front-desk staff also said the discount was 70% off, which was never the case. Luckily the staff at the restaurants helped us sort it out. Additionally, the front-desk staff said that tables would automatically be reserved for us, but again this was not the case.  Secondly, the bathroom within the lobby/casino smelled entirely of piss and looked like it wasn't cleaned in days. Not expecting much here, since I know it's‚Ä¶",30

A good solid choice if you want to visit the casinos or see a show . The main minus is that it is quite easy to get lost in the labyrinth and the lobby cafe and area is extremely noisy . Nonetheless the rooms are good and you can walk to old Taipa for a taste of old Portugal. ,40
"The staff was polite and caring, quick and easy check-in and check-out, Rooms were clean, spacious, comfortable...easy accesability to other hotels and casinos nearby. Free shuttle service to and from Macau ferry terminal . Also, free shuttle service available for the City Centre (old Macau ), other nearby hotels and casinos from a hotel nearby.

"We took the 1:40pm ferry from Hong Kong and cleared customs painlessly and easily found the free shuttle (2nd stop on the Sands Hotel Shuttle) from the long line of shuttle buses to various hotels and casinos.   We arrived at the check in desk at about 4:00pm and found it was busier than nearly anywhere else I've stayed (we waited about 15-20 minutes) however, the front desk staff was still really friendly and did not treat us with the ""Next!"" attitude! He took the time to answer all our questions and teased us a little bit saying ""Are you sure one night is enough?!"" which turns out was not enough. The interaction left us feeling welcome and excited for the stay. Though some staff didn't speak English, they were all really smiley and welcoming!   The room was great; the bed and‚Ä¶",40

Room is very well furnished and spacious (deluxe suite), and it's tucked in a quiet floor without much disturbances. No lack of entertainment tv programmes. A great location for honeymoon ;)  Hotel area is very grandiose, but traffic can be very high so waiting time can be really Long. Casino is right beside the lobby so it's quite fun and interesting to swing by after our day.   Buffet breakie was one of my bestest breakie. Variety is a lot and ranges from the conventional yogurt cereal to Chinese porridge and noodles. I spent 1.5 hours just at the buffer breakie ;p  Definitely a hotel to return!  ",40
"Greatly appreciated for the double upgrade to Executive Deluxe Suite. We enjoyed the high ceiling and elegance of the room, especially the strong wifi reception. (Experienced poor and no reception in the bedroom in the Executive Suite in the past.)  This stay was a day longer than any others in the past and we had the opportunity to spend some time in the pool and the Spa, oh my, I wished time did not fly by so quickly!  Thanks to Guest Relation Team, the birthday cake looked and tasted wonderful!  Silly side of me during this stay:  Without any difficulty, the 40th floor button in the elevator is easily located and I enjoyed pressing it :)",50
"It is hard to complain about a hotel when you stay in a state of the art suite with over 200 sq meters. Check in was a little complicated at start as I didn't see the special check in area for suites and executive rooms. Once I finally found out the special check in area, it was so smooth and they were so welcoming that I immediately realized the stay would be fantastic. Once the formalities were done, I was sent to my suite and what a BIG surprise. It surpassed every expectation I had by far. With a view to the Venetian, the 2 huge bedrooms suite felt like home immediately. I had a hard time to gather courage to leave it and explore Macau. Macau is a pearl left from the hands of the Portuguese in Asia and I have always been enchanted by it. The city has grown and became more‚Ä¶",50

I checked-in this afternoon to my Deluxe Suite (room number: 2-4010) and upon opening the door I noticed that there was an awful smell pervading the room. Upon closer inspection I found cigarettes littered across the living room, along one of the walls, on the floor, and on one of the tables. There were ashes (!!!) strewn on said table as well.  Went back to the lobby extremely shocked and disappointed. How can a (supposedly) FIVE STAR resort mess up as simple a request as ""non-smoking floor, please""? Even if you were to give this room to a smoking guest, the room cleaning/preparation looked so shoddy and haphazardly unbefitting of an‚Ä¶",10

Loved the location since we could walk over to the Venetian and also take the shuttle bus back from the historic city center. Tried the Italian restaurant Bene and loved it.  Though a little cold, my son enjoyed the various pools there",40
"There is nothing in the standard of the room or the service that we would score as above average for a Club room stay. Sure the rooms are spacious, but they are average international class hotel rooms, the decor is nothing wow. Where it does score well is price, by our reckoning, this is one of the cheapest Macau Club room packages around, especially if you take the full payment in advance option. We also enjoyed three thoroughly sound nights sleep and never once heard any noise from surrounding guests. The staff is well trained in customer service and in general are helpful but we found were slow to respond. Check-in was slow but we appreciated the calmness of the Club room check-in compared to the general check-in on the ground floor.  The twin towers of the Sheraton Grand‚Ä¶",30

Good view of the Macao city. What disappoint me this trip will be the food quality during the evening cocktail buffet session.  It used to have tons of food variety for hotel guests, and the menu will change daily. This round it's bad, food is total crap, to my surprise , food menu wasn't change for my entire week of stay in Sheraton.  Total regret for purchasing hotel room package together with breakfast and evening cocktail. ",50

Sheraton macau is great big hotel, nice room and pool, conveniant site to visit The Venetian hotel and shopping mall. if you aren't member, must register before arrival. it has 3000 rooms and robby is like a hell, crowded people waiting for check in or check out or left their baggages. SPG member counter is better and you can get free wifi.",50
"The location is close to the show ""Dancing water"", just walking distance and that's why i stayed here. The Italian brunch at Bene was good from 11-3pm and got plenty of time to enjoy the food. Check in counter was welcomed by warm and helpful staff. SPG members get an express counter which was easier for me to get through.",40
I consistently stay at the Sheraton Macau at least 1 night every week and I always feel welcome with the friendly and warm staff at check-in. This a considered my home away from home. Generally every staff member are attentive and willing to extend their help to all the guests.,50

Guest Services is also Excellent.   All the staff at the Lounge made the effort to call me by name from checking to seating me for breakfast.",50

We stayed for 3 night after a 28 days in China it was nice to get a comfortable soft bed we had breakfast included in our package it was ok but long Cues and had to wait for them to fill up they needed 2 chefs to do the eggs as there was always about 15 in the cue  Over all it was nice an central with free buses to the other casinos and lots of places to eat out  We went on the gondolas at the Venetian go early in the morning and you should get one by yourself ,30
"The rooms are well-appointed. Spacious and clean. No complaints here. They are generous in giving out complimentary water, which guests should take advantage of since bottled water within Cotai is costly. The pools are ok and the view fantastic. But if you are staying in the Earth Tower, you need 5 minutes to reach the pool and gym in the Sky Tower. Check-in and check-out are a breeze. Location is quite challenging. They have a bridgeway leading to the Four Seasons and Venetian which are across the street. But if you plan to go to the likes of Senado Square and Macau Tower, and avail of free shuttle buses, you need to go to the City of Dreams, which offers complimentary shuttle buses to more locations than Venetian and Cotai Strip combined.

The staff is truly a collection of dedicated professionals striving to perform for the guest.  Guest rooms are large, airy and most comfortable.  Furnishing are all first-rate.  Location on Cotai is ideal with shopping, entertainment and dining within walking distance.  There is so much to do; however, the guest determines the pace of the stay.  I anxiously look to my next visit in the coming months!  Always a great treat and filled with much enjoyment!",50
"This is a huge hotel and it's conveniently located in a complex with shopping mall, restaurants, casino and other hotels.  Everything in the Sheraton is up to standard, though not luxury, it won't disappoint you.  From the room design, food served at restaurant and service at the front desk, everything is 5 star standard.  It may get crowded at weekends, but with express check out you just call in your room, drop off the key downstairs and you are good to go. Great value when compared to other 5 star hotels in Macau / Cotai area. Free shuttle to the ferry station is a plus!",50
"The only complaint I have with this hotel is that it can be somewhat hard to find, especially if you don't speak the language.  Beginning at the airport shuttle, all other hotels have their buses branded and easily findable, but since the Sheraton essentially shares a space with three other hotels, it's logo is a small addition to the larger ""Cotai Central"" bus.  Also, taxi drivers routinely dropped us off at the wrong entrance for the same reason, the hotel shares a building with Conrad, Hard Rock, and Holiday Inn.  Besides that, the hotel is fabulous.  Exquisitely designed lobby with casino floor, gorgeous swimming pools, and the club breakfast is absolutely to die for.  We had a suite (first one ever) which unfortunately provided great views of the other tower, instead of the‚Ä¶",40

Great location on the Cotai strip for visiting the surrounding casinos... bit of a slog to the Venetian Expo centre but ok once you get the hang of it. Rooms great - every facility inc ironing board and iron!! Better than Holiday Inn,40
We were given a large room with a pool view.  The room was very clean and comfortable.   It had a large bed and 4 thick pillows.  The wifi worked very well too.  There were many elevators to transport guests to their appropriate floor so the wait for the elevator was never long.,50

I had some email communication prior to arrival and I should admit that the response from the staff was quite prompt. The room was very big with a king size bed with absolute peace. There was no noise at all. We had a good view facing the pool and studio city. The pool was quite good and was not at all crowded. Breakfast was sumptuous with the local, continental and Indian cuisine. The lower levels were awesome with the shopping stores, casinos.

I visited this hotel last week during my business trip. This is undoubtedly world's biggest property of Sheraton !!! Its so huge that you'll definitely end up in losing your way to your room and it would be an achievement if you reach your room without any assistance ;-) Location is one of the best in Macao. Venetian is just few steps away.  Must stay hotel in Macau.,50
Poor Service - Wrong room number provided by Front Desk staff. Assigned #3665 but inform us as #3605. Clarify after half hour. - No signature and notification for 1/f lift lobby which suspended after 2300. Escalators back to G/F lift lobby. Safety quest for wheel chair and baby wheels. Poor hardware - Poor noise insulation in Room 3601. Lift machanic sound all night long.,20
"Stayed at the Sheraton in Macau for only 1 night. Overall all the 5 star hotels in Macau are the same, they all have shops, a gaming floor and the same room but I chose the Sheraton only cause it was the cheapest. All the hotels on the strip are also connected to each other so it's really convenient to go from one to the other without having to actually step outside the hotel. Sheraton specifically had a regular check in process, the rooms were stock standard and so was the service i.e everything you would expect from a normal five star hotel. My only complaint was that there wasn't enough drinking water so we had to keep calling concierge to order more, other than that it was perfect.",50
"This was an unplanned trip. I went directly to a travel desk to inquire the best deal of the day in Macao and was given a list of 5 stars hotels and somehow I picked Sheraton Macao.  During check-in, was quick and efficient! And friendly. Booked our dinner at a buffet breakfast too!  Room was immaculate clean - non smoking room for sure! Love every sight of it not to forget to mention the view was breathtaking - Parisian & studio city! So this kinda make u feel you are either in Paris or Vegas at one glimpse üòÖ. Worth the price!  Don't waste your time to explore outside restaurants. Stay indoor and book your dinner at the Grill near the Pool - food is super delicious!!!!

The front desk told us that it is because of the weekend as more people are travelling from mainland China to Macau for leisure, so if you can avoid weekends.",40
"In a city noted for glamorous casinos, this hotel / casino is opulent and dignified in keeping with the Sheraton style.  It has beautiful pools, facilities and is attached to an up market shopping centre.  It is in the centre of the new area and a good choice.",50

From the front desk (special mention to Lukas Liu), the concierge, the pool attendants to the room service.  They all wear that genuine smile and all ready to assist you.

The mattress was essentially a thin piece of foam and the bed totally rock hard! Would probably be more softer sleeping on the carpets! Complained to room service and was told that the mattress on the top was  thin so that the railings would still be effective. Totally illogical reasoning as this should have been considered in the inital design stage for the comfort and safety of the guest. To give them their due, they did give us a rollaway bed after i complained.  Another factor which they should look into is their Spa.

We have stayed here for valentine's day. The check-in was horrible. We have arrived areound 15h but the queues were so horrible long that we gave up and choose to explore Macau a bit. When we came back at 20h it again took 30-45 min to queue. This was my second stay in this hotel and the queues at the check-in were as long as ever... The staff was very attentive and had prepared some rosepetals on the bed and a box of macarons. We didn't try the other facilities of the hotel. The room was spacious in general clean but the carpets had stains. The view was bad facing the other tower of sheraton.  Overall the experience with Sheraton wasn't bad besides the queueing.,40
"We spent two nights at the Sheraton Grand Macao and enjoyed our time here. It's located outside of central Macau but offers shuttles to a number of other properties.   Our room on an upper floor was beautiful and spacious. The bathroom featured both a very large tower and a huge soaking tub (very nice for weary traveling feet). The view (on the back of the hotel, towards the Holiday Inn) was not very attractive. There's a huge amount of new construction in this area, and along with one of the Sheraton's pools, that comprised most of our view.   Service at this hotel was nothing to write home about. I have no complaints but also did not feel like any staff members went out of their way to make our experience a positive one.   The pools on this property are among the most‚Ä¶",40

I selected Green Choice so I would not be disturbed but requested for many bottles of water(if possible). Shortly upon arrival in my room, housekeeping came and gave me additional 4 bottles of water.   The next day when I returned from a long day of business, I noticed a bag of 4 bottles of water was hanging behind the door when I entered.  I marked ""Do Not Disturb"" so the housekeeper did not attempt to put it in the room.    Whilst I did not recover immediately over the 3D/2N, it kept hydrated.  Thank you Sheraton for the care and front desk and housekeeping for remembering my request (a rare one).",50
"We only had one night at the Sheraton but it was lovely.  We stayed in a Club Room, which I would highly recommend as we considered it great value for money.  Check-in & check-out was a breeze.  Evening drinks & nibbles were included and the atmosphere was relaxed & welcoming. The buffet breakfast was great with lots of choices. We would have no hesitation in returning :)",50
"Everything was very good.Kindly stuff,location,rooms,restaurants everything is pretty good.We really enjoy our stay in this hotel.And comparing with prices of other 5star hotels in Macao price of this hotel was quite reasonable.",50
"Hotel was overbooked over the weekend, and my family was given a smoking room instead of a non-smoking one.  My partner has a very sensitive nose to cigarette smell, and we were surprised to find out that there minimal cigarette smell in the room!  Club floor is great, especially if you like a variety of food.  On behalf of my family, I would like to compliment the staff for maintaining the rooms at such an excellent level. My thanks again!  The stay has been fantastic, and we are looking forward to the next trip to the Sheraton Grand again.",50
"The overall was a very lousy stay. We had a smoke free room,but was kind of small. We dun expect it to so small. BF was bad since day one, not choices at all, no refill,taste was off. We have a baby but bf was not suitable. Very nice room. Looking forward to stay there again",30
"The hotel has two towers, which are a couple hundred metres apart. The reception area is vast; the Starwood preferred guest area is not immediately obvious, but staff are plentiful and will point program members in the right direction. I had the misfortune to have a key card which did not work for my room...it took me 10 minutes to re-trace my steps and get the card re-programmed. Once in, the room was a pleasant surprise, with an excellent, and sizeable bathroom. Enough hanging space, and a comfortable double bed completed my requirements. The hotel is connected to the Venetian and Four Seasons across the Cotai strip, but there is quite a deal of walking involved...and GPS would help! Signage is plentiful but confusing, and it is easy to get lost.",40
"I will get back to Sheraton, however  I will try next time the Club Floor if i plan to have breakfast in the hotel.  It is not recommended to have breakfast in the main restaurant: It looks like a huge canteen  with bad service . However the main issue is the so bad smell when you approach the restaurant outside in the corridor as well as inside , a smell of a mixed of fish+ eggs.... , smell of dishes..... That was terrible, you feel you don't want to eat anymore and that was on daily basis.... However plenty of choice....  So next time we will try the club lounge hoping to avoid such situation.  As for the location, as long as you decide to stay in this area, all hotels are vey close to each other: Four seasons, Venetian, Conrad., Holiday Inn.... they are linked with bridges,,,‚Ä¶",40
"This was my second time at the Sheraton Grand Macao and again, it was an excellent stay. I just wanted to comment that the check in staff, Eduardo C., was so friendly, nice and helpful. Not only did he make our check in process go so smooth, after curd checking out and more than 4 hours later I noticed my daughter forgot her jacket in the room. Eduardo helped us track down her jacket and was able to return it to us asap.   Thank you so much Eduardo for your excellent service. Much appreciated  Regards Mr. Leung",50
We have had a great weekend with my family there. We don't need to discuss the location issue in Macau since everyone know how to get around Macau by the free shuttle buses in every casino. The room was big and the place was clean. good value !~,50
"Overall I liked the hotel. It's huge, There are many bars, restaurants, the shopping mall. An easy walk to the Venetian across the street over the pedestrian bridge. I arrived by the ferry from HK and the shuttle bus was right there - it was an easy transfer. It's a largest Sheraton in the world but, surprisingly, my room was not ready (I arrived before the normal check-in time though). They told me that the property was fully booked the night before. Can happen. The line for check-in was quite long even though they have a dedicated check-in counter for SPG guests. I had to wait quite some time. I think they could have been more effective here. I booked a standard room. I liked the room, it's a decent size with all typical 4 stars amenities. The bathroom was well designed and‚Ä¶",40
A very long queue for check-in . I queued up for SPG reception counter which was a much shorter queue but still had to wait more than 30 minutes as some of the staff were really slow in their processing. I understood there are almost 4000 guest rooms but the hotel management should deploy sufficient staff as the check-in experience gives the first impression to hotel guests.  Bedroom and bathroom were spacious and comfortable though the decoration was not stylish.  Room rate was reasonable for a weekend before the Mother's Day. Lots of shops and restaurants inside the hotel and in its neighbourhood. Check out was quick as I used the Express Check-out counter.,40
"This hotel is huge with nearly 4000 rooms. Amazingly, even on what is one of the busiest nights in the year when they were completly full the service is personal and first class. On arrival a manager came over to personally explain to me that they could not offer me an upgrade as a platinum SPG member. He also personally escorted me to my room and made sure there was a nice bottle of wine on its way. Later on I attended the happy hour at the Sheraton Club. Not only is this club the biggest I have ever seen but they actually increased it in size by adding an additional large room. And here the personal service continued with both myself and other guests in ear shot. All the staff were great but one lady Marianna stands out for her ""nothing is too much trouble"" attitude. It truly‚Ä¶",50
"This is a massive hotel and with size sometimes a hotel like this can struggle to deliver We took club rooms and my wife and I were upgraded to a suite-- our daughter who was travelling with us unaccompanied by her partner was given an adjoining room with a connecting door The rooms were all large, bathrooms were large and immaculate and we had no complaints at all Check in at the club lounge was fast and easy and breakfast and late afternoon drinks and food brilliant  The hotel is one of a massive group of 4 and is also connected to the Venetian by covered overhead walkway We could not recommend it more highly",50
"The standard and service at the hotel has definitely slipped. Wouldn't stay again or recommend this hotel anymore - and I've recommended it to a number of friends over the years.   A serious incident at breakfast summed up our recent stay. My six year old son badly burnt his forearm on one of their hot plates at the Club facility. It was dangerously hot, with zero warning signs and caused considerable stress and pain. He has scarring two weeks later.  Had to chase the hotel up via email for an apology and to check they had put warning signs up at breakfast. Got the impression from the hotel that it was 'just one of those things that happen'!   Avoid - plenty of great hotel choices in Macau - and the Sheraton needs to show a greater care of duty to it's guests.",10
"We did book the Sheraton Grand for one night only and chose it due to the close proximity to the airport. Upon arrival we had an incident (nothing to to with the hotel) and were treated so nicely and everything was handled in the most perfect way possible. When we decided on a 3000 keys hotel we were not expecting boutique and had no illusions on the size (I honestly can not follow ratings saying the hotel is so large and you get lost - it is the same saying there are so many casinos in Macau). So to put it in a nutshell - everyone we met from Concierge to housekeeping, receptionist to manager, security to staff at the pool - everyone was very friendly and attentive. We did get upgraded to a Suite which was just amazing with view at the pool and ""Eiffeltower"". Beautiful design,‚Ä¶",50
"Stayed at this property twice, friendly helpful staff. Designated Starwood members checkin that would save significant time checking in. Quite centered on the strip. Within minutes to local attractions/ casinos in the Taipa area.",40
I booked this hotel after reading the reviews.  The check in was pleasant and the concierge was knowlegeable.  It was quite a ease for me to book the ferry tickets and to get to  the ferry terminal.  The place is clean and well located. Will stay here again.,40
"We checked in on the Club floor which was fast and easy.  However when one of our friends left their key by mistake in the room and asked for another key card, the staff were not quite with it.  They kept insisting to see identification, as we explained it's in the room and since we have not key we can't get that.  It took 10 minutes before they understand and said they would follow my friend to the room to check the identification.  They really should have better trained staff who speak good and understand English!  Room service was slow took over an hour for food to be delivered.  We had a deluxe room which was fine - it was clean and comfortable.  For a weekend, it is not a bad hotel but I wouldn't say it is one of the best hotels in Macau.",30
"We booked the rooms that gave us Club Lounge access which turned out to be great. The breakfast is average, but the evening food and free cocktails and drink was great. Saved us a lot of money drinking in the casinos.   One down side was the rooms felt very humid and bed sheets and clothes were damp  Check in was also a bit of a nightmare as the booking was mixed up with twin beds and king sized beds. ",40
"Hotel Nice and Neat. Extremely busy hotel. queued for at least 30mins to check in even as a SPG member. Hotel staff was directing other non SPG guests queuing to check in at the ""less busy"" SPG area - hence actual SPG members had to wait longer than usual. Many staff are hired from the mainland China, not as professional as staff in other Sheraton hotels elsewhere, didnt respect people queuing at the back of the line, just let other guests jumping the queue to check out. Room was neat & clean - although i found a hair on the showerhead...Breakfast was alright. Recommend to go early (esp on weekends) to avoid the queue. Overall I am satisfied with the price i paid for as I didnt have much expectations when i booked",30
"We stayed 2 nights at the Sheraton and enjoyed it very much. The room was clean, modern and large. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The hotel has some nice restaurants and a big casino. It attaches to nearby hotels via shopping venues. The room rate was better than many nearby hotels, such as the Venetian and Four Seasons across the street.",50
"My first visit to this hotel was on mid April, our family booked two rooms through Sherwood website. If trip advisor.com need any proof that I actually stayed in this hotel prior to me writing a review, I  am gladly to provide them. Just ask.  Anyways, my mom and dad arrived Macau first and it took them sometime to check in as they were asking for my credit card because I made the booking, my dad explains that i will arrive later that night and the front desk reluctantly checks them in. Not such a big deal at the moment.  Upon arrival at the hotel, i notice that the corridor is quite smoggy, perhaps due to the fact that there are no air vents, at least not the distance we cover which is about halfway in from the elevator.   I enter the room, no big surprise given it was my‚Ä¶",10
"If you are willing to spend time in the casinos, this is probably the best option. Located in the middle of the cotai strip, with internal access to other casinos and free shuttles to the airport, the ferry and the border. The breakfast is expensive but amazing. The rooms are luxury and spacious.",50
This was a nice hotel but did not provide Club Lounge access for SPG Gold Members (Platinum only).  The hotel is also some distance from old town Macau and many of the tourist attractions in the city. The complementary breakfast was very nice.,40
"Looking for a base from where to experience Macau with guest from Europe, we settled on this large Sands Cotai property as it is close and connected to The Venetian but at a significantly cheaper rate. We did not regret this choice, as our stay there flawlessly delivered what we expected. Our rooms, at the 29th floor, had good views of the Venetian. They were large, well-appointed and comfortable ‚Äì good but nothing unexpected in a new Sheraton property. With large seasonal fluctuations in occupancy and steady opening of new properties (Studio City has just opened; The Parisian and Wynn Palace are next in line later this year, in the same area), Cotai hotels frequently push attractive promotions and it‚Äôs worth shopping around online before settling on a particular name.

"Just spent a good couple of days at the Sheraton on the club level over the holiday weekend. I would recommend this hotel due to good customer service overall especially the club lounge set up. They were without exception courteous, friendly and very helpful. A good breakfast served and 2 hour happy hour from 5.30 to 7.30 with outside seating if required. They also have some nibbles and sandwiches available at lunch time. The hotel is centrally located on the strip and is joined to the Venetian centre by a walk way. There is a cheap and cheerful food court on the 3rd floor as an alternative to restaurants. shops and casino on the lower levels. Free coach transfers from and to the ferry and airport terminals that run about every 15 mins. The only fail was with the house keeping‚Ä¶",40
"We have stayed at many other Asian hotels, but this one did not meet our expectations.  The staff at check in was very rude and not very helpful.  It took over an hour for us to finally get into our room.  The rooms were just basic.  The food was just ok.  The location was nice for Macau.  There was a mall attached to the hotel but not one that you could actually shop at unless you were a ""high roller""....very expensive!  We will not return to this hotel as you have many other choices in this area.",20
"We arrived at this hotel at night via a free shuttle bus from the ferry terminal.  It was a 5mins walking from the back entrance to the 2nd lobby of the hotel since the first lobby was closed at that time.  We enjoyed it anyhow since we walked inside the mall.  When we checked-in, they asked for HK$2000 deposit.  There's less queue that time so one staff stayed with us while checking and led us the way to our room as usual. The way to the hotel room was so tricky if you will go back alone as there are two towers so be sure that you're on the right path.  This hotel is connected to the rest of the leading hotels in Macau, we passed through a casino going back and forth to our hotel.  There's a lot of restaurants to choose from and of course shops too :) The room was so clean and‚Ä¶",50

"I stayed lots of hotels in Macau in the past. International 5 star hotels in Macau CoTai are almost the same as they are all luxury! However, my recent stay at Sheraton Macao was amazing.   In fact, being an elite SPG member, I never request for upgrade especially for business trips. However, Stefan, the front office manager surprisingly upgraded my room to a larger suite when they knew I was travelling with 70 year old parents. For me, that is really touching and feeling appreciated!   Furthermore, I would like to thank you Benny the Manager at the SPG elite check in area (1/F). His mentality was really positive which can make huge difference! Certainly, all the staff were friendly, helpful and professional.

A very big room with beautiful furnishing and a very big bathroom. There is lots of shops and good restaurants. The casino is also very standard Vegas style. It took about 30 minutes for us to wait in line for checkin.,50
" <Advantage> 1. Adjacent to the biggest shopping center in Cotai area- Four seasons hotel, Venetian, Holiday Inn, Conrad Hotel etc. 2. Spacious room  3. Huge Casino  4. Good restaurants are nearby (Japanese, Chinese, Italian etc.)  <Disadvantage> 1. Late check-in time at 3pm(A long queue as well) 2. Conjunction at the elevator",40
"Yet it is not extravagant, it is a weekend-get-away family-type of a hotel you may consider staying at. Nice complex with different types of shopping...from M&S supermarket to luxurious brands. Room are tidy & spacious. Room service is efficient & very polite & considerate.",30
"We reached to the hotel at midnight due to delay of airplane, and stayed there 2N3D at the Club Room. We checked in through the Club Lounge. The hotel was huge and there were so many rooms, and it was not so easy to find my room. But, the hotel staff never lead me to my room, and it was quite disappointing.  Room was spacious and clean, but the toilet was not properly maintained. We called house keeping service to clean the toilet.  Food was fair, but I cannot say it was great. Room service food was also fair, but again I cannot say it was good.  There was available shuttle service, but it was not as convenient nor frequent compared to other hotel.",30
"I was there during April and it was a huge complex with holiday inn and conrad altogether. The lobby is spacious however i would recommend to have better signage since there are a number of check in counters which can confuse those first time visitors. Room was comfortable with quality bed and nice bathroom, enjoyed my stay.  However the downside: BAD wifi connection: it was poor for a 5 star hotel with connection dropped in every 10 mins, which is disappointed with such service Shuttle bus: suggest to have a few more route to different places which would be better",40
"When I walked into the hallway I found a bit musty, I thought it was the air con was not strong enough, but it turns out they are a bit old.  Rooms- I had stayed in Sheraton Taipei few weeks ago, and I found the room share the same style and design which is quite surprising that they did follow Starwood stand policy, the amenities are the same!!!! We booked 2 bed, the bed is quite big, but rather hard. The whole room is very classic Sheraton style. Sheraton Macao and Sheraton Taipei have one thing in common, the room have musty smell, Macao has less musty than Taipei.

It's an okay room, nothing more, i.e while Venetian suites gives you an awesome experience while Sheraton rooms just provides you with a simple nights sleep. And for the same price. Great location though. ",30
"It's Not the Sheraton in the States- it has a much modern-er design, exp in the room. Great maintenance despite the fact that they have over 3,000 rooms and always full house. Good work! Though getting lost in the casino is still a headche in terms of the number of hallways and exits (typical), the rooms are surprisingly decent.",40
"We arrived at night on a full flight. After collecting your luggage, turn right at the airport exit. It's a short walk to the free shuttle buses which take you directly to the Sheraton Grand which is about a 5-min ride.   Immigration was a breeze. A pretty small airport, an easy walk to the belts. Free airport wifi. Just hook on to the free airport wifi and launch browser.   At Sheraton, thankfully there was no crowd when checking in. Check-in was smooth and easy. Instantly made an SPG member, they found our booking immediately. A very pleasant, smooth and easy check in.   At the lobby near the walkway to the Cotai Shoppes next to the Bell Desk, there's a premium mobile phone store, where you can get your prepaid simcards. It's MOP188 for 2GB data and we got a top up of MOP100,‚Ä¶",50

The front desk receptionist is very hospitable and accommodating. She is a Filipina. They gave us a free room upgrade to Executive Suite and late check out up to 3PM. They even surprised us with a welcome pastries which tastes really good. The bathroom was huge. We have a bath tub with complimentary bath salts, a separate shower area and toilet. I even have a vanity mirror with lights on the side, similar to what make up artist uses. We even had a separate wash room on our receiving area.

Its a very nice place just understand that if you wanted it to be like Vegas its not.  They love to gamble their but the party seen is not like Las Vegas.  Expect to not see people walking the streets with drinks and having a good time.   They all in the casino doing it there.  Lots of shopping and friendly people.  Hotel was nice and luxurious.,40

I  decided to give it the second chance to stay during the Easter holiday at a promotional rate, and surprisingly much better than I expected, especially during the tourist-flooded Easter peak.   Thumb up to the FO at the SPG member reception which all I've encountered were very helpful and efficient. Special thanks to Gladys Wang who made my stay perfect by suggesting us to upgrade to the Shrek-themed family room. The well-appointed connecting rooms were both spacious and stocked with kids' amenities (even a Xbox!) at the kid's side.

The rooms are dated but clean. On location restaurants we all good, Buffet, Casino and Italian were the ones we visited. Location is on the Cotai strip and a taxi ride away from Taipa strip. For those wanting to stay closer to the city center, I would recommend staying on the Taipa side as you can walk to town, instead of using a taxi.",40
"My family stayed this hotel first time, but they were very happy here. the room which facing the swimming pool and Eiffel Tower is very beautiful and comfortable,  the food also is delicious.by the way , the location of Sheraton hotel is very convenient because located near Venetian and Galaxy hotel.

"If you want to be in the main casino hub on the Taipa side then the Sheraton is an excellent choice.  It's located right in the heart of the Cotai strip with beautiful rooms in a luxury venue and very reasonably priced.  While it won't be cheap enough for those on a tight budget, anyone looking for a great experience then this is likely the best bang for your buck that's near everything you want.",50
"Its integrated facilities and shopping arcade made us want to stay here as we already exhausted from travelling around HK. The bed so comfy and big, love the bed sheet, the ambient and the casino. The breakfast was great, plenty of great food, make sure you stay with breakfast. Nothing to complaint, check in - out was quick, staffs were very helpful and friendly. Definitely will stay in this hotel again. ",50

The Executive Suite which I stayed was comfortable, clean and well-equipped.   Overall service is good, especially the Chef Concierge -  Mark, who is friendly, helpful, efficient and able to assist all my inquiry and provide very detailed information that I need during my stay. Such professional service impressed me.  If I go to Macau again, I would love to stay in this hotel.",50

"We have stayed in this hotel for three times before this (there aren't many cheap hotels in Macau with good quality like Sheraton). Maybe because of this reason, we were upgraded from an executive suite to a deluxe suite at the top floor of Sky Tower, which had fabulous views and the room is extremely spacious for 3 people. Breakfast in the club lounge was ok, and the room had many useful facilities such as a coffee maker, two toilets, a bathtub, snacks, an entertainment room, etc. My only drawback is that the bed was not that good to sleep on. I would definitely choose Sheraton next time.",50

One minor bad point, which is the temperature of the water.  When I took a shower, the water cannot maintain with the same temperature, like 1 sec hot, 1 sec cold @.@ ",30

I would suggest to SPG club to serve snacks that meet their standard if they want customers satisfied 110%...",50
We booked for two nights in their Sheraton Club rooms which were located on the top floors beginning at the 31st floor.  We initially had a hiccup when the rooms we booked were not ready despite the fact we arrived by 5 pm already and have to wait a bit.  Good thing when you are booked in the club rooms you have some welcome drink and a quiet space to sit.  The rooms were spacious and nice bathroom.  Bottle water is free and you can request for more. Cleanliness i rate at 8 out of 10.  What was great about this hotel was that it was attached to the shopping centers and the other hotels including The Venetian.  Free shuttle buses were provided to the airport and ferry stations.  The staff at the Club Lounge were very helpful and checking in and out was very convenient and less‚Ä¶,40

Our children have not included any breakfast however the front desk upgrade our children with free breakfast. We also enjoyed the early check in and late check out during the visit. The room is not big but enough.  The view is good and we can see Venetian hotel. Some food there are quite expensive. There are som program for kids.",40
"My 2 nights stay end up turned into a 5 night stay. Due to the mixed reviews here, I booked they lowest tier to try it out first.   First 2 nights at their Deluxe Room, then I decide to try out their Family Suite, then moved to their Executive Suite.   As a SPG member the check in is very smooth, rooms are clean. There were hiccups one the third day as one of the staff at SPG check in service was unhelpful on extending my stay. I was little ticked off, checking out right away did come to my mind.  Lucky I decided to go to their 4/F Club lounge to try my luck, their staff, Mr Go saved the day. Very helpful and polite, with his help I checked in my new room seamlessly, and he restored my impression of Sheraton.   Back to the rooms: Deluxe room is spacious comparing to most hotels,‚Ä¶",50

"Stayed at the hotel for 1 night in March. It took over one hour to check in (this does not even include the queuing!) which was incredibly frustrating. The room itself was very spacious and clean. We had paid extra to have breakfast at the hotel, but when we arrived there was a queue for around 60 people ahead of us. They just could not fulfil demand and we therefore asked for a refund. Luckily this was given without hesitation. The casino itself seemed a bit dated, there were other hotels on the strip which just felt a bit more glamorous. Unlikely to stay here again. ",30

"As some reviews pointed out, this is a typical casino hotel. Rooms are spacious and beds comfortable. What impressed me most is the service from their Guest Relations Team, in particular Mr Peter Jung who answered my email promptly.  Not sure who did the good job, but all the requests that I made when I booked through Booking.com were arranged in order before our check in. My experience is many  5 star-hotels will need you to repeat your requests upon checking-in and hence it takes a long time to search the rooms to meet your requests.There was also a birthday card and a small box of cakes in the room to celebrate my mother's birthday waiting in the room for us when we returned from dinner at night.

To create a little surprise to my wife, I ordered a bundle of flowers and requested to have the flower put inside the room so that my wife could see it once entered into the room.  It turns out that the Guest Relations Team, including Cristina, Rachel, Mandy and Carlos did much more than what I expected.  First, their responses (emails) was prompt, helpful and efficient so I was assured things will go as I planned.  When we entered the room, the flowers was in the bed (of course), but there was also a ""heart"" formed by some rose petals with a warm greeting card inside!

"Sheraton  Our Deluxe room was more than adequate.  Even numbered rooms offer best views in earth tower with view of the Venetian.   Not sure about sky tower.  Sky tower is closer to entrance to fitness centre and pool.  Earth tower has direct access to cotai centre mall which is on 2nd floor.   Cons: Bright items made falling asleep at night difficult.  For example, clock radio, Internet station, room thermostat, and smoke alarm.  There appears to be a central Ventilation system in addition to the in room one.  Even when we turned off the in room fan, cool air still entered the room.  Towels were dated.  Direction signs somewhat inadequate.    Pros: Excellent bedding, firm bed, wide bathroom countertop to place all your toiletries, comfortable sofa chair and work desk.  Separate‚Ä¶",40
"I spent two nights over the weekend in Macau. I was upgraded to a suite due to my spg status. The suite was very nice and spacious. There is free shuttle to and from ferry, airport and other nearby hotels. But there can easily form long line for these shuttle buses and even cabs. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Hotel is always crowded, I think it is because many groups of Chinese tourist stay here.",40
I stayed at Sheraton grand 2 nights.Deluxe room double bed is big & comfortable. There is shopping mall and casino at hotel. We use shuttle bus service form airport and  ferry terminal.You can walk across the bridge to Venetian  shopping & casino.,50
"Great Experience.  Good services.  The Casino although very small was customer friendly.  Was connected with a much bigger casino Venetian.  The mall attached was not of much value to the travellers.  However, ATM facility was helpful.",50
"I stayed at this amazing hotel for 2nites. We are not planned to stay here because quite a lot negative review for this hotel. But we ended to stay here is they offer good price and guess what? We found out all the bad comment is wrong. Yes wrong! Sheraton is a great hotel with easy access to everywhere, especially if you are into venetian and vicinity attractions.  Also the most exciting part is when they inform us that they are complimentary upgraded our room from deluxe room to Deluxe Suite which is so wonderful for me and my husband. He is on his birthday and we are celebrating our 1st wedd anniversary so its truly blessed trip for us.   Thanks to all hotelier and hotel management who prepared everything. Highly appreciates your effort!!  Notes :  - all the food & beverages‚Ä¶",50
"location is good, very convenience, hotel is new and clean with a big mall and casino, shuttle bus service is good. we get the free upgrade from staff in reception for the higher floor with a good night view. but room is full, we can only accept the room with 2 single beds",50
"Great location with shopping arcade and food outlets within walking distance. Love it. We enjoy the stay, the room is spacious and clean, housekeeping attendance were attentive and food and beverages staff were service oriented and knowledgeable. We also make used of the free shuttle to go around Macau",50
"Nothing to say but awesome. I never stayed in a hotel that make me feel like im home. With reasonable price, I found sheraton is somehow relaxing, and very great place to stay and gamble.  It's such a disappointment that the swimming pool not open until midnight",50
"Front Office staff provide a good rate for dinner buffet. We have dinner in feast. The food is good but only one staff in desire counter. He have many thing need to take care (ice-cream, pancake etc.) .",50
"We had nothing but a positive experience during our stay at the hotel with the exception of the long queues at the check in desk. The room was clean, spacious and the dinner next to the pool was outstanding (the best steak I've had for a long time). We will definitely plan to visit again in the near future!",50
Quite literally the largest hotel in the world I have stayed in. Pinnacle of Luxury and offers great views of the adjacent hotels. They get tourists from Mainland by the bus loads and have 10s of Checkin counters to quickly complete the checkin process. Chinese/Mandarin is the mainly spoken language and most of them speak passable english. Massive floors and huge conference rooms with a Casino below and connectivity to adjacent Shopping Centres. Right in the middle of everything and has all the casinos at a walkable distance. An experience that is unforgettable,50
"We are family with 2 kids was stay 3 nights here. 1. Been upgraded to family suite with Shrek and kungfu panda theme, my kids are screaming and they loved the room alot 2. Don't miss the dreamworks parade held on 4pm everyday on 2nd floor. Great show even adults like us were enjoy. Most important is FOC 3. I stay in 1815 and is a connection room.Room are spacious, comfortable bed and room service is great too. 4. Thank you Bruno Miguel who show his professional during my check in, he told me what can I do with my kids ard the hotel and it did help alot. 5. Another must try activitie is swimming. The pool is come with warm water. 6. Email response is fast as I write to ask for hotel shuttle timing and food promotion.  7. Free bus shuttle provided in airport / ferry terminal. Look‚Ä¶",40
"Good Hotel,Decent Food but dont know if the hotel would be categorised as 5 star.But having said,it was a good experience.Better if you have sheraton/star hotels memebership to avoid long queues for checkin/checkout. Booked through Ctrip.",40
"Must say sheraton macau has been a fabulous place to stay in macau especially if you have an infant with you. The hospitality and service provided made us spend our time in peace and fun. The location is also awesome having access to multiple casino zones, shops and a huge food court. Hope a indian restaurant opens up in the food court soon.",50
"I have stayed in this hotel for numerous times and this time i got upgraded to a suite with a KTV room3 which is larger than the one I stayed few years ago on my wedding celebration. Huge thank to the hotel especially the young gentleman who checked in for me providing useful information during my stay to celebrate a frd's bday. The room was again prepared flawlessly, well maintained guestroom with everything i need. Basically i didnt have to leave my room!!! Huge thank to the staff who prepared the room in a great condition. I will stay again and again and recommend my family to stay too!",50
"We had booked two adjoining or adjacent rooms and as this was unavailable we were upgraded to a two bed suite on the 35th floorüòÄ I would definitely book a suite next time, especially when travelling with children. It was surprisingly quiet considering the casino on the ground floor. Incredibly well policed at every entrance to stop children entering.üëç Breakfast was much better than we expected. Staff were super friendly and efficient. We were even able to do express checkout and leave our bags till we returned to catch the free shuttle to the ferry. Will be back.üòÄ",50
"Stefan and the rest of the staff at the club are really tremendous.  Living there for a month while we worked we had lots of opportunity to pester everyone. We got lots of extra help finding a hospital, bar, restaurant, coffee roaster, printing blue prints, etc, not to mention our nightly visits to Ronald at the bar for happy hour.  We'll be back for another long run in just a few weeks.",50
"Great place to spend a family holiday in Macau, Sheraton has easy access to hotels in Cotai. Venetian is only 15min walk through elegant shopping mall. Free shuttle to Taipa and Macau was also very handy. We might have been lucky as our check in and checkout was so quick. Sheraton does stand for its name. Room was elegantly decorated with all the basics and more. Breakfast at The Feast was awesome. Great customer service and very prompt room service. Loved our stay and we will definitely be back. ",50
"I have read some of the more negative reviews about the Sheraton but all I can say is that our weekend was an excellent one, made specially so by the great service and warm welcome that we received from Stefan and his amazing team in the Sheraton Club.  Macao appears to be currently suffering in terms of a decline in numbers of those visiting the Casino's and/or sightseeing etc. which means that hotel occupancy rates are under attack. In these times, therefore, those hotels who are proactive, are willing to go the extra mile to welcome, support and ensure that their guests continue to receive the very best of service, will be the winners. The Sheraton is one of these! Comments have been made by the lack of and/or change in the food now available in the Club but all I can say‚Ä¶",40
"The Sheraton in Macao has sadly lost its way in an overly crowded cotai-side resort market. At one point, the selling point here was the incredibly personal, friendly, and professional service from the club lounge; but that has sadly dropped over the past few years (several other similarly priced resorts offer comparable or better service for the same or cheaper rates). The resort also went through a period where it attempted to cater to families, but now the JW Marriott is a clear preference to the Sheraton for any family wanting a western-quality experience that serves family (the JW Marriott offers the Galaxy beach / wave pool and a kids club on site). Now, with 4,000 rooms on offer, the Sheraton will most likely attempt to be the ""mcdonalds"" of macau hotels ... a‚Ä¶",30
"40 minutes to check in, same for check out. Very average breakfast. No king bed available for a couple ... All the services around this hotel are really disappointing. We stayed two nights. Next time, will go elsewhere. Only plus side was the quality of the materials the room",20
"We love our 2 nights stay at Sheraton, staff are helpful, check in and check out is fast. Room is big and very clean, nice and complete amenities. Nice bathroom and very relaxing shower. Our bed is comfy and big enough for adult and kids to share.  Lots of restaurant nearby and food court too!",40
"Firstly I will declare that I was booked into this place by my company as we were presenting at a nearby exhibition so I wasn't paying the bill.  Arrived, around 9pm, check-in process fine, go up to room (enduring brattish kids in the lifts) and find the room which has all one would expect of this standard of hotel, or so I thought......  Anyway, having unpacked and started to relax there were some emails I needed to deal with so tried to logon to the hotel wifi to no avail (neither my tablet or phone worked so I knew it wasn't me). Afte many calls to the front desk, '10 minute' waits, unplugs etc. I gave up and went downstairs to complain.  Was advised to use the lobby lounge wifi, which did work. Hurrah! So sat down to do my work and thought why not order myself a glass of‚Ä¶",20
"Stayed in one of the rooms designed for families. Normal nice Sheraton room for Mom and Dad with an adjoining room for kids. Our 6 and 3 year old loved the bunk beds, themed decor from Kung Fu Panda and Madagascar. Little table and desk with kids size robes, playstation everything they could want.  Check in was slow and our key cards didn't work but after a trip back to reception and some help from maintenance with a flat battery in the lock everything was good.   Staff friendly throughout.  Kids loved heated pools.  Did Shrekfast and character parade. (Separate review). Great for kids!",50
Huge Great amenities with good Casino ...beyond what one can expect  but for Indian vegetarian food in Breakfast is meager .... Buffet need improvement to add more Dishes .Great ambiance and Rooms are good but Language is a Problem,50
"We booked two rooms to stay with kids and my parents in law for easter holiday.  The staffs at front desk and operators are nice and helpful since we brought our kids with us and we had different kind of request.    We arrived hotel at 8:45am, since the checked in time not ready yet so we walked around and went back at 5pm finally.  The room  I stayed with kids was terrible, because when we took shower with my kids, the shower head was broken. Also,  the TV was mute by itself and even the volume is high, but no sounds cane out unless we restart.  Both of two rooms' wall were quite dirty as well.  This is so surprise for me Sheraton likes that.    We lived in 16th floor, my parent-in-law room can see the studio city but mine room can viewed the dirt.    ",30
"Great hotel with prime location close to Venetian and Dream World. Large and comfortable room and bed, featuring luxury amenities. Surprising individual care and attention received for a hotel of this size (over 4000 rooms)! The staff was helpful and kind. Fast check-in and check-out procedure compared to other huge hotels. True 5 stars hotels experience!",50
"Macau is mostly all about casinos and this hotel is at the right place. There are casinos in this hotel as well as right across the street at Venetian.  Another plus of this hotel is its closeness to Venetian as well as other hotels close by, which gives you a lot of options for shopping, eating out etc. The check-in/check-out process was a breeze when we visited in the afternoon, but the queues are longed in the evening. The hotel has a shuttle service to the ferry terminals, which is useful when travelling back to HongKong.",40
"Reception area was hot and stuffy at check in. Felt like we were suffocating, great way to make waiting guests even angrier. We were not allowed to use the facilities until AFTER we checked in. Arriving 2 hours before check in time I dont expect to be walking into an ""hourly"" hotel. Why were we not allowed to use the pool and wait for our room? Rooms were quite plain.  In Room Dining staff very friendly and attentive. So polite. Nice view outside near studio city and developing macau. Nice big rooms. Thanks for the late check out, even if we did have to ask 3 times to finally get it. Free WIFI throughout the hotel was a nice touch. Express check out very convenient, saves from crazy lines",40
"Sweet and confident staff offer great services, proactive and responsitive my enquiressss before my booking^^""  Cozy Executive Suite, spacious with my favour Tea WG , love it probably the best suite i hv stayed  only one problem is ... Stay one night is not enough ! i will be back again",50
"The Sheraton Macau is a huge and a very busy hotel. But the service is impeccable. The Check in checkout was very smooth and the desk clerk did not hurry us along but took her time to explain the hotel details and available amenities. The breakfast is varied and a vast spread but they do not take personal requests, as I wanted soft boiled eggs for my LO but the chef said could not be done, a tad disappointing for such a huge hotel. the rooms are amazing with great views of the Cotai strip. The hotel is huge and getting from one place to another can be quite a walk. All the neighboring hotels have interconnected lobbies and walk through shopping arcades, so bring your comfy shoes to walk the distance. the shuttles to and from the airport/ HK-Macau ferry is a terrific bonus! They‚Ä¶",40
"This is a very busy hotel,but saying that the service was excellent.Location very good and opposite the Venitian which is worth a visit.Never visited the gambling halls but if gambling is you're thing then you can't go wrong,we were here for the motorbike racing and this hotel suited our needs.",40
"I decided to stay at the Sheraton Grand Macau for two nights before the easter peak season. The service was very good and the staff extremely helpful. The concierge had an in-depth knowledge of the city and local restaurants. Check-in and check-out procedures are extremely convenient since there are 3 possibilities to check-out ( reception, touch-screen or in room check-out ) . The room was clean , spacious and comfortable. Staff members ( especially housekeeping ) are warm and friendly. The wifi connexion is disappointing since it crashes often ( the connexion is weak in the whole complex ) . Breakfast is of good quality but the variety of the food should be improved ( no salmon, very limited choice of cheeses , )... Overall, a great stay up to my expectations !",50
It was an awesome stay at Sheraton Grand Macao hotel.  They are so thoughtful to arrange a small little card for our son and the hotel rooms was awesome!  Friendly staff and great location for family travel.   We surely will visit again in summer time.,50
"Stayed here for a few nights in December. Overall, this is what it is, a nice hotel that Sheraton is worldwide. It is fairly standard across the world. You pay fo what you get. Sometimes at this end of the price spectrum, it is the little things that sets them apart. Unfortunate there were a few out of date coffee/ tea and milk on offer. They were months out of date, not days.   Overall, this hotel is very crowded with tourists and service can sometimes be lapse due to overcrowding.",30
"Spacious room, Comfortable bed and quest atmosphere. Loved heated swimming pool and jacuzzi Location is right in the center close to all major casinos and entertainments. Room service took a while and long queuing for check in. If hotel has cellphone charger to borrow that would be great. ",40
Nice hotel -but very big -pool was closed -the view was ok -go early for breakfast and sit for as long as you can -. Shop around for food and meals as to many places to pick from .after breakfast jump on a bus to any of the great local restaurants and casinos any is great .rooms nice and big but don't get lost . Take your walking shoes as it is a long walk if you want to walk and enjoy the rest of the places to see ,40
"Stayed 2 nights at the Sheraton Grand.  We had a standard King room and everything went well.  The hotel is in a good location in the Sands Cotai complex (indoor overhead bridge to Venetian).  There is a free shuttle from the Airport and the ferry terminal.  My room was clean and bed was comfortable.  Points for improvement are the slow elevators and very slow room service.  Otherwise, good experience.",40
We chose Deluxe suite with entertainment room for my family get together. Its a spacious and comfortable room. HSK staffs attended our needs efficiently. The only issue was the entertainment room which cannot be used for Karaoke due to some cables connection problem. Even their engineers cannot do anything. Hope they can work it out for our future stay and other guests.,40
"It was great when we were there! Nice welcome and they upgraded us free suite room for first oversea couples trip at Macau. When we saw  the room first time no have any word just only ""Wow"" ""Oh my gosh"" The room so nice and comfortable we can see Cotai view from our room on 33th floor but unfortunately our 2nd and 3rd night has hard fog we can't see anything but the room made us feel well If we have a chance we'll go back again and hope to get this special experience again  Thank you.

"As a die-hard member of Starwood, choosing a Starwood hotel chain is always the best choice for us. Room is very nice and we love the contemporary interior design. Check-in was fast and fulled of warm welcome although the lobby was crowded at all the time. We really love the pools and spent a half day with it. Besides that, the buffet breakfast and lobby lounge are also good to enjoy for them. It was great to be here.",50
"The Sheraton Grand in Macau, it's actually in Taipa, a new suburb across the bridge from Macau proper, is part of the massive hotels being built. Specifically, the Sheraton Grand is connected by way of malls and casinos from the Sands to the Holiday Inn, St. Regis and so on...it seems to never end...quite a spectacle of 5 Star hotels, cafes, restaurants and boutiques that will have Vegas looking over its shoulder to see what the younger sibling is up to.  The Sheraton Grand is, well, the Sheraton Grand. It's a Sheraton. What more can be said. Everything was perfect! We had a 1 bedroom suite and is was, well, it's a one bedroom suite at the Sheraton Grand...clean, spacious, huge soaker tub, two bathrooms, great WiFi and so on. The only irritating glitch was that breakfast was not‚Ä¶",50
"It's a good Sheraton hotel. There are some that pretend to be good but the staff could not care less. This one is genuinely good. Polite, smiling employees, clean spacious room with a comfortable bed - all you need for a pleasant stay. Stayed here a few times and always happy.",50
"Really nice hotel and very clean. Rooms were big and nicely made. TV and Internet were both adequate. Loved the pool and hot tub. Only thing was that when we checked in, they would not upgrade is even though we were Starwood members. Small problem, but not enough to not stay again. ",40
"Every year I must reserved Sheraton Macao Hotel  every time I could enjoy their  greatest and comfortable hospitality. The staff can provide the warmness services. Room is clean and the facilities are good enough to provide. By the way, they have to provide the front desk for the SPG members to check-in, this is the greatest arrangement.",40
I went here and overall hotel was fine but after going to casino here and in 3 others including venetian I can say that gambling in macao sucks. I miss vegas.  Macao is boring gambling. . No fun at all. Of the 4 casinos there was only one craps table. Everything is baccarat. .. high mins everywhere.  No drinks at tables just water and coffee.  No excitement or noise.  No fun.  Last trip here for me.  Will be in Vegas from now on. ,40
Good location and very convenient to go around Macau with Hotel own shuttle bus especially from and to airport . The food court at Level 3 serve a varieties of food and don't miss out the HongKong Wanton Mee and BBQ Goose Rice.The room is very clean and spacious. A lot of branded shops in the hotel and there is a bridgewalk to Venetian just located opposite the hotel.I would recommend this hotel to my friends.,50
"Check in took almost an hour. My cousin in the states prepaid the room. She sent the 3rd party requirements right away. At check in they told us that their accounts is on holiday. So, I have to prepay it again and that they would refund my cousin back. How ridiculous, finally the duty manager named Tracy came. She was cold, no smile at all and sound very abrupt. Her first words was, ""you can't show the credit card right?"".  I explained that it was not my point. She then asked me to show all the documents again, which I did. Finally, she let me go without paying again. Thank you for that.  At Check-out queue , the staff assumed that I will use my credit card for express check out. I told her I'm paying cash.  The front desk staff didn't even ask if I need a receipt, after I paid,‚Ä¶",20
It's my second time here and I must say I am sorely disappointed. We could see many people stranded at hotel lobby today 19/3 due to heavy fog as flighrts and ferries were canceled. We checked out of Galaxy and were ready to head to airport when we learnt that our flight was cancelled. We tried booking galaxy but they were fully booked. Then we booked Sheraton through booking.com for the same night. It was a Last minute booking. When we reached Sheraton at about 5.30pm the guy at SPG counter could not find our booking.we realised it could be due to delay in response time from booking.com hence he told us to wait and come back again.after some 15 mins we approached the counter guy( he is not a local guy) and he said he could not fnd the booking.he even suggested we call‚Ä¶,10
"It's extremely convenient to reach the hotel from Taipa ferry pier with the hotel's own shuttle (as is the case with most casinos in Macau). What put me off immediately after arriving at the hotel was a very smelly lobby and the long queues for check-in. The smell was artificially added and very strong (I am not even allergic). Luckily we found out that the rooms themselves did not have such added odours.   Staff at the reception is well-trained and take care of every little detail. In such a huge establishment they do not have the time to give a second thought to individual needs, however.  We stayed three adults in one room and got a comfortable extra bed in no time after arrival. Room service is very courteous and polite. We originally thought a couple could fit into a‚Ä¶",30

Although we were far from home, our stay at the hotel felt we were just at home. This was because the warm welcome we got from the hotel employees. We would like to specially commend Tysa and Cathy for the warm welcome and excellent service they had given us. Tysa is from the housekeeping Dept. and always saw to it that we have fresh towels, clean bed sheets, and that the room we stayed in was always clean. All these she did with a smile on her face.

She also saw to it that we are well‚Ä¶",50
"A very good Luxurious Hotel located right on the Cotai Strip where all the action is. The hotel is sprawling,high rise building  situated right in front of the Venetian. It has very good and cordial English speaking staff. Very satisfied with the services, amenities, breakfast, food in general etc. Location is also a very big plus point. There is an in house Casino on the Ground Floor. Highly Recommended. Free Wi fi only in common areas and not available in the rooms.",50
A very comfortable hotel with friendly staff. Toilet amenities comprehensive. Convenient location with free shuttle to piers. Shopping complex with varieties of food outlets to choose no matter high price or affordable price.,50
"Had a 1-night stay.  Experience was what you would expect from a prestigious hotel brand such as Sheraton.   Check in was rather quick with a huge check in/check out area, with enough counters so that guests were attended almost promptly.  A HKD or MOP 1,000 has to made as deposit, and as I paid in HKD 1,000 cash, i was suddenly worried thereafter that they would return me in MOP, which would be useless when I went over to Hong Kong the next day.  Hence, in the evening, I went again to the counter to the same service staff (a pity I can't remember her name now), she actually surprised me by addressing me by my family name.  This was indeed a good gesture from the service staff, which has, unfortunately, been missing from service lines through these years.   Anyway, so we checked‚Ä¶",40
"As an SPG member, we always stay at the Sheraton when we visit Macau. Excellent Hospitality - check-in hostess is always friendly and courteous. We always reserve a room with club benefits for the hassle-free convenience. Received surprised upgraded suite with entertainment room this time.Our suite was sparkling clean. Lounge hostesses are always friendly. ",50
"The room and bathroom is huge and tastefully done. They've got high thread count bedsheets and fluffy down pillows. The breakfast buffet has one of the widest spreads I've ever seen, and the quality is good. The staff is well trained and service is prompt and courteous. It's all good, but there's nothing to ""wow"" you. It's all you'll expect of a Sheraton. ",40
We were very lucky to get an upgrade to a family room. This was amazing for our little son. The hotel has a swimming pool that is heated up to 29 degrees and a well equipment gym. The hotel is very big and therfore feels a little cold. We were charged over 90 MOP for one cane of beer from the mini bar. ,50
We stayed 3 nights with our 2 young children. We all loved the shrekfast experience. There was lots of food options and photo opportunities. They made sure each visitor had a photo with every character and the characters were all really friendly.  The hotel itself was really nice we had a few minor issues with the toilet becoming blocked and our room key not working but these were fixed within minutes. We had a great night at the st regis bar part of the sands group (buy 1 get 1 free drinks 5.30 til 730 with free canapes). They were very accommodating to our young children and even gave them strawberries and marshmallows.  An overall great experience ,50
"OK, we won't return. It was my second and my boyfriend's first visit to Macau, and we were both disappointed in the state of and attractions in the region. But the hotel didn't do much to help. Even though it was still 28C and sunny, the pool areas were closed ""for winter"" - well, if you want to be a tourist destination, act like it. The breakfast ""lounge"" with space for several hundred people was gigantic, noisy and not well-equipped for being a lounge. But there was a lot to choose from! If we return to Macau, we will aim for staying on the peninsula itself, hopefully at the hotel school's pousada.",20
"we're staying here for 4 nights great room,facilities and everything that's true but on our second night we came back to the room and the keycard doesnt work we called the lobby and they had us wait for half an hour...yeh that was great and then our third day(today) they're doing the construction on the same floor as ours...what...? The smell of the paint the dust and even coming into the room so now I'm having a really BAD allergy (at least give us some notice instead of killing me this way) not to mention that my brother brings his 10months daughter here with us Thank you Sheraton great stay...",20

It is surprise that Sheraton upgrade our room to family suite. Kids love it so much, and thanks for the little cakes for my daughter's birthday. It is nice for family to spend the holiday here. Kids love the show, and there is kids corner at restaurant, parents able to enjoy the meal in more relax way~",40

We were there for our 28th wedding anniversary and we booked a club room with lounge access. Checkin was on the 4th floor and we were kindly upgraded to a suite. On arrival in the room the staff had prepared the bedroom with rose petals and a small welcome gift, a lovely touch. The staff at checking were friendly and helpful. The club lounge was probably the best for food we have experienced. It is almost like a restaurant in the evening. The club lounge is worth every penny, it's a must do.

With so many rooms, you cant expect good room service, we didnt mind.",40
"I just checked out after a two-night stay.  There were good and bad things about the hotel, but nothing that made it stand out as a memorable experience either way.    The shuttles to/from the ferry terminals and Sands Macau were nice and convenient.  Check-in and concierge staff were friendly and helpful.  Room rate was good.  The upgrade to the executive suite was nice.  I'm not sure when the Earth Tower was built, but the room furnishings looked looked worn and tired and the decor was a bit of a letdown considering how the property has been advertised.    Overall, I was very disappointed with the food and was glad I was able to find some inexpensive local restaurants in the historic centre and in Taipa village.  The ""Feast"" buffet dinner was 95%+ seafood dishes and breakfast‚Ä¶",30
"Have been staying in Sheraton whenever I visited Macau. This time round was no different. The room is spacious considering the money we paid.   It is near Venetian too and the hotel has a casino. Great restaurant in the hotel too. Similar to other hotels, transport is provided.",50
"The lobby was teeming with people wanting to check-in. It felt like lining up for a concert. We were in line for almost 3 hours! After spending two days at nearby Venetian Hotel, we find our room at the Sheraton kinda tight. We only stayed in the hotel for the Sheraton experience but Oh no... never again!  Room service was almost non-existent. Had to call reception and ask them to let Room Service return our call because no one was answering. I was already sleeping when my dinner arrived a little after 12mn.",20
"Affordable large rooms with great view of the Cotai strip.  The hotel is across the street from the three largest entertainment venues: the Venetian and City of Dreams to the North and Studio City to the South.  All are within 10 minutes walking distance.  The hotel is new enough that the rooms feel really fresh and clean.  The hotel shares a shopping/casino platform with the Conrad and Holiday Inn.  And the management is an extension of the Venetian.  There is also an enclosed bridge that takes you across the street to the Venetian.  Entertainment seems more oriented to kids, with licensed cartoons (Penguins, Kung Fu Panda, Shrek) the main theme.  The are two towers:  Sky and Earth.  Earth has the better views to the South,  Sky's views to the North are better, but partially‚Ä¶",50
"We stayed in a club room which was well worth the extra money. Our breakfast was included as was afternoon tea and a happy hour which consisted of drinks and a buffet that was amazingly varied and enough food that we didn't need to have dinner afterwards. The room was extremely spacious for 3 of us but the beds were a bit small, especially for 2 adults. The location was great with a casino and shops just downstairs and a covered walkway to The Venetian. Shuttle buses also made it easy to access other hotels. The staff were friendly and helpful.",50
"The Sheraton's Shrek-themed children suites are perfect for a family weekend in Macau. Essentially it is a King-sized room connected with a children's room that features a giant bunk bed, play table and other features the kids will love (like a TV close to the floor to lie in front and watch hours of cartoons!). The kids will also love the ""Shrekfast"" in the morning with all the obvious cartoon characters making an appearance. One of their outdoor pools is heated and hence you can even go for a swim in cold February! Location-wise, you're close to a lot of the other major resorts/casinos with plenty of family attractions around.",50
"The Sheraton is the largest hotel in Macau and one of the only truly Vegas style hotels, with access to gaming and shipping directly below. It's also one of the newest, so facilities are modern and well maintained. Standard rooms are quite large, trending towards executive size, but does are very affordable, so worth that bit extra. The breakfast buffet is incredibly diverse, offering options from around the world.",50
Great place very nice & comfortable. Sheraton has done a very good job maintaining its name to a high quality hotel. I've checked in to different sheraton hotel in different countries and was never disappointed. Excellent ambiance to welcome you after a long day of travel.,50
"Sheraton is very centrally located and excellent value for money.  Walkable distance to City of Dreams, Venetian, Studio City.  Connected to a shopping center where there are many restaurants and shops.",40
"Was in Macau with my family for the New Year break. Stayed at the Sheraton for 2 nights. It was very conveniently located with linkways to the Venetian etc. Check-in was long and slow due to the sheer crowd over the break. Breakfast was served in big ballrooms with sumptuous spread.  The casino itself looks very busy, not that I visited it. The rooms are clean and spacious, with a wonderful view as well. Would highly recommend this superb hotel for anyone who is visiting Macau.",40
"The room was nice.  I had a view to a construction site, so not very impressive.  The hotel doesn't have any place to buy water/coke after 11pm, which I think is unreasonable.  The Italian restaurant in the hotel was very good.  The gym was ok,  although much smaller than expected. ",30
"Booked the family suite which includes a room for the 2 kids. The booking I made included breakfast, Madagascar package... But for a strange reason, when we got to check in they advised that the room we booked did not include breakfast and we needed to pay an extra hk$300 per person for the breakfast. Which only means the room is now at HK$4,000/night (yeah right...) Anyway, I am not the person who argues and stand up to fight for what I think would just ruin my family weekend out...  Checked in went up to the room, and to no surprise, the kids room had no books nor board games, never mind the amnesty which they claim the kids would get at the checkin, they even emailed me asking for the names of my 2 kids and their ages... The wife got really angry, there is a limit after all‚Ä¶",10
"The Sheraton Macau, located in the Cotai area, is part of the massive integrated resort of Sands Cotai Central - nearly 4000 rooms divided into 2 blocks (Earth & Sky towers). There is a sizeable shopping mall within this resort and the Venetian shopping mall is across the street, connected by a pedestrian sky-bridge. The airport is just 5 minutes away ‚Äì there are free shuttles to / from the airport to the hotel. The downtown Macau is a 15 minute drive away.   Being an SPG member, we were able to check in at the SPG counter ‚Äì avoiding the massive crowds and long queues at the normal check in area. The staffs were professional and friendly.   The deluxe rooms are comfortably sized at 452sf but we opted to upgrade to a suite. It was worth paying extra for slightly more luxury and‚Ä¶",40
"Only stayed one night at the Sheraton but was really impressed. Got the ferry from Hong Kong and then took the free shuttle buses to he hotel (most of the ""top"" hotels are in the same resort so have provided free transport which will save you 50/60 dollars in taxi fares)  The hotel is part of a huge shopping/hotel/casino complex so took us a little bit to find where we had to go to check in. There were a lot of other guests that had arrived but the hotel had a lot of staff working to get everyone checked in - only took us  about 10 minutes which was pretty good. Once done, we had to walk about 5/10minutes to locate the lifts for our tower (there are 3 towers in total). My only minor issue was that it took much longer for us to get to our room once checked in - especially when we‚Ä¶",50
"Very nice experience as the room is well prepared. We did send our request before the stay and the staff in front desk handled it very well. This time we stayed in Sky Tower and the last time we stayed in Earth Tower. The decor in the room is a bit different but it is as good as expected--Large, cozy, and clean. The spacious room is really important for the travelers to take a good rest after a long journey or visiting the attraction. It is good that they can manage our room before 15:00 check-in. The cake from hotel is also very yummy! Thanks for the gift! We will definitely come again.",40
"I stayed in Sheraton Macao many many times. I like to write review here to highlight the improvement & appreciation to Guest Relation team. As usual I arranged a limo & associate to pick me up at Macau ferry terminal. After exiting the gate, Ricky Trinh (GR) greeted me immediately with a smart voice. Ricky has picked me before. He made some mistakes and I complained him after that trip. Surprisingly this time he apologised for his mistake (although I forgot detail). The GR team of this hotel is really serious in complaints & improvement. Having such smart greeting by Ricky, I felt personalised & he did a good brand ambassador in the ferry terminal.   After reaching hotel, another surprise to receive. It was the second day of Chinese New Year. Lots of crowds. I was surprised to‚Ä¶",50
"We spent 2 nights at this hotel just before Chinese New Year, we had a family illness the day before arriving at the hotel. The service and attention to making our stay was exceptional and the personal service of Fiona Lao and her team at the front desk was certainly world class, and this continued throughout our trip from all staff. The room we had was very well equipped and generous in size. We had dinner one evening at the Bene Italian Restaurant and this again was fine dining with excellent service. The hotel is very conveniently placed for other shops and entertainment. We cannot thank the team enough for how they looked after our needs.  Thank you",50
"I enjoyed my stay at the Sheraton.   I was pleasantly surprised with my room.   It was very comfortable.   I especially liked the French press.   The corridor was quite loud due to Mainland tourists, but the rooms are soundproof and this did not bother me at all once inside my room. The gym is nice.  There are about 20 Technogym machines, a couple of Smith Machines and a cable machine with chin up bar.   A couple of things would make this even a better gym.   There are only 2 benches for the free weights.   They need a couple more.   There is also a lack of mirrors.   I noticed people taking the weights into the yoga room and using the mirrors there.    The gym is open to outside membership, so it gets quite crowded.  I think they need more space and benches for the free weights‚Ä¶",40
"My young son is really happy with this trip. Love the parade,beautiful indoor garden with photo sessions with the characters , a big swimming pool , a great location to walk around and the dimsum. The downsides are more about the slow check in in the receptionist and the very crowded breakfast since this is a HUGE hotel with a lot of rooms. Hopefully the management can organize it better in the future",40
"Given that Macau is the las vegas of asia, expect the casino to greet you as soon as you enter the hotel.  The check-in process was quick and easy, the check-out process a little bit too easy - we just dropped off our room keys and that was it.  There was no opportunity if we were charged correctly or not.  The rooms itself were spacious and amenities were decent, nothing great but nothing bad.  Biggest disappointment was the distance from the hotel rooms to where the breakfast was being served - a good 10minute walk!  As well as the lack of cuisine variety within the hotel area.  Staff were helpful, but as English speaking tourists, there was still some difficulty communicating.",30
"I believe this is the largest Sheraton in the world and it is quite GRAND. There are Cotai shuttle buses that take you to/from the airport and it takes about 20 mins to get to this hotel (along with Conrad next door)  It's easy to get lost in the hotel, but check-in was quite efficient and swift. They have a separate desk for SPG members and the bed/room type I had requested prior to my visit was granted. Room was quite spacious and clean and the free WiFi worked surprisingly well for such a big hotel. You can easily explore Macau and get to old town by taking free hotel shuttles or taxis.   FYI- There's a small computer station by the check-in desk (it's inside the cafe by the SPG desk and kinda hidden towards the back) which lets you surf and print for free. If you want to‚Ä¶",40
The rooms are big and staff is very helpful. We left a watch in the room and realized it about 30 mins after checkout. We went back and were promptly issued a key and got the watch back! We had lunch at Bene. The service didn't impress us much.  Nice place to stay!,40
I stayed there a week ago with my fiance as by chance I saw the price was very reasonable among those 5 stars hotels in Macau during the Chinese New Year. The front desk staff Frankie and Shirley were so friendly and attentive. We got a very nice upgrade for our celebrations. Even Martin from IRD was very polite and helpful while we enquired. We had such perfect stay with amazing view from our room. We enjoyed the stay so much and feel relaxed with a hot tub.,50
"Lucky me! A friend of mine who booked the hotel room is a SPG member. When we arrived, we were told that we got upgraded to a suite! Yay.  The suite had a big living room with a dining table that could fit up to 5 pax, sofa & tv, 2 bathrooms, 1 walk-in shower, 1 bathtub, 1 audio-visual room that could fit up to 8 pax, 2 single beds. It was perfect because there were 5 of us altogether, so the suite was big enough for us to hangout.  When we entered the suite, there were already a platter of bite-sized cakes, small box of chocolates and a bottle of red wine, all on the house. It was surely a nice touch.  The service was great and I have to mention, the pillows are super comfortable, no neck pain the next day. Will definitely be back! ",50
"From Hong Kong, Macau is an hour ferry ride.  Stayed in this hotel for one night. A very busy hotel, totally ""grand""...packed with people.  I call it A City Inside Itself.  Huge hotel with lots of things to see...shops, restaurants, casino. Hats off to the room decor, free WIFI, very comfortable bedding and humongous bathroom.  My family and I will return and will stay longer. Just love it...",50
Very attentive staff and that can remember me. Free upgrade to Deluxe suite was a very nice gesture where we enjoyed the new experience of home. Hope we can stay there in the near future and visit the attractions and food in Macau.,50
"The location of Sheraton Grand is excellent if you want to stay in Cotai Central (which is the casino / entertainment district).  There is an interconnecting walkway (through many shops) to Four Seasons Hotel and then to the Venetian Hotel.  It does not have its own shuttle bus, but you can utilise the shuttle buses operated by other hotels to get yourself to and from the ferry terminal / airport (ie. There is a stop at Sheraton Grand).  What we found was that it wasn't so convenient to catch a free shuttle bus to do our sightseeing (where the old district is) - you effectively have to catch a shuttle bus back across the bridge to the ferry terminal and then catch a bus or taxi to your destination.    We (family of four) stayed in a family suite.  The room is effectively made up‚Ä¶",30

My oh my. Just dunno where to start. This is one amazing hotel and its HUGE. Check in was very slow. We had the family suite. Amazing room setup. It was a 2 bedroomed room with 2 bathrooms. The kids had their own room with a bunkbed and all kids stuff in the room. Kids were in heaven. A fully Shrek Themed room. Their bathrobes and toiletries all to detail of Shrek. The beds were super comfy and so were the pillows. Rooms were huge. Very clean rooms and bathrooms too were very spacious.  The sands cotai mall is within. Dont miss the Shrek parade at 4pm. Kids just love it. Across the street is The Venetian its also connected with a bridge. Round the corner is The City of Dreams.  Breakfast spread was really big and really good. If you with kids then The Shrekfast is a must to do. ‚Ä¶,50

I receive prompt reply and tremendous options from decoration and personalize package. I'd like to express my great appreciation to Rachel, Mandy, and Carlos. They are extremely helpful and friendly.

I went here after Venetian. It was a good place although they have a lot of things to improve. I really like the ambience of this place. They also offer free bus transfers from one hotel to another as well as going back to the airport.,40
Spent the weekend here in our first visit to Macau. Fantastic staff made us feel very welcome. Recommend the Club Lounge which offers happy hour drinks and snacks. Food selection very impressive. Rooms were gorgeous with large bathrooms and super comfortable bed. And a great location with connections to all the nearby hotels and casinos. Free shuttle bus from the Ferry terminal also. Highly recommended.,50
"The Sheraton at Cotai central lives up to it's reputation of a luxury five star and is a landmark in itself as it is the largest Sheraton in the world. The entrance itself is part of a mall ""Shoppes"" and once you enter you might have to look for the reception as it is huge. The mall itself consists of 3 floors and the area is never ending. One can easily get lost inside the mall and if it weren't for the signages we might never get back to our room. There are 2 towers, The Earth Tower and The Sky tower. Each tower consisted of around 35 floors so that made it a combo of 70 floors in total. The room was huge and bathroom was equally impressive. The casino is situated in the ground floor itself and one can make out that this is the mainstay of the hotel. Check in and check was‚Ä¶",50
Been here many times but my last visit was with my Mom and sister. Lobby is crowded most of the time. Mainly tourists. We liked our stay. They have many restaurants to choose from and it is connected to the Shopping Mall.,40

Relatively simple breakfast buffet offering although other cafe, restaurant and room service offerings are very good.  Good quality gym and sauna facilities and excellent free wifi across the property. Large size rooms for a very comfortable stay.",40
"We used an express checkout and later found in our credit card bill that the hotel overcharged us. We called the hotel, but the waiting was so long that we had to hang up. This on top of the very long waiting time for the check in makes us dissappointed in the hotel. ",10
"My wife and I stayed in December, the hotel is grandeur and luxurious in every sense. Rooms : Are spacious specially bathroom consisting bath tubs. View : Excellent view of pool and another hotel right in front of you. Service : Beyond description. Check in : A very long queue for check in, have to wait 10 mins for your turn. Should have provided lounges for people to sit. Check out : Hassle free and quick. Concierge : Was helpful and helped to book shows and guided us with places of interest in Macau. The good point is that every hotel lobby within the compound is connected with each other and travelling is so convenient. City of dreams is just a walk away from the hotel. Have a translator app or a book If you don't speak Chinese and Mandarin specially to hire cabs/taxi.",50
"We checked inJan 6 to Jan 10, 2016. There area a lot of Filipino Staff who are as always helpful and gave us directions and help to wherever we want to go in Macau. Check in at SPG counter was fast. The room is spacious, when we ask for an extra bed- the staff was so gracious that she never charge us anything.  The hotel is clean except that in the lobby the first day we were there smell fishy but later on during the night I think they rum their humidifier/deodorizer. Overall, I will stay there again. The staff are all helpful- I highly recommend it!!",40
"I booked an executive room with lounge access.  We also have a special breakfast room.  Food in lounge and at breakfast just average.  Even waffle-making is self service.  Coffee only came in a flask.  For a five star hotel, I would expect freshly brewed coffee.",30
"This hotel is massive (not surprisingly) but is clean and pleasant. The staff overall were very kind and helpful and it's located by loads of shopping (City of Dreams and Venetian) and right over a casino. The room was great for the price we paid, and the bathroom (especially bath) was a particular highlight. Was a bit disappointed with the time it took to check in, the concierge's knowledge (we had to ask another hotel to find the free shuttel bus) and that you don't get free water with the lunch buffet.",40
"I was planning a trip with my girlfriend to Macau in early December. I communicated with Sheraton's staff about my intention to proposal to my girlfriend during my visit.  They keep it secret when we checked in and the room happened to have an excellent view outside. The room was big, I believe I got a free upgrade. Inside the room was flowers, chocolate, a hand-written card congratulating us .......  The atmosphere was good and it did make our visit a memorable one. Hotel staff was helpful and give us great suggestions on experiencing the very local Macau. PR relationship was good and efficient when handling clients' special request. ",50
"It's wonderful staying in Sheraton, I love the family room, my family enjoy it so much! The hotel provide baby bed, steam sterilizer and  Bottle Warmer, it's very good for me! As a SPG member, I can also enjoy the fast check in counter",50

A fair walk to local transport into Macau township and make sure the bus from The Ferry drops u off at front door.The back door is a long walk.",50
"Although as a Gold member, it is very appreciated that my room could be upgraded as I requested. I hope I would be living in your hotel soon when I am on my business trip in near future. It's an amazing room provided by you.",50
"We just spent a weekend here. Second time. Last time was 2 years ago.  We picked the family suite - the kids liked their room. But not as much as the first time. Before the room had gummies, a variety of Xbox games. His time round there were no gummies and for the games you have to ask and even then they only provided Minecraft.   Room was good - clean and quite well kept.  Check in was smooth. Club lounge staff was friendly and efficient. Cherry was particularly helpful.  Club lounge was great during HH. Decent selection of snacks (but I recall 2 years ago they were even better). Likewise - selection of drinks was good.   All in all - very enjoyable. But somehow - I felt they were even better before.",50
"Who doesn't want to stay in a fantastic hotel at dirt cheap prices? Everyone does and I was one of the lucky few. One can get good bargains if one looks out on the websites giving various offers on hotels. One can book hotels at HongKong for stay at Macau if one is going to Macau from HongKong and it is advisable to book at HongKong because it will be cheaper. Macau is costly compared to HongKong though one would not face any problem with currency as they are at par with Chinese currency. If one is booking hotels at Cotai strip it is advisable to take the Cotai Jet to Macau from HongKong. It is easy to book at the HongKong Macau Ferry Terminal. One can book tickets online also.

We had held numerous birthday parties and dinners in Bene, Xin, Feast, and they turned out to be wonderful memories with the effort and attention paid by the friendly Sheraton staff.  Their rooms are considerably big and comfortable.  There are different level of Suites to choose from, so it gives us flexibility when it comes to budget.  I always recommend my friends from overseas to stay in Sheraton Macao and all of them are happy with the hotel.  I will surely recommend Sheraton Grand Macao to everyone who plans to come to Macao.

We stayed in club rooms which were okay but smaller than we expected for a club room and one of them stunk like smoke even though the room was non-smoking. We were on one of the higher floors and when we looked down out of the window there must have been a smoke vent there since there was a perpetual cloud of smoke below us. The views aren't that great since the city is quite polluted. This hotel did have the best bed sheets though!

Two of us booked two rooms and one of them was a club room so we could take advantage of the club lounge. It's about NZD$80/night more for a club room than a standard room but it was more than worth the spend. At NZD$40/person/night you get complimentary buffet breakfast in the lounge, complimentary dinner and drinks for 2 hours in the evening, afternoon tea and free non-alcoholic drinks any time.

With a closed door media room with a sound bar.   Loads of drawer & hanging closets. A powder room was an added luxury.   Only peeve was the long wait for hot water. It was cold.   Club lounge on L4 is huge. A lot offered during 5:30-7:30pm.  Breakfast was ok, preferred St Regis Macau instead. Staff @ club lounge very friendly & very hardworking. Kudos to all of them & Joe Huang. ",50
"We stayed here for 2 nights while visiting Macau since this is well connected and easily accessible to/from Cotai Strips. The hotel receives high footfall everyday, we found the service levels at the restaurant, room service and bell desk very good. There is an option of heated swimming pool as well.",40
"We stayed at Sheraton Grand Macu for 2 nights.Shuttle bus to and from taipa ferry terminal was there. Checkin was super smooth ( Hardly 5-7 mins) as being a SPG , they had a separate checkin area for us. Few days before our reservation we got mails from the hotel, informing about this privilege. Also they asked about special requirements if any. The hotel ambience is good. Their checkin desk executives speak clear english. We also took the shrekfast for the next morning and the kids ( and their mumma too) enjoyed it loadz (shrek more than the food!). There is a parade for kids at 4pm at the shoppes , kids loved that too! We had a deluxe Cotai view room with twin queen beds ( SUFFICENT SPACE FOR 2 ADULTS AND 2 KIDS) at the 24th floor. Room was spacious, clean, amazing coat view. ‚Ä¶",50
"Enjoyable stay with family. Booked two rooms which at check in asked if we wanted connecting rooms which was ideal for us.  As you would expect from a SPG hotel, this was no different with clean and spacious rooms, comfortable bed and a great shower,  Location wise, it's in Taipa on the Cotai Strip - pretty easy to get around using the hotel shuttles (Macau Ferry and airport).  Only negative was that check in was ridiculous with the massive queues and subsequent long wait to be served (despite being a SPG member).  Check out on the other hand was super quick using their express check out service - not at all technically advanced - just hand over your keycards and state which room you stayed in which is just noted down on a piece of paper (!) - apparently you can use this service‚Ä¶",40
"I checked-in and asked whether or not I have club access as a Delta Platinum Medallion member, I have previously been given club access at several other SPG hotels.  The front desk staff said no and asked if I know how many spg hotels there are and proceeded to insult me that I have not stay at all of the hotels so I cannot be sure that all of them grant club access.  I found his attitude not acceptable, a simple ""I am sorry but no club access"" should suffice, the rest was inappropriate.  Also, the hotel is huge and he did not tell us how to find the building so we ended up at the wrong building and had to ask to directions a few times.  The rooms and the fitness center were very nice, highly recommended for folks who are not there to gamble.",40
"Stayed for 4 days 3 nights. The room is clean and spacious. Second time staying at Sheraton. Like the place very much. Being a SPG member, I was able to check in at the SPG counter. The guest services ambassador, Jack Zhao, who checked me into the hotel is very friendly and helpful, making the entire experience very pleasant. Will visit the hotel again.",50
Stayed here with family with kids Satisfied experience enjoy our very clean and awesome rooms and very polite Staff thank for the experience. A lot of choices @ breakfast from continental to American breakfast. We will be back here thanks.,50
"We stayed here for 1 night. Having heard about the special promotion they had on, we decided to upgrade our room to the deluxe executive suite and boy did we not regret it! From the minute you enter, it felt like heaven. The room was very spacious and big enough for a family of 5. The room even had its own entertainment area which was awesome. It also had a living room area and a seperate dining table. A Nespresso coffee machine was also included in the room which was great. The bathroom was so spacious and the tv channels were great. We stayed on the 34th floor in room and got great views of The Venetian which was across the road. The bed was super comfortable and I had the best sleep there. We also got a late check out which was great.   We were checked in by a lady named‚Ä¶",40
Checked in to this hotel for a short holiday with family in December 2015. This is one of the luxury  hotel in Macau and under the Sheraton brand. The hotel and room are great and the food is excellent . The hotel  management  should look into the check in process flow.  The queue  is extremely  long and the service at the reception  is bad . The check in flow can be improved  further especially  managing the GIT  and FIT . The hotel is not located  at the city centre and you need to grab a taxi if you need to for shopping  or other activities .,40
"My review here is regarding what my wife, mother-in-law and brother-in-law comment to me.  The reason I ask their opinion coz my review/opinion might be a little bias for the property since im a hotelier working in a Forbe's five star hotel here in macao and rank as 1st or 2nd place most of the time since the opening last 2012.  So definitely, im not going to give any review coming from me directly coz my standard will always base on the hotel where I worked.  Here's their comments/reviews;  We stayed last December 24-25 for Christmas.  I book thru hotel website despite of the high season rate.  1 standard room with 2 beds.  I also registered in SPG which help a lot during the check-in process.  Seeing the queue in main lobby's reception that time makes me and my family happy‚Ä¶",30
"First of all, same as other comments, the queue for check-in was really long, I cannot imagine that I have to wait > 30mins even when I am in Gold/Platinum check-in area. I know the number of mainland China people were simply too many, hotel should arrange more staff to handle this. And as a result, don't expect much about upgrades because the occupancy of this Sheraton is really high.  Pretty good room size, quite comfortable for me, bathtub available even in normal room. In general it's nothing special for a normal room, a bit pricey so I would say there could be other options.  I stayed this hotel twice, the 2nd time I waited even longer in check-in. Because of my Platinum membership and I've informed them that I am going to hold a mini party so they upgraded me to standard‚Ä¶",40
"My third time staying at Sheraton Macau was under expectation. Quite disappointed with services. First, long queue and slow check in. Second, booking 2 non smoking rooms, but arranged 2 smoking rooms. Third, some bathroom amenities were missing. Finally, late check out request never guaranteed.   If possible, we will not stay here anymore since there are so many nice, new, and better price than this hotel.",20
"It is truly in the lap of luxury, where all the best brands of hotels are located with in walking distance. The hotel is huge, though we had to wait during checking in but the lines were fast moving. Great staff to help one around as it is possible to lose once way. The rooms are excellent, the breakfast buffet are superb. Indian food variety is very less for room service, but it s worth to check out the hotels.",50
"Was there in Dec 27 - 29 , 2015. Getting was breeze with the free buses. However , check in was a bit slow with long q. Staff was well trained but could be better if they can communicate clearer in English . Advise to avoid going to Macau / HKG during peak seasons such as year end or on China holiday. Your experience will not be good. TQ",40
"Best located hotel. Just in front of Venetian Casino and Mall. Most of best hotels are in the area. All the hotels are so well connected with each other. Indian food available at walking distance. Prefer high floor room to enjoy the view. Service, food and ambiance of the hotel is superb.",50
"My fiance and I were visiting her family in Macau and her brother booked us into the Sheraton Sands (Cotai strip). We stayed in a suite and it was a delight. Very spacious, comfortable, clean and quiet. Due to the holiday rush (mid December), there were lots of Chinese tourists, and on our 3rd day there was a Jeanesse conference so we were overrun by their attendees (including quite a few rude and rowdy middle aged women). Other than the other guests (luck of timing I guess), definitely a place to stay if you are visiting Macau",50
"I liked to enjoy our memorable dates in Macau Sheraton in these years, besides in two yrs ago,  in my wife's birthday holiday, we received a free birthday cake from Sheraton, in these yr my wife's birthday holiday, we have free upgrade to Executive room, in which there are dining room inside, large bedroom and large toilet , I also like the services in Sheraton and I will continue to enjoy my holidays in here- Macau Sheraton.",50
"Stayed one night in a club room at this hotel...when we passed by the lobby, the queue for checking in is unbelievably long...glad that we did not have to check in there. The hotel feels dated with strange smell, although I think it's pretty new when compared to some other hotels in Macau. It's huge but when you get lost you can't possibly find staff to help you. Anyway we made it to the club lounge. The check in was quick and the room was okay. However the evening cocktail session at the lounge was a mess. There were too many people in the lounge and we had to line up for 15 minutes to get food! People were rude and noisy, kids crying or running around, adults shouting to each other in the lounge and some didn't even bother to queue up for food. The presentation and quality of‚Ä¶",10
"My positive view of Sheraton has been destroyed. From waiting at hotel shuttle bus rank to airport for nearly an hour, around 3 pm on 3 Jan, a Chinese woman staff of hotel started shouting in Chinese and pulling my arms away from bus. I was severely confused as I don't speak Chinese she was pulling me repeatedly and no Eng speaking staff to assist. I had to get on bus otherwise I would miss my flight. Problem was randomly solved - just a cup of coffee that needs to be thrown but it was lost in translation and shouting. Another male non-Eng speaking Chinese staff in shuttle bus rank counter looked at us with unfriendly insulting eyes. Five-stars much? Don't think so!!!  Extra bed - waited until 9pm to receive my bed after repeatedly calling the guest services.  Room cleaning -‚Ä¶",10
Celebrated Christmas at Sheraton. The new rooms was exceptionally spacious. Loved the bathroom space too. My room view was overlooking the Venetian. Comfy beds with silk duvet covers. I had a lovely 2 nights stay here. There's many shopping outlets here connecting to the Venetian. It's massive! And sales going on at 50% during the Christmas. There's also free shuttle busses to get to town and free pick up/drop-off to and flo from the airport/ferry port. Concierge staffs are friendly and helpful. ,40
"Stayed here for 1 night because we had an early flight the next morning to Beijing and on to London. At over ¬£200 for a night the hotel is grossly over priced for the standard, the room was mediocre and the bathroom in places was disgusting especially in the shower the hotel is getting tired and worn out but they re still charging top rate. Would strongly advise against staying in this hotel.",10
"Had an amazing time at Sheraton.  Large and comfortable room with an abundance of amenities. Bathroom is very big and very clean.   The hotel has many facilities, with the gym being open 24/7. The trainer there is very nice and helpful. There was also a steam and sauna room inside the changing rooms, which was unexpected but also very nice.   There is a huge shopping mall under the hotel filled with many brand names and also a it is connected to the Venetian and 4-Seasons mall. Food at the cafeteria is average but there is also another food court at the Venetian mall.",50
"Just back from stay last week over New Year. This was my 3rd time back over 2 years. By far the most disappointing stay, particularly due to the Exec Lounge amenity which has deteriorated quite amazingly. The evening food in the lounge was awful and basically 'mall foodcourt' quality at best catering exclusive for Asian guests with virtually no international choice (which you would not expect at a Sheraton). Small children running around screaming pretty much destroys any semblance of ambiance too in the lounge. If you aren't fond of big crowds/queues, Macau is not for you and Sheraton would be your least preferred option.",30
"We had low expectations coming here due to the size of the hotel. There was a complimentary shuttle to the hotel from the ferry terminal. Upon arrival we were escorted to the Club Lounge for check-in. We stayed on 31st floor and had a good view of the Venetian. The Club Lounge was FANTASTIC! Breakfast was extensive, free happy hour cocktails 5:30-7:30 and canap√©s (literally didn't need dinner). The staff were so friendly and helpful, speaking great English. They were mostly Pilipino - we observed them to be far more friendly and helpful than the Chinese. The Pilipino bartender was a great guy. The gym is the best hotel gym I have seen in my travels. Highly recommend staying here in a Club Room. Central to all the casinos.",50
"big room, big window, excelent location, and all the facility that you can expect from a sheraton. eventhough you are not a gambler, you can enjoy all what they provide. the location also in centre of cotai, easy and convinience access to many neighboor shopping malls, hotels and of course casinos.",40
Booked an Executive Suite for my Family... We had a very enjoyable and relaxing stay. Well maintained and professional... It is the best Sheraton I have ever stayed at.  It had all the shopping brands in the shopping area... The pool was great... Breakfast was at Executive lounge... Which was only a turn down... Overall we were satisfied and would always come back.,40
"I stayed at this hotel for a few nights during my visit and I genuinely enjoyed the experience - it's well located, clean, has luxurious feel to it. The hotel is massive though, it's easy to get lost. The pools are lovely too even though can get slightly overcrowded. They are currently refurbishing/building some of the parts of the hotel, so it will only get better with the time.",40
"Second Best Hotel in Macau after Venetian..Centrally Located in Macau Taipa with Skybridge connecting Venetian and all group hotels of SPG are located in parallels..St regis , Conrad , Holiday Inn and Sheraton..Weather was chilled this time around in Dec..But as with Holiday rush season , had to wait for an hour and half to Check-in..Otherwise rooms are big and spacious and we got the rooms facing City of Dreams side which was not quite a view...Morning breakfast was a feast but as always with Macau hotels.Hospitality was strictly average..Shopping Area in central Cotai was also awesome..Will surely recommend this hotel to fellow travellers..",50
"After spending Christmas 2013 here on the way back from Taiwan, I convinced my sister and her family to join us on our way back from Hunan to thaw out for New Year's Eve.  We chose to stay in Club Suites which offered entry into the Club Lounge, a must in this massive complex and away from the madding crowd. The Sheraton Macau is huge but it is also quality.  A real treat was the International Buffet at the Feast Restaurant in the complex.",50
"Very good facilities but not as crowded as Venetian hotel across the street. Rooms are excellent quality and hotel is centrally located to all sites in Cotai. Club lounge is excellent with large offering of food and beverages.  The hotel is also very friendly for young families. Fitness center and swimming pool facilities are also good. We did not gamble in the casinos, but you can have your pick if you stay here.",50
"When I arrived the hotel lobby on 27 December, I was surprised so many people queueing in front of the front desk waiting for check in or check out. Lucky SPG member had a separate check in area and only a few people awaiting. I just wait for a few minutes for checking in. I booked 2 nights of the executive room and requested for room upgrade when checking in. The front desk staff upgraded my room to a deluxe suite. This is one of a benefit as a SPG gold member. The suite is very big approximate 125 sq. meter.  Including a sitting room, a dinning room and a bed room. One bathroom and  a separate toilet. The kitchen even had a big refrigerator and a micro oven. The amenities is luxury and the wifi working good. The sleeping quality was good too because of the comfortable bed and‚Ä¶",40
"I stayed at the Sheraton Macau for a night in mid December. Overall, it was a pleasant stay but nothing particularly memorable.  -  A shuttle bus is available from both Macau ferry terminals directly to the hotel. - The Sheraton is connected with two other hotels: Conrad and Holiday Inn and is part of the Sands complex. A footbridge connects the complex to the Venetian. Close by also is the City of Dreams (useful if you are visiting for the House of Dancing Water show). - The Sheraton has two towers so pay close attention to which you are staying at otherwise its a long walk - The room itself was large and clean but nothing special. - While the hotel website lists three pools available at the hotel, only one was in operation at the time of my stay. Pool is heated so can still be‚Ä¶",40
"I do agree with a few reviewers about the massive queue when you check in for the normal rooms. It is a massive hotel with over 3,000 rooms. However it is not as bad as Venetian next door. With conducted tour there it's like cattle market. Makes Sheraton looks down right quiet. If you have booked the club suites the hotel is on a whole separate level. Check in is on the 4th floor at the club lounge. Hardly any queue. We were upgraded to a deluxe suite . When we finally got there it was the most massive room we have ever stayed in. 1,200 sq ft. Separate tv room, two toilets massive and over the top. The hotel is so massive it took us two min just to walk from the lift to the room. The club lounge was also massive . Snacks during the day , happy hour and breakfast all inclusive in‚Ä¶",50
"If planning to go to Macau, you will be better off staying on the Cotai strip as the ambiance here is a higher class than what you will find downtown old Macao. For value of money you cannot get anything better!  If possible try booking your rooms a week before on booking.com as you will probably get a better deal.  Lobby = welcoming and nice ambiance   Rooms = clean, big, warm and welcoming with good views on either side of the building.  Facility = internet was good , gym and swimming pool was also good, changing room however is mediocre as it was understaffed!  Service = great service all round!  Sheraton maintains their standard and is true to their name, there is no doubt I would be coming back and staying here again! ",40
I stayed during the 1 few days before New Year and the lobby and bell drop off for luggage were like a zoo with very long lines and people occupying every open space.   They shouted check in at 3!  So we had to store our bags.  But check out was at 11 the next day.  Other hotels in Macau were much more sedate and well organized during the same period.   Obviously under staffed at the bell desk and check in and housekeeping or they could be like other hotels.  The rooms are small - they look like a standard city hotel or even smaller.  Don't feel you are at a posh casino resort.   The beds are comfortable with good sheets and the air conditioning works well and blackout curtains cover the light well. The rooms are quiet.  So sleep quality is good.   Restaurants:  The shopping‚Ä¶,30
"The good... - Our deluxe room was comfortable and look fairly new - Convenient for shopping if you like to shop for expensive designer goods - Free WiFi  The bad .... - Room smelt of cigarette smoke when we first got in. Had to ask for it to be sprayed with air freshener - If you go out in the morning and expect your room to be clean when you get back, you will be disappointed. The room is not cleaned up until 4 or 5 pm - The Guest Service number is frequently not picked leaving you more frustrated - No simple inexpensive shops or supermarkets around the area  Will probably look for other hotels if we decide to come back to Macau",30
"Was there on 28Dec 2015 in the morning at 11+ in the morning. But we're told we have to wait till 1pm to check in.. To our horror, there was a long Q. It was an hour wait just to check in. We were surprised that they didn't analyse their bookings and made better planning for the crowd.  On other matters: most service personnel weren't conversant in English. So it was really difficult getting help around. Majority of the hotel guests were from Mainland China and Hong Kong. Perhaps the hotel management could consider a counter for International visitors so that we could get appropriate help. The saving grace was the house-keeping service. The rooms were kept clean with all amenities topped up daily.",20
"We (family of 4) booked a deluxe twin room with 2 double beds. However, the two beds in our room were smaller than expected, and could barely fit 2 people each. The room was also very cramped, with little free space, especially after we had housekeeping set up an extra roller bed. Additionally, for the entire duration of our stay, housekeeping kept preparing the room for only 2 people (e.g. we were always only provided 2 sets of toiletries). This meant that we had to ring housekeeping every night to get 2 additional sets of everything. However, the rest of the service staff were friendly and very helpful when we had difficulties finding the boarding points for the different shuttle services.  We were lucky that the queue at check-in wasn't very long and we managed to check-in‚Ä¶",20
"When it's a SPG hotel you kind of takes some things for granted. Sorry to say, I did not exactly feel the love despite being a member. the check in took ages. all the spg cards etc are of no great use. the long wait I think is a known issue which is why they have some balloon creatures at the reception to humor children while you wait endlessly. all this after booking in advance. these small things do dampen your spirits when you arrive to a new place with limited time in hands. after paying a premium you kind of assume things will be hassle free. not all the time i guess.  The hotel room charges are on the higher side (obviously) but the service etc did not match the charged premium. If you were to sit in the room with closed curtains and order in-room dining then I would rate‚Ä¶",30
I stayed in the Sheraton twice over the course of the last two years and enjoyed my stay both times.  The hotel is much more accessible than the Venetian where every corridor seems to miraculously lead back to the casino.  The rooms I had were clean and had a good layout and design as expected of an international hotel of this standard.  I especially like the large bathroom.  The hotel has nice promotions involving the Dreamworks characters such as the Kungfu Panda Academy and Shrekfast which is great for families with little kids.  While the check in time was a bit long due go the huge amount of guests I generally found the service adequate at all times.  There are good package deals available for the Sheraton.,40
"We stayed at the Sheraton Hotel when we went to visit Macao and our overall experience was good.  Our experience: -There is a shuttle bus from the airport to the hotel which is free -The hotel is massive and have pretty much has everything you need - shopping, restaurants, casino etc. -We opted for a club room which means check in is on the club lounge. No queue when we got there and we were provided drinks in no time. We were also upgraded to an executive suite which was a nice surprise - we were on level 32; -The room was very modern and had a large bathroom complete with a separate toilet, shower and a big bath. There is also another toilet for guests and a separate lounge area; -We asked for a room with a Cotai view and our request was granted;  -My partner enjoyed the gym‚Ä¶",40
"We just came back from a family trip to the Sheraton Macau. In a nutshell, it was a frustrating and horrible experience and we will never be back.  From the unbelievably long check in queues (even for the SPG counters where we had to wait close to 45 mins with only 4 people in front of us) to the seemingly ignorant staff and poor service (we had booked 2 rooms - one deluxe room and one family suite and long requested these rooms be close together as possible. Whilst checking in, we enquired whether this was available, and the lady said she couldn't find any Deluxe Rooms that were ready on the same floor as the Family Suite.

The hotel is at a great location with free coach service from the ferry terminal.  The hotel has a huge room count. When I reached the hotel there were at least 20-25 standing in the que to check in. This does not leave a great first impression. However the staff is efficient andi was checked in within15 mins of waiting.  The room s are nice and spacious. Well connected to the Venetian and the malls.  Great Casino though did not spend much time there. Good staff and efficient room Service. ,40
"Quite nice hotel but long Q to check in, its take about 30 min to get a rooms, but the room, amenities staff are nice.  If dont want to buy a water go to the casino to get it for free. And also have a free shuttle to many place. One of my recommended place to stay in Macau",40
"This hotel has nice facilities but the service is poor and significantly lower than my expectations. Let me share with you three incidents. First, my five-year-old son lost his bag on the shuttle bus. My wife immediately went to the bus bay. The staff were cold and unfriendly, with a substantial ""none-of-my-business"" attitude. As a result, she was told to go to different places, despite that a simple phone call was all they needed to do to help us. Second, we went to check out dining at Palms. When we asked for a  menu, the waiter produced a copy rather reluctantly with a stiff face. He then looked away from us, to make it obvious that he didn't want to be bothered with questions. Lastly, the bell boy, Rohene Leo, I asked him about where to board the bus to the airport, which i‚Ä¶",10
"We stayed there for two days. It was very nice hotel with good facilities. It was enjoyed by every family members. In breakfast though there was large variety but for vegetarians very few items. In all, hotel was good but only draw back was that they deposit security money even having booking through tour package.",40
"I've stayed here twice. The big negative is the queue for the front desk - the wait time can be at least an hour. I don't understand why they don't hire more front desk staff. The rooms (especially the suites) are very comfortable, and the staff are very attentive. Note this hotel is connected to a number of other hotels, so there are many restaurants available. The gym is very good.",40
"If I had to choose between Vegas and Macau I know which one I would choose.  The hotel is lovely, but the experiences are for hard core gamblers. Coaches take you to any casino for free (just have to line up)  We were lucky to go to the Macu Grand Prix which was a lot of fun",30
"I really want to give this Sheraton a 4.5, wish they would let me.  It was very impressive and really nice.  Service was great.  Having the casino there, which was not run by Sheraton by the way, was a plus.  But it is just a hair short of blowing me away which I need to give a 5.  First off, if you are an American reading this I have a few suggestions.  First, don't go to Macau to gamble unless you really know how to play Baccarat.  Its pretty much the only game you'll find.  Second, this is trying to be Vegas, but its not, close.  Shopping yes, food yes, gambling yes, shows sort of, Sin City yes if you speak Chinese.  If you want to see the Portuguese old town just go to Lisbon, a thousand times nicer and way better food.  Oh and you will be the only white person in town if‚Ä¶",40
"I arrived about 1700 and it was chaos.  There were 17 check in stations open, but service was very slow and it took nearly 45 minutes to check in.  The room was very spacious and the bathroom was a good size, with beautiful marble and lovely fittings.  View was of a construction site next door.  Breakfast was beautiful, with a huge selection.  Going through the foyer, with a myriad of tour groups, all talking at the same time made it seem like bedlam.  Proximity to the Venetian was good if you wanted to take a walk. On registration, I had to pay a hefty deposit for the mini-bar.  I was not impressed the next day to find out that I would have to wait two weeks for that to be recredited to my account. Overall, a nice hotel, and I would certainly stay there again.",40
"I have been in Macau several times and it is very nice to stay in Sheraton this time! Staff was helpful and professional. The room is spacious and view is not bad with big Window. The location is great! Although you need to walk for a while via inner bridge , it is convenient and good for shopping and gambling. The stay is kind of flawless! ",50
"I stay in there on 25th, actually the room price and quality are acceptable, but compare with my friend's room........it's worse.  My friend stay in Conrad, beside Sheraton, the room price is same as me, but he can free upgrade to king suit, X'mas gift, but I have nothing.  The funny thing is it has a SPG member counter,  it is separate with normal counter and have a long queue. So I guess maybe go to SPG side easy to get free upgrade and early check in............finally, I was foolüòí  In honestly, he room is fine, has a large bathroom, comfortable bed.",30
"I had no idea I was staying at the Sheraton because when I booked they said something like ‚Äúhay lay doon‚Äù in Chinese so I thought it was going to be Hilton or something.  Anyway, found out it was the Sheraton which is a popular pick for bloggers in Hong Kong.  The hotel was quite nice, it was clean with a nice bath tub. Although there was a long queue to check in, there had fruit infused water for people to drink.  Checking in was a waste of time because there were so many people which means you lose some hotel time.  The quick check out was good because you don‚Äôt need to queue.",30
"been stayed in Sheraton Macao for many times and it does not disappoint me for the price paid. I reserved 3 rooms this time and 1 room with club access. Club lounge was great in service and food and drink quality. Check in staffs were exceptionally great, patient in locating the best rooms for us. Room was clean and the maids are friendly with a smiley face. overall services provided have been flawless! I look forward to another stay in the hotel!",50

Even though the family rooms were designed more for families with children we found that the room lacked the amenities for them.  1. No Cartoon Network in English( Mandarin only) 2. Wii did not work. Had to call up and it took over 2 hrs until it was replaced. 3. Children's room service food inedible. If you were planning to book this room type for a family with children than I would recommend maybe booking a suite at The Galaxy as their rooms and facilities are more well suited.",20

But food court are full of Chinese food and quite inexpensive too.   Gaming hall are separated from the public but easily accessible.   Lovely weather (15-17C). Walking distance from the Sands(hotel), Hard Rock Hotel, Venetian etc....",50

No recognition of SPG status other than you get to wait in a different line to check-in... and they are so rammed that you are asked not to even stay with your partner, they want the queue to look smaller so it is one person only. Enough said really... nothing more than a massive block in the middle of nowhere. We wandered out later that night and aside from the collection of drunk Mainlanders arguing, found nothing open and were grateful for a little convenience store a few blocks down in another hotel. I guess this is progress... a hotel devoted to gambling and a particular clientele. Numbers win over character and quality.",30
"Even though I didn't much care for Macau as a whole, I can't fault the Sheraton for that. Spent one night in a spacious room on the 21st floor. Room was modern, clean, and comfortable with good wifi. Check-in took about a 15 minute wait. Would have liked to check out the pools, but the weather wasn't cooperating for that. The whole area is very expensive, and even McDonalds has jacked up their prices significantly. The free shuttles were nice and all I needed for getting around Cotai and Old Macau.",50
"Location and accessibility to ferry terminals, airports and main attractions were great. The room and bathroom were spacious and comfortable. Service was impeccable. As my hubby told them that it was my birthday, they arranged for a birthday card and madelines to be sent to the room. Their madelines were the best I have ever eaten!",50
"Back to this hotel after a so so experience earlier this year. As a SPG gold member, got upgraded to the newly opened executive deluxe suite. What a surprise! The whole family loved it. Located on the top two floors, very quiet with nice view. Very spacious, full amenities, among the very top class in Macau and in the world. Service is excellent too. Highly recommended!",50
"A nice weekend break with the family suite. Two kids, 7 and 5 loved their room which makes it so easy. They also have the Shrekfast for kids - but make sure to book early as it is popular (we didn't). If you live in HK or nearby I would recommend a short break, and with the shopping it makes a surprisingly painless Christmas shopping weekend. Can also take he kids to qube which they love.",50
"I stayed for 2 nights on a business trip on 1st and 2nd December. As a travel agent I was able to inspect the various room types, all of which were beautifully furnished in contemporary neutral shades.  I was staying in a club room on the 30th floor, the rooms have dedicated lifts which eliminate the constant stopping at each floor which often happens in large hotels, our lift expressed past all 26 floors before servicing any floors so you never had to wait long for a lift - there are banks of 6 lifts dedicated to differentt floors throughout the hotel. The first thing you notice us the sheer size if the foyers and atriums, there are also escalators to various public floors.  Beneath the hotel is a large upmarket shopping mall on two levels and this is also where the daily dream‚Ä¶",50
"This is one of many high-rise hotels in the Cotai strip between Taipa Island and Coloane Island.  All of the hotels feature high-end shopping, gambling casinos, and restaurants.  It looks a lot like the Las Vegas Boulevard strip in Nevada.    The hotel is oriented toward tour groups and people who are interested in gambling and shopping.  But, as we discovered, it can also be a good location for non-gamblers.  There is frequent service by local buses on the strip.  If you learn to use the buses, it is easy to travel to Coloane or Taipa or Macau for day trips.  A stored-value card can be used to pay the bus fare, so there is no need to worry about what the fare is or having the exact change.  We used the buses numerous times for trips to restaurants in Coloane, visiting the small‚Ä¶",50

"Okay so my first trip in Macau was definitely a memorable one for the reason that my family and I got to stay at the Sheraton. Although we weren't really able to maximize all the amenities in the hotel (I wish we had 3 days to stay at the hotel) since we had to leave for HongKong after the 2nd day it was still a great experience.   Their staffs are very accommodating despite the language barrier (although everyone thought I was Chinese), the place is huge and you can just shop and dine at the adjacent stores and restaurants. Too bad we werent able to dip in their pool and avail of the in house massage (too much itinerary for the day)  The room itself was very spacious and very cozy. We really had a good nights rest when we were there.   When talking about price it is for me‚Ä¶",50
We travelled over from HK to stay at the Sheraton Tower for a night to watch the House of Dancing Water (also wow).  The large rooms are superb with attn to every detail and the service excellent. Menus all great and good value. Cannot be faulted I would fully recommend.,50
Hotel is new and convenient from the ferry terminal as there was free shuttle service provided. Was reasonable priced for a luxury hotel in Macau. I had a pleasant surprise when the service officer(Chris Sun) at the check-in counter had upgraded my room to family suite. Room was extremely spacious for my family with kids. It was very thoughtful of him. The kids had a great experience and enjoyable stay in Sheraton Macau.  Another officer also made an effort to call up during evening time to check if we are fine. Housekeeping was prompt and cleanup on time.  Thanks to Chris and staff of Sheraton!,40
"Hotel is new and within the Cotai Strip. Hotel provide free shuttle to Macau City Centre at Sands Casino. Next to the hotel is City of Dreams where they also offer frequent free shuttle to Macau City Centre. Venetian, City of Dreams, new resort - Studio are all within walking distance. Rooms are nicely decorated and spacious. However, the pool is a little small. ",50
"This is a mammoth 4000 bed twin tower hotel in the Cotai Central area. Should really have been run as 2 separate hotels for optimum efficiency and service.  Check-in: Massive lines, but fortunately, being a SPG member, I was able to check in in a dedicated member area. Still had to wait a while, but it would have been faster than the snaking queue at the main check in counter. Staff at the SPG desks were friendly and helpful. The experience was let down by the fact that I was double charged for the security deposit.  Room: Hotel elevators do not have secured access to guest room floors, which is surprising as this is a relatively new hotel.  The room was large, clean and had all the usual amenities.  I had booked a room for 3 persons, but everything in the room was in pairs. I‚Ä¶",30
"Being regulars in Guandong, Hong Kong SAR and Macau SAR, we have developed a habit of ending all our trips, leisure or business, in Macau and our go-to hotel is the Sheraton Macau. The fact that this hotel is the largest Sheraton in the world and probably one of the largest anywhere is secondary to the fact that it is probably (good money on this bet) the best managed gigantic hotel in the world. Personalized service, they knew us and often gave us the same room when they can. That makes MY WIFE their ally and in that situation, I am only too delighted to oblige. You get good traffic in the Sheraton Cotai, multiple lobbies, pick-up points, hotel staff deployed across the facility - the place hums. We enjoy the buzz. It's there in the lobby and mall complex but when we step into‚Ä¶",50
"Booked Sheraton for two days for my parents and sister and they loved it. Now even when they are back they are still praising the staff, hotel and really good services they provided. They stayed in a club room so check-in and check-out was a lot easier. For the normal rooms check-in queues we really long it can take 30 to 45 minutes. Great hotel to stay in Macao will love to visit again. ",50
"It was a very pleasant and memorable stay experience even  though we check in late in the evening and had to check out by 11.00 am the next morning due to some site visiting engagements with friends who are also staying in the same hotel. The room is very well equipped and furnished and more than adequate to meet our needs. This review may be brief but rest assured, it was very clean, neat and accomodative! The hotel staff are polite and very helpful as well.   The only minor set back was I smell some tobacco stench along the corridors leading to my room which is a non smoking room.",40
"For the final port of call on our honeymoon, we chose to stay at the Sheraton Macau.  I didn't know much about the city whatsoever apart from it featuring briefly in the 1974 Man With The Golden Gun James Bond film.   Of course, things have changed since then and Macau is a vastly differently place, not least because it is home to the ""largest Sheraton in the world"".  The room we were given was phenomenal. I used and SNA and was upgraded to an executive suite which was as nice as any I've ever had in Vegas with a dining room, media room, and two bathrooms. The place looked to have been newly decorated and overall was exceptional with lavish decor and all-round quality. Me and my wife were impressed.  We were also impressed by the special honeymoon welcome we received its rose‚Ä¶",50
Booked for 3 days and 2 nights. Staffs are very friendly and accommodating even there's a language barrier. There's no shortage of night life and shopping.  Every hotel are connected to each other plus the convenience of riding the free shuttle to the destination you want to explore. All in all we enjoyed our pleasant stay here.,40
"Location was great - no doubt but too many people on the lobby which I didn't really enjoy. the swimming pool was nice but it seems that people from the Public could go in. at the check-in counter, I did wait for a while before reaching to the counter, I guess it was around 3pm where all travelers were waiting for the check-in time.",40
"I stayed at this new hotel and manage to get a discount rate of 700hkd per night, and at first I though the hotel would be only 3.5 stars standard.  to my surprise the room is huge and it is a well designed room with a king size bed.  The furniture inside the room are high quality.  the Itanlian restaurant are well design and with a great selection of food.  For the swimming the water is too cold and not what they said 28 degree. However, the pool attendent is very thoughful as soon as he sees me with a infant he immediately tell the engineer to heat up the pool and jacuzzi.  With his kind effect instead of giving non sense excuses, this make  my stay so much pleasant even means we dont get to use the pool. Overall, a good stay.  will go again.",50
We have a wonderful stay here for 2 nights. Hotel is located near Taipa temporary ferry terminal and regular shuttle bus to/from the hotel by Cotai sands shuttle bus. By staying at the club room is really good! Fuss free check in by their wonderful staff Ms Jean Wu. She has good knowledge of her work and upon registration she invite us to the lounge for the happy hours while she has arranged the bell boy to bring our luggages to the room. The club lounge really big and has big capacity of seating and good selection of food like a mini buffet and lots of alcohol to chose during the happy hours. Morning breakfast is tasty and good spread of western and local food available here. Really worth paying extra for the club lounge access! If u are here for gambling the casino is right‚Ä¶,50
"Me and my friends stayed at Sheraton, Macau in November 2015 and truest us it was a pleasant stay. Room is having all modern amenities with comfort bed. they are having WIFI router inside the room so you will get good connectivity. They are having good CASINO.  All things were good except their towels, Towel in my room was torn, I asked to room service but as usual they don't understand English :(",50
"We booked Sheraton hotel because this was one of the few hotels with decent size family rooms and facilities for young children. However I got a little worried after reading so many negative reviews on this hotel, especially on the check in and check out process. I got myself mentally prepared for the worst when my family of 5 arrived.   I agreed that the lobby was like a fish market but I think the hotel staffs did very well in managing the checking in and out, and deposit of luggages efficiently.   Given the large number of guests they need to handle, there may be lack of personal touch. There is no porters helping us with the luggages or leading us to our room but this is fine for us. We managed to find our way in the big hotel with clear signage and helpful staffs we meet‚Ä¶",50

"Book a suite & club room for family holiday of 6, on arrival to lobby, was usher to ""SPG Club"" check-in queue. I reiterated to the usher/security that ""are you sure this is the right queue for club room guest"" - and he kept saying yes.  Fine - I queued. There were at least 5 check-in counter/staff, so I guess it would be a breeze, then to my dismay, Gold/Platinum members were served first while those on queue just had to wait and wait.  After my check-in was completed after 30 mins of queue-ing, was given a leaflet of 'club benefits' - and what does it say? Club Guest should have check-in at their club, and there weren't anyone.

If you are an SPG member or wanna be one, then look no further; go for it - the largest Sheraton worldwide.  Everything was perfect for our two-day trip to Macau.  Prompt check-in/check-out. That was an advantage of being SPG member ;)  Perfect location. Hotel Venetian was two shades away from the hotel. The beautiful building could be seen from the room. Hotel Wynn on the other side.

House keeping is also excellent as they will do twice a day.ensuring that the room is tidy and replacing towels and mineral water.

"I suspected that the Sheraton Macau was a well managed hotel by the emails that their guest relations people sent to me in the weeks prior to my arrival.  The first email, about two weeks before my arrival, wanted to make sure that the bed arrangements (there were three of us staying in the room) were adequate.  The second email, a few days before my arrival, asked whether I had any special needs that the hotel should be aware of.  It's important to note that these were not pushy sales emails that wanted me to book spa appointments or upgrade to a more expensive room.  These were genuine emails where the staff really just wanted to ensure that my arrival would be smooth and my family's needs would be met.

My daughter was so happy running around in the spacious suite.  Additional to this, when I returned from dinner, they sent me a box of madeleines as birthday gift.  Also, a baby bed was setup for my daughter.    Overall speaking, the staffs are attention to details and very considerate, make you feel like home and you will keep returning to Sheraton.",50

It has a good choice of restaurants and shops locally and the casino is fairly low key if you're not interested in gambling. I would happily go back.",40

Bene Italian ristorante is really good especially their Pastas and Bread,  also the service.

This is the largest Sheraton in the world (as of 2015) and part of the Cotai strip hotels. We were upgraded to a great corner suite. All the public spaces were quite clean (we did not notice anything broken or cigarette butts and such) and people were nice and friendly throughout, even the guys who do the room.

"i stayed just one night from 12-13/11. as expected, the room is up to standard, location is fine. but what amazed me was the huge group of china tourists crowded in both front desks to check in!! this seems to happen everyday! i queue up to check in for 45 min!  this phenomenon was not observed in other neighborhood hotels. i felt a bit uneasy when queue up among all these mainland people, coughing, speaking very loud on cell phone around you, next to you and appeared as if they did not understand the meaning of staying in a queue.....i will certainly choose another hotel next time to avoid this suffering.  the Gym was far away from my room and easy to get lost on the way.... one good thing is the speedy check out system...otherwise cannot imagine!",30
"It has free shuttle service from airport to hotel. The location is great since it is within walking distance to nearby hotels such as Venetian, City of Dreams, Hard Rock, Studio City, etc. There are lots of shopping and restaurant options inside. Stayed in the Executive Suite for 7 nights with access to the club lounge. The room was spacious and very nice. It has a living area with separate bathroom, a sofa bed, TV and closet. The main bedroom had a very comfortable King size bed. The main bathroom was awesome! It has a bathtub, dressing area, standing shower room with a bench, the closet with the vault. The staffs are very efficient and room service/housekeeping was fantastic.   Thanks very much to Ms. Kristine Flores and Mr. Jim Menasco for our stay in Sheraton",50
"I spent 3days in Macau and 1 night in Sheraton.  This was to celebrated my husband's birthday.  I appreciated the hotel upgraded me to Family suite and the complimentary gift.   However, what made me so impressed was the integrity of the staff!  I checked out at the Sheraton and went to check in Holiday Inn immediately.  Afterward, I found my trouser was left in the room at Sheraton and came back to Sheraton 2 times in next day to ensure if it was possibly a different person would kept my trouser.   What the answer I got was ""It was not found."".  I was so disappointed cause it is the 5 stars international hotels group but some of their staff are dishonesty.   My trouser is not a famous brand nor a high value but why its staff are unreliable?   It was definitely in my black list‚Ä¶",30
Thanks Chris Lum for making our stay in Sheraton wonderful and for upgrading our room which was initially a single room twin bed to a family room as we have a kid with us as well despite being a 1 night in Macau before we leave for Hong Kong. Thanks! Your consideration for our stay here is appreciated and I would definitely return again.,50
This is the 3rd time to stay in the Sheraton Macao. I return to this hotel because of it's location and facilities! The most important reason is because of the high quality of service that I received from the courteous Sheraton team! I'd like to highlight Amy as she looks after us very well on my every stay! I will return to Sheraton in my future visits to Macau!,50
"It was a smooth check in. The counter asked for the same card that was used for booking the room. We got the room in Sky tower 2. The way towards our room is filled with boutiques and high end shops.  Our room is awesome! The room is romantic! its about 40 sqm room. King size bed, with duvet covers, 4 pillows, and literally a bed of roses. We notified them that we are honeymooners, they welcome us with greeting card, a box of Sheraton's macarons, and a bed of roses. yes, its perfect! :)   Toiletries? You cant ask for more. there are 3 tissue rolls, soap, bath gels, conditioner, shampoo, comb, sanitary bag, heavy duty hair dryer, 4 kinds of towel for each guest, thick robe, and slippers!   Vault is easy to use. MIni bar is provided. Cable TV has ample numbers of English channels.‚Ä¶",50
"I am an SPG member and booked for myself and family. I also requested a wheelchair for assistance for my spouce and a room near the elevator to avoid the long walk in this large hotel. I had to stay back in Hong Kong and my family went directly. They reached at 3pm at the hotel with the Reservation detail. Meanwhile i had phoned at 3.30pm to enquire if they checked in and when informed room not occupied i was a bit worried. I informed Guest relations and reservations on the phone that my family will be checking in and i will come later. They said noted and i also reminded about room near elevator and wheelchair, again said request there and noted. I made a total of 4 calls between 4 & 7pm and till that time not checked in. Unfortunately my wife had a HK phone which was not‚Ä¶",10
"Great hotel with awesome facilities and a good location. My best tip would be to pay extra for the club lounge privileges. Buffet breakfast and dinner with free drinks at happy hour saved us a bucket load of money! The casino is a decent size but be aware the gambling ages have just changed to 21 which was unfortunate for one member of our party... Also located in a shopping mall, however the Venetian mall is just a short walk away and much bigger",50
"As soon as we were leaving the airport, we were relieved to see the hotel shuttle ready to leave. The check in was not as crazy as expected since it was absolute mayhem in the lobby, huge crowds coming in and out.  Since we were with our younger boys, they gave us the Kung-Fu panda room...my kids didn't want to leave the room.  Breakfast was not really enjoyable, since it's mainly Asian breakfast but it was manageable. ",40
"Our first impression of Sheraton Macao Hotel was too crowded; there are so many people in the lobby area and even with so many people service is above average.  Luckily as we are Starwood members we were checked-in in the Club Lounge with less people.  The room is nice, clean and good in size.",30
"I highly recommend this hotel for a Macau trip. I have stayed there already several times and I will always come back since it offers a great value for the price, especially comparing with the other hotels around, which are much more expensive.  It has the perfect location at the Cotai strip since you can easily visit the other hotels/ casinos by walking. The rooms are spacious, super clean and just perfect. The bed is magnificent. The sheets are so soft that you just do not want to leave the bed. Unfortunately, the price does not include breakfast, which is common in all the hotels in Macau. But there are plenty of places where you can have breakfast, such as Pacific Coffee. Since I stayed there already several times, I noticed some two minor downsides: - The hotel does not‚Ä¶",50
"This is our first time to stay at Sheraton suites. With the promotion rate, we were satisfied with everything! The room is spacious and well-equipped. We especially like the little pantry near the sitting room where we can enjoy a cup of coffee or tea while watching TV or enjoy the nice Cotai view   The  bathtub which comes with Jacuzzi function as well as the OSIM foot massage machine in the master bedroom are the add-on to the basic amenities, and no need to mention the comfortable (as usually) beds",50
"I stayed at Sheraton Macau for 3 nights. We ordered coffee capsules which was scheduled to be delivered to us at the hotel during these 3 days. As we went with a group tour, our names weren't match with the reservation name because tour guide had rearranged new room for our family to stay on the same floor. We then talked to staff at the concierge desk about this situation since the first day that we had arrived. We provided them room number, our names, order number and pretty much everything. We reconfirmed with the staff many times but they refused to collect our parcels when it was delivered to the concierge desk. The reason given to the carrier company was that the name did not match with the reservation name even the room number and our names were shown on the parcel.  ‚Ä¶",20
"I have stayed here twice. Last year, I booked a room for 4 persons on SPG's website, made it confirmed by e-mail from the hotel that the room was for 4 persons. But, they gave me a room with just 1 king bed when I checked in. I was flustered, and the reception said that they don't have a room for 4 persons except for a suite. To make matters worse, they suggested me to upgrade to a suite with additional pay because all the deluxe rooms were fully booked. Anyway, they put some extra beds in a room and I had no other choice. I had complained, and Guest Service Manager offered me a complimentary room upgrade for next visit. I had another chance to visit Macau early in Jan. This time I'd booked a room and asked the Guest Service Manager if the last offer was still valid. He didn't‚Ä¶",20
Was expecting more from sheraton. The building and rooms are a bit old and wornout. I guess is just good for location and casinos. is conveneient but not that delightful for the rooms. For this price  i believe i can have better options,30
"We are having fun and enjoy in the big Executive Suite with madeleine provided by Sheraton Macao. All the staffs serve us are very friendly and helpful. Front desk‚Äôs Jacky even called me to ask any extra help after I arrived in the room. The room is big and warm, such as a home. Living room is confortable for us to enjoy tea and celebrate birthday. Bathroom‚Äôs water is enough water pressure and hot.  I must stay in Sheraton Macao next time when I travel to Macau and will recommend my friend to stay in Sheraton Macao too.",50
"A nice hotel offering everything that need to be for a Sheraton kind of place!  The location is good as it is in the central of the Cotai mall, the Venetian is accessible with a bridge passageway. The city of dreams is also close, less than 5 min walk.  Really a good place for shopping or enjoying shows in Venetian theater, the city of dreams house of water and the studio city.",40
Generally good service... However the menu of one of the restaurants was not update on the app whilst the print menu was.  One of the deciders in choosing the restaurant was based on a discontinued dish... Great disappointment when our time in Macau was limited...,40
I checked in the Sheraton Macau over the weekend to find out the latest development and happening in town.   I found Sheraton Macau has done a great job in offering a SPG Counter exclusively for SPG Members.  It makes a big different where you can  your check-in and check-out without need to line-up with hundrerd of arrival/departure guests.    My check-in was simply 5 mins and my travel accompany can rest at the seating area surfing the free wi-fi provied by Sheraton.  The hotel is centrally located at Cotai and it's connected to Ventian Mall and also within walking distance to other mall like Studio City and City of Dream.  I spent the whole trip at Cotai without need going elsewhere and enjoyed my weekend.,50
"We stayed in this hotel for two nights. We used the free shuttle from the harbor. Went all fine. The check-in wasvery good,... Super friendly and much more than I am used to thanat other SPG properties in the greater China region.  We had a family suite,... This are two connecting rooms (with connecting door). One room is the master bedroom and the other one is the kids room with kids table, bunk bed, kids robes, a Wii game computer and so on. My kids LOVED it!  The club lounge is most likely the best club lounge I have ever seen. The staff all seem to be from the Philippines (so English no issue) and there service and friendliness from them is simply spot one! The breakfast and also the food selection is great. They ever had childs cutlery, plates and high chairs. WOW! Thanks‚Ä¶",50
"1) the bed is so comfortable and no annoying sound from corridor or neighbor. 2) the 50% discount for dinner/lunch of maximum of 8 persons is surely a very good bargain for in house guess, 3) the free bus services to terminal is punctual and tidy.  4) easy access to any other places for shows and visits",50
"Came here on a Saturday afternoon expecting the worse, after reading some of the reviews here. Expected to wait one hour for check in but was totally surprised, only waited 10 minutes. Served by an excellent staff, Ms Sally Yu, who got me checked in swiftly and professionally. Room is typical Sheraton and despite the huge setup with 3k rooms, it was clean and proper. One of the downside was that we were in the Earth tower which is quite far from the gym and swimming pool. Loved the Dreamworks themed hotels here. The other downside is they dont have shuttle bus service to the Macao Peninsula. Otherwise its great!!",40
"We celebrate my wife birthdays at macau. This is my first stay in Sheraton Macau,Hotel was arrange free upgrade to a family suite to us and even birthday cake was there. We were very excited and appreciated with their services. My kid join their Kung Fu Panda Academy , My kid feel happy and exciting. If we come again to Macau, Sheraton Macau is my first Choice!",50
"We chose Sheraton for celebration of our wedding anniversary.  We did make a good choice. The upgrade to the Executive Suite, the small gift plus a greeting card, the big stylish suite...together made our stay a memorable experience.  LIKE Two suggestions for improvement: 1 the food quality of the 'Feast' , and 2 only when we returned home and revisited the sheraton website (in Chinese version) did we notice that Executive Suite guests could access the Club Lounge and enjoy complimentary breakfast.  If so, it's a pity we did not enjoy the privileges. On the whole, our stay at Sheraton was comfortable and pleasant.",40
"Followed advice from previous reviewers and booked a Club Room : Superb  Plenty of room to stretch out - comfy king bed - amazing marble bathroom. Club access meant that i didn't have to buy any food in Macau - Cotai Strip looked very pricey to eat. Club Room also ensured to skip the check in line -when I arrived at check in (massive line) area at lobby I asked the first staff I saw about Club Check in, I was swiftly escorted to level 4 where there was no lineup and quick check it.  Free WFI was good - but due to size of the place dropped in and out.   Hint : when arrive pay close attention to where room is and best way to access - with 2 towers it is easy to get lost after an evening of gambling !   All Staff were attentive and helpful.",50
"We booked this hotel after losing a passport; we originally spent the night at another hotel but the rates were not within our budget for multiple nights so we decided to move over to this hotel.  We arrived early but rooms were available so they let us check-in. We used room service and the food was mediocre but it satisfied our late night hunger. The rooms themselves are clean and pretty large but they could use some updating. The hotel is HUGE so there is not a very personal feel, but that was to be expected.  Added bonus for pictures with Shrek!",30
"Sheraton is situated right next to the city of dreams where the ACOP ( Asian poker championship ) take place every year. Since we love playing poker, we prefer staying at Sheraton. It's great value for money and we love their service ! It has some great restaurants to grab a bite and shopping anyway is a load full ",40
"There is free shuttle from airport to hotel and vice versa.  Within walking distance to nearby hotels such as Venetian, Studio City, Hard Rock etc. Booked the 2-double bed rooms for 3 persons and they also provide an extra roll bed.  Room is of decent size and bathroom is big. Housekeeping very obliging when we requested for a fruit knife and fast in delivering. Room is clean but a little dim. Bed is comfortable but not the pillow. Was given a pool view room which was pleasant.  Daily bottled drink is provided. Stayed on the 23rd floor but do not have to wait long for the elevator during our stay there. For those who visits casino, the pacific gaming is on the 1st floor. Food court(koufu), restaurant are all within means. Nice pool for those who loves to swim. Most importantly,‚Ä¶",40
When one reaches macau there are free shuttle buses that takes you to all the hotels at Cotai Central. Board the bus which takes you to Sheraton. Check in at the hotel is very efficient and fast. The hotel & room are very spacious & equipped well. A couple of hotels share the same Ground floor in other words opens to all the malls and restaurants. The hotel also has a connecting bridge to the Venitian which houses the largest casino - for those interested in the trade.,50
"It was my girl friend when we arrived Sheraton Hotel in Macau, And everything was well arranged and it was perfect.   The very Friendly and Cheer staff, Ms. Amy Wu was arranged to upgrade my room to Suites. and even birthday cake was there. Without her perfect arrangement, we wouldnt have a wonderful day likes this.  Thanks Amy and the rest of the hotel staff.",50
"Luxury hotel, near to mall, free pick up service from ferry terminal to hotel, and free wifi in room. The things that hotel could develop are the complimentary water is to small and the iphone dock is to old",50
"The hotel rooms were very comfortable!!  The pool area was beautiful . Questioned the entrance to the pool some decorative   blocks a little tricky to walk around .. If you are not watching you could trip and  hurt yourself .. There is no set lounge ..there is a Casino, lots of restaurants and a mall.. There is a lot walking as you find your way around ..",50
"We stayed at the Sheridan for one night on a trip from Hong Kong. The complimentary pickup from the ferry terminal was fast and easy but we encountered our first problem with the hotel as soon as we arrived. We entered the line for check-in at around 2pm and were still queuing one hour later. The check-in attendant informed us that it was always that busy which made us think that more attendants should be trained to assist during busier times. Otherwise, the room was fantastic with a comfortable bed and great bathroom.  The hotel's facilities were phenomenal with a great pool, lots of restaurants and easy access to the casino's/shopping.",40
"From check in to check out everything was faultless. The room, the club room, the staff all excellent. The pool are was another place where you can really chill and relax. We will recommend to anyone and everyone. The happy hour in the club room was an icing on the cake. We already thinking of going back to Sheraton Macau on the near future.",50
"So this is one of the largest hotels i have ever stayed in being a 3000 room monster.  I am a Gold SPG member and luckily after finally finding the lobby there was a SPG member checkin area. Me and my colleague where served by a very lovely and friendly agent called Lively Liu who ensured we felt like valuable guests in this overly large hotel.  We booked Club Lounge rooms which worked out pretty well once we managed to orientate ourselves and weave through the many convention centre type corridors to the 4th floor and finally into the enormous Club Lounge"" area.  Having stayed in many hotels and always preferring club access rooms, this did not feel like your typical club lounge by any means.  The dining area was more of a food hall, the small snacks of food was like a wedding‚Ä¶",40
"While the hotel is clean modern and the rooms are good, it just feels like the hotel is not up to the standards of a typical Sheraton hotel elsewhere. Situated on top of a casino with crowds coming in and out every day, the place is busy and you don't feel as if you are in a luxury/Exclusive hotel (well they certainly have not priced it as a luxury hotel I have to agree). The check in queue was very long and you feel being rushed. Everything is some distance away, including the walk from the check in desk to the lift where your room is.   Other than that, there isn't much to complain about the room I guess, it is modern and clean.  There isn't much they can do to be honest, this is one of three (4 soon) hotels on top of a massive casino and is designed to provide affordable beds‚Ä¶",30
"Stayed for 5 nights, happy with this property .   Like - express check out facility, being located in mall connecting shops, restaurants, casino, other hotels like Venetian.  Don't like- having stayed for long 5 nights, there wasn't no additional faculty like complimentary club access etc which normally hotels provide. ",40
Its grand : Visiting Macau was a good experience a sheraton was icing on top.  Amazing property well connected with other neighbouring hotels and venetian. If you are looking for best place on macau and be in the centre then Cotai macau is the place. Staff is very efficient and room services and Housekeeping was just fantastic despite being a huge property. It has a luxury mall with connection inside to Conrad and St. regis and to venetian. Only thing is checkin takes a longer time as the counters are less as regard to rooms it has. Always huge queue. However its worth when u get in to your room. Its has two towers (sky and earth) both gives awesome view of Cotai and venetian. Its a must stay place for your next visit to macau. 10/10,50
"My second visit to this hotel. Big and clean rooms. Spacious gym and is 24 hours (simply love it), i can go gym at any time. Breakfast at the feast is average. Cakes abit hard for me.  Free shuttle bus from the macau airport, only about 10-15 mins bus journey. Very convenient and near to airport.",40
"World class hotel. Compared to Sheratons in the USA, this hotel is in a totally different class. Top notch service, rooms, food and more. Reasonably priced. A bit inconvenient if you plan to spend more of your on Macau island but Cotai Island is just a short taxi ride away. Stay here every trip. Rooms are too cold even with air condition turned off.",50
"We did not know that this hotel is a very large one,The bus from Macau pier dropped us off at the back of the hotel and taking us a while to look for the check in counter and after we found it everything went well,thank you Khun Aida. The room is nice,clean and airy with a very comfortable bed. We tried the burger at the Sala pool size bar and having our dinner at Bene.The food over all is good. Service is pretty good for the hotel that size. We will come back!",50
"Sheraton Macau was one of my best stay ever. I booked a suite in June 2015 and had a wonderful stay here. Let me vent my rage on the only con first, which was at the lobby, it was too messy. Club lounge members are not identified and we are mixed with the rest. No directions were given for us to take our registration at the club reception. Oh well.  So allow me to tell you about the magnificent of this hotel. The hotel is conveniently located, with a direct connection with several other big hotels around, most notably the Venetian. Also, theres a free shuttle at the airport to bring you here. Though I think most Macau hotels possessed this service.   The room was spectacular! The suite has a nice living area with a separate bathroom. What is breathtaking was the main bathroom,‚Ä¶",50
"I visited the Sherton Macao Hotel during summer holiday with kids. When I arrived, they check in area had a very long queue, I guessed there was over 300 people in the lobby waiting for check-in. There was some staffs to maintain the queue in good order. I waited more than one hour to get the room key. The front desk staff was too tired to offer a smile. Not a warm welcome. The room was clean, I had left a top in the room afte departure however no one contact me for the lost and found during my stay. Perhaps the Housekeeping was too busy? The room package included daily breakfast or lunch. The food and service in Feast was very good. The hotel had shuttle bus to Cotai ferry, however the other hotels would have shuttle bus to other areas in Macao. We had to take taxi when we went‚Ä¶",30
As a regular visitor to Macau I always look forward to staying at Sheraton Macau. I highly recommend upgrading to the club level rooms as then not only do you have a quick and easy check in on the 4th floor but you get to experience the fantastic customer service offered by Stefan and his team. Stefan will endeavor to address your every whim to highest standards and really is a huge asset to this hotel with his very professional standards,50
"as SPG platiumn number, our room was upgraded,  this is a grand, super nice room, we truly enjoyed stay in Sheraton Macao !  and the hotel with only walking distance if you wish to go house of dancing water and some shopping around. also free shuttle to different ferry terminals.  overall a very nice expierence of staying in Sheraton Macau.",50
"We were spg memeber , so hotel can arrange free upgrade to a family suite to us, we were very excited and appreciated with their service! We enjoyed a lote for our short 2 days trip ~!  The room included a child room and basic room, 2 toilets, its very nice that my babies can have a very happy bathing time there !",50
"We had a wonderful experience in the sheraton Macau ! We spend 3 nights in this hotel and everything was perfect. It was our weeding anniversary and all the staff took care of us : We had an upgrade in a wonderful suite with view on swimming pools, somes roses petals on the bed and macaroons... Wonderful ! And a really nice card to wish us a nice stay. Thank you very much for everything.  If we come again to Macau, for sure we will be back in Sheraton hotel.",50
"I have stayed at this hotel before and this time again I visited but just for one night. Being a platinum member, they offered me the Ambassador Suite in the hotel, which I think is one of the biggest suite in the hotel. Really enjoyed. Staff is good and helpful. Better than last time. Already planning to come back again in a couple of months to this hotel., just perfect place to stay in Macao",50
"This hotel is amazing, has exceptionally friendly and helpful staff. Nothing is too much to ask. The rooms are amazing and with loads of things to do for both adults and children.  We had an absolutely incredible stay and will definitely be back.",50
"Macau has dozens of first class hotels and to each their own. This hotel stands out for the friendliness and efficiency of staff. Special thanks to GiGi and Lester. Recommend Club Floor ,everything is  included from breakfast. Sandwiches at lunch and evening canap√©s (which is more a full meal service). Alcohol is expensive in Macau so the provisions of wine and beer is most welcome. If you take into account food and beverage provided the cost of the Club room is economical. Tip use the casino buses to go from resort to resort and the old town. We were on 40th floor with great views.",50
"Great hotel location!! I visited Macau as my first time for the vacation. Sheraton Macau is the best choice for staying due to the hotel is located in a great location. It's not too far from the Macau side if taking taxi is going to be only 15 mins and it's also opposite to the Venetian beside, it's easy to get to the airport by shuttle bus. ",50
"You feel lucky when in, i liked the place too much from the door to checkout, the casino is good but there is bigger, i enjoyed my stay and the room is amazing, and if you are a SPG member you well enjoy the discount and the best treatment.",40
"Large hotel with as many baccarat tables to your hearts content, as do all the casinos in Macau have. Pity I'm more of a blackjack man myself.  The hotel itself is very nice and has a large pool area. Most were preoccupied with the aforementioned baccarat tables so we had it all to ourselves!  Being centrally located on Cotai it is within walking distance of all the major hotels to explore.  The taxis were probably the only bad experience. Make sure they don't go the long route across the furthest bridge. We got stung twice as they claimed there was a lot of traffic. But the worst experience was a cabbie trying to add on a surcharge to our trip back to the hotel with some ridiculous chart showing the base fare and a % added on. As this was our 10th taxi ride in Macau we knew he‚Ä¶",40
"We stayed at the Macau Sheraton, this is another big beautiful gambling establishment in Macau. the rooms were large and the buffet was excellent. the lobby was expansive with fountains and greenery everywhere.  There is even a waterfall that spells out messages.

"We spent 3 nights here in October 2015 in a Deluxe Twin room.  Being the world's largest Sheraton, we were not dissapointed with the quality and range of amenities throughout the hotel. The 2 Queen-sized beds comfortably sleep 4 and the facilities in the room are generally adequate and of reasonable quality (from high speed internet WiFi/LAN connection to housekeeping attending to requsts in a prompt and timely manner).  The 24-hour gym (which includes a steam room and sauna) is one of the most comprehensive hotel gyms in the world (with medicine balls and equipment for all kinds of stretching, in addition to the standard treadmill and weights machines). Similarly, the swimming pools are exhaustive comprising of numerous decent-sized pools (comparable to what one would get at‚Ä¶",40
Sheraton Macau is one of the lowest grade hotel for this brand. Stayed there 2 nights and cannot believed they used such low end  products across the room. The shampoo and soap are unbelievable cheap. There is No security at all. Anyone can get access to all floor as they do not have lift control.  This is one of the lowest standard of  Sheraton in Asia,30
We stayed for 4 nights from 23rd October.  The hotel itself is very grand and very large. We booked a room in the Club Lounge which we later discovered was well worth it. The check in for Lounge members is on a different floor and we were looked after as soon as we got there in comparison to other non club members who lined up what looked like 30 people deep every time we walked past those areas. Our room was beautiful and very spacious and the bed very comfortable and linen and toiletries luxurious.  Our view was looking directly over the Venetian - amazing. All the staff were wonderful especially the ones in the Club Lounge who helped us with tips on sightseeing and where to find shops for small supplies and assisting us with ferry tickets and times straight back to Hong Kong‚Ä¶,50
"After arriving from Hong Kong via ferry, we could get the hotel shuttle just outside of the terminal, but since it was a Saturday we had to stand in the check-in que for about 40-45 mins. Rooms were clean and cosy, Hotel doesn't have a Casino but just opposite to the Hotel is Venetian and we went for the Casino there. City of Dreams is just 5 mins. walk from the Hotel and Shrekfast is must do for kids on level 5. Hotel has a shopping mall connected and if you just follow the directions you will directly reach to Shopping at Venetian, there is a connected bridge from the shopping area to the opposite side of road which leads to Venetian. Very nicely located property",40
"This huge hotel is connected to The Venetian, Four Seasons, and Holiday Inn. Very convenient. All those shops, eateries and expo/conference halls within walking distance. The room (Twin Room) is spacious, lovely, and clean (except the alarm clock and tissue box which were quite dusty). Bed was SO comfortable :) Large and nice bathroom. Our room had the Cotai Strip view. The hotel has shuttle bus to/from airport and ferry terminal.  Negative points: The hotel was so crowded (I guess that's a good thing for the hotel). No staff to take care of our luggages, so we have to carry them on our own. Surprisingly long queue just to check in. Took me at least 30 mins. There was even a long queue to deposit your luggage at the concierge, and another queue when you want to collect them. I‚Ä¶",40
"This is my second time to stay in Sheraton Macao Hotel Cotai Central. It consists of two buildings, one of which is Sky Tower and the other is Earth Tower. The reason that I need to add another comment is because I stayed in Earth Tower this time.  I had heard about the great differences between these two buildings from my friends before. Thus I thought it was a good chance to experience it if the Reception arranged a room in Earth Tower for me.  The hotel rooms in Macau are much larger and more comfortable than those in both Hong Kong and Mainland China. Some of them are even as large as your home. Relative to the warm colors of red and orange in Sky Tower, the entire color of Earth Tower is blue and grey. I prefer the colors in Sky Tower which represent a feeling of warmth and‚Ä¶",40
We had a good experience here despite the check-in line being ridiculously long. The staff were very accommodating. The room was great and we had a nice view of the pool. The bell boys helped us explain to the cab driver where we wanted to go and gave us a small card with translations to help us better communicate with the driver.,30
"Stayed at the Sheraton Macau Hotel, Cotai Central for three nights. We ended up getting a room with a fantastic view of The Strip.  It's also directly connected to three other hotels and connected by a walkaway to the Four Seasons Hotel and the Venetian.   We're vegetarian so when we wanted to get good cheap vegetarian food we just walked over to the food court at the Venetian. They have a ton of international cuisine options for reasonable prices compared to the hotel restaurants.   It's convenient because each of the hotels have bus service to different places in Macau proper. We took the bus to Border Gate from right outside our hotel.

"I was not enjoy my stay on 24~28 Oct, no show on 24 Oct,then check in on 25 Oct, reception counter full of staff but look so messy, receptionist seem like not so familiar with the system, after i enter the room, found a soap (used) on laundry basket, 27 Oct i back to room at night, room simply clean, found cup and coffee pot unclean, bed sheet like unchange, dust on carpet, seem no vacumm at all, and room svs tray still on the desk, no one take it out, so i put outside my room, but when i check out this morning, still at the same location, i don't know the standard for extend guest and new guest, that's make me quiet disappointed. I don't think i will stay there again. ",20
"Stayed for 3 nights. Booked on a Club Loung basis. The check in located on the 4th Floor is designed to give a superior experience this was not the case. There are potentially 8 check in positions, at the time of our check in only 2 were in use. One of the two was dealing with a client on a protracted matter the other was the sole interface with the new registrations, the time spent waiting was in access of 20 minutes. I consider this to be unacceptable. Our Club Room was on the 31st Floor, for a 5* hotel this was dissapointing and the room  can only be described as basic and underwhelming, certainly not to the standard I was expecting. On a positive note the arrangements in the Club Lounge were very good with light refreshments , tea , coffee and sandwiches available in the‚Ä¶",30

"This is the second hotel I have stayed at on the Cotai Strip.  I must say that the Sheraton is better than the Venetians.  The hotel is more modern, the shops and restaurants are not as crazy crowded as the Venetians.  I had a suite, and it was marvellous.  The bathtub in the middle of the bathroom is one of a kind.  The bed is very comfortable with complete block-out from the curtains (most other hotels, I still need to wear eyeshades to complete block-out).  If you are a tea drinker, you would love the tea bags available in the room.",50
Stayed for 2 nights with my family . Pool area nice but a bit in the shade.This hotel is massive but the bar is very small and lacks atmosphere. Rooms are large nice bathroom but just looks a bit dated . Ok hotel if you can get a good deal .,40
It is so nice to have a very good hotel to stay at after a long day tour. The bed is comfortable and our toiletries were replaced with new ones everyday. The ambience of the hotel is superb.  very clean,40
"It was a long line at check in even at SPG counter , but the staff was very nice.   The breakfast was also very delicipis, there's many different choose!  The bar restaurant at Lobby which is very nice place to eat some lite foods & dranks; the staffs there also very friendly .",50
"My family and I stayed in a family (2 bed) suite last month, and were incredibly underwhelmed by the Sheraton. We came on a busy weekend with a Bon Jovi concert in the neighbouring Venetian, so when we walked in at 3.30pm the queue for checking in must have been an hour long.  We were ushered to an upstairs check-in area, which was only a HALF hour long! Upon checking in we were told that our room was not ready yet, and were shown to the lounge, where we were provided 1 drink each - there was no food, and by this stage the kids were hungry and miserable. The suite was quite nice, with bunk beds for the kids and Madagascar themed accessories for them too.  Wi-fi was poor throughout the hotel, even in the room. The breakfast area was about a half-hour walk from our room to the‚Ä¶",30
"It is truly a adventure park for adults.   With a huge build in casino in the ground floor, the world biggest Sheraton is unique. Many different restaurants, and i guess over 30 Check-In counters, just to give you an idea, whats going on there. It is great value for money, as it isn't expansive.  Good Platinum upgrades, responsive staff.  If we ever go back to Macao, we'll stay in the Sheraton again, but for sure will try out the new St. Regis too. Please do visit this Hotel just for the purpose of gambling, there is not much more to do than gambling and shopping.  4-5 Star Casino Hotel!",50
"As with most casino accommodation it was high quality.  Breakfast was great, several shops and food options.  No bar on the casino floor seemed odd but this place and this town is 99% focussed on the gaming dollar.  I've been there (Macau) and don't think I'll return. ",40
"I arrived this hotel late evening & my goodness what a brilliant room; luxury at its best. I never stayed in such a comfortable hotel with incredible amount of detailing given to the room. Washroom was brilliant. Pools were different & interesting. We ordered late night salad & it was brilliant.  However, there couple of things which were bit let down.  Heavy ques during check-in/outs, they should have more executives for the same; took 30 mins   Second, they take 2000 HKD as a security which was bit surprising, since I am not a credit card person hence faced lot of hassle  But overall it was a great experience & a must stay hotel; try Venetian Hotel for casino",50
"We chose this for a short break with our 4 year old twins. First impression was a chaotic lobby and long queues but we were quickly ushered upstairs to the SPG lounge by an attentive concierge. It saved embarrassment that I am actually an SPG member... I'm happy to carry my own luggage, which I guess was a relief as no help was on offer (a first for me - normally there's an embarrassment of service in that area). Adjoining rooms were good and the kids' room was bedecked with Dreamworks themed goodies, which was great and one of the reasons we had chosen the Sheraton. We set out to explore lunch options. Poolside bar menu was sparse, as was the service so we elected for Bene, the Italian on the first floor. Generally pretty good although the waiter got a bit pushy when we only‚Ä¶",30

The rooms were lovely, clean, spacious and the beds and linen were heavenly! However, after a journey over to mainland Macau, we arrived back at the Sheraton around 10.30 pm...on the hunt for food and drinks. Very dissappointed as options were few and far between. All the fast food outlets were closed or closing, the restaurants closing, the pool was closed, the food hall only had Asian choices, and we needed serious feeding...hamburgers. The only option was the hotel cafe/bar which charged like a wounded bull! So we starved and had no alcohol.  In saying that, the lunch buffet was awesome the next day. The location‚Ä¶",40

The hotel was lovely but our holiday was ruined and very disappointed with the check out service. We paid a deposit on arrival and were told we would have the amount credit within 24 hours back onto our credit card it was a moderate amount. 3 and half weeks later I was still trying to get that money back I could not get any satisfaction from emails etc. so disappointing from such a large well known company there was a huge mix up and paperwork missing not good enough I will never stay at a Sheraton hotel again I have never had this problem ever all over the whole world,20
I've stayed 4 days with my family and used lounge club. Check in and Check out from there as well. I've also stayed at Grand Hyatt Macau which is just across the street and they had great food in the Grand Club however I preferred the selections at Sheraton. All the hotels in Macau are pretty new so the facility are also new and clean as well. All the employees showed smile face and willing to hep me out and quite nice. I will definitely stay at Sheraton again for future trip.,50
Hotel was Really clean. Swimming pool was crystal clear. There were 2 Different pool areas with many pools in each area. Loved it. Staff was helping and friendly. I got pool view room on 40th floor. The view was amazing. Loved our stay.,40
"Very spacious and cozy room condition, especially our kids liked their room which decorated with Shrek cushion and many pretty things and wii game player, they played by themselves at their room so my wife and I had really enjoyable time. Drinking wine and looking out the good view, I think it is the best place to celebrating their wedding anniversary for parents. I hope it can be helpful for you and enjoy your trip in macau~~",50
- one of the best hotels I ever been. - the location is perfect and clos to Venetian hotel/ - the shuttle service of Sheraton perfect and you can go free all Macao. - room service very slow. - the hotel are huge and not easy to to orient in. - the pool was close and we was Disappointed!!!!!!,50

For family with young kids..better u prepare kids equipment such us diapers, milk, baby food and water",40
"This is a humongous hotel.  If not careful, you'd get lost.  Overall, service is excellent.  Executive lounge is huge and can accommodate a lot of people.  Food items are plentiful and well diversified.  Room is also great.  Got upgraded to a suite and it is big.  Swimming pool is also colossal.  The travel center is however disappointing.  Hotel concierge told me there'd be no extra charge for hotel guest buying a ferry ticket from the travel center.  However, extra charge was levied.  Service at the travel center is also terrible and condescending.",40
"Over the past year, I have been staying in the Sheraton Macau during my weekly visits to Macau and I have never really had anything to complain about. Each stay was welcoming and the entire staff tries really hard to make you feel like home. This hotel is my home away from home.",50

As a SPG member I go to the SPG counter to check in although I booked the room through travel agent.  I understand the earliest time to pick up the room is around 15:00. So I put my luggage at bell service. Friendly SPG staff marked down my phone number and he said hotel will SMS me when the room is really. At last I do not receive the SMS at all.  I come back to hotel around 23:00, I go to pick up the key at SPG counters as well. Everything is fine. When I go up, I hear some noise inside my room, then I use my key to open the door. I found that a staff is setting up my extra bed which I ordered before...   May be I didn't book through SPG for the room they do not give me a SPG room‚Ä¶",20
"Have been a loyal SPG member for more than 2 years now, and the Sheraton Macau didnt disappoint. Yes, there are better hotels in Macau, but this one ticked all boxes.   Getting there-There are free buses from the Ferry terminal to the Sheraton, but difficult to find as there arent many signboards. We actually took a bus which dropped us off at the Venetian (signboards for the Venetian buses are at every 100 yards, impossible to miss). We knew the 2 hotels were connected, hence it wasnt difficult to get there. Experience- 3/5  Check-in could have been handled better, as we had to wait in line for quite a while. A couple of other families were also waiting at the check in. However, the attendants were very courteous and ensured we didnt have a bad experience at the start.  Rooms-‚Ä¶",40
"This is probably the 5th time I'd stayed at Sheraton Macao. Great facility and activities for the kids.   We got the club faculties package which is so worth it - have access to the lounge which seems to serve drinks throughout. At 5pm there's happy hour and with a full selection of buffet.  Staff are friendly and fluent in English. Shuttle bus arrives every 15min or so. Close to other hotels including City of Dreams - where we watched the Dancing Water Show. Kids loved the front seats!  I would highly recommend this hotel. I've also stayed at the Crown, Venetian and a few others.  However, next time round I would probably avoid the Chinese October long week -- too many mainlanders.",40
"This an ENORMOUS hotel....  the biggest sheraton in the world.  We looked out of our window at the pool but when we arrived at the pool about a 10 minute walk it was a different one altogether!!!  The rooms could be anywhere in the world but were spacious, and the bathroom was huge and had great amenities!!!!  Of course there is the obligatory casino in the foyer but this didn't really interested me much so just had a walk through to see what all the fuss was about.  Huge selection of restaurants but i was more interested in eating local Portuguese food so except for breakfast i gave it a miss.  I had room service breakfast - delicious!!  Was still piping hot when it arrived and great service.  This is a beautiful hotel but a bit bland - would have liked some local flavour!  Bed‚Ä¶",40

"Stayed at Sheraton Cotai from 24-28 Sep 2015.  The check-in line was very long, luckily as our group consist of 2 young children (1 was done with fever) and 2 late sixties seniors were directed to the express check-in.  I find the hotel concierege are really helpful whenever we approach them for assistance.  We would suggest that families with young kids to stay on the peninsula side and most of the tourist spots are located there.  The Cotai area is mostly for people visiting the casinos.  Our family enjoyed the fantastic House of Dancing Water show.",30
"This is my third time to stay at Sheraton Macao, I am fine with the hotel location, facility and the room is nice.  I had a very disappointing experience - when I check out, I told the reception Miss Chow/Zhou I loss my deposit receipt then she gave me a long face to calculate the deposit balance, then she ""throw the money"" on the reception desk. I felt embarrassing, I need to meet my friends so I didn't raise complaint to her manager.  Very disappointing service I hope Sheraton to improve their service level, therefore I have to give them only 2-star.  To clarify: this time my room is not complimentary by the Casino, I book thru agent.  ",20

I went there during the China National Day holidays, and boy oh boy.. It was so crowded at the lobby.   This is my third stay in this hotel, and I have no idea why I was put at Sky Tower again. From my observation, it seems that Caucasians were placed in the Earth Tower while Asians, which I am one, were placed in the Sky Tower. I have never been into the Earth Tower, and hence, can't really comment on the layout, decorations etc. But what I can comment on was the quality of guests in the Sky Tower.

I held a 60 person birthday pool party at the Sheraton this past weekend. The entire time I dealt with Amy Wu as my events representative. Amy was quick to respond to my requests over email and over whatsapp. When we arrived we to the hotel we were surprised by Amy with an upgrade to an deluxe suite. The deluxe suite was one of the biggest I have ever stayed in. It consisted of 3 rooms. One main room with sitting and dining. One small entertainment room with a L-sofa and surround sound system. Finally our huge bedroom and bathroom. As per usual at Sheraton the room and facilities were to their standards (which was excellent).   The pools at the Sheraton are also great.

Horrible stay. Save your money. This hotel had the dirtiest breakfast buffet I have ever seen. Also the service is far below the other hotels. I will never stay at this property again. Ask for non smoking king yet room smelled of smoke. Overpriced should be a one star motel not even hotel rating.,10
"  Ultra-snazzy, a poetry in luxury. Totally futuristic in the way the Sheraton, along with the three other Hotels alongside, connect to the mammoth dream world of the Venetian, through the connecting corridor in the second floor. Great gourmet food in the restaurants. The flexibility of dining in the many connected food-courts. Integrates the entire experience of Hospitality, Retail and Entertainment industries, which seamlessly blend into one-another.  ",50
"I agree with another traveler, the regular check-in/out line here is ridiculous but after staying here, I realize that's the case with most hotels here, especially during the holidays so I suggest checking the calendar when you're booking so you'll know what kind of lines you're in for. Otherwise, great hotel , great location. The pictures/other reviews don't show you that the Sheraton is connected to other hotels by a sort of mini-mall with restaurants and shops...it's connected to other good hotels like the Holiday Inn and the Conrad and they're all directly opposite the Venetian and right next door to the City of Dreams so it's a great location with a lot of high-end shopping at your fingertips.

The club lounge service and food was good.  But the restaurant choices inside the hotel were so not attractive and we preferred to dine outside.  Especially the food court, expensive but taste no good.  There is no indoor pool and outdoor pools are cool water only, it will be great if one of the pool will be a heated pool.

"Keeping in mind this is the biggest Sheraton Hotel in the World, in a tourist hub like Macau, you clearly have to make certain concessions. Clearly you're not going to get away from the crowds, nor should you really expect to, but certain things which could help aren't particularly thought out. The Sheraton Club for example is MASSIVE and there isn't a slight air of exclusivity - the dining area just feels like another hotel restaurant.   As a platinum SPG member I was upgraded to a very comfortable suite and the service was rather good. I ordered an item from the daily menu after 11pm and the staff had no issue at all bringing it to me.   I think if TripAdvisor allowed half ratings this would be a 3.5/5",30

"Honestly, I cannot follow many of those who posted the review here on Tripadvisor... but so be it! I just stayed recently at it was most likely by far the worst experience I had in a so called 5* hotel over the past couple of years. It starts already with the feeling of being a number instead a guest that you have to line up for check in...that alone is already not 5* but the fact the the check in process is slow and many counters are not manned is another fact. The check in was not organized at all and took over 10 minutes leaving the waiting time aside. The staffs was not well trained neither customer oriented.  That the lobby has no charm as it is permanently overrun by game machines is a fact that you have to accept when you are in Macau... The whole ambiance just feels odd.‚Ä¶",20

So few months later I returned and stay here for one night for the concert, it turned out to be a huge disappointment. I arrived at 1800 and it's packed, due to the public holiday and mid-autumn festvial, the place is totally packed. So I went to the SPG counter, the queue is long and there's only two staff at the counter, and they took ages to finish one check-in, one even keep chatting with the customers on and off. I was in a hurry to fresh up and go for the event.‚Ä¶",30
"Stayed for 1N over the Mid-Autumn Festival. Crowded time to be there but expected better from a 5 star hotel. The Good: -fast, efficient check-in for SPG members, same for check-out at club lounge  -fast, efficient service by housekeeping when attending to our requests given the size of the hotel. -nice large room -Special mention to Edmund Yong (hope I got your name correctly) at the Club lounge). Our luggage was sent mistakenly to Bell services even though we requested otherwise. He went down with us and personally ensure everything was in order. Thank you Edmund. The Bad: -the so-called club lounge is the worst I have ever been. zero exclusivity with a huge dining area which serves mediocre food. which club lounge has such a big dining area where half the hotel guests seem to‚Ä¶",30
"This is a very impressive hotel, and so well located, connected to the Holiday Inn and the massive Venetian and its gigantic shopping mall. The rooms are wonderful with great furnishings, good views and excellent spacious marble bathrooms.  No problem with check in and no queues, but that was on a Friday. Over the weekend it appeared to be hectic in the checkin and reception areas.  The pools and recreation areas are fabulous but oh so crowded over the weekend.  A free shuttle was available to the port...so convenient.  The only down side for us was the buffet breakfast, although it was massive with so many options available, people were literally fighting to get to the food which constantly ran out and the staff were seriously under pressure to replenish and even became‚Ä¶",40
"Stayed in Executive Deluxe Suite. The suite was great. The view was excellent. The club was pretty unusual: they offered a full scale dinner on evenings. Huge choice of food, good quality. However, kids are running around even when alcohol is served. Swimming pools offer at least two different temperatures: cool and warm.",40
"It's very convenient to get from one place to another since the shuttle service picks u up from the ferry terminal and takes u into the city as well(u have to transfer from one shuttle bus from another once to get to the city, but it's still free and not difficult at all.) The room was clean and u can go to all the malls without going outside the hotel building so ",50
"My wife and I saw bon jovi concert and chose to stay in this hotel on 26 sep 2015  Room: nice deco, bedcover texture very nice, shower and bathtub both provided, WiFi is OK with no need login n password   Staff: staff response is very good, responsive to email enquiry.  Facilities: free use of gym room with new equipment and swimming pools   Good: staff is good to try best arrange everything to customer. Free shuttle bus to and from pier and airport. Clean room.   Bad: check in time long to almost 45mins. Swimming pool is just for fun with no deep water level and long lane. No free drink except bottles of water at casino. ",40
"My travel agent suggested Sheraton when I asked her to book a one night stay in Macau for a concert. Having stayed in the Venetian in the past I agreed on trying something new.   The shuttle bus picked up the guests from the ferry terminal an we arrived at the Sheraton door  fairly quickly. We followed the sign and reached the reception desk. The queue is very long but everything is orderly. The wait was approximately 25 minutes. As soon as we were greeted by the front desk staff everything went quite smoothly from there. I was offered to registered for the SPG membership. The service was good but I'm a bit disappointed with the fact  that the check-out time is 11am.  We stayed at Tower 1, non-smoking room and facing the Holiday Inn. The room is spacious, clean and tidy. There‚Ä¶",40
"This property is an excellent choice on the central Macao ""strip"" which is evolving into something similar than Las Vegas. Everything is large here, rooms, showers, toilets, SPG lounge.   The property is part of the Sands Central Cotai which is made up of two other hotels: the Holiday Inn and the Condrad. Soon The St. Regis will join in as well. It is within walking distance to the City of Dreams and the soon to open Studio City and Wynn Palace and has a direct link to the Venetian.   You'll find a plethoral of retail and restaurants that should please any palate and budget, Maucau is much more focussed on gambling though than similar gambling cities such as Las Vegas and Singapore where entertainment is heavenly supporting the gaming.

"Stayed for one night due to Bon Jovi concert ( across the road at the Venetian ). This Sheraton claims it is the biggest Sheraton in the world and since they have so many rooms / visitors; they need to have system to match the crowd over the weekends. Basically everything works like clock work ( impressive ) but food is disappointing ( bland ). Otherwise, sleep quality was good ( good bed ) but the mini fridge was locked and could not get a drink!",30
"From MFM Airport we took the free shuttle bus to Cotai Central, you need to alight at the second stop for the Sheraton, (Stop 1 is for Holiday Inn & Conrad). Upon entering the hotel, it was a little bit confusing where we needed to head to check-in and a little chaotic.   After asking for directions from the concierge, we headed to the Club Lounge for check in. Other Trip Advisor reviewers have suggested this, and this is something that I would endorse if you are staying Club Level. The regular check-in areas looked to be quite busy every time we passed.  We were warmly greeted at the lounge and offered a cool towel and small welcome drink. As an SPG Gold member, we were upgraded to a suite which was most welcome.  Our suite was on the 34th floor, and was huge. More than enough‚Ä¶",50
"Pros:  -Stayed in a suite which was fantastic - big comfy bed, good tv, great bath/shower -Room service was great - ordered a biryani and dan dan noodles, took 40 minutes but was hot and tasted great -Casino area is vast   Cons -Took over 30 minutes to check in and out, big queues  -Pool area is full of children and very busy, not relaxing environment -No sun in pool area",40
"Check in and check out is way too slow (even on SPG only line). I am not sure why the hotel staffs need such a long time to complete a standard procedure. Swimming pool Jaya is close most of the time, disappointing since you pay full price but availability of some amenities are just half of the time. Shower head hose is leaking a lot. Positive points: very helpful room service, trying their best to help to provide alternative for baby crib (unfortunately unusable as the rail guard is set to lock and cannot be opened), provide plenty of extra drinking water bottles without much questions asked. Most staffs can speak English ok. Room and hotel condition & cleanliness in general are good. Did not try the hotel restaurants, unfortunately dining options at the adjoining mall is‚Ä¶",30

"This hotel is absolutely stunning. The minute you walk into the central lobby, your senses are overwhelmed. We felt unworthy to be here as we had just got off the ferry from Hong Kong and we looked like we had slept in our clothes. The hotel runs a free shuttle bus from the ferry to the hotel complex, which was fantastic. We felt slightly intimated about checking in and there seemed to be a massive queue but one of the very helpful staff members who are everywhere, asked if we were Starwood members (we were) and as a result we were shown to a separate reception area with no queue and were efficiently checked- in by an extremely helpful Marianna who answered all my questions with the confidence of someone who has complete knowledge of the area.

its a 4000 rooms hotel and yet the fastest i ever visited. Located opposite to venetian hotel. Spacious rooms with fast service at every touch point of the hotel. There is a big casino which is crazily busy all the times. Multiple restauants with huge choice of shopping within the hotel. The hotel works like machine yet offering personalization. in spite of being on the highest floor of the hotel my baggage reached before me to the room. I left one bag at the reception while i was check ing in. i remembered this 8 hours post check in and to my surprise the bag was safely kept and delivered to my room within 10 minutes of my inquiry. dos to the team for setting up great processes and delivering them so efficiently.,50
"I usually don't stay Sheraton. But I heard Sheraton Macao is good. I stay 3 days.. Enjoy everything there.. I special thanks to lounge staff.. What I want they know and gave me everything.. Breakfast was huge and delicious too. I never wait to get something.. If I go Macao again, I will choose this hotel... ",50
Sheraton is always our first choice when going to Macau.  That's very kind of their Manager - Ms Amy Wu this time who upgraded us to an executive suite.  We like the bathroom very much.  We had some relax time there and thanks again for making this birthday trip so comfortable.  Will for sure come back again.,50
"Excellent location! The place is center of the Sands Cotai region! Walk to Four Seasons, Grand Hyatt, Hard Rock Hotel, and the Venetian in just 15 minutes walk! Sheraton definitely proved to be one of the best hotels in the world! Cant say anything bad about it! Quality at its best!",50
"I enjoyed a very pleasant stay at the Sheraton Club Executive Suite with an impressively large and dramatic open marble bathroom that takes up almost 1/3 of the spacious 83 sqm floor space.   Hotel security is tight. Service is deserving of a 5-star rating as the reception desk efficiently arranged for me to check in early due to availability of room.   The Club Lounge is a great place to unwind, however, they should look at serving better quality snacks. Seriously, egg and tuna sandwiches, potato chips, butter cookies and marshmallows are not what I expected from Sheraton Club Lounge.  That said, do not miss the Club Lounge cocktail hour between 4-7 pm with a full and generous buffet spread which feels like early dinner to me. The choice of drinks is plenty to choose from‚Ä¶",50

This was the 5th time we have stayed in Macau but the first time at the Sheraton, we were debating if we should try this hotel or stay in our favourite which is the Venetian Hotel and we made a big mistake picking this hotel. We checked in fine, the receptionist was friendly, we loved the room so it was a good start.  However then the hotel had major issues with power outages, we had to get ready for dinner with no lights the first night, the next day (my birthday) the power went again in the afternoon, there were people stuck in lifts screaming and crying, others couldn't get into there room because the keycards weren't working.

Smooth check-in, beautiful rooms and decor, excellent service, good and helping staff.   Its a great hotel. We had the best time. we have stayed for two days and every moment we enjoyed. more over attached to a big shopping mall with almost all international brands. Superb.   and with a big Casino. They even give you a late check-out just on request.   very good room service. All amenities in the room and toilet.   only one thing I want to share - and it is very important is for Vegetarians like us it has very very limited choice. So you have to just manage.",50
"There are smoking rooms floor at this hotel but I don't smoke. The room was not worth that much money, probably because of weekend. The breakfast cost 217 HK$ at door and 179 HK$ at checkin. The entertainment playground is rather small with limited tables. It's better go there at day time with less players.",30

The ground floor is interconnected with the Holiday Inn hotel and Cotai Sands Shopping.

Bed was comfortable and the pillows just so luxurious. Room was spacious. Staff were friendly, polite and very professional. Special mention to Amy Wu for her extra special treatment and thoughtful arrangement.  We have so many happy memories of our visit to Sheraton Macau and we will definitely recommend to friends.",50
Well we were looking forward to  the all round Sheraton experience and we were very disappointed. You can't check in until 1pm. Then at 1pm they cattle que you in long ques. Awful system. Why you can't check in and do all the paperwork and then just grab your keys and bags later like in normal hotels I don't know. Terrible experience. The restaurant is the furthest area away from the rooms so breakfast is a march. Set off 15mins before you're hungry. Nothing is sign posted well except the shops and gambling. Everything else you need to constantly ask for directions.  Good fitness and pool facilities.  Rooms are dated.  Breakfast is OK but nothing special.  It seems that the standard and service you get used to from these hotels elsewhere is not continued here Macau. Venetian is‚Ä¶,20

Could do with a nice bar though...",40
This  is our 4th time here and always the best.  I've stayed at almost all the luxury hotels in macau and the are all top notch. But for us with 2 kids 5 and 14 nothing compares to Sheraton Macau. I suggest get the breakfast included.  ,50
"Stayed for one night in July 2015. We booked tickets for a musical at the Venetian Theatre and Sheraton was a good choice because of its convenient location. From the hotel, we could easily access to different shopping malls, restaurants and of course, the theatre. Our room was clean and big enough for both of us to move around. Comfy!",40
"The sheer flamboyance of the hotel is breathtaking and the atmosphere inside is simply overwhelming. It goes without saying that the staff at the hotel were very welcoming and courteous, the only issue I faced was while checking in, the duty manager was extremely rude and curt, but besides that there was no issue at all.  The hotel has numerous in-house restaurants, I happened to try their Italian restaurant, and they had a truffles theme set dinner planned which is finger licking good. The hotel has all the amenities you would look for in a Sheraton and is located bang on the Cotai strip. It has a sky bridge that connects it to Venetian as well.

But I found the service to be friendly and courteous. People trying to do their best handling A LOT of guests.  Depending on what it costs, the club level can be valuable because they lay out a very nice buffet for both breakfast and in the evening... food and drinks. Takes a while to walk to anything, but the hotel is connected to a nice mall and a food court. Be sure to take the walkway over to the mall that is part of the Venetian.  The casino is heavily oriented to baccarat.  Hard to find a blackjack table.

The staff was helpful, although some can't very well converse in English. They also have a shuttle bus which also made it convenient to go to places in Macau.",40
"Booked a Deluxe Suite as a SPG Gold member, unfortunately, when I arrived at the hotel at around 4pm, the room was not available yet, while the official standard check-in time is 3pm. And, the front desk staff suggest me to go back at 7pm, without any compensation or temporary room. It was so disappointing, this is the worst SPG property in the world, this is the third or fourth time I stay at this hotel, and I realized that the service quality at this hotel has been decreasing again and again. Friends, you may want to try some other new hotels around, unless only paying for the name of Sheraton.",20
"We stayed two nights at Sheraton Macau and we had an awesome experience.   The construction is very impressive and the stuff is very nice.   You should definitely get the Club access as it includes breakfast, snacks, dinner and drinks.   The casino is quite expensive to bet but it wasn't our main goal of the vacation. We did go to City of Dreams for some gambling, where the casino is more welcoming. ",50
"Amazing hotel, the family room is the best thing since sliced bread, my 2 children have not stopped talking about the awesome bunks and their room which they didn't want to leave.  The character breakfasts are the best we have ever had and we have been all over the world and to Orlando twice. The pools are nice and the gym is really good. All staff were amazing and everything is so close to the shops, airport, other hotels and the best show in the world - Dancing with water. I recommend the Sheraton to anybody to Macau.",50
"This hotel is centrally located on Cotai and min walk from Venetian. It wasn't very packed when we were there but has a decent casino. The room was extremely clean, definitely happy with that. The pool, bars, and party scene can be improved on. It was very family- oriented resort. ",40
Rooms are ok - what you would expect from a Sheraton.   The food options are pretty poor. Italian restaurant is below average. Even the Chinese restaurant is below average!!!  Pools are great - they serve better food there. Although they close the bar/food way too early in the evening!!!  Worst thing is that it's located in Macau - a poor man's Vegas. Doesn't have the soul or crowds that Vegas pulls. Really quite disappointing. ,30

We ate in the on-site Italian Restaurant (Bene) which was delicious and also had the opportunity to use the outdoor swimming pools during our stay. The location was great for visiting the different attractions on the Cotai strip, and the transfer from the Hong Kong ferry to the hotel was excellent. Our only problem with the hotel was the lack of signage to breakfast. It took us a long time to work out where breakfast was served, there was no information in the room, lobby or in any of the lift areas. We asked two separate members of staff (one sending us to level 3, the other to level 1) only to find by mistake that breakfast is held in ""Feast"" on‚Ä¶",40

When I got to the hotel around 1am they told me I had been upgraded to a suite and I was pleased.  It was an executive suite which is very nice but not the deluxe suite I was hoping to be in for the rest of my stay.  I still have trouble communicating with people in Macau but they were very friendly and I figured I would tae care of it the next morning.

Only 2 staff at the counter ! gave up and wandered off to another part of the hotel and found a SPG only area where check in was swift and efficient. Room was excellent with great views and good amenities. Bed was comfortable Asked for a scissors and that did not arrive throughout my stay ...  Full of people and looked more like a shopping mall than a hotel. But that is true of all Macau hotels - wandered around the place as a lot of hotels are interconnected. Venetian , Conrad, Four Seasons all connected and easy to walk .  Not sure if all Macau hotels are like this so cannot say how the Sheraton compares but certainly not up to the same standard in service as others I have stayed in‚Ä¶",30
"Sheraton is one of the hotels in cotai sands Macau, we can walk to the Venetian in 15 minutes. Overall, room is in good condition and quite spacious, gym is okay, but downside is the swimming pool is very small. Good thing is that shuttle runs from 6:30am till late evening. ",40
"The location is great - just opposite The Venetian and there is an airconditioned walkway to take you there in 5 minutes. This hotel is interconnected with 2 more hotels namely the Holiday Inn and Conrad. The view from the upper floor rooms is great. There is nothing much to do in Macau except gamble and this hotel too has a good casino. The check in took ages, because of the weekend travellers from China and HK. Very slow. Being vegetarians, we requested the room service only to heat our packaged food. We did not tell them to even open it, but they refused on grounds of hygiene.

So I came back after the show, and what happened was we requested a room with king bed, but they said they ran out of room and can only offered us a 2xdouble bed bedroom and we were not happy with this arrangement at all. The hotel staff was not helpful and all they said was because they have too many people coming in since its a weekend and all the rooms are occupied and that's what they can only offer us.

This is my repeat stay at Sheraton as I find the room comfortable and clean. This time I chose Sky Tower and got room 3322 and was pleased with the view of Venetian Hotel from the window! The hotel staff are friendly at the Club lounge and the appetizer cocktail in the evening has a good variety of food that can substitute as dinner if you are not looking for wide spread of food that dinner buffet serves. The bar serves good cocktails in addition to sparkling wine and the usual white/red wine.  I think it's the lull period for holiday so it wasn't crowded at the club lounge which made the experience even more enjoyable with the attentive service from the staff. I am glad I chose to book Club room this trip and am looking forward to the breakfast at the lounge tomorrow.    ,50
"Booked a Club Suite through Hotels.com at a great price.  Room was incredible and exceeded our expectations.  This hotel is massive so a room near to the lifts are a good idea.  Club area checkin was smooth and efficient.  Room service/housekeeping were faultless and the array of complementary products was awesome (6 bottles of water, tea/fruit, coffee machine, bathroom supplies restocked at least twice a day).  Best of all was the Club Lounge, which included beer, wine, coffee, tea, juice, soft drinks, all day buffet food/deserts and breakfast (the food quality was impeccable) included in the price.  Located within easy walk of Venetian and Galaxy of Dreams complexes.  This would have to be one of the best hotel experiences I have ever had.",50

I state this hotel at Aug. when I arrive I need wait more than hours for check in. If you are not their member. This is horrible thing in this trip. The room is clean and the bad is big and soft.

This is apparently the largest Sheraton in the world. It sure feels like it with the walk to breakfast taking 10 or more minutes. The rooms are large and comfortable and although it's very big it seems to deal with the large numbers efficiently. ,40
"Even though we were 3 young(ish) girls, all staff treated us with respect and were incredibly helpful. We were in want of nothing. Normally we stay at hostels and cheaper hotels, but this time we felt we should do it up a bit. We have all stayed at nice places before, but travel a lot and have budgets. The Sheraton and its staff were above expectations and the view was incredible.",50
"We stayed at the family suite for a weekend. The suite was spacious and gave us a comfortable and relaxing stay. The Club lounge had also provided a nice environment for a relaxing moment.  However, I do feel the hotel needed to look into its shuttle services. I am so disappointed that the shuttle to the Galaxy had been canceled. It was very inconvenient to get around Cotai.",50
I recently stayed at Sheraton  hotel for a birthday getaway which was ruined by an ATM eating my boyfriends bank card. The staff there were not helpful in helping us try and get our card back and never offered to call the ATM phone number for us. Instead they chose to stand around and watch us while they chatted amongst themselves. We then had to go back to our hotel room to make phone calls to our banks to cancel the card in case it did miraculously pop out somehow and someone tried to use it. We made a total of 4 international phone calls totaling 10mins to our bank to cancel the card. Only when we 'express checked out' ( some young lady who was rude and basically shooed us away) we didn't get a receipt or anything to say our checkout was fine. Only to find out a few days‚Ä¶,10
There was a deal: stay two nights and get free breakfast. Breakfast buffet had a large selection and was good. We stayed in a standard room which was spacious and offered a good view. The hotel offered many swimming pools and we loved them. It was a comfortable stay.,40
"This location has 3 buildings so it's a very big Sheraton. With so many guests, the hotel services are nothing but highly efficient, functional and smooth. The check in check out process, stowing bags while we sight-see and the shuttle system were all painless. Great job Sheraton Macao!",50

"First time to have to suffer the indignity of queuing 40-50pax deep just to checkin for our room.  Something that's not expected of a Sheraton property.  Had no idea when we made reservations that this hotel has a casino.   Hotel is far away from local shops.  There are no convenience shops, not even a mini mart. You are forced to spend your money within the property.  Macau island is a 30-50 bus ride away (depending on traffic and which service number), rides are fairly cheap, 3.2 to 6.2 MOP per trip, just look at the machine when you board, it should reflect the fare you have to pay. Make sure you have lots of coins.  Rooms are clean and comfortable.  Fridge in our room doesn't work.  Kudos to the housekeeping staff for a thoughtfully tidied room.  Breakfast options are‚Ä¶",20
"Really liked the family-friendly reception and lounge: a balloonist kept our 4yo entertained while we were busy checking in. There was a pushcart with snacks for kids too! Many other kid friendly activities like movie screening by the pool, kid themed breakfast and junior hotelier program where the kids get to try and make cookies as a hotel chef, etc. They have strollers available for loan too, just email them in advance.   Room was very comfortable and staff were nice but we got lost trying to look for the food court in the adjacent building - would be nice if they provided more obvious signages for guests trying to get there from the rooms.",40
"Excellently placed in the middle of the cotai strip hotels - Venetian, City of dreams, hard rock all within walkable distance. The club bedrooms were underwhelming but the club breakfast and food from 5 pm were outstanding. Pool area great with kids - shame the best pool shuts at 6 and that there isn't a better food and drink offering or service there. We went out to get takeaway pizzas from bene in thhe hotel which were great - just can't see why you can't order from the pool... Wifi really good - free and easy to access with multiple devices",40
"It's my second time in this hotel. As compared to last time, I have noticed that the hotel staff have become significantly less patient and friendly. The shuttle bus drivers shouted at passengers when they insisted boarding the bus even when it's full. The bell boy at the entrance pointed us the direction to the restaurant with an angry face, without saying a word. These are just two of the examples I experienced in my one night stay.  This is my second time in this hotel. As compared to last time, I noticed that the hotel staff have become significantly less friendly and patient.

We stay in this hotel just for one night and we were upgraded to a suite for our family.  The hotel has made many significant improvements and I believe the management has pay a lot of attentions and taking actions from guests comments.  I think the drawback is primarily coming from the hotel guest that are not very respectful to this smoking free hotel!,40
"I've spent my weekend with Sheraton with my other half for her birthday.  Since I would like to give her a surprise, I've made a request to do a room decoration for me via email.    The Guest Relations Team (Myn Lam / Rachel U / Mandy Yap) reacted promptly and did everything they can to fulfill my requests in terms of room decoration, helium balloons, banners, flowers and cake.  They are very professional and confirmed every single detail of the arrangement with me to make sure there is no mistake.   The plan was executed perfectly and the room decoration was impressive.    We both had a good time and I highly appreciate the professionalism of the Guest Relations team. Thank you Sheraton.",50
"Took a family room which was effectively a suite...main bedroom + kids themed room with a bunk bed. Good size for a suite. Kids theme was great for the kids. Pool was ok, but needed to be more kids friendly rather than a series 5 or 6 pools. Primarily stayed here for the Shrekfast which was very good and excellent value for money (versus Disneyland hotel). The amount of characters and photo opportunities was high, and the food was also good. Shopping centre has good food court....and also convenient for Venetian.",50
"I am a platinum member of SPG and booked two rooms for one night. When arrive the queue for the check-in was as bad as the queues at the passport control at the Chinese border. Soon we saw a shorter row for SPG members and than a lady old us about the check in on the 4th floor for platinum. Pff, what a luck, no waiting. We had a great stay and an outstanding service from the friendly staff at the club lounge.  Nice rooms and bathrooms. We did not notice we were in a hotel with something like 4000 beds. I even won my money back at the casino. We had diner at Bene, Italian restaurant, which was OK.",40
"Arrived via the free Taipa Ferry terminal shuttle bus to see a check in queue with at least 150 people in it. We were moved to a group check in counter (even though there were only 2 of us) and we figured this would be like an express line. It wasn't. Even with 3 staff on desks and only 2 people in front of us, we waited 45 minutes to reach the counter and then the check in process took about 10 minutes. It was just absurd.  It seems this hotel classifies you based on the price you paid for a room. I got an advanced 30% off discounted rate months ago which meant I was allocated a room in the 'Earth Tower' and almost the very last room furthest from the lifts on that particular floor. It was a ridiculously long walk to the entrance and even to the pool. I don't understand why the‚Ä¶",30
"Room is spacious and mattress is comfortable. I have informed hotel that we were celebrating anniversary and they have decorated the room with the sweet amenity.  Swimming pools are large and good for family trip.  Maybe this was in summer holiday, the queue for check in was so so long, the staff saw that I am pregnant so they allowed me to check in at member counter. Great service! ",50
"The issue was I entered to a room with welcome amenity that was with another guest name. So i went back to reception and said they gave me a wrong room and asked them to change another room. But then I got a room with strong ciegarette smell. I chose not to go back to reception again since I was so tired.  Upon checkout, I informed the recepionist regarding these. She told me maybe because someone smoked in this room before. (I understand this is not the fault from the hotel but the housekeeping should make sure room condition before selling to guest) Besides, I told her that no one offered welcome gift upon checkin. I asked if I could get the points now and she said okay (luckily i did ask). She also mentioned no room upgrade for this stay due to high occupancy but will offer‚Ä¶",30

Towels could be better quality. Had breakfast in room, well presented and served very nicely. Please get better sausages and wholemeal bread. Casino was good too!! Pool was fantastic ",40
"Sheraton Macao is one of the best properties by Sherton. We were upgraded to a suite and the suite was too lavish, even bigger than a studio apartment. The Venetian and Hard rock cafe are at a walking distance and Sheraton also has its own casino. Breakfast and the business centre has amazing dishes to be offered. All in all being at this place is a super luxurious and once in a life time experience!",50
"We stayed at the club room, access to club lounge was great. Check in was lengthy as there was a large queue at lobby, as a club room guest, we can direct check in at executive Lounge on 4th floor. The rooms with Cotai view and high floor, downside was the floor on the bathroom was not so clean. The club lounge included complimentary buffet breakfast , evening hors d‚Äôoeuvres and drinks, plus other snack and beverage options throughout the day. The evening cocktail like a buffet style, but the food is average. We top up the breakfast to Shrekfast character breakfast; these were great interesting with a DreamWorks character performance on stage and take a picture with your favorite DreamWorks characters. As a SPG gold member, we can late check out to 4:00 pm, we have enough time‚Ä¶",40
"Wouldn't comment much for the price offered. Can be considered reasonable. Comfortable beds, excellent hospitality from the staffs and great location.  However, the rooms are rather old. The management should consider renovation and upgrading works. Maintenance alone is not enough. Room carpets and bathroom fittings are old.   No security screening, which means the public could access guest floors without a room key. Security guards can be seen at every lift lobby, but I suppose their duty is not for screening purposes?

"I stay in this hotel with my sisters, and this is my second visit in this hotel. Hotel staff were friendly, when they know we have three person stay in the room, They(Room attendant) take the initiative to provide more of a disposable article for us. We reserved a deluxe twin bed room, room size was big and comfortable. Hotel room was modern and fashionable. Overall, I enjoy my stay in this hotel.",50
Hotel room was very nice and comfortable. Only issue was we were out on a smoking floor and the smell of smoke in the hallway was pretty disgusting. We did ask for a high floor with better view and I think this is why we were put a smoking floor. Check in took about an hour due to the queue which was very annoying. Breakfast was delicious and pool areas were brilliant. Staff were very helpful. Overall would def recommend hotel as there good connections to other hotels. Macau in general not great.,40
"I spent 1 night from Sunday to Monday at Sheraton Hotel Macau and it was great ! I am not going to complain about the service and the room because everything are fabulous. One thing that I dislike about the hotel is the crowd ! It was my 1st time seeing the queueing line like that with 20 front lines people just to do the check in. I spent about 30 mins just to do the check-in which is unlikely happen when I stay at 5star hotel. So I guess, Sheraton is one of the most popular hotel among tourist from China and you just need to be ready with the crowd and don't expect to enjoy the swimming pool peacefully either ! Eventho' they have a lot of pools the amount of guest just unbelievable, you can't expect to do swimming properly unless you just want to dip ur feet in the pool. I‚Ä¶",30
I thought las vegas was the ultimate sin city then i came here you have ho come to macao to see what china has done with the gambling.

"Spacious and comfort room, well-equipped hotel facilities (especially the gym). Great location: located at Sands Cotai Central and complimentary shuttle from and to the ferry terminal. Great value for money!",50
"I stayed at this hotel for a business event.  The room was a standard king with a work desk and separate bathroom.  Comfortable room, but it was the service that met us at every turn that made me feel like I was an honored guest.  If I find myself in Macao and need a place to stay, this is going to be my first choice.",40
"For the largest Sheraton in the world, service was better than expected and check-in and out, easy. Once you get over how busy the lobby is, it's a good stay. We had the Madagascar family suite- room for parents and an adjoining room for the kids fully decked to theme. Love the touches in kids room- board game, kiddie robes and slippers, balloons and themed toilet amenities. Top bunk bed could do with a softer mattress but otherwise, all good. Shrekfast was amazing- must try- very well done. It would be good if concierge offered to help bring luggage to room but I suppose with such a busy lobby, it would be faster to carry your own. Convenient location and polite staff- would stay there again",40
When we arrived at the hotel on the shuttle bus from the ferry terminal we realised how large the hotel is. We were dropped off at the other side of the hotel and had to carry out cases right through to reception.  Check in was easy Eduardo on reception spoke excellent English and gave us a room with a nice view which we requested. The rooms are large so there is plenty of space to put your luggage. The rooms were cleaned daily and to a good standard.  Breakfast was lovely and well worth the extra we paid when booking the room.  There are many swimming pools to choose from so there were always loungers available. The gym was excellent really big with a wide range of equipment. With the hotel being so large it does feel impersonal however this is inevitable. Overall we felt it‚Ä¶,40
"Attending a conference at the Hotel. Had a very good room in the Sky Tower.   Easy transfer from the HKG Airport on the ferry, and then the free shuttle to the hotel. Reception was busy but efficient, so the line moved quickly.  Staff were helpful, and everything worked. The bedroom was immaculate and the bathroom was OK - a little tired - but clean and functional.  Food (everything was catered) was excellent except for the one bad day they had a boxed lunch - terrible.  Fast and easy check out.  Down side - the elevators were very slow. And everything to buy was really expensive. The gaming tables were all high stakes compared to US tables.",40
"We had a lovely stay at the Sheraton Macao. The rooms were very spacious and of a great standard. The only thing I was unhappy about, was how busy the lobby area is and how long it took to check-in. I wouldn't expect a 20 minute wait at a 5 star hotel!",50
This is a great location and our price was certainly good value. Rooms are very good as are facilities including the pools. If there were a negative it would be its popularity which means traffic during checkin and checkout verges on chaos. However we were there during the summer holidays,40
"The family suite contains two bedrooms and linked together, which fits for 4 adults and a kid.  For additional bed only MOP2xx surcharge needed.  Shuttle buses run continuously from both ferries and wifi everywhere. Perfect for family stay.  ",50

"I spent 5 nights at the Sheraton in Macau. Spacious rooms, very good shower and overall clean room. The bed was comfortable and the tv station options had a good mix of english and other language choices. Check-in was quick, even with the late night and long line.  The hotel is connected to a number of other hotels and a mall with a decent food court. There are some fine dining options in the hotel and through the other connected hotels. The airport shuttle was efficient and is self service un terms of loading your luggage. You can buy tickets for the ferry at the hotel. The staff overall was very nice. I forgot the ""do not disturb"" light on all day and the checked in later that night to see if I wanted my room cleaned, which I thought was nice. ",40
"One of the best hotel we have ever stayed. Noise free rooms, Comfortable bed and pillow which made us have great sleep after travelling in turbojet from Hong Kong. Amazing buffet breakfast with variety of food but dinner buffet was just OK. They have 3 pools ‚Äì SALA, JAYA, TIKI and they are always full with guests. We stayed there for two days and I must say it was a great experience. The only Inconvenient part was the passage to lift lobby. It was always overcrowded with guests.   Make sure you carry additional HKD 2000 as security deposit at the time of check-in. They refund this amount at the time of check-out.",40
"I stayed a couple of months ago, don't remember exactly when. I got a very good price. The room was very good, large and suitable decoration. It strikes me as odd that the hotel rooms have a very decent design as the rest is mostly ghastly (but i suppose that what this kind of tourism is). But, then again, the really important thing is the room and that is very good. One plus is that the pool area has a long narrow one where you can really swim. Don't really know about service because i didn't need anything special. Check-in formalities very fast and very nice and we were offered a late check-out without my even suggesting it by a very nice receptionist. I won't forget. Oh, no BBC or Sky.",40
"I stayed 4 days for a conference.  I was told this is the largest Sheraton worldwide with 4000 rooms and massive conference center.  Macao is different than Vegas, Chinese gamblers pretty serious about their gambling and don't really drink a lot of alcohol while doing so.  So the casino lacks casual walk-up bars - this is a Macao thing more than this particular hotel.  So here is my hint:  close to the Sky Tower lobby there is an Italian restaurant called Bene.  They have a nice bar area and an outside patio as well.  Raymund (assistant manager) gave me great hospitality and made me feel quite at home.   Another good thing is that this hotel is attached to the Cotai shopping area which then links to Venetian and 4 Seasons and other hotels.  So without going outside you can‚Ä¶",40
"It's very good, but after our superior experience in Grand Hyatt before, I will say I'd prefer other hotels. Don't get me wrong, this hotel is also very good but Macau's hotels are all very good. The competition is fierce, so it has to be more than that.  We stayed in a Deluxe Room with one additional bed. The room was clean and tidy. There's not much of a WOW factor in it. Out of the room, the gym was however extraordinary! It's in a decent size, spacious, all NEW and top of the line equipment. There are quite a few choices of pools as well! if you like to just soak with a nice drink and chat with your friend or lover, you can pick the round multi ""slices"" pool.  If you'd like to train up a bit or want more sun bath without children splashing you, you could go to another side‚Ä¶",40
"Just concluded our family bonding in Macau and we had satisfactory experience staying @ Sheraton. Though when we arrived, it's so crowded at the concierge and I'm feeling uneasy already due to the long cue lines waiting for our reservation to be serve. Good, the room assigned to us was satisfactory to my standard. How I wished that reception area at the lobby were that spacious so as not to be bored while waiting for our room assignment. The hotel lobby were eaten by the casino and since I have kids we me we have no options but to stand and wait. Good that when we arrived at our room, I felt so relax and at home. Overall passes to my preferred hotel stadard.",30

It was my fianc√©e's 4th trip to Macao and on her previous 3 occasions, she could not get tickets to Dancing Water at City of Dreams.  When she told me this after we checked-in, I sought help immediately with the Concierge team and they promptly helped me to secure the tickets despite being very busy with lots of other guests at their desk.  The manager who helped me (Domingos Lao) even offered me to call him anytime during our stay if I need any special arrangements to make the stay more memorable and romantic.  I would have given this stay a 5 star rating if not for the following: 1.‚Ä¶",40

"Conference visitor. Huge place, i mean HUGE ! I reckon my room was 15 mins fromthe Lobby. Overall Everything perfectly adequate, if not outstanding. Two observations : no ' tidy my room' sign, so room service can arrive anytime. Romm tidy not to European standards - beds and towels, but not much else. Secondly, the the room safe was  not fixed into the wardrobe, so you could pick up and steal the entire contents ( if you could leave the building). Pool very nice, food fine (but pricey)  and i couldn't find a communal lounge bar - which is critical if you are to attract a western audience.  Shopping expensive.",30
I have been there three times with my family. The hotel is new and nice decor. Room is big enough for a family of 3. We have tried the buffet restaurant and there are good variety of food. The only downside is the hotel lobby is too busy all the time and difficult for us to fetch a taxi. Every time we have to queue for taxi no matter what time of the day. Pool area is good with separate areas. But pool bar has limited selection of food. There were only 3 items available during the day we were there. ,40
"Service was abundant- from check in, to getting ice delivered, to check out, if you need something (even if you don't), the staff is right there ready to help. The bed linens were very nice, comfortable, and soft. Room was a good size with large windows, a very large bathroom. The downsize (which I usually experience in Europe) is there is no plug in the bathroom for the hair dryer and there is no plug available near the bed to charge the cell phone. However, there were multiple plugs available at the desk. Coffee supplies and water were refilled daily. The one thing I didn't understand is why they didn't remove the dirty glasses or cups daily.  The pools are very large and clean. Lots of options for restaurants as well. The concierge was extremely helpful and patient. I'd‚Ä¶",40

"First time in Macau and stayed here. First impressions are how much it's like the big uber hotels in LV - big gambling area, fancy restaurants and shopping nearby, lots of marble etc. The differences however are two fold:  1) The rooms are far superior, bigger, more modern and better appointed   2) This hotel is surrounded by others that are still in construction so it feels like a building site outside. That probably isn't a problem to the vast majority of people but if you want to go for a run outside beware.  There are some impressive hotels and other infrastructure going in so in a few short years it will be amazing outside but for now it's just the inside that is. I would recommend staying here.  ",40
"The Sheraton Hotel in Macau is run under the Sands Casino Umbrella Group,  that's why it's adjoining Conrad,  Venetian or even Four Seasons.  For me this has a nice color scheme and is clean,  well insulated as I can't sleep when I hear the neighbors or banging close the doors - here it is always quiet and hence I have been staying here over 15-20 times.  The restaurants here are also not to be missed (look I write about Food and Travel after all on my website and magazines).  BENE serves authentic Italian and their pastas are affordable but to die for.

Don't get why this was... since the casino floors are like in the middle, you need to walk around the whole complex to get there if you are with kids, really terrible after a bouncy boat trip from Hong Kong. To get to the breakfast restaurant we had to walk like 10 minutes every morning, service isnt great.

The rooms are nicely decorated and the beds amazingly comfortable. The swimming pools are well designed with plenty of sun loungers to go around (tip - the pool quietens down significantly between 12:30 and 15:00). The choice of food by the pool could be better.

"Recently I just return for a long business trip in Macau and Sheraton is always the first choice to me.  Nice hotel, strategy location, convenient shutter service and helpful staffs.  A special thanks to Jessica and Vera for their hospitality, make me feel warm and always welcome home! ",50
Stayed in an executive room and although the room the average the evening cocktails were more a buffet meal than a few nibbles. The staff were very friendly and helpful and when going back will be staying here for sure,50
"We stayed for 5 nights at the Club in Sheraton in July. It was our second stay. Last time v got totally floored by the services and the Staff of the Club particularly Carrick Chan who made our stay indeed very comfortable and pleasant. This time Giulian Langone joined the list with his outstanding personalised attention with his smiling , humble and helpfl attitude. Both Carrick and Giulian went out of way to arrange Veg dishes for my wife.   The Club is indeed a differentiator at Sheraton. The entire staff is very well trained and looks after the guests very well. There is a separate chk in facility 2 there. Also there is outstanding wake-up call facility ; very useful if u r a Casino person.  Our first time stay was at Venetian but now v have totally shifted to Sheraton,‚Ä¶",50
"I can't complain about the hotel we were well treated and the room and facilities were excellent. As we travelled in the warmer months the pools got a thorough work out. The hotels location is probably a hinderance, it was a 20, 30, 40 minute trip to Macau depending on traffic and taxis were the quickest option. A tip for travellers is that all Hotels have free shuttle buses that run to the ferry terminal were you can shuttle jump and travel to another hotel in a different location around town.",40
"It is a very nice hotel, you can walk to everywhere, services are great. Room is spacious and clean. Beautiful marble bathroom with separate tub and shower. Conveniently located and connected to a plaza which has tons of shops and food. Pool was gorgeous.",40
"I have just returned from a weekend break in Macau at the Sheraton and can not recommend it highly enough.  We had been told by friends about the excellent kid's programmes at the hotel and wanted to try them out for our 4 year old.    The first impression I got when we arrived was how vast the hotel complex is - all the promotional literature proclaims this to be the largest Sheraton hotel in the world.  But it is also the first of the Macau casino complexes that I have visited that had the more Vegas feel of an entertainment venue as opposed to just a casino or luxury shopping mall.  Our room was great - a two bedroom family suite which had a well designed and comfortable main room for the adults, as well as a brilliantly designed kids room.  Ours was all decked out in Kung Fu‚Ä¶",50
"my husband and I stayed 5 nights at the Sheraton Macau and could not find fault in any aspect of our stay. We booked a club room and we were very happy with the benefits it provided. It was exceptional value for money, and very convenient. All staff were unfailingly polite and helpful, and nothing was too much trouble. A special mention to the staff in the club dining room and bar, especially Ronald for the margaritas, and Ana for the extra hot lattes.",50
We were stayed in these hotel for one night. The booking was though the on line agent to reserve with reasonable price. The price was including two breakfast.  The lobby was great and a lot of Chinese people walking around. The Reception counter were separate four different areas for check-in. The front desk staffs were helpful. The hotel is separate into two towers. The security guard will cross check in front of the entrance of lift lobby for those suspect people. The room is fantastic but only think the front desk staff cannot put me to non smoking room king size bed. The room is smelly. The check out system is good as you can do by myself in the check out machine. Although we already reserved the breakfasts but they can allow you to choose to take breakfast or lunch buffet .‚Ä¶,30
"We stayed one night whilst on a break from Hong Kong. When travelling by ferry there is a complementary transfer available via the shuttle buses to and from the ferry terminal.  First impressions of the hotel were that it was huge (it has over 3800 rooms)! The check in process really showed the scale hotel with a wait of 40 minutes in an airport style queuing system. There are two towers at the Sheraton, Sky and Earth. Our room was located on the 32nd floor of the Earth tower. The room was a good size with oversized twin beds and modern, high quality furniture. The highlight of the room was the view over the Cotai Strip. From our room we could see the Venetian as well as Galaxy Hotels which were a real spectacle at night. The bathroom in the room was of a high quality with a‚Ä¶",40
"We spent our wedding anniversary at the Sheraton Macao Hotel which is located at Cotai Central. We took the ferry from Kowloon to Cotai and got on the shuttle bus after clearance the immigration smoothly.The check-in lady staff was nice, helpful and service orientated. There are many shops (with summer discounts) around the hotel if you enjoy shopping. The swimming pools, big or small of around 10 on the 4th floor suit family and kids the best. We enjoy very much of the cuisine at the food court. Check out was fast as we have chosen to take the express check-out.",40
We chose the Sheraton for a weekend away for our anniversary. The bus service pick up was prompt. Check in was lengthy as there was a large queue. Pay your deposit by card so you don't have to queue on checkout.The hotel was huge so can feel slightly impersonal however the hotel kindly left flowers on our bed and macaroons for our anniversary.  It would have been helpful on check in if we could have been given a map of the complex as it is huge as well as information on breakfast and locations.  The breakfast was okay but not brilliant although service was good. The pool areas are nice and not too busy. You can so go there after checkout if your ferry is later. The consierge team were helpful to book shows etc.  ,40
"I usually stay at less expensive hotels whenever I travel but since I was travelling with my parents and I wanted them to be very comfortable, I booked with Sheraton. It was relatively pricey but it was very worth it. The hotel was huge and luxurious. The price was actually cheap if you compare it with the other hotels in the area.   Our room as well as the bathroom was very spacious. Everything was comfortable and we had a good view of The Venetian. Location was great. The hotel was connected to shopping malls, restaurants and other hotels through indoor bridges.  They offer free shuttle service to and from the hotel and ferry terminal. The breakfast buffet had good variety and everything was delicious. All the staff from valet, to reception, to the restaurant were very‚Ä¶",50
"stayed for a night with my wife. Check in time was 1 pm and there were full of people in the lobby (mainly Chinese) but acceptable. Although the room was not big when comparing with Venetian and Galaxy, it was perfect for a couple or even family. The maintenance of the room is good and the pillow and mattress were good. We feel comfortable. The breakfast was good with wide variety of food. Want to praise the chef who made the omelet. he was professional and concentrated on his work. Wonderful.  However, here some points to complaint:  1) when We went back the hotel at midnight through 1/F of the shopping mall , the lift lobby on 1/F is closed only with a small notice nearby. We had to walk a long distance back to G/F. You know it's very tire after one day shopping and walking.‚Ä¶",40
"We stayed in the hotel for honeymoon. The hotel was very kind as to give us a high floor room with beautiful view of the venetian and the pool, a greeting card and some macaroons. The room was very nice and comfortable, spacious also. The bathroom is also spacious. Very easy access to every tourist attractions in Macao by free shuttle bus. Walking distance to the venetian and city of dreams for even more free shuttle buses, shopping and dining options.  For a quick checkout process, opt for credit card for your key deposit. So you can use the express check out table instead of the queue line for those who need to get refunds for their key deposits in cash. ",50
"One of the newer properties in Macao and it is huge. The room was really luxurious; large bed, spacious bathroom with a large tub and separate shower. The staff who checked us in was also very friendly and helpful with the shuttle information. Like every casino hotel in Macao, there is free shuttle service around the island. What i really liked is the variety of shopping outlets and the express check out service. It is also connected to Venetian via a bridge.  Totally loved the property and the room. Wish we stayed another night.",50
"Went there for only one night and while we understand that is really full of people, we were extremely disappointed by the lack of service and food at breakfast! We arrived at 10am! Still 30 mins before they closed the buffet and they had many items gone.  Went to get some eggs and first: the station is just so dirty and disorganised that you don't fancy eating there, and second, the chef, while really polite, couldn't understand what I meant by fried eggs!  Great point: the people at check in were really accommodating! ",30
"Highly recommended for family with kids because the rooms with two double beds cost the same as the ones with one king bed.  When compare with other hotels in the area, Sheraton Macao is certainly not the most deluxe one.  However, given the competitive summer offers, this hotel is already very good to me.  At the check-in counter, there were quite a lot of people lining up.  Fortunately, I am a SPG member which allows me to use a separated check-in area with a much shorter queue and some welcoming juice.  The room is clean and spacious.  There are separated bath tub and shower area in the bathroom.  The hotel provides a French press for you to make coffee and there are 4 complimentary bottles of water.  The free Wi-Fi is very good; there is a router in each room to make sure‚Ä¶",50
"The location of this hotel is convenient and easily accessible to nearby areas, within walking distance. Free shuttles are provided to/from airport. The hotel is a part of the Sands Cotai Complex which houses several hotels, shopping malls, restaurants, food courts and casinos.  The room we stayed is spacious in size with great amenities. The beds are comfortable.  Will definitely be back and also recommend to friends and family.",40
"Check in smooth though the ""bond"" is the same charge for each night you stay.  The place is massive and I was in the sky tower unsure if that's because I entered that side when dropped off by the complimentary shuttle from air port (has wifi and & 10 min drive).  The room was in 23 and view of pools and the building of the Parisian so one day with be special.  Bed & pillows heaven and room very big as was bathroom with great water pressure and mega clean.  Wifi perfect and is every where with the hotel connected to others by air con walk ways.  Gym-sauna-spa perfect and staff just lovely as were pools though only open till 8pm which was the only let down to me.  Buffet breakfast at feast out of this world and one of the best of had something for all, I would love to return and‚Ä¶",50
"I would like to take this opportunity to thank you and your staff for the wonderful evening we had to celebrate my husband's birthday. We could see from day one that the hotel service has a great quality, both because of its comfortable and appropriate facilities, as well as service and constant concern for our comfort. Thank you especially Ms. Kylie He for being aware of our requirements. Thanks again to the team that made our stay a good time, comforting and secure. We are sure that when we return to Macau, we will go back to your hotel.",50
"Enormous rooms, well appointed, good minibar, comfy beds and great showers. Check-in was terribly slow, but service in China is always slow, so was not expecting to be through in a flash. I had a fantastic suite, and it was the equivalent of 150 Aussie dollars a night. Staff are helpful, although a little slow to bring drinks, etc. I would stay here again though.  I thought it was great for the price. If you want the Ritz-Carlton, go stay there. This is cheaper and in my opinion, much better value. ",40
"It was a great stay and a very fun celebration of my birthday together with my friends. I love the music room where we had karaoke. Normally, when I stayed in the hotel I always request top floors where for me is a less noise and I felt happy about that they grant my request. I love room#3429!!! The room is very big! We really enjoyed our stay! ",40
"There are heaps of hotels in Macau. Choosing  Sheraton was a family choice but personally I would not. 1. U would choose Sheraton because u r member of the hotel group. - Starwood. 2. Outstanding service?. ( not all hotel the same) 3. Value for money.? ( only the club floor that is all your meals are there) For my family it's the above 3. This trip we were upgraded to a suite so I should be thankful but the sofa bed that was supposed to be set up was not. This was done after 3 calls and it was past midnight n half an hour later tt they did. Bed springs was protruding... Sigh! Anyway. They give a rollaway the next night. Discomfort settled. Food in the club- amazing. Almost can be your breakfast, lunch cum dinner all in. Great value for money but alas u will not need to eat any‚Ä¶",30
"This hotel is the comparable to any higher end hotel in las vegas strip. It is your usual casino hotel where you have your gambling downstairs and rooms in a tall building. We really enjoyed walking throughout the indoor sky bridge system that connects different hotels, shopping stores and restauraunts in the Macau strip. Over all it's a good hotel, nothing special  or different than any other vegas hotel. The rooms were clean spacious and quiet. The restrooms were big and clean and the bedding very comfortable. They have very good dinner and breakfast buffet. check in and out process was very quick and efficient. This hotel has buses to take you to the ferry to go to Hong Kong, very convenient and efficient. very good view from the buses make sure you have your camera ready for‚Ä¶",40

"Its my return visit to Sheraton Macao, but my first time in their Executive suite room with the Club privileges. Needless to say, the suite room was a WOW for its luxurious fittings and contemporary design! Hotel is really only a shell without fantastic staff members! It was a weekend stay, and the occupancy rate was obviously super peak/high Yet, I can see all the staff members working hard and efficient and attentive to all the guests needs/demands. Miss Amy Wu deserves a special mention, thanks Amy and your team! I will certainly return to Sheraton Macao again for my next trip to Macao despite newer hotels eg Galaxy",50
"Had a great stay at the Sheraton.  Impressive facilities.  Excellent staff and incredible thoughtfulness.  From room service to meeting facility services - the staff were outstanding and professional.  Rooms, while a little dated, were well maintained and serviced as well.  Drawbacks: Club lounge had average food and the 5th floor meeting room lobby (which is the size of about 2 football fields, I think) really had a smell of stale cigars and not climate controlled.  They were trying to fix the problem, but not sure what was causing it.   But the meeting rooms were perfect.     Highly recommend the Sheraton",50
"Stayed over the weekends with some friends and the service was one of the worst I have ever encountered. While the hotel looks ok, it was let down by its untrained staff. The checkin took almost half an hour even without a queue.   First of all they couldn't find my bookings. When they have found it after 10mins, the reception asked me if I want to have the rooms that I've booked to be on the same floor, but then proceed to give us rooms on different floors because ""it was busy"". Finally, the staff said our checkout time could be extended to noon, but when I double checked the next morning, I was told it is 11am. All this and I never heard them apologizing and said a word of sorry.  Don't stay here if you want a relaxed holiday",20
"Overall solid hotel in the Cotai area of Macau. Its part of the Sands resorts so its connected to the Venetian, Four Seasons, Conrad, etc.  It's also very close to Galaxy and City of Dreams, but you'd have to walk outside to get to these areas.

This is my 2nd time staying at this hotel. Had to wait nearly an hour to checkin at the SPG counter. Completely shocking! Realised later its due to slow checkin system. We were also told to 1.5hr for in room food service  Really unacceptable for a 4 star hotel. It felt like Sheranton is under resourced to serve high volume of customers.   They do make it up with friendly smiles and initiatives to serve staff. We were there for the pool party at hard rock and were given complimentary water proof pouches! That's exemplary! We also asked for many bottles of water which was promptly delivered to our rooms. ,30
"We stayed at the club floor.  Access to club lounge was great.  Great variety of food and drinks served, although service was not great.  Staff were not proactive in serving.  We need to ask for plates to be cleared or ask again and again for orders to be taken.  Room was small for Macau.  I was surprised by the even smaller bathroom.  Smallest shower stall I'd ever been in.  Service was bad.  Reception at the Club lounge on 4th floor was friendly but nothing spectacular. Free welcome drink and cold towel was a nice touch. Didn't even note my husband's birthday after looking at the passports.  Glad that we didn't have to queue at the lobby, it looked extremely busy, almost market like.

"From booking and confirmation to leaving the hotel, the service was impeccable. Usually there are one or two letdowns even for the best hotels but there is nothing i can critique on, for Sheraton Macau.  Rooms are spacious, clean and modern.

"Positives: Good service from the staff; fairly decent fitness room with free weights, treadmills, cycles and machines; the one-bedroom suite was large with nice views; the rooms were fairly clean; the bed was very comfortable; many English speaking stations on the TV; the included internet was fast and not censored, which means I can check all blogs on my favorite teams.  Negatives: It's a casino so you have a lot of people everywhere on the property; long lines at check-in and out; breakfast was plain and not all that good.",30
Very comfy place to stay at when u visit Macao for visit.  Good location. Good interconnection with free shuttle buses with other hotels and districts of Macao. Couple of restaurants with full of delicious dishes.  Breakfast - large range of seafood was just great. ,50

We have stayed at the Sheraton before and always said we would try the Family suite sometime. We finally booked it and couldn't have been happier with having such an amazing space for the kids.   The exceptional service and hotel facilities continue to impress us and we would definitely recommend it.,50
"This is a reasonably good hotel. Bit impersonal. Didn't like the long queue to check in - felt like waiting for some favour. Otherwise it's nice. Very good location from the Casinos point of view, on the Cotai Strip. Would do well to have better signs for people to find out directions. Rooms are large and comfortable. Nice toilets. Housekeeping is neat but not the best. Expected turn-down service of the bed in the evening, but seems that's not in their service agenda.",40

My request for early check in and late check out was granted as I was half expecting it .We eventually got our room, finding our way there wasn't easy, one of the staff noticed our issue and personally took us to the lift as there were many, that would take us to our floor.

Stayed at the Sheraton Macao with family on a holiday. The hotel is HUGE and one tends to get lost. But it is very conveniently located and connected to the iconic Venetian hotel. We were upgraded to a family suite which was very comfortable and the kids loved it. The check in experience and the concierge interaction was one of the finest I have ever experienced.  Given a chance would love to go and stay there again.,50
"Macau Sheraton is nice, huge, it shares a big building with Holidays Inn and other 3 hotels, that's why it's so big, it has a nice shopping center too.  We did a casino hopping from one to another one, there are shuttle buses take you to different casino.  It was fun.",40
"Sheraton Macao hotel, provide free shuttle bus to the Macau city, to the airport. If you know how to used the free shuttle bus, you could save a lot money. This hotel located in the mall, going up to your room, it can be very confused due to the big building. If you're going in to wrong elevator, you're not able to go to your room. For first day, you need to take awhile to get yourself used to this building, it just too huge, just look for a landmark, then it's easier for you to go for a right elevator and go to your room.  The breakfast in this hotel, they got lots of varieties and a lot choices to choose for, if you have to be there early for breakfast, if not there's going to be a long queue.

"Before I travelled I read reviews saying service at this hotel was poor. Well I'm not sure I agree. Sure, I had cause to grumble when the girl in the food court dismissed me like a fly ( but it's the food court in the shops so let's face it, she hasn't been trained, although I would argue she should be). but... The staff in the club lounge have been outstanding. Really personable and attentive.   Despite many, many rude Chinese fat cat gamblers treating them like the girl in the food court treated me, they never failed to greet us with a smile.

You can walk over to city of dreams to catch house of dancing waters.You can easily walk over to the famous Venetian hotel. -Spacious and clean Room and bath room.  All hotels around that area seems to provide shuttle buses .  What we did not like:  -Strong kind of smell of detergent in the room. It was not pleasant, what's up with that! -You have to queue for so long to check in even on a weekday, we were quite surprised. The place itself is damn crowded, we had to queue for 40 minutes. -Customer service is alright, but unlike other Sheraton hotels we have been to before, everything seems to be done in a rush, but we can't really blame them, they have too many customers.",30
The Sheraton Macao is part of a collection of hotels which are all connected. You can in an enclosed walk way over to the Venetian Resort. The Sheraton is a very nice and modern hotel.

"It's my second time in Sheraton Macau (the first time is business trip) and this time goes with my family.  We are there for the shrekfast and Kung fu panda academy, which is quite fun.  I just feel exhausted to run around and take pictures with different characters within a 90mins breakfast.  There are rooms for improvements in the services as some of the staffs are not even sure where the make payments for the Kung fu panda academy.  Anyway, they do have a few very helpful staffs, Bruno Miguel and Jovi Luk, from SPG frontdesk.  I have to emphasize Jovi for her patience to handle my incidents and she has done it very well.  ",50
"Great place to stay and experience Macau and the Casinos, close to shops and other top Casinos. Rooms are excellent , very spacious and with big Bathrooms. Plenty of restaurants with all types food available.Express checkout saves you time when checking out and the Transfers to the Ferry / Airport all provided.",40
"We live on Mainland China, not far from Macau.  We occasionally like to escape the mainland and head to Macau or Hong Kong for the weekend. We usually stay with friends in Macau, but this time we decided to celebrate a birthday and stay at the Sheraton. We found a great mid-week deal and we were happy with our stay.  We were already familiar with the hotel as relatives had stayed there in the past and we had been to Cotai Shoppes many times.  Thus, I think we were just used to the large size of the hotel.  Upon check-in we were greeted and got through the line quickly.  When the customer service rep found out it was my birthday, she was able to get us late check out (2pm!) free of charge, and we had a lovely card and a delicious slice of cake delivered to our room later that‚Ä¶",50
Forget about the pricing. This place will probably tear a hole in your pocket. My company organized a convention here in January. Beautiful rooms. Clean and spacious. Very quiet as well. The hotel is quite huge too. The casino however is below average. Not as big as Venetian or Sands. But I am not complaining because I am not a gambler. Next to this hotel is Hard Rock. You can get a bit of night life here. The hotel is also located across the bridge from the old Macau. Hope that is enough to help you around Macau. Have fun.,50

"Based on other reviews, we had braced ourselves for a long wait at check-in when we arrived for our one-night stay in April, but as I had signed up as a SPG Member upon booking our room, we were ushered to the SPG family check-in area, and were attended to immediately by Eduardo.  He was absolutely fabulous, and extremely attentive ... and the little touches for the kiddies at check-in (balloon animals, and goodie bags) brought some genuine joy to our tired littlies.  (I didn't notice any long queues at the standard check-in area either ... and we arrived at 3pm.)

"Stayed in the family suite which is an awesome size and the kids loved the bunk bed and little extras like kids dressing gowns & slippers etc. However, no toys or books in the room and only Cartoon Channel available on TV. Kids are too young for playstation. Gorgeous kiddy styled cabanas by the pool but no kids menu for food and drinks. No kid friendly restaurants either, they all have high chairs but no kids menus or portions. Swimming pool is basic, no major kid features like slides or anything. Nothing else in the hotel that is super kid friendly other than Shrekfast (highly recommend) or possible shows/activities that you can book and pay for (tried Kung Fu Panda Academy but left early). Warning on check in and out, takes a min of 20-30mins which is pretty painful when with‚Ä¶",30
"The hotel is one of the three in the Cotai Central, where a many hotels all gather.   SPG member can check-in in a special area. This greatly reduced the time of waiting for check in because the hotel is rather big and there was a long queue waiting for check-in. However, when I was there, it takes more time than I expected to wait, even there were only four people in front of me. Two receptionists were helping out. When the line was getting longer and some guests came with big family which may take longer to check in, no one came to help to reduce the waiting time. This looks a bit disappointing.   Even so, the room is amazing: spacious, comfortable, enjoyable, tidy, clean, and well maintained. I felt like I was the first one to use the room (though I know I am not). Even the‚Ä¶",50

The reception staff at SPG is good and polite.  However there is no personal service offer to SPG members especially when you paid for a flexible normal rate without any discount offered.  Also remember to check your key card before leaving the room as you will found that the key may be default just like my previous experience that I queued for long time in SPG counter to change to a new one.,40
Room was spacious and location was decent.  Went with family that doesnt gamble to tour old Macau.  Distance to town was not too bad and easy to take cabs.  Hotel is huge and connected to shopping mall. So no real sense of nature and not real environment to relax.  But pool and sauna were very spacious and comfortable. With lots of green around. That alone was worth the visit. Relatively reasonable food in small restaurants inside casino.,40
"Good location in Cotai Strip, walking distance with almost all hotels / casinos / malls in the area.  Good hotel if traveling with kids.  We were there during for New Year's celebration and the hotel was full but service was great, rooms were big, standard rooms can fit a family of four.  Though was not able to try the pool during this month, but with the looks of it the kids will enjoy it during summer season.",40
"This was a 3 year Anniversary trip with my girlfriend and we had chosen this hotel, and I planned to organize a proposal to her. I sent email to hotel in advance for further assist about this plan, and they advised so many ways to make it perfect. I am appreciated their effort on it.  Firstly, they had free upgrade our room to executive suite, and lie to my girlfriend that upgrade is for our first time visit. The suite was large and have a wonderful bathroom and feel comfortable, there were a pair of swan which make by 2 towels in heart shape so romantic. Also, I requested the front desk to give the third key card for my friends to decelerate  my room to make a surprise for the proposal. And everything make perfect so I did it. Thanks for the warm arrangement from the hotel.",50
"Checked into a 2 bedroom family suite for 2 adults and 2 kids (10, 12).  Room was beautifully appointed and huge. Bunk beds in children's room and wii playstation so they were happy.  Hotel room was immaculate and very clean so no complaints there at all.    Breakfast at Feast restaurant was very good with usual large array of breakfast items.    Here's the problem with the Sheraton in Macao.  The service - or rather total lack of it.  You are just another nameless, faceless person wandering through the massive mall of the hotel.   We spent an afternoon at the pool (not great layout of pool but small mini pools dotted around).  We wanted to order food but no waiters to be found. We eventually got someone's attention and ordered food but the attitude was almost 'don't bother us'.‚Ä¶",40

The place is huge and we got lost a couple of times getting off the lift, then on top add all of the people. After reading others reviews here, we booked a Club Room in the Sky tower, that was a great idea, not only do you get the full Spg club benefits, like the club lounge with their snacks and drinks during the day you also get a separate breakfast restaurant, and in the evening free drinks and a buffet dinner. Other SPG clubs have many finger food to eat in the evening, but this one had a full buffet dinner.

"Macau's 5-star hotels are too busy counting the cash to pick up the telephone's receiver so the wife had to book via the agent. Yes, agents still exist, albeit only just.   The Sheraton it is. She broke it to me gently. I review hotel chains globally for some part of my meagre living and yes, i am a huge fan of the dying art of hospitality which is why i admire some brands and not all. Anyway, this is supposed to be about the Sheraton Macau and not about me. Then again, that is arguable. I am the Guest (remember what that is?) and were it not for me, hotels wouldn't live.

As the buffet is located right at the Sala pools we had a swim before dinner. The service was really great: attentive, quick, friendly and pro-active. The manager who we booked with came pro-actively to us to welcome the group and was assisting the whole time. We recommend everyone to spend an evening at the pool side restaurant. It is one of the few places in Macau where you can relax, have a safe secluded environment and you can swim, eat and play at the same time. We will be back again soon!",50

Venetian I feel is a bit hyped , however one visit to the hotel is enough, family suites there are pricy. Holiday inn and Conrad are part of the sands resort Sheraton group and they have a daily afternoon parade with all the dream works characters . Check in and out was super quick and simple.

The only advantage for this design probably is that you don't need to go out in the hot summer. You can spend a day in this complex without getting bored. The main disadvantage of the hotel was that they lacked the shuttle bus service. They had shuttle going to the two ferry terminal but that's all. If you want to go to other hotels, you could either go by taxi or walk to venetian and then use their shuttle service.

ITC MAURYA in Delhi and H5 Luxury hotel in Bangkok)  Later in the evening we went to the lounge for the cocktails and snacks they have a wide varity of snacks, cocktails, deserts etc. One of the best business lounge.   Unfortunately I stayed there for one night only. But looking forward to stay there again.",50
This is my second times here at Sheraton Macao both with SPG Moments. Since the hotel location is just right opposite the Venetian that has an enormous space for gambler and shoppers. My stay was lovely and fantastic with overall of 8/10 except an overcrowded on the weekend.,50

When I was checking-in, the staff really outdid themselves making me feel welcome, as they were extremely kind and helpful.  The food that was served for the evening cocktail and breakfast was amazing! Very interesting variety of local and foreign food, and they were all pretty tasty too!  I initially booked an executive suite, the free upgrade to the deluxe suite was, of course, just awesome. There was a room just for lounging and it was the best!  The internet speed at this hotel is very fast, I usually experience much slower speeds for free WiFi, but I managed to stream HD videos with no lag at all (after the initial buffer delay) while connected to the wifi!",50

I stayed on the 21st floor with the windows facing the airport. The style of the rooms follow the classical 'Vegas look"", you may like it or not. I found it pretty comfortable and neat. Wifi is for free and works OK (...but WhatsApp calls are blocked). Value for money is good. The yellow/green airport buses are waiting just outside the arrival hall. Considering the comfort and attractions the Sheraton offers set in relation to the price per night it's a full 5 points.",50

Positive: the hotel has direct access to shopping mall and the Venetian complex. It complies to Sheraton standard of comfort. It is clean, bed is super comfortable, bathroom is nice  To be improved: there was a construction site beside which even with super thick windows can still slightly be heard.

Club Lounge also exceeded our expectations, with a variety of snacks during evening happy hours...!! However, the only negative was the waiting time every-time we visited the Club Lounge, which seemed like the hotel had over-booked in relation to the capacity which can be handled.

Its like a city in itself. Best part is Venetian and its gondolas. Amazing place to stay no matter what hotel u choose, experience will be amazing. BTW, its on a separate island called Cotai which is relatively new place with hotels only. The Macau city is another island.

Staff were excellent on arrival with one of the concierge team members escorting us right up to the executive lounge.   Good amenities, comfortable bedding and great spread at the club lounge during happy hour.  It's so substantial everyone was able to eat dinner there.  Breakfast was also good quality and variety.   A good choice for everything you need, good amenities and shops and restaurants a very easy walk away within the complex.",50

I got sick during my stay, and they had a doctor I could see for 600 HKD, and he gave me medicine to feel better. This hotel is perfectly located if you are just going to gamble, but if you want to see the city, you will need to take a taxi. There is a language barrier, so the hotel gave us a taxi card which had Chinese writing on it of all the main attractions so we could get to where we needed to go.",50
Comfortable room and good to have late chech out (We checked in at 8 something). It will be even better if the hotel can provide bath salts.   The free lunch buffet was a bit disappointed though. It was too crowded and food was consumed too fast. But overall a very enjoyable stay.,50
"Excellent experience and truly Starwood.  Strangely, all Sheraton hotels greets you with a familiar scent as one enters the lobby.  The check in experience was efficient and professional The rooms were new and excellent. The suite was LARGE! The location is convenient with free shuttle bus to the Taipa ferry terminal. The shuttle bus even had free wifi",50
At the largest Sheraton in the world I stayed in the Club floors.  These floors and facilities were as big as any hotels that I have stayed in but the staff helped to make it feel like an exclusive club.  Not as intimate as many places in the chain but great facilities and service.,40

As expected, Macau was full of tourists and even though it was a holiday weekend, and there were tourists everywhere, the staff were friendly, helpful and cheerful at all times.  Rooms were spacious and the view was great.  The shopping mall inside the hotel was great.  As we were travelling with a little one, we did not get to gamble, but entertainment were abundant!

"I personally liked every aspect of this hotel. It's huge and the check-in counters were busier than Hong Kong immigration counter. Since we were SPG members, there were separate counters for the members. Make sure you join SPG before you go to any Starwood hotel.   They gave us a late check-out for 1pm but the hotel check-in time is 3pm and checkout time was 11am, which for me was so less compared to what we paid for the hotel. Then again, we kept our luggage at the concierge and went to explore the Macau Island.   The view from our room was beautiful. Everything about Macau was good. Loved the stay at the hotel. Spacious rooms and extra comfortable beds and pillows. The toilet was ginormous with a tub.   Breakfast was excellent. Couldn't run out of options. ",40

I came here with my relatives and mother. We stayed in connecting room which was convenient to communicate between two family! Staff were polite and friendly. My cousin and I went to the Dreamswork breakfast and it was really fun... however it was really really overpriced in my opinion. There was a large selection of food in the breakfast though. The pool was fairly clean with just little fallen leaves but well maintained overall!,40

The suite was really good size and very well appointed, the hotel/casino is only 18 months old, has been built to the standards of the top Las Vegas Strip hotels. Club Lounge served a great range of food for breakfast and the best club evening food and drinks I have come across. Once you have got past the casinos and shops, head outside to the pools, and I do mean pools, there is a pool for everyone and every age, no sharing one big pool when that have pools and cabanas to suit everyone. Would definitely recommend this hotel/casino to singles, couples and family.",50
"To begin with, I did the booking by directly contacting the hotel reservations staff. I noticed that a lot of irrelevant replies were there from the reservations staff most of the time. I am a travel agent and I was expecting a better price and deal from them.  We took a package deal Enduring Moments which is reasonable but the same is published all over the internet as well. Only reason we booked directly was to get the SPG points.   Check-in was 1500 which is quite late where as the standard check-out is at 1100 hrs? This is not unreasonable. When we reached out to the SPG counter and it took forever in the counter.. He maybe a trainee or a new staff and did not understand english very well.  The room was an absolute beauty.. toilet was spacious and clean. Bed was comfortable.‚Ä¶",40
"Queue to checkin like disney land! being the worlds biggest hotel, i had to queue in a lane system much like a large themepark, when i finally got to the clerk, i was asked for a 300 USD depoit, i didnt have credit card or the HKD currecny which they requested, i then had to change USD to HKD at the hotels exchange rate and proceed. Once my deposit ran out, they cut off all supplies such as Room service, Telephone use and even 2 USD movies in room. Just a number here, if someone wants 5 star treatment, best go to a smaller hotel which isnt juggling 5000 guests",20
"I agree with the previous reviews. A magnificent hotel. Unbelievable that they can cope with 4,000 guests. No complaints at all. This Sheraton has a private check in area for SPG Gold members. Very useful - especially when when really busy.  I can not fault this hotel in any way and I will return.",40
"We went on a family holiday and wanted to be near the bright lights and casinos of Macau so the Sheraton was a great choice. It is modern, with a good variety of restaurants, near the shopping center and has a free shuttle to the ferry terminal.   Rooms were clean and spacious which I was surprised about, and staff friendly. For some reason there was a Dreamworks promotion there at the time so lots of cartoon characters around which made it appealing for children.",40
"Stay one night at the suite and the services was brilliant, breakfast was great at the club lounge...size of the suite is big, amenities were good!! i was having the wedding proposal to my girlfriend and Sheraton offered a free set up for me where a ""red heart"" would set up on the bed!!  somehow the room's decoration is not up to my expectation for a suite; as it's quite similar to the deluxe room i had stayed previously.  afterall it was a good experience, will come back again.",40
"Everything is perfect, large room but no view (next to construction sites). Free upgraded to executive suite upon arrival. We arrived late around 2100 but only two counters available for check in. Line up for over 10 minutes for check in. Heard some others guests complained about waiting time.",40
"Luxury, clean and family friendly resort The delux suite is decent and cozy. And the location is great. It connects to few shopping mall and casinos.Check In and Check Out was fast and efficient. Location was good. Shuttle bus to and from airport as well as town makes staying in this hotel the best of two world as you can enjoy the casino facilities and yet go to town for shopping and dining",50
"I enjoyed my stay at the Sheraton. Rooms were big and spacious, the wifi was decent, bed and pillows were not too soft. The soundproofing was better than a lot of other hotels I have stayed in too. Beware the lobby is really crowded and you might take longer than expected to check in because of the queues.",40
"The room is clean and is of reasonable size.  This is of course not as big as Venetian but it can be considered as big size.  The bed is clean and comfortable.  The sleep quality is execellent.  Shower quality is good although the bathroom is morden, clean and large but the water pressure is just barely acceptable.  Temperature is good.  There is no complain in the room.  Location is good because you can connected with the Sands hotel area and walk to Venetian and Four seasons through a foot bridge, City of Dreams is just next to Sheraton.  I will consider staying this hotel in my next visit to Macau.",40
"Out of the three hotels at coati central, Sheraton Macao is perhaps the least impressive with their rooms. Rooms are generally spacious (so does holiday inn and Conrad) but the decoration is minimal at best. Amenities are adequate but seemingly made cheaply. Undoubtedly their suites are much better, but given the price paid for, Holiday Inn does a better job than Sheraton. What they lack in their rooms make up with their restaurants and service though. Sheraton has better restaurants (Xin and Bene) than what the other two competing hotels offer. And the service and buffet at the club lounge are quite good. Guests that are SPG members and/or have club access definitely have better service. Would recommend this hotel if it is on a promotion. ",30
Hotel and the room were amazing. Breakfast was also good. Only drawback is that they have no concept of customer service. Staff was not courteous. Access to food court and connectivity to other hotels nearby is a big plus.,40
"In reservation stage,  the staffs were being so helpful.  Reply my enquiry quickly and offer a spa package which includes upgrade to suite,  one way transfer and club lounge benefits etc.  All I thought was I could finally find a hotel in Macau that provide good service.  My experience was just bad....  1.Early check in was accomondate.  But when I check in,  I asked the staff if I can have an air purifier.  He said I could call from the room because he doesnt recommend to have the machine on when I am still in the room.  I felt weird with his statement but when I got into the room,  the machine was there.  2. After I enjoyed a relaxing Shine spa,  i was resting in my room.  One staff broke into my room without ringing the bell or knock on the door.  The manager replied the‚Ä¶",10
Like any other hotel. . Has positives and negatives. .  Lets start with the positive  The price is excellent for a hotel in this location and services provided   The location is excellent. . And the hotel itself has all the amenities you need..   Nice casino ..  The rooms are big and the bathrooms are roomy   The gym is very good and the swimming pool is fantastic   Lets start with the negative. .  Its really shameful to have such slow Internet in a facility like this.. reminded me of the Dial ip Internet Era.. although its for free but super slow.. had to go to Vanetian mall or Four seasons mall to get a better Internet. .  The allies on almost all floors smell of wet cloths..   The Lifts are hot as if you are in an oven.. Probably they forgot to put Air conditioning there..  ‚Ä¶,30
"It must be quite an adventure to run a hotel. Many things can go right, many things can go wrong too. And when things do, the hotel is presented with an opportunity to impress, or in my case, disappoint.  My dear wife surprised me with a trip to Macau (my first) with a stay at the Sheraton Cotai. A lot has been covered by the other 2,568 reviews, and it is easy to write about the good things. For me, the wifi was faster than expected, though only in the first room (more on this later), the room was spacious and clean, the bed was awesome thanks to its Sealy mattress.   However, one incident marred the whole experience.  The power tripped just as my in-room dining appeared on the first night. The room was plunged in darkness, the air-conditioning disappeared. There was some light‚Ä¶",30
"Sheraton Macau is part of the Sands complex, so Venetian and Sands Cotai.  The hotel is reasonably new so still in a good state.  Room was very comfortable, spacious bathroom with bath, shower (strong water pressure), light and modern.  Bed was wonderful, there for 6 nights so very important.  Staff were excellent throughout the whole hotel including their casino which made for a very pleasant stay.  Hotel is positioned perfectly for easy access to shopping in the attached mall, to the Venetian and other Cotai hotels and casinos.  Will return for sure.  ",40
The room is cozy in a reasonable price..  Spend my day mostly in casino .... The  Terrible buffet ... Feel like the food are already put in there for several days.  Food in the food court are not in good quality too ... Better just eat outside the hotel.by the way the monitor I order from lounge next to the casino is just terrible terrible teribble,30
"I been to this establishment again for 2 days in May 2015 and again it did not disappoint. The hotel is well maintained, check in was a breeze and the rooms were huge. Initially I queried on the non recognition of my spg gold, unlike my previous stays whereby a fruit basket, a welcome letter and additional mineral water was in my room. This time there were none. On the second day, they quickly explained to me that some perks of the SPG program had changed and offered to upgrade me to a better room which I gladly accepted. I would return to this hotel again when I am in Macau.",50
"The last time I visited Macao was during the late 90's, it has definitely changed and enjoyed it. Staying at the Sheraton was as expected a good choice of hotel. Supposedly the biggest Sheraton, it surely does look and feel :) Lobby was huge which was good with the volume of guests checking in, they also had other sections where guests can go express check out. The staff were excellent and was very happy with the well equipped and clean rooms. Walking distance to City of Dreams etc.",50
"Start with our checkin which was very smooth, the lady at the reception was very courteous and gave us all the required information and helped us understand what all kids can do as well in the hotel. Our room was excellent one of the best i have stayed in. A Must do if you are with kids is the Shrekfest (breakfast with Shrek and characters from the movie) The characters spend lot of time with kids and the kids have a blast. Food spread is also good, worth every $. Restaurants are good Hotel has lot to do, casino is good. It is connected to two other hotels so a lot to do. Overall a great stay and a fantastic hotel.",50
"visited this beautiful city during mid-May, the interior and exterior of this hotel is very beautiful.  view is breathtaking, with view of swimming pool and Venetian hotel at the opposite.  Room is spacious, especially the bathroom with strong water current and wide mirror.  Bed is very comfortable.  Wifi is very slow.  The only minus point is that there is no convenient store nearby the property, therefore we need to walk very far to buy mineral waters.",50
"We always stayed in this hotel every time we visited Macao and they never let us down. We have the club suite where they provide a complimentary Canap√© in the evening and buffet breakfast. The food and beverage were fantastic. The swimming pool were nice.The room was spacious, clean and have all the amenities. Bed was very comfortable and there were bottles of water and fruits provided in the room. The hotel are linked to shops and few minutes walk to Venetian. Definitely will go back again and highly recommended.",50
"The shuttle from the ferry was very quick and useful.  The lobby is quite impressive and reminiscent of any five star Las Vegas hotel.  The check in queue was a quite slow given there were only about 4 or 5 people in front of me and they have the option of many more desks to be open.  For this reason I give it four instead of five stars.  However I do understand it is a 4000 room hotel, so this is probably unavoidable.   I would hate to get there if there was a big queue. An apology was given at the time along with an upgrade. As a tip, look out for the SPG preferred guest check in, I missed it but it is virtually opposite the main check in, and this seemed quicker.  This could be sign posted better as i could not find it. The check in staff were super friendly and I was pleased‚Ä¶",40
"We stayed there for 2 nights during Chinese New Year holidays. We went with our baby so they prepared the baby cot for us. The hotel is huge and there are a number of rooms. The room size is huge and everything is very nice. We love the shower very much.  The hotel really pays into the details. For example, the quality of toothbrush is Much Better than other hotels. It is a highlight and surprise of the day when you wake up (as some hotels' toothbrushes are in poor quality). They also provide recycling rubbish bin and all the notes they provide in the room are well designed. The bed is comfortable and we love this hotel very much.  One of the flaws is we took along time to wait for the lifts (everytime we went out) and all lifts were full of guests and sometimes we were not able‚Ä¶",40
"I stayed in this hotel for 1 night, had the good impression when checking in. This hotel offers a very excellent facility start from we arrive in Macao by providing shuttle bus from ferry terminal. The location is also convenient to reach and nearby other hotels that offers attractive performances. Breakfast was excellent! The staff were also kind and caring and monitoring from the first time I booked the room. Sheraton Cotai Macao is indeed a hotel I strongly recommend to stay whether only 1 night or 1 week.",50
"Had the pleasure of staying here. Was upgraded to a view of the Cotai strip in the Sky Tower from a basic room booking.  Given the SPG benefits on check in as expected. Wifi is free at this hotel and is a curse, everyone was on it and I wasn't able to browse anything until around 3am at night time.   Staff were very friendly, lines are a bit long due to so many customers but it is a large property so it is expected.",40
"2N stay and was amazing... The room is just perfect.. No flaw.. Huge room, clean, good ac, good wifi, good view.  But seems the operator couldn't really understand English.. Hard to communicate.. Breakfast was good and wide selection.. From vegie to halal. Cold meat was good and bacon is good as well, but I couldn't find pancakes :(",50
"Stayed at the Sheraton Macao with my husband and our 2 children, aged 4&2. I'd heard good things about the family suites and wasn't disappointed. It was a bright clean ""Kung Fu Panda"" themed room with a large, solid bunk bed which the children loved. The price is very good for what is essentially 2 adjoining rooms. Service at reception and in the restuarants was quick and couteous- Feast, the buffet restaurant serves a good variety of high quality food, and kids eat free below a certain age (6?). We went to Shrekfast (Dreamworks themed creakfast) one day and that was great.  The hotel is on the main strip and you can walk through to the Venetian complex under cover. My only suggestions to management would be (1) Heat a couple of pools year round because with the weather only‚Ä¶",40
I stayed at this hotel for 1-night. Booked online at spg.com. Am an SPG Platinum Guest. The hotel was easy to find and the check in was fast and painless. I was upgraded to a very nice and spacious room and did not need to ask. This is great service from what was obviously a busy hotel.  The location of this property was convenient for a 1-night visit and offered plenty of choice for dining and shopping near by. The breakfast was good and had a lot of variety for any taste.  I was very surprised by both the size and cleanliness of the room. The bedroom was spacious as was the bathroom.  I would recommend this property to travellers visiting Macau and to SPG preferred guests who appreciate great service from SPG properties.,40
"I was planning to book Venetian, but after some research, decided to go for Sheraton.  It is on Cotai strip and just opposite to Venetian.  I got a good deal for Club rooms.  Right  from checkin till I checked out, I experienced a wonderful stay and hospitality here.  Club rooms has a separate checkin/checkout sections that helps in beating all the checking/checkout crowd.  Staff helped a lot at every stage wherever needed. Food and availability of food at Club lounge was just unbelievable.  Though no indian veg dishes served, lot of veg stuff was on for buffet breakfast.  Afternoon snacks and evening happy hour was just an added privilege for Club room guests. On my checkout day, shuttle to Macao Ferry terminal got stuck in traffic jam and the Sheraton staff was ready to help‚Ä¶",50
"It is apparently the biggest of the chain. Rooms are spacious, clean and you can still see that the hotel is pretty new. Location is great on this side of Macau, with access to all near hotels and attractions. Lots of shops, restaurants and spas in the vicinity. Macau airport is only 5 minutes away. Service is pretty good if all goes smoothly, but expect issues if you want something out of ordinary which does not follow the script which staff uses for their daily work. It takes a lot of explaining, where some of it may lie in poor (sometimes) grasp of English language. This is by no means a critique, it is a fact of life down there.",40
"Huge Hotel but room service is excellent and speedy. Spacious twin room with large single comfy beds, large bathroom with nice toiletries on offer. Meals quiet expensive but excellent food and great variety, access to other venues is easy by walking the skywalk between Sheraton/Four seasons and the Venetian. Upmarket shopping plentiful but very $$$ overall all excellent visit",50
"I understand it is a holiday weekend and was not too perturbed by the forty minute wait to check in. However, when we finally got to the check-in counter, we were told there was no room available even though we had booked and paid months in advance. After waiting an additional 30 minutes at the counter, we got our room as well as a 30% discount on dinner at The Feast.   We head up to our room to find the TV isn't working. We were told to wait and an 'engineer' would be there in fifteen minutes to fix the TV and we should wait in our room. After two hours of waiting and a few phone calls assuring us someone was on their way, we were told they'd change our rooms.   Did they upgrade us for wasting our afternoon? Of course not. Instead, we were moved to a 'gambling floor' to a room‚Ä¶",10
"Having spent 2 nights here in 2013 and having had a fantastic time, and also being a SPG member due to the usual excellent Starwood experience, we decided to book the same type of room - the family suite in the sky tower. The drop in quality of the service and our overall experience has been unbelievable for a 5 star hotel. The worst element is the stench of cigarette smoke on the family floor, which seeps into the rooms. While smoking is banned and I flagged to staff numerous times that people were smoking on our floor, the only thing that appeared to be done was spraying some deoderiser. it's outrageous that a supposed family floor is so polluted and my kids are exposed to the smoke.   We had reserved a suite for 2 adults and 3 kids with an extra bed. We had email confirmation‚Ä¶",20
Beautiful hotel and a great location. The rooms were spacious and well maintained. The service at the hotel to was very good. The check-in and checkout takes quite a bit of time especially during weekends as there are lot of people coming. The poolside area is a great place to relax. Would definitely stay here again when in macao,50
"My husband and I are staying here with our toddler son. There are some real positives to this place, but I've felt 'annoyed' too many times during this 3-night trip to give it anything more than an a average review.  Let's start with the positives. Firstly, I was impressed with the room. We're in a good sized suite with 1.5 bathrooms, and the room is in good condition. This is the place's greatest strength. I also like the fact that I snagged a good deal on their website (buy 2 nights get one free), so the price was very reasonable. That's another big plus.  Now for the frustrations... To start, I requested a baby cot and non smoking on my booking. Because I've had enough experience to know that these things get overlooked on bookings, I called the day before departure to check‚Ä¶",30
"Amazing property, great location and awesome service. We have visited Macau in December first week and the place looked even better as it was beautifully decorated for Christmas.They had an amazing buffet spread.. we loved the pools out there, the water was nice n warm for a cold morning. We prefer this property over Venetian as its new and the rooms are better, though a little small. Its connected to Venetian if you need to attend the various events happening out there.We stayed at both the hotels for 2 nights each.Even the casino here is better and less crowded.We had a lovely time.",50
"Great Hotel Great location and awesome service - Starwood did a wonderful job in making my stay the best one. Sheraton is best in their services. The hotel room is big and services is great. pool, spa is also excellent.",50
"Service with a smile at check in counter. Front desk staff was very helpful indeed! Room is very spacious, warm lights make it very warm and cosy. Big bathroom indeed a plus! Very happy with our stay here!",40
"Stayed for a couple nights on a recent trip to Macau...most promising SPG property was Sheraton so we decided to give that a try (also excited for the new St Regis that will be opening soon). Convenient shuttle from ferry terminal took us to what was billed as the largest Sheraton in the world - and it feels that way. Lobby was extremely busy whenever we walked by, but thankfully there was a dedicated check in/check out area for SPG members. There were two other areas (for the two towers) handling check-in and there was always a long line from what we saw.   Front desk staff was friendly and knowledgeable, and although the check-in process took a little longer than usual, it was relatively painless. The room was a comfortable size with a large bathroom. Shower pressure was‚Ä¶",40
I immensely enjoyed my  stay at this hotel. Very good service right from the reception to the comfort of the room. Totally made up my day when I couldn't venture outside due to the ongoing rain. Venetian mall is just a bridge awa,50
"Great service from the second you walk in, it was my parents wedding anniversary so they left a card on their bed and some macaroons which was a lovely touch.  The rooms are spacious and of a high standard.  There is a free shuttle from the airport as well as the ferry terminal.  It is joint to a mall with great shopping - a good mix of stores.",50
a short getaway for us and we wanted to be a bit away from the hustle and bustle of crowds in Venetian and show venues. The room in sheraton was very nice and spacious with all the necessities. easy to get cabs when we wanted to go out to the local eateries. a perfect balance of hotel getaway and also the ambience of local food.,50

"What a Hotel it is. Check in was smooth. Just opposite  ""THE VENETIAN HOTEL"". Can't get better hotel in cotai strip at this price. Nice Rooms. Good Housekeeping. Very good Swimming Pool. Best Casino. They even offer you free soft drinks. Casino is operated by The Venetian Group but I liked it more. The Venetian's casino was over crowded and very hard to get water even. You can roam around with their free transport. For kids there is Shrek Parade every afternoon and there was a lady giving moulded baloons to kids in the lobby. Enjoyed my four night holidays with family. Thanks Sheraton Macao.",40
"I found it hard to believe that a well known hotel like Sheraton does not carry charger for iPhone! I always thought that it's the little thing that shows you care! Other than that, the room is big and although I chose a smoking room, but I don't feel there's any odour in the room and that's a PLUS!",30
"Being a regular to Macau and having stayed at 5 different properties over the last 9 years I went into the Sheraton hoping for an at par experience with some of the previous stays at the Venetian, Hyatt-City of Dreams. Sofitel-Ponte16, Holiday Inn Conrad etc but the experience was way above expectations and really super.          It was the May day weekend and that in itself can be quite a chaotic time in Macau with long lines and chaotic check ins. Got to the sheraton and was pleasantly surprised to see the efficient management of the rush. Met Joyce at the check in and she was extremely courteous and very helpful and in fact really deserves a special mention. She also very generously upgraded us from the club room to the executive suite.       The suite was fantastic even by‚Ä¶",50
"We used to visit Macau two to three times a year for weekend getaway. Recently, Macau has been doing very well attracting many visitors because there are many shows and concerts that are not to be missed. We were recently at the Sheraton Macao for a weekend with our children for Katy Perry Concert. We have returned to Macao alot more frequent. In April to June, we will visit Macau every month at least once with our kids for the shows, concerts and special programmes for kids.  It was May 1, one of the busiest holiday season of China. I dreaded at first about the crowds, and whether the service of hotels, taxis, and restaurants would be horrendously compromised.   However, Sheraton Macao does NOT disappoint, in fact, exceeded our expectations during this very busy weekend. From‚Ä¶",50
"Need to line up an hour for check in, staff service was terribly slow and the worst was they even made an error on written down room no to us. When we went up to the room and got failure to go in after trying all room key. We had to go down to lobby again for checking what wrong happened, the staff just said he wrote wrong no on the envelop of room keys. It is unbelievable this is service from SPG. The even worst was when we went wash room and saw the toilet had not been cleaned... We had to help house keeping even for flushing, this was the first time of experience we had......  In fact if the hotel is not experience enough to handle so many visitors, they should not promote ss frequent like that . This is just treating !!!!!!!",10
"The Sheraton is a nice place to stay at in Macau. Its conveniently located, has nice and comfortable rooms,a  couple of casinos and so on.   It doesn't have the personal touch of the smaller hotels and feels ""robotic"" but I guess that's to be expected in a hotel this size.  We didn't feel too let down by the lack of dining options as The venetian is a 2minute walk across the road, via the skywalk. Also free WiFi seems to be a given at all hotels here and the Sheraton is no different.   All in all I would recommend this place as one of the best options in Macau. ",40
"I recently stayed here with my sister and my parents in 2 x Deluxe twin rooms. Check-in was smooth and fast, very friendly staff but also could be because we checked in at the SPG Preferred Guests desk (being a member).  Overall the rooms were spacious and nice although personally I'm not a huge fan of the decor of the Deluxe rooms (red and flowers). The views from the windows were terrible, overlooking building sites. Location of the hotel is great and it's convenient to walk to City of Dreams if you are planning to watch House of Dancing Water (which we did).  Internet was good but the annoying thing was you had to 'sign' in everytime you come back to the room i.e. log in via the portal. Bathroom was big and clean, loved the shower as it powerful with good pressure. Beds were‚Ä¶",40
"A very memorable stay indeed !  While initially we were taken aback by the amount of walking from the main entrance of the building complex to the hotel lobby, I realized that we could have taken a shorter route if any instructions had been provided.  Once we reached the hotel lobby, check in was a breeze. The room was huge and luxurious. Kids had a great time.  One can walk over from the hotel to the Venetian to shop and gamble.  Plenty of dining choices  in and around the building complex.   Apart from a casino right in the lobby area of the hotel, there are activities for kids to keep them busy.  The English language is a challenge in Macao...we had a not so great experience at a so called ""Portuguese"" restaurant called ""Restaurante Vinha"" when we went for dinner outside the‚Ä¶",50

It's a pitty that the same Chinese people that allowed me to live in a gorgeous apartment made me get away of the breakfast room. Guess all there is made to make them leave the dollar, sorry again‚Ä¶ spend their renminbi!!!! Anyhow, it's a great place to stay. You have all casinos and shopping around. Easy to go to the historic side of Macau with free hotel transport.  I recommend",40
"Just stayed in the largest Sheraton in the world (room 2925). As you would expect from the Sheraton the rooms are beautiful and well appointed, the decor is fresh. However the service leaves a lot to be desired, we had a reservation with three people on it, despite this we were never provided with enough amenities like towels, so for the three days we stayed here we had to call and request more (doesn't sound like an issue but when you get back from the pool and all want a shower it is).  In terms of value hmmmmm, I would not recommend eating at the feast buffet unless you have it included in your room (we did have breakfast included and while was a very comprehensive selection) the cost was excessive, we also notice that the prices are not advertising in the hotel room only the‚Ä¶",40
"This is my 2nd visit back to Sheraton Macao after 2 years. Everything was as good as my first visit and that's why I'm back to stay with them again at the repeat guest rate.  Being new to the SPG, my room was upgraded, complimentary wifi available in my room and there's a designated check-in area for SPG.  I had my dinner on my 1st night at the Cafe, their XinJiang cuisine was indeed fabulous with wide variety. Staff are friendly and attentive.  Shortly after my cousin do take up my recommendation to stay in Sheraton Marcau while she's in HK lately.  I'm planning for my next visit hopefully during Xmas and can't wait to stay there again.  Thank you for the great service.",50
"We attended a corporate networking event at the hotel's Sala poolside bar on the 4/F in May '15 and I am happy to write that the event was extremely well run and hosted by the hotel and its staff. The atmosphere was nicely set in the decked area, with BBQ appetisers and free flowing chilled beer and wine accompanying the event. The staff were very well presented, smiley and attentive! Signposts to the event from the ground floor lobby were plentiful and helpful. To summarise, one of the best run events of the year, a definite place to return for a corporate event!",50
We stayed for two days in Sheraton Macao during our visit to Macau. The hotel is centrally located to Cotai Strip and has very nice facilities.  The staff is very courteous and very helpful. Special thanks to Ms.Yu who took care of check-in formalities and gave us a wonderful room with a view of the pool  Keep up the good work,50
"We recently stayed with four of us in one room (two adults and two children) in two double beds.  The bedding was like heaven, though the pillow was a little too thick for my liking.  My husband appreciated it, though!  The staff had arranged flowers on the bed and some treats as we were celebrating our anniversary, which was a very special touch.  The hotel's property was huge, connected to a few other hotels in a big high-end shopping mall.  Everything was clean, and the fountains and greenery throughout the hotel and shopping area were picture-worthy.    Book the club lounge!  You will not regret it.  We had a great breakfast, snacks in the afternoon enough to fill us up, and a great spread for Happy Hour in the evening.  We couldn't get over the amount and quality of food in‚Ä¶",50
"The lobby is very busy, the check inn for families with children is quick, but without children it's like the check in we have for flights at the airport with long queue's. The rooms are excellent, so also the breakfast. One has to know his route very well to get to the right tower and then the right elevator to get to his room. Rooms are very quite and peaceful........ all the major attractions are interconnected in Macao, hence location wise the hotel is excellent......overall i would visit this place again.",40

Very exotic bathroom like vintage old style with a bathroom scales! Awesome hotel room!! Big tv enough space for storage and you also get the complimentary water and good old tea! The view was amazing !! Could see the other hotels and other casinos!! Loved it. Most hotels in macau connect to shopping mall, eateries and also the good casino !! Good location! ",50
"Staying more than a hundred nights per year in various hotels around the globe, it is clear that not always things go smoothly and wherever humans are involved problems occure.  Nevertheless the experience I made in this hotel was one of the worst which ever happened to me in many years.   Woke up after 3h of sleep due to huge noise of hotel personell in the corridor, caused by laughing, loud talking, shouting.  Roused out of sleep, went out and asked the people politely to please be more silent. Nothing changed, 30 min more of loud noise. Went out again, asked them again. Another hour of the same noise, nothing changed. Called at the guest service. Explanation: police went there to check another guest.

"Our stay at the Sheraton Macao was excellent! My wife and I traveled with our toddler in March 2015, and our stay was excellent. Rachel U in reception was extremely professional and warm. She took a family photo of us when checking in, and later that evening after returning from dinner, we noticed 2 framed family photos and a kids' pack of goodies for our child, alongside a welcome note, chocolates and macaroons. Anything we needed throughout our stay, Rachel made sure that everything was taken care of. The breakfast is excellent, though you may get moved around from restaurant to restaurant (with a hotel this big, it's understandable). The pool is quite nice, as is room service.

"I had an amazing time in this hotel. Very nice property, the location is very nice.  There is a saying "" what starts well ends well""   Our good time started from checkin.. Ms. Siska, pardon me if I have miss spelled the name, she welcomed us with a lovely smile and checkin was just matter of few minutes. She explained us a lot of things and gave us information of nearby places to visit and availability of vegi food because couple of my friends are vegetarian, she almost made our trip super easy. Thank you so much Ms. Siska.  If you are coming for the first time, do ask the staff for suggestions, they are very happy and proactive in giving information.  Rooms are very nice, the casino is just besides lobby area, view from my room was also pretty nice.  I stay regularly in st.‚Ä¶",50
"We stayed at a club room some time ago and were impressed. So, we chose to come to this hotel again at club room again to celebrate our child's birthday. We checked in at the club lounge and were asked to pay for my child's use of the lounge. Fine, they already told me when I requested an extra bed for my child by email. No need so many reminders. We got our room and did not find an extra bed even though we checked in after 5pm. We need to ask again. We went to the lounge for pre- dinner drinks. The dining area was extremely cold and the food  cold too. We could not stay long. Again, we were asked to sign for my child use of the lounge. Luckily, we got the extra bed in the evening. A small cake was also sent to our room around 9:30 (isn't it a bit late?) by someone who basically‚Ä¶",30
"I recently visited Macao with mixed feelings. My last visit was many years ago and my sense that the place had changed beyond recognition was confirmed on arrival. As an SPG member, the Sheraton check-in was courteous and attentive. I was impressed with the level of individual attention offered during the check-in, even in such a large hotel.   The room certainly matched the hotel for its presence, size, and quality. I could not fault the quality of the fittings or the 'lived' experience staying in the room. The massive scale of the complex in which the hotel is located made exploration something of an adventure, but one that required time and patience. Working out the best places to take meals, and the choices were overwhelming, also required a bit of trial and error. As a‚Ä¶",50
"After booking a special online deal (upgrade to club room though), my wife and I arrived and had a very friendly greeting in the Club lounge.  We were upgraded to a suite and had a good explanation of the services included with the Club room (lounge facilities and breakfast, lunch, snacks/dinner and drinks) and were also shown to the pools etc. All in all a good experience which normally is not given in hotels unless you ask specifically for it. The room was of course very nice, and great bedding as well! Service throughout our stay on 4 days was impressive, and we got a late checkout till 4pm on or departure day as well. For a few days pampering without going over the top, the Sheraton hotel is a great choice. Especially if you prefer a nice service and personal touch without‚Ä¶",50

I will stay at Sheraton Macau again in the future :)",40
"I travelled with wife and 2 kids (age 7 & 9) to Macao from Hong Kong. Only stayed one night (Katy Perry concert at the Venetian - I was only there for the kids, honest!) but found the Sheraton to be well situated and good value for the money. The staff were great (my son had a broken leg and we were given a wheelchair for the duration of our stay) and The receptionist encouraged me to renew my Starwood Preferred Guest membership which gave us money off at a couple of restaurants. Great swimming pool area too. ",50
Jst came frm macao...stayed in earth tower...26th floor...checked in 29th and check put on 1st may 2015...now as per sheraton standard i am nobody to say that its the best hotel which i hv stayed so far...evn far better than venetian....  Positive points. No hustle bustle in checking in and out. City of dreams jst adjacent and i think spending 5000 inr extra in venetian per night makes no sense bcz all hotels in cotai central. COD is rather most happenibg place to be thn venetian. Also sheraton has the reputation of bst spa and sauna which i enjyd d most. Saved my money and put dat money on roullete...however i lost in galaxy cadino...but i m happy 4 my stay...7 stars to hotel. ,50

"We stayed there with our kids and had two rooms with connection door. The rooms are nicely furnished especially the kids room with all the furniture and features designed for kids. In essence, when you stay at a Sheraton you‚Äôd expect a certain standard and this hotel simply has it.  BUT don‚Äôt visit such a place when there are long weekends/holidays in Mainland China because there just millions of people. The hotel was so crowded, haven‚Äôt seen so many people on one spot for a long time.  If you want to go somewhere, you have to wait super long even for the hotel buses and you can‚Äôt get taxis at all. The maneuverability radius is limited to whatever you can reach in walking distance and that‚Äôs it. So forget site seeing, shopping and/or gambling besides dining are the only options‚Ä¶",40
"Although it is the world's largest Sheraton hotel, it doesn't seem that large.  Rooms are large and full of amenities.  Bathroom warm and ultra clean.  Entire facility's cleanliness is remarkable.  Unatrusive staff always working to clean litter, etc.    Food in restaurants good.  Catered food to private meetings excellent with good choices.  Meeting facilities very adequate and makes it easy to spend time there at meetings.  Hotel's general manager stopped by to visit and made our stay feel appreciated.    Lots of shopping available.  Large, family-style, swimming pool.  Clean casino without bad odors from cigarette smoking.  Lots of different baccarat games.    I would take my family there.",50

I arrived your hotel around 11:00. I understand that the check in time is at 3pm so i decided to leave the luggage in the concierage. When I approached concierage desk, one of the concierage associate said he couldn't find my reservation. I am definitely sure I have made the reservation in Sheraton Macau but i don't know why your staff kept challenging and arguing with me said there is no my reservation even I provided them my confirmation number.

Went to Macau for the Katy Perry concert with our kids aged 11 and 15. What a great hotel. I am an SPG Gold member so we were able to avoid both the check-in and check-out lines. Our suite and adjoining room were FANTASTIC! Service was great and I don't know how this hotel could have been any better. All the decorations and fittings were of the highest quality and carefully designed.,50
"We stayed at Sheraton Macau for 1 night during the May 1st holiday (for Katy Perry's concert). I'd say that the rooms are a little bit nicer than the holiday inn in the same complex, but not as nice as the Venetian across the street. They have a promotion that if you book a SPA, you get an upgrade to the room (to an Executive Suite), plus breakfast for 2 and limo pick-up / send-off. When we tried to book the promotion, however, they told us that the room upgrade is not available, which was quite a let-down.  The service is pretty on-point and location is convenient.",40
"What a super place to stay! Absolutely great and classy hotel in what is part of a huge shopping mall. Absolutely lovely staff. Professional, friendly, polite and very helpful. Many thanks to Vicki at reception for the welcome and the free room upgrade for our first visit. Fantastic and luxurious room that was complemented by one of the best club rooms you could ever want. Absolute wide array of food that was just delicious. You would pay hundreds of dollars in Australia for such high quality and delicious food. The problem was not walking out kilos heavier! And the room had exquisite sheets!!",50
Where do I begin. I showed up at 4 to check in with platinum spg in a suite. Room was not available. Humm. Even though check out is 1pm. Okay. Room available at 5. Then I went to a nice concert at the venician. Came back to order room service but no menu in the room. I call to get a menu. A guy came buy 20 minutes later to check there was not a menu in the room. 10 minutes later he brought a menu to the room. Then we ordered food abd was told 40 minute wait. Seriously? I ended up eating a bag of pretzels from the mini bar in the executive suite as they have No idea what a basis service means. I will never come back to this hotel. Think twice about coming to this hotel as a platinum member.,10

Wish it will have more options in future. Room is clean and comfortable. Amenity Kit is good. Recommend to stay here when you go to Macau!",50
"Stayed there for one night only.  I encountered some problems on my package reservation  but the guest service rep and front desk staff in Macau helped me to solve it efficiently. My room (3525) is so big and comfortable, free wifi, just feel like my home. The SPG check-in counter is efficient, friendly and helpful. The hotel location is perfect and convenient, I did some shopping at Venetian Mall and City of dream, just a few mins walk.  I also took taxi to Taipai, bought my favourite almond cakes and Egg Roll with Seaweed and Shredded Pork.   In room dining experience is good, tried the crab congee, fried noodle and rice for lunch.  It's very tasty and i feel relax to eat crab in my room.  Everything was amazing and I would not hesitate to recommend it.  I will go back again.",50

"We stayed at the Sheraton Macau in April for one night. The property is located in front of the Venetian in the Cotai area of Macau. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted with the most friendliest staff. Bruno checked us in and not only did he give us an amazing room, but also helped us plan out our short stay, so we get to see the city. His professionalism and customer service are to be appraised. He made our stay. I would highly recommend staying here and can not wait to go back.",50
despite the huge property the staff is very friendly. check in and checkout was swift. room was spacious with well stocked amenities. breakfast layout was stupendous. surprised to find the sugar cane juice which i relished.,50
"Stayed at Sheraton Macau for the first time.  It is a huge property, the largest Sheraton in the world if I am not mistaken.  Very new room and facilities with great friendly service.  Like any casino hotel in Macau, lobby is always very busy with hotel guests and visitors all mingled together.  It is part of a large development with a shopping mall and other five star hotels connected.  This is a good choice if you plan to spend most of your time in the casino and shopping mall as it is a 15 minutes taxi ride to the old Macau where you get a taste of the real Macau.  A lot of construction still going on near Sheraton so there is nothing right outside of the property.  Overall a great experience.",40
"Our family of 4 adults and an 11 month old baby are currently on our second to last day staying at the Sheraton Macao and will be sad to leave tomorrow.  Our two joining Executive suits on the 35th floor are luxurious and large. The hotel is grand and the food in the Club Lounge is outstanding. However I'd like to focus my review on the exceptional service we have received during our stay here. Travelling across the world from New Zealand to Macao with a little baby can be a bit stressful, but the staff really went out of their way to ensure we had everything we needed, from the pick up service at the ferry to the wonderfully serviced rooms. The Club Lounge staff were some of the most genuine we've met. Lester Lindo and his colleagues at breakfast went out of his way to ensure‚Ä¶",50
"Sheraton Macao, Cotai Central is one of the three latest hotels by Sands Macao, the other two towers on site being Holiday Inn and Conrad.  This sprawling facility is bridged to the gigantic Venetian (3 times the size of its Vegas original) to the west, and sits just south of the City of Dreams (Hard Rock, Hyatt, etc.).  We spent two nights here recently while visiting local friends.  Check in was a breeze (so was check out).  Mired deep inside the casino, elevator accesses are a bit less than obvious.  Also, the division into two towers (Sky & Earth) could confound the less suspecting.  However, even the standard rooms are a cut above what one would expect from business standards:  Good size, excellent features, sparkling and spacious bathrooms, and non-smoking rooms are just‚Ä¶",50
"The hotel is massive. Absolutely massive. Which means service is extremely slow. We ordered room service which took about an hour to arrive - understandable, considering the kitchen is feeding about 6,000 odd rooms + various restaurants.  We stayed in a suite, which was nicely decorated (perhaps more to Chinese taste - some of the decor was a bit questionable). The entertainment room was perhaps my favourite feature, with a nice big sofa, large television and closable doors to relax.   As a nice touch, as it was my partners birthday, they sent through a welcome package of chocolate covered strawberries and a variety of other sweets, which was welcoming.   We also had a buffet down in the restaurant - not badly priced and quite a large selection of delicious food including‚Ä¶",40

Well...when I stepped into my room, nothing was set up, my balloons and flowers were not there as if the communication for the past month was an illusion. I called and check, they kept saying ""we did the set up, are there really nothing in the room"".... Oh come on...  finally after a few calls and some wait time when I was so in a hurry to get the room fixed for the party, they came back to me saying that they did set up the room but it was not the room that they checked me in. Ridiculous enough?! Alright, so they brought all the stuff back to my room and the party went on.... I turned‚Ä¶",20

The bed is very, very comfortable and if you lie down on it. You will fall asleep in minutes. A good night's sleep after a crazy day in Macau is definitely nice. It is a 20 minute walk from the Venetian Canal Shops so a large shopping mall is not too far. Just remember to get up early for the breakfast as there are lots of people going for breakfast at the Sheraton. All in all, a good deal for a good price.",40

We only stayed for one night and wished we were staying longer.   We booked a club room and on arrival we were upgraded to a suite. It was just amazing. June checked us in and she was wonderful. Very caring and took her time to explain the transport system and about the hotel.  Pay the extra for the Sheraton Club lounge experience. The drinks and food from 5.30 - 7.30pm were of a very high quality and once again the staff were outstanding. Breakfast in the Club was also very good.  The hotel is Hugh and sits above a very large and upmarket shopping centre and Casinos. Everything you could want was there.

He should explain to us that we couldnt just wear swimming suit in the lift! however, he just closed the door!!

"If size doesn't bother you than this is the hotel for you. With 3866 it is the largest hotel in Macao as well as the largest Sheraton in the world. Too be honest the number is scary but overall you feel lile in a 500 room normal hote,  hats down to the management as the facilties are ran very smoothly. Prices are reasonable and if you go with an executive suite then you will not only have a gorgeous room but also access to the lounge which provides above the average brbreakfast and dinner meals.   I could fully suggest this hotel to families, people on business or just casino pleasur,  it is trully a magnificent hotel.",50
"Sheraton's Sunday Easter Dinner Buffet was very enjoyable, but what really made the evening wonderful was the Easter eggs painting activities they've prepared for the children. With some help from their staff, Amy Wu, my daughter successfully drew a penguin for me. Special thanks goes Amy for spending time painting with my children. She made the evening even more wonderful than expected for my whole family!",50

Apart from the long wait everything else with our stay was lovely.  Really liked the rooms, the bathrooms were decorated beautifully with marble. The location is convenient with the Hotel connected to the Venetian (so you never have to go outside) and there is a shopping centre connected to the Sheraton directly next to it.  Make sure you go to Old Town Macau as well as there are some interesting things to do on the other side of Macau too! Such as visiting the Ruins of St Pauls.  Thanks for an enjoyable stay!",40

I ended up have to call my travel agent, who told me not to pay them because i paid already.  My travel agent had to call Sheraton Hotel to resolve the whole thing.  Eventually,  the hotel left the shrekfast voucher at our room.

"Came back to the hotel on March 7th for a quick weekend getaway with some good friends. I had recommended this place due to my positive experience last time despite having some hiccups here. Last time, I thought it was due to the hotel being relatively new, so the staff probably needed some time to get acquainted. This time, it felt like the quality of staffing was much worse.  For starters, the ""platinum check in"" area was run by inefficient staff - our party checking into 4 rooms on three reservations took the agent over 20 minutes to handle. Granted, its three different reservations, but I think hotel employees should realize that (platinum) member will be waiting for check in and call in backups to handle. It didn't happen.

"There were six of us in our party. Four adults and two children. Our rooms were lovely, well equipped and very spacious. There was lots of hot water and the tub was amazing. We loved the pools too. The problem is the hotel is just too big. You can get lost, get in the wrong lift that doesn't go to your floor, go to the wrong tower, end up in the casino when you don't want to. I stay in hotels a lot and have never got lost in one before and that would make me think about booking here again if we had children with us. I prefer the smaller hotels and more personal touches and where you can't get lost.  The staff are amazing and well trained though. I was very impressed with them from booking, enquiries and everyone during our stay was lovely. It is just too massive a hotel.",40

I was happy to see a recycle bin in the room but seeing how the hotel flaunts its plastic wrapped utilities etc, you can tell that Sheraton is not serious about it's environmental responsibilities.   In room dining was a disaster. Ordered some food which I had and threw up 5min after. The meal cost me almost 80usd and I slept sick and hungry. Next morning put a complaint in, and the staff came in with apologies and a review form. We filled the form and staff promised to get back to me by email about the outcome of the investigation.

We found all the staff to be very efficient and helpful, including check in and check out staff, restaurant staff, doormen, security - everyone!  Our room was on the 19th floor and we had a great view of the atmospheric Venetian complex opposite.  Our room was large and well equipped with a comfortable bed and nice bathroom.  Never having been to Vegas we found it pretty crazy having a casino area in the lobby so this would not be the best hotel if you were looking for the normal peaceful and quiet lobby area!

"Had a great sleep, and a fabulous soak in the tub. The room had free wifi included. The one surprise was the size of the gym. It was well equipped, but a little small for the size of hotel that they had. This is a massive hotel, so if you have difficulties with mobility, you're going to want to request a room close to the reception area.",40
"Planned an impromptu family get away in Macau. We received a good deal and managed to get an adjoining room. The rooms were spacious, clean and airy. I would certainly recommend this hotel for family trips, especially for families traveling with young children. There is ample amounts of fun for them.  Positive: - Clean - Non-Smoking so a lot cleaner - Close to a mall  - Breakfast at  the Feast was fabulous with a great spread - Wifi available all around the hotel  Negative: - House keeping were friendly but a little slow to respond  - The pools were shut so didn't get to enjoy that - Staff near the pool were not able to communicating as clearly in English   But the positives completely overshadow the negative. Definitely recommend it.",40
"Stayed here for one night for a day trip to Macau.  The hotel - was fine. Its much like a large conference hotel. You can tell by the large hallways, massive rooms and the fact you have to walk about 15 minutes from the elevator to find the pool...  Hotel itself, if you are here to just sun by the pool - is fine. Its a nice hotel, but its not special. You are one of 2000++ people here who are all very much about themselves.  We used the SPG Club while here, which I am told is the largest in the world. It was PACKED with families with children. Its not relaxing and to try and work here would be a nightmare.  They do drinks from 5pm - which must have 300 people at it. Its a large club yes, but the amount of people who bring their children with them is insane.  It really should‚Ä¶",30

We used the pool on both days and were pleasantly surprised that the many pools had different temperatures from very cold to heated. The poolside food and beverages were tasty and the service was fantastic. I will definitely stay here when I return to Macau. While the rooms are not as grand as the Venetian, they are still stylish and much more affordable. My only gripe is that the place is far too cold, there is no need to‚Ä¶",50
"i always stay in Sheraton Hotel when i am in Macau. I like the atmosphere, ambience, excellent service of the staffs here. Since the time it opened the rooms have never changed. The rooms are clean and well maintained.",50
"Check in was fast and efficient. The kids were made novelty balloons while they waited for me to do the paper work.  We got adjoining rooms in the sky tower, the king size bed was huge which was fantastic, The kids room had funky bunks and the towels were shaped into dogs which they loved. The proximity to other establishments - the Venetian, shopping was also very good. With a 6 year old and an 8 year old we did attend Shrekfest which the kids thoroughly enjoyed. I found the buffet was not really hot enough but seems common. We did find that the place lacked a bit of ambiance especially when we were looking for a bar to sit relax and watch everyone go past. The Water Spectacular at a neighboring hotel was sensational.  Not all of the pools were heated. The lap pool could have‚Ä¶",40
"I never thought a chain hotel would replied a guest's email for their special event; especially they booked the room online. anyway, I wrote an email to them to ask if we could get a better room since my friend was gonna proposed to his gf. They actually replied my mail pretty fast and its not a formal mail.  They did offered me to help for our special event. thats really impressive, However, our plan changed and they still let us keep the nice room.  We did not expected that they upgraded us to a suit and put the chocolate,flowers, and a HAND WRITING LETTER in the room for our special event. Im really surprised that a chain hotel would really wrote a letter to their guest, even they are not their member. I would also like to thank Mr Andy Chao the front desk agent who check us‚Ä¶",50
"All hotels in Macau have the gimmicks - Venetian has it's Venice, Grand Lisboa has it's art collection, Wynn has it's tree of prosperity and dragon, and Sheraton has it's Dreamworks. Can it have a recall factor for it 's guests? For a first time visitor, it is nice to see the characters.  We had booked a club room and the club lounge was excellent. The food was excellent and compliments to the chef.  Was disappointed that the room showed it's age - the bell sticker was peeling and inspite of staying for 3 days was not repaired or glued. The rooms was not cleaned till 445 pm and had to be called for. Also,unlike Galaxy the bus connections were limited.

"We stayed 2 nights in April here, and the room was very spacy, very nice view of Venetian from our room (2018, Earth Tower).  3 pools but only 1 was open. King size bed was a plus, as well as the interior of the bathroom. The bath tub could be a little bigger.  10-minute walk to Venetian, and shuttle buses available to Cotai Harbour, Macau Harbour and Galaxy.   Don't go for the casino, because this is nothing special (not big, no poker).  Overall a superb experience!",40

"i decided to book this room after i've read the reviews. I am amazed at their customer service which started even before we got to the hotel. They sent me an email confirming my room preferences and upon check in, i got them! The people at the reception area (especially Michelle Kim at check in and Eduardo Cailan at check out) have a way of making you feel that they genuinely care about the comfort and enjoyment of their guests. When we got back at the hotel in the evening of our first night, we found our room already cool and lit up, and a ""goodnight"" message inserted at the card slot to turn the power on ‚Äî nice touch!

"We stayed in the club suites and found the rooms to be quite large, very modern and clean.  The club facilities had a great variety of food and drink at both evening and breakfast times.  The pool area was really good with several pools and sitting areas available and would rate it higher than the Venetian's and Galaxy's.  The Venetian is just across the road but can get a bit hectic attracting a lot of mainland tours.  I'm sure tours also come to the Sheraton but we didn't notice them and it had a more relaxed feel to it. Highly recommend a stay. ",40
"Stayed for 2 nights for a short break (Working in Zhuhai in mainland China and we can walk across border) and booked into a club room. We find it cost affective to stay in Club room as my wife is vegetarian and sometimes difficult to find suitable restaurants, unless you like salads all the time. Told just to get on the Venetian shuttle bus, as Sheraton is just across road !!! (Which it is) Only trouble is we got dropped of at back door of Venetian and spent 45 minutes on a underground adventure trying to get to Sheraton, even asking various help desks. TIP: Just get taxi from Border gate to Hotel. Once in near touch of Sheraton found signs for Sheraton Earth Tower and Sheraton Sky tower and no mention of reception.  After asking numerous other guest services, found our way to‚Ä¶",40

"The people at Sheraton Macao hotel made the stay an extremely pleasant one. Before the trip, I was greeted with an email from the hotel staff to help me with any special requests. Upon arriving, the lady at the front desk was extremely helpful and friendly. Overall everyone there had a smile on their faces and it was relaxing to be staying there. The room was spacious, clean and comfortable.  Not to mention the location was fantastic. It was within walking distance to shops, restaurants and casinos.  This hotel will certainly be my first choice whenever I visit Macau.",50

"Sheraton Macao Hotel is a very good place to stay. It's beatiful,convinient,and comfortable.  The receptionist, Rey Wang, is a nice, warm,profesional and handsome boy. We had a happier trip because of him. Quick check-in and out, quick feedback. I'll choose this hotel next time.",50
"Third visit to Macau and usually stay at the Conrad next door however, my husband was not travelling with me and he is a Diamond Member of Hilton so my daughter and I decided to try the Sheraton.  We got a terrific rate from an accommodation website and decided to take the Executive Suite.  We were certainly not disappointed.  The room was spacious and very comfortable and the bathroom was large and there was a powder room. Bed was very comfortable and the blackout curtains made it easy to sleep. Fresh fruit in the room as well. The check in was exceptional.  I can't remember the young lady's name but she was extremely helpful, signed me up to the SPG rewards club and gave us lots of information about the hotel, area and promotions.

The front desk, concierge and room service staff were all very friendly and prompt.

I was upgraded to a junior suite and was quite impressed with the room. The room was quite large and very well maintained.The bedding was comfortable and overall everything was quite clean.  The club lounge itself was quite large and the morning & evening options were very good. The staff at the lounge were also very friendly.

i spend one night at Sheraton Macao and it was really enjoyable experience . Since the time i check in the staff in the club lounge were very helpful with me and took very good care of me. The executive suite that i stayed in was awesome with all the extras thst i needed after a long day travelling. the hotel is huge but the attentive staff always try to satisfy your needs. Special mention for Giulian he gave me the best service possible and help me with recommendation around the area. Without doubts if i comeback to Macau sheraton will be my first choice. ,50
"I received an email from their General Manager on April 9 and the email stated that I reserved a room from April 12 to 13 and I replied I didn't but there was no reply. Just now, April 13, they sent me another email to ask me to rate their hotel here.  Two years ago while I stayed in this hotel, I was mad by the poor services, no invoice after a month, wrong billings and etc. Now I could only pray they won't charge my credit card or my starwood points.",10
This time stay is really a nice experience due to the warmly receptionist Frankie Chen. His professional and quickly operation let feel comfortable. He explain the room facilities carefully and help us upgrade the room with a good city view. Thank the staff.,50
"The room was amazing with a beautiful view. Everything was modern, clean, comfortable, and high class. Executive lounge and happy hour made my trip 10x better. Bartenders were nice, fast, helpful, friendly, and new how to cater to any request. They really made me feel like a valued guest. The bed was so comfortable. This is a big deal because I‚Äôm a tall guy so a big comfortable bed is a necessity for a nice night sleep. The attractiveness of hotel design, d√©cor, and furnishings in public areas is simply fantastic. Had I forgotten to bring my own toiletries the room had everything already provided.

"Our stay was only for 3 days but Sheraton lived up to its luxury status.  Our King Bed room was thoroughly spacious, can only imagine the size of the suites.  Gaming rooms were well excluded so you did not feel like you were in the middle of a casino and staff were ready to lend a hand, although noticeable that English was not a first language. Did not explore the hotel facilities but hotel was conveniently located to other hotels and venues within walking distance.  Definitely stay again to explore more of Macau.",50
The family room was perfect for a family of four. Location was central and easy access to City to Dreams and Cotai Shoppes. Sheraton Staff was polite and friendly. The only draw back was that the mattress on the upper bunk in the children's room was too firm for a child. Wifi in the children's room was slower than normal but fine in the adults room.,40
"Not the ideal places to stay if you want to visit the cultural side of Macau. Very generic and uniform rooms, great for a family stay if you would like to spend most of your time at the casino or shopping.  Pool was lovely, nice idea to have choice between lap/spa pools or kids pool (however adults pool closes early).   Check in was advised to be 3pm, however, was advised that they had over booked and room would not be ready for at least an hour (unless we would accept a twin room over a queen), I was not impressed as I had booked over 5 months ago and was not my problem if they had over booked for the easter period.   Free wifi was useful and appreciated.  Due to the size of the hotel, services are quick and dismissive but gets the job done.  View of pools and lights of the‚Ä¶",30
"The Sheraton in Macao has very nice, well equipped and spacious suites. The breakfast buffet in the Club Lounge is rather average. The highest improvement can however be achieved by working on the service attitude of the employees in the Sheraton club.",30
"Let's admit you go to Macao so you can spend a majority of the time _outside_ your hotel room and not _inside_ the room, and so we did :)   The Sheraton Macao is located right on the famous Cotai strip where a vast majority of the Casinos and resorts in Macao are (including the Venetian). Access to the hotel is very easy from either of the Ferry terminals via a quick taxi ride (~20 mins) or from the Airport.  Like any other Casino and Resort, the Sheraton is a gigantic property with well furnished facilities. We booked a one-bedroom suite and it was very well furnished, clean, and spacious. Check-in and Check-out was smooth, room service (when we tried once) was prompt, and of good quality.  We did not try the pool or the gym (it was chilly and we didn't venture out to the‚Ä¶",40
"Clean and cozy room, free WiFi, the hotel has a shopping mall, restaurants are convenient. Swimming pool a bit crowded and small. Housekeeping attitude is better than the receptionist, front desk receptionist should review much.  Besides, shuttle bus time unstable, almost could not get to the pier, this is not good for tourists.",40
"Firstly I would like to commend the staff here from check in to check out everything was handled quickly and profesionally. We arrived late 1 (am) but the room was read for us to check in and we were in it within 15 mins. The room itself was spacious and clean. What I was most impressed with was the gym. I find it a struggle to find a comprehensive gym in Asia but this one has it all.. The only let down was if you wanted to find something western to eat , you have to walk over the the venetian. Not really a Major problem at all and depends on your own taste. But in general A super stay ..",50
"Our family was going to Sheraton Macao for celebrating my dad's birthday.  Before that, I had written an email to the Hotel for checking if they could arrange any surprise for this.    Alice, from Guest Relations Team, Front Office - Club replied my email promptly and offered a complimentary mini birthday cake for that.  Before the stay, we had many back and forth email to confirm the date and time and the Guest Relations Team was willing to answer my email.  Special thanks for Rachel, Supervisor ‚Äì Guest Relations, Front Office/Club and Alice, their preparation and work for this.

"Another fantastic stay at Sheraton Macao, however the hotel was busy due to Easter holidays. Front desk lines were fairly long, even for elites. Stayed in a deluxe room, was not upgraded at all as a plat, but comfortable sweet sleeper bed as expected. Perhaps due to occupancy, operator and housekeeping response times were longer than usual. Lounge breakfast and tea is fantastic but the no guest policy is annoying as one would expect to be able to get some work done with colleagues. Should have different entry policy for the work/quiet area separate from the dining area. Would like to see internet speeds improving in the future. Overall, a relaxing and comfortable stay.",50
"We walked in to checkin counter where one of the front line staff was talking in rudely to one of the hotel guests. It seemed for me like, the guy was staying in Sheraton as if it were the only hotel. Hotel should train staff on handling guest better.  The rooms were nice and clean but nothing special to comment on. The Nepalese security guards in the hotel were very helpful. If I visit Macau again, I will not choose Sheraton.",30
"Even prior to our actual check-in, I already experienced Sheraton's brand of service.  When I received my confirmation, I already made special requests and had questions, which were attended to immediately by a Sheraton/ SPG representative. I was even sent the shuttle service schedule in advance and they even called me so I know which shuttle we should be boarding upon our arrival at the airport (which, by the way, is free)  The location is really good because it's part of the Sands Cotai strip of hotels and had a walkway going to The Venetian.

Was there for a conference so booked into a club room which includes evening drinks, snacks all  day if you want, and a separate club breakfast room. I understand the reason for the way this complex is put together. Most people are coming there to play the tables and maybe catch a show. It's surrounded by equally huge properties of City of Dreams and The venetian. More are being built so in a year or so you will be in gambling central. The room are massive.

Wifi a bit patchy and on the slow side. The Club lounge is very spacious. Breakfast there quite tasty (though coffee should arrive a bit faster and without raising your hand to attract attention of a waiter). Afternoon ""snacks"" are more than snacks..this is practically a dinner buffet served between 17:30 and 19:30 with lots of choices (changing every day) and lots of available drinks.

My fifth time, I got upgraded to a suite again and to wow daughter, Bruno Miguel gave the special teddies to my daughter, that's made that so very special to a kid.  How he remembers all this information to make the guests feel special, amazing!!!  I know that I am repeating myself from my previous comment, I went back to Sheraton again and again, it is because of Bruno Miguel. He is definitely an asset to Sheraton, thank you, Bruno! Hat off to you for the excellent service. Hope to see you in our next visit in August. May your senior management recognise your excellent customer service, ""Well done!"" From us, thank you very much!!! See you next time!",50

The bunk beds are really cite and comfy. There is as well a wii in the room (though there is only 3 games provided and strangely not the most popular ones). A big plus is the movie night during week ends : outdoor dreamworks cartoons with popocorn, my eldest chilfren (9 and 6) loved it! The swimming are nice though a bit crowded especially the heated ones.  The kids activity programm is not clearly laid out so you should check it out when checking in to ensure you don't miss anything.  The hotel is gigantic and can be a bot overwhelming but staff is friendly and ready to point directions and help.",40

The check-in process is like a boot camp where guests jumped queue but thank goodness there is an SPG area for members so we had a better experience after going through the initiate nightmare. Like what the rest of the reviewers have mentioned, not much of service spirit when it comes to check in and their counter staff (except the housekeeping folks who bother to greet). I gave 4 stars to this review becos I'm totally sold to the Sheraton Sweet Sleeper Bed that made me really keen to get one. I'm a light sleeper and the bed really made me sleep like a baby.

It was so nice having so much space for our two kids to stretch out and play. Siska at reception was wonderful! And the two times I asked questions at the concierge desk, they were super helpful and nice! This hotel is located perfectly in the middle of Cotai Central. We walked over to the Venetian several times and to the Hard Rock. And when we decided to get out and see historic Macau, we were able to take a free shuttle bus to the Galaxy who had a free shuttle bus to the historic city center.

We took a Club Floor room and, to be honest, you are almost getting an all-inclusive package: all you can eat breakfast and 2 hours of drinks and food in the early evening means that you dont really have to put your hand in your pocket.  Staff were great, transportation from the ferry port was easy, never had to wait long for taxis, this place is great of all you want to do is gawp, gamble or shop.

"The Sheraton Macau sits opposite the Venetian, owned by Sands. So it's a good place to stay if u want to be close to the Venetian but not be swamped by the large crowds over there. The Sheraton is one of three hotels occupying a huge mall development called the Sands Cotai Central, also owned by Sands. The other two hotels are Conrad and the Holiday Inn. Each of these hotels are not small, each having more than 1000 rooms each, with the Sheraton being the largest of the three. Price wise, it is cheaper than Conrad but more expensive than the Holiday Inn. It provides two shuttle services. One to the Macau ferry terminal and other to The Galaxy Hotel.

"Our intended trip was Hong Kong, but I made a point of going to Macau to see a friend and her family so we stayed at this hotel for 1 night.  We booked 2 deluxe rooms with interconnection as we have 3 young children.  The rooms are quite big and clean.  Breakfast was not included in our room rates.  Checking in and out was not an issue.  Compares to Hong Kong, this was really cheap!  Located inside a mall, so plenty of shops and there's a food court with reasonable prices. We did not try the hotel food as we were invited to dinner at the Four Seasons, then for breakfast and lunch we ate at restaurants in Macau side.  Sheraton is located among Four Seasons, Conrad, Venetian hotels etc, so you do not have to walk far from one place to another.  We did not go into any casino but‚Ä¶",40
"Modern and spacious room! The bed was very comfortable. Great location! Only about 5 mins walking distance to The Venetian and free shuttle to major tourist attractions. However, the lobby was very crowded. Luckily we are SPG member so that we could skip the long queue to check in and check out. Overall, we had a good stay in this hotel.",40
The room is spacious and beds are really comfortable. Breakfast is also good. The hotel is actually of quite a good value if you compare with other 5 stars hotel nearby and you can easily reach Venetian via 5 or 10 mins walking,40
"We stayed a this property as we were part of a birthday group. There is nothing intimate or subtle about the property which one would expect from Macau. Thank goodness we are Starwood Gold which made the check in process quick and easy. We stayed in a suite which was spacious, the decor was standard. The Club was huge and an awful experience, the food was tasteless. The property is a stones throw from the shopping centre so if you're there for the shopping it's an easy walk.",30
"The family suite at Sheraton Macao consists of two adjoining rooms - one was a normal deluxe bedroom (for the parents), and the other was the adorable kids room with a bunk bed.  The one we stayed at was Shrek-themed and everything was so lovely and cute I'm sure kids would find it immensely interesting and fun.  One minor complaint was that they only had one game for the Wii - and when we tried calling reception to see if we could have other games, it turned out each room was only allowed one game disc, and if you want to change the game, it depended on whether they had any other discs in store.  Would be nice if we could have at least a few discs to choose from. Another problem would be wifi - there were many blind spots in the room particularly the kids' room.  This needs to‚Ä¶",40
"The room is clean, spacious, comfortable bed (given 2 queen size bed even though we booked a twin room) you can even have a nice view of venetian out of the window if you're lucky - the only disappointed thing is the internet not stable  Strategic location - 5 minutes walk to venetian/city of dreams  Easily accessible to important areas - has shuttle bus to galaxy macau which you can walk to Rua do Cunha OR change another shuttle bus to ferry terminal/San Ma Lou(if you are going to senado square)",50
"We stayed one night at the Sheraton Cotai Central.  We were offered free upgrade to a Family suite as we have a child with us.   The hotel is new, clean, spacious, more luxury than other Sheraton hotels I've visited in North America.  The Family Suite is basically 2 rooms connected with a door between.  The main room has a king size bed and the children room has a bunk bed and other children furniture.   The bunk bed looks great but the mattress (of the top bunk) is too hard.  You would complain back pain after sleeping for a night.  The complex has a shopping mall, a casino (1st floor), food court (3rd floor), coffee shops and McDonald's as well.  Very convenient.    It has a bridge connected to the Venetians.  The min. bet at the casino is quite high, min bet for black jack is‚Ä¶",40
"Anybody will need at minimum a day's time to get familiar with this property. There are two towers and the casino is on the lower level below the food court of the hotel. While in Macua, one will definitely visit Venetian which is bang opposite the hotel and has a bridge connecting Venetian from within the hotel. There is a food court in the hotel but if you are heading for dinner, make sure you grab it before 8 pm else one will have to go to the food court in Venetian where we can find better and more options. For Indian Vegeterians, there is Aruna's Indian curry in the Sheraton. I wouldn't recommend to try anything fancy but at least you won't be starving further. More options could be found in Venetian.

"Just stayed 4 Conference days at the Sheraton. Met at Macau ferry and complimentary transfer to Cotai - excellent As a Preferred Guest we were checked in seamlessly and given a great room on 24the floor overlooking pool. Room size, bed comfort and room features all excellent. The gym and pool areas all excellent. Change facilities all excellent. Our major problem was the value of food and drink to our lower valued Australian dollar. When a hotel coffee shop charges over AUD 40 for coffee and an average tuna sandwich you know that eating at this hotel is going to be a problem. All speciality restaurants are to our budget far too costly. The hotel does have a MacDonald's and a Pacific Coffee venue for that type of product.

Sheraton Macau is a beautiful hotel hotel with even better location. The hotel staff is polite and very helpful. The breakfast spread is also good and infact the Indian dishes in the ala-carte was delicious. Kudos to the chef.   The hotel is connected to the Venetian Mall directly through an atrium and also has clothing brand outlets. The hotel also has an awesome casino with a good capacity where we enjoyed every evening.   Overall a very good hotel where I will surely like to stay again. üëçüëç,50
"We are a family of 5 (my mum n two boys), everything was prefect since we checked in n specially thanks to guest relation, Alice. Our room upgraded to family room, my boys were so excited and refused to out from the room during our 3D2N stay. Sheraton is definitely the first choice, especially family with kids. The dreamworks events are round the corner, shrekfast, free photo shooting section with dreamworks cartoon character, afternoon parade. N Close to Venetian. Excellent location and awesome services, although the hotel is so big with crowd. You won't be missed out, every staff are so friendly.

"Recently attended an educational conference here. The hotel has great facilities including the usual amenities, spa, swimming pool, shopping malls galore, plus the expected casino. However, there is little to do in Macau except for gambling, so if this is not your motive expect to be bored. With the exception of a very small old town, you will struggle to find the 'real'  Macau amongst of the glitter, tackiness and excessive lights and sparks.",30
"They messed up, but then completely redeemed themselves. To keep a long story short, we had booked 2 rooms, as we were traveling as a family with the grandparents along to help watch the kids. We had booked 2 non- smoking, adjoining rooms. When we were taken to our first room,  we just started to settle in, and got a call that the adjacent room was actually not available, a mistake. They moved us to another set of rooms, but they smelled like cigarettes (despite being non-smoking rooms, I think many of the Mainland Chinese break the rules). We asked to move again. This time, a supervisor came to our room with a bellhop and promptly escorted us directly to the PRESIDENTIAL SUITE. Now, I'm sure this isn't entirely common, and perhaps they had vacancies in their suites, but who‚Ä¶",50

"I have just spent 5 nights at the Sheraton Macao.  Overwhelmingly, this hotel has a focus on gambling.  Conference facilities are exceptional and exceeded anything I have experienced previously in other parts of the Asia Pacific region.  The hotel seamlessly managed high quality catering for 1,100 people each lunch-time, within a small time window.  Food was excellent quality with diverse options catering to all requirements.   The distances within the hotel itself are vast.  Endeavour to request a room near the lift, as it may take you a very long time to get to breakfast.

The Club lounge does a great spread of food for breakfast and evening. The staff were very attentive and welcoming.  The Suite was very nice with a good size bedroom and living room. It was a slightly strange design with the wardrobes placed in the hall and the bathroom not in the bedroom itself.

You can choose your children's favorite character rooms when booking depending on availability.

"You can expect a little more from this Sheraton than in America; the service is always better in Asia and the prices are very competitive. If you don't mind the mainlanders (they are ubiquitous anyway), then this is a fine place to stay in Macau.   We got the Executive Suite, which is better than a regular room by every standard. Exiting the elevator, you walk down a staid hallway devoid of any wall decorations. Upon entering the suite, there is a powder room to the side, and a living room ahead. Further in, there is a bedroom/office area; within is the bathroom, with a free-standing tub and two showers, two sinks, and plenty of mirrors.

Check in was fast considering it was still Chinese new year's week.  We had a good room view facing the Venetian.  The room was in a high floor, spacious, clean and beds are comfortable.  Nice gesture of the hotel to had sent me a complimentary small birthday cake.  Daily buffet breakfast at the Feast was wonderful.  The hotel is huge with two towers and pools in between.  Lots of shops, restaurants for any budget.  Easy access to the Venetian via bridge as well as shuttles to different‚Ä¶",50
Rooms - Spic and span Service - Impeccable.....Sheer delight Location - Central Check-in - Smoothest I have experienced thus far Elevators - Too many so much so that I almost got confused with which 1 to take :) Hotel - is soo huge and vast-spread that I lost my way twice :)  A memorable experience!!,50
"Connected right to an awesome shopping centre, rooms were extremely comfortable and large, bathrooms were amazing, making my stay here awesome.  Has a casino downstairs (as you'd expect in Macau), pools were absolutely amazing and all the staff were there if you ever needed assistance  Very central spot, the shops actually lead onto the Venetian Hotel but quiet a walk, conference rooms were huge and easily accessible, didn't have to leave the hotel at all!  Amazing, and highly recommended..",50
"Despite being the largest Sheraton hotel in the world, we are always amazed at the high level of service provided at the Sheraton Macao. We have stayed here a number of times and always been impressed. The check in is super efficient and the rooms are huge. It has one of the best fitness rooms in town!",50
"one of the biggest of Sheraton. Good hotel with good services. Close to Venetian... many options to shop, dine and entertainment. Close to airport but little far from old town. If you are visiting the place for casinos and shopping, this hotel is strategically located. However, personally I find this place too big, noisy and full of people. I was on a business trip hence, the place accommodated the business events and stay comfortably. I however couldn't understand why hotel denied to consider the SPG membership!",40
A pleasure staying at this hotel! Staff were amazing!  Big 'shout-out' to Lively on Reception desk and to David in Club room service.  They were so very helpful! Our suite was vast and had everything we could possibly need or want.  We had room 1-3557.  Cleaning of room was the best service we have ever received - room was cleaned twice a day! Both the shower and the hairdryer provided were brilliant! This hotel is ideally situated amounts other large hotels and is ideal if you like to visit casinos. The pool are looked amazing too! Bed and bedding were luxurious.  The food which comes with the Club package was gorgeous and plentiful. I would definitely recommend this hotel and look forward to staying there again in the future - Club package again! Thank you Sheraton staff!,50
"One of the beautiful hotel , with class . The hotel is vast , there are malls inside the hotel area with all top notch brands ; Gucci , Armani , Zara , juicy couture .... It's a shopping paradise for shopaholics !! The room was huge and was very classy . The bathroom was amazing with four fixture , the bath tub was awesome .. The breakfast was very good with various spread ...  The hotel connects to other top hotels like the famous Venetian hotel , holiday Inn  All over it was amazing , I enjoyed staying here .",50
"The housekeeper, whose name is Kim, made our room extraordinarily well.  He/She did put their heart on that job.  We did enjoyed this stay.  Amasing experience.",50
"If you are looking or a quiet, romantic hotel in Macau, then head to the Four Seasons or the Pousada. But if you want a good value, well-run place with great beds and facilities, this is an excellent hotel. We stayed for two nights, and arrived just after CNY on a day when they had three thousand (that's right 3,000!) rooms booked. It could have been chaos with the sheer volume of people they had, but hats off to the hotel who managed to keep things running smoothly and even managed to make you feel well-loved. Efficient check-in service and a concierge who booked us restaurants and golf with ease, and a great room for a reasonable rate. We had a club room, and although the club is enormous, it was also well run, with enough seating and staff to keep it efficient, and a great‚Ä¶",50
"Cotai strip was not the perfect location to us travelling with children. Cotai strip is still under construction/development and right now there are too few hotels to make Cotai strip exciting and fun enough for a family (unless you are a gambler and just want to sit in the casino).  Hotels on the strip are new, big and luxurious. As in Vegas you will find lots of name brand boutiques around the hotel area. You will also find lots of restaurants and all-you-can eat buffets at reasonable prices (~399 HKD).  We stayed at the Sheraton Macao Hotel for 4 days. We were upgraded (with Amex platinum and SPG card) to the Sky Tower with Cotai strip view. The room was large with 2 big queen beds, huge bathroom with rainshower and bathtube. Beds, pillows and quilts were lovely and soft =‚Ä¶",40
"We overnight at this hotel over two years ago, during our day trip to Macau.  This hotel is always very busy, so is every other hotels in Macau. But the staffs are very attentive, and available to assist whenever you need help.  The room we stayed in is so clean and spacious. It has a large king bed, massive bathroom with massive shower and bath. Shame we were not there for more nights.  This hotel is situated on Cotai Strip, where a lot of other hotels are. It is nice to be able to wander around the strip, checking out other hotels and walk back to our room within minutes. We were there during Christmas (Winter), it was a nice time to be there as there were pretty decorations everywhere, and shows going on every night at the Venetian.   Definitely will be back, this time‚Ä¶",50
"Very good rooms and customer service; yes this is a big hotel, so no point cribbing about the distance to the rooms; if you want a small hotel, you should look elsewhere. We got a taxi for 45 HKD from the ferry point as the shuttle was not there when we landed and we didn't want to wait. Our check in lasted for a few minutes only, and we were given a nice room (the bathroom was bigger than the bedroom!). Comfy-amazing bed, and room service was surprisingly good and not very expensive (for the quantity).   Macau is good to relax and unwind. Gambling, yes, we tried our hand but after losing a small fortune (and earning it back, thank god) we said good bye to the gambling hall and stuck to our room, watching movies and reading books! We didn't have meals at the hotel, so can't‚Ä¶",40
"The hotels on the Cotai strip are all huge.  Somehow The Sheraton still managed to make us feel welcomed and like we were special guests.    The lobby was not as grandiose as some of the other hotels but was functional.  The room was fantastic, big clean and the bed was very comfortable.  Despite the fact that we were there for Chinese New Year and it was extremely busy, there was practically no noise from outside the room at any time of the day or night.  All the staff were very friendly, though some of them were not strong English speakers, they tried their hardest to help.  My two most important factors when staying in a hotel are the staff and the sleep quality and The Sheraton provided extremely high standards in both.",50
We spent two nights at Sheraton as family of 5. It is located near the happening part of Cotai strip. It is connected to the shopping areas in the neighborhood conveniently.    The free shuttles from/to the Hotel to/from the ferry were helpful. All the facilities were good.  The check-in process was very slow & time-taking though!,40
"We had a pleasant stay at the Sheraton Macau at Cotai Central during the beginning of the lunar new year holiday. The service was very good and the room was spacious, but the crowds and busy club lounge detracted from the experience.   The Room We booked an executive suite in the Sky Tower, one of the two towers comprising the hotel. Our suite was spacious, attractively furnished, and clean, except for the dirty wallpaper next to the toilet in the powder room. The bathroom adjoining the bedroom was especially spacious, with two sinks, a bath tub, a shower stall, and a toilet stall. Even though we were on the 34th floor, we didn't have much of a view as our room faced another tower of the hotel. The bed was comfortable. I slept very well the first night, but the flashing of the‚Ä¶",40
"In order to make the review easier to deal with, I will split it into several parts: 1. Overall 2. Room 3. Service 4. Food 5. Location  1. Overall impression.  We have decided to book that particular hotel because they gave quite a good offer for the time period we were going to stay, it was roughly 150USD/night with breakfast and ""all-day"" snacks included into the price.   Hotel has a free shuttle bus service from Macau Taipa Ferry, which was particularly convenient for us(we've arrived from Shenzhen, China by boat). The bus takes literally 5-10 minutes to get from the ferry to the hotel, which was awesome.  Now, in order to make it fair, I'd have to really clarify things before I go any further. Our trip has taken place right before Lunar(aka Chinese) New Year in February‚Ä¶",30
"Our family of 4 spent just 2 days, on a quick overnight trip to Macao. Oddly, there are several hotels all connected by a multi-level mall within the same mega-complex and, like the architecture of many casino hotels, designed specifically to force you to walk an indirect route to your destination. Indeed, a quick wrong turn from our elevator bay brought me right into the Conrad hotel.  Nevertheless, the layout also makes things easy for a family, in that the rooms, food court, shops, restaurants, fitness center and pool areas are all accessible from one to the other.  Despite cool weather and the outdoor area being practically deserted, our kids were happy to find 2 of the pools heated and we were still able to relax with morning coffees delivered with a smile by the staff. ‚Ä¶",40
"Stayed twice here over the springtime, each time as there was an event on eg the boxing at the adjoining Cotai Arena   ProsÔºö   - human scale with personalized service - I joined their VIP club which among other things enables access to an excellent  breakfast buffet next to the pool area  - excellent gym and pool facilities with saunas which I used 3 times during my stay   - obtained a special package where there was an upgrade to a king bed suite so large that it had a separate Karaoke / Entertainment room and views of the pool and the Venetian opposite (about usd 220 per night, including VIP / Club upgrade)   - lots of food and shopping options in the mall underneath - there's a place simply called ""Dim Sum""which offers numerous options at larger serves and prices better than‚Ä¶",50
Stay here 3 to 4 days every month..This time hotel must be cutting back as no small mouthwash left in bathroom daily and no bag to put dirty  laundry in ....In these slow down periods easy to see little savings hotel making.Disappointing for a hotel of this standard,40
"Yes, it's the biggest in the world, with almost 4000 spacious and nicely appointed rooms! The Club lounge kept it as a very personal and pleasant experience. Staff is well trained, friendly and very professional. Coming from a hospitality background myself, I can be a demanding customer, and it's getting difficult for hotels to make a difference for me.  So I was quite happy to be pleasantly surprised with the Club lounge. Besides the excellent staff, the food and drinks available were also very good, and you have a nice place to relax from the bustling gaming rooms! I must refer the Portuguese members of staff I foud need there, Giulian, Laura and Bruno, who made me feel right at home, giving me lots of good information about the surroundings. Nothing was too much trouble for‚Ä¶",50
"Nice and comfortable hotel, my 2nd time stay in this hotel, very comfortable bed and pillow, convenient shuttle bus to airport or ferry. And it already become my first choice in Macao.  Something that needs to be improve us that the check in really takes a lot of time in queuing, but the acceptances staff are really friendly and patient, and maybe this is why it takes so long time.",50
"I was a holiday with my family and we got a good deal to this hotel thru Agoda.com.  It was very nice as we got a family room, meaning one room with a theme for kids only & the other for us adults. This time it was a Shrek theme and my son just loved it so much, he didn't wanna leave the room.  The bathroom was clean and our rooms are always made in time.  The check in went very smooth and they had shuttle buses to the Macau city area which is just 10 mins drive away. I especially liked the way it was connected to other hotels that you would not even leave to exit the building itself. I would like to stay here again with the family due to its very nice location.",40
"Good stay over CNY. The property was packed with tourists, but handled to load well.    Staff were very accommodating to attend to a family member with Coeliac / gluten free menu requirement.  We would recommend the property and will likely take another weekend break from HK here.",40
"There was a special Valentine's Dinner taken place in the Jaya Pool. Lucky that I took my girlfriend there. She fell in love with the place immediately once arrived.  The place and the atmosphere already worth the price. Romantic and Private. They assigned a shelter along the pool for us.  The service was very good, no extra distortion but it's there at needed. The food was above average considering the price, and the portion was quite large that we couldn't finish all.  Actually it was not my first choice and I didn't even notice there was such a brilliant place. I was informed when I called to the reservation. Lucky I went for it over Bene, the other Italian restaurant in the Hotel. I think the promotion was not done well for this such good event.  Nice event and I hope there‚Ä¶",50

Thanks Sheraton.",50
"My latest Macao tour last week was arranged by HIS as a package tour, and unfortunately the Air macao flight was cancelld suddenly so that my tour was also cancelled. But the Air macao could arranged us altenative flight through Hong Kong on that day, and after 12 hours behind the schedule I arrived the hotel in the morning. Althogh my hotel booking was cancelled, Mr. Eduardo Cailan gave us the stay as we boolked with his great hospitality and warm smile that was most inpressive service throuth our stay. I want to say millions thanks to Eduardo. Then I decide to stay your hotel next visit to Macao.  thank you again from Yokohama Japan Norio and Aiko",50
"I stayed in Macao Sheraton Hotel for five nights in last November. Actually, Hotel's location is superb. 3 hotels (Sheraton, Conrad and Holiday Inn) have connected lobbies, so you can use the facilities and attraction of them. The size and amenities of rooms are suitable and room service meet your needs very quickly. We booked a package which allowed us to select breakfast or lunch every day. This package was really good because you can manage your time and it is not necessary to be at hotel in important hours of day. Sports facilities was also very good, there are two outdoor pool, one of them is cold and other one is hot.   Hotel's management pay so attention to different occasions. For example, it was Halloween during my stay. Lots of Hotel's parts was included in Halloween‚Ä¶",50
People who are familiar with my reviews know I like to be treated special and made to feel welcomed.  I got to the hotel in Macau around 11:15 at night and check din at the front desk.  The lunge was closed.  I had stayed here last year and had my suite upgraded to an even better one.  They told me they were pretty full and not able to upgrade me.  I had a nice suits with a very nice bathroom that had limited views except into the hotel across the way.  There was no welcome from management.  I let them know I was not happy.  The next day the club manager got ahold of me and told me she was able to upgrade me to a much nicer room if I wanted.  I said yes. The room was down the hall and was much nicer with much better rooms and the expected welcome note and gifts.  Interesting the‚Ä¶,40

Needed to be in Macau for work and ended up in this hotel. The location is excellent and the amenities are vast. The only drawback was the hotel was almost too big. You need to walk a lot to go from one place to another and it can be a little confusing.,40

Went last year in May and December to Macau and stayed both times in Sheraton.  Sheraton has everything you want in a hotel. It starts with a complementary shuttle bus with free WiFi that picks you up at ferry terminal ( I took the ferry from HK).   At the hotel check in goes smoothly and fast. Rooms are spacious. The view can be great or terrible it depends on which side of the building you are staying. If you are lucky you have a great view over the pool area otherwise you are looking at a big construction yard.  There are lots of restaurant. A cheaper option is the food court. I always stick to the food court. Its just convenient.  And besides restaurants there are plenty of shops who will satisfied your needs.  Sheraton has a casino but it's not that spectacular in comparing‚Ä¶,50
"Good rooms, beautiful design in the room, i like the colourful carpet in the room, from the window you can see the swimming pool. also have free shuttle bus to anywhere if you want to go. a little pity is i have not try their swimming pool, may be next time.",50
"First timer in Macao and it was a good decision to stay in this hotel. Very big rooms, cozy large bed, big bathroom and nice view from 33rd floor. All needed services like bars, restaurants and casinos are situated within the hotel complex. Staff was very helpful and willing. Prices at the central bar are a little bit above average but the quality of food and beverages made you forget about it. The hotel is quite far away from the old town of Macao which we were very much interested in. This is the reason for 4 out of 5 stars. Apart from that, a perfect 2-night-stay.",40
"My friend and I stayed at Sheraton Macao for the second time.  The hotel is always amazing as we expected.  Good location, clean and quiet room, amazing fitness center, fast check in and check out, and good quality of services. Easy to travel around with complimentary shuttle bus.  Absolutely, we will be back again since Sheraton Macao is our first choice.  BTW, thanks a lot to your Thai staff name Aida who we met and helped us during our first staying at Sheraton Macao in October last year. We didn't have a chance to meet and say Hi and Thanks to her this trip.  Look forward to visiting Sheraton Macao again soon.",50
This is my second staying at Sheraton Macao. What an amazing hotel. All services were wonderful as my friend and I expected. Both check-in and check-out were quite fast for SPG members. The room was so clean and quiet. Fitness center was great. Dining at Feast was amazing. All staffs were nice. Sheraton Macao will be absolutely my first choice if I have a chance to visit Macao again.,50
"Good rooms, beautiful hotel, flawless design, high-end and amazing location. The best part is tat if u r here to explore casinos hen this is the best place to stay. It is near some amazing casinos. You can also take a walk on the strip road just outside the hotel. Although the road is not as happening as Las vages. But one must experience the city by walking as much as possible.",40
"Well, what I could say about this hotel? ""Just"" the best hotel ever. I have been in Macao 3 times, but only now me and my husband ""found"" this hotel. I loved it everything! It's a huge hotel, very luxury, with a spacious suite, very cozy bed, big bathroom, a nice fitness center and a amazing breakfeast and ""happy hour"" buffet. The hotel also has a very big shopping center!!! The staff is simply the most helpful and polite. I burned my hand with milk and directly Mr. Rick Chan helped me with some medicine and he also asked me if I needed to see a doctor - what wasn't my case, because it was just a very small incident. Anyway, when I come back to Macao I'll stay at this perfect hotel. I recommend it!!!  Bem, o que eu posso dizer deste hotel? Simplesmente ""apenas"" o melhor hotel.‚Ä¶",50
"We stayed 7 nights in Sky tower, however had the best room service, good breakfast and helpful stuff. Internet seemed bit slow.  Please try to increase the internet speed if you can.  On cable tv there was only few sports channels as we could only watch Dutch league and Bundesliga, it would be lovely if we can watch the English premier league on the weekend. Movie channels were great though. Also my friend was saying you guys should have more selection on the breakfast and IDD call was little bit overpriced than the other.  Location wise, it was close to Sands, City of Dreams, Venetian casinos.  I will stay again in March",50

"We had the privilege of staying at the Sheraton Macao recently.  We originally booked our stay for just two nights, but after our first experience at the Sheraton Club Lounge we extended our stay for two more nights and then for one additional night.  The service in the Club Lounge was unparalleled.  Each morning, Platinum SPG members and all guests who are staying on the Club Level rooms at the Sheraton Macao, have access to a full buffet breakfast and each evening they have access to the happy hour buffet (which is a full buffet dinner) and unlimited drinks.  The assistant manager, Giulian, was extremely helpful during our stay.  He looked after our needs each night.  Also, Lester and Hilary provided great service as they helped us plan our activities and also took great care‚Ä¶",50
"i stayed there with family (incl 2 little boys) in late November 2014. The rate was reasonable for the room and the convenience.  The crowd was better compare to The Venetian.  Attached to the hotel, there is a nice shopping mall. However, the food at the Food Republic  was a bit pricey for food court standard.   One of the reason for us to stay there was the ""How To Train The Dragon"" class for the boys. Unfortunately, the class was a little dissapointment since there was nothing special and it was located so far away from the main lobby or from the guests lift.  Overall, we are willing to stay there again on our next trip to Macau.",40
"Last month, my company held a dinner event at Bene restaurant. When I first reached Miss Amy Wu from Front office, I already knew she would be a good coordinator. She is friendly, passionate and very helpful. We changed the plan all the time but she could always meet our needs. She was so nice to negotiate with Bene restaurant and arranged everything for us. I really appreciate her working attitude :) It was my first time visited Bene in sheraton. It's a great place to catch up with friends and families because of its comfy environment, delicious food and reasonable price. I will definitely visit again very soon. highly recommended!!!",50
"We stayed at the Sheraton Macao the second time with my 2 daughters.  This time we came with another family to celebrate my daughter's birthday.  Since the hotel knew in advance that we are here to celebrate for the girl's birthday, we were welcomed by a birthday cake, marshmallow, macaroon and birthday balloon as a wonderful surprise for the girls :-)  The girls was very pleased with their own room inside the Family Suite.    After checked-in, we went straight to the QUBE nearby at for the kids to play.  Then we had a nice Portuguese dinner & ice-cream at the mall.  The next morning, we took the kids to ""Shrekfast"" to watch the show and meet the Dreamworks characters which they enjoyed a lot.   Although the adults are exhausted, it is nice to have all the fun, food and shopping‚Ä¶",50
"Sheraton sure has its signature welcome and endearing staff as a given... but the food, the casino with only high stake tables and language barriers was not a great welcome... while City of Dreams with it performances is just a walk away, yet one would expect some means to make Sheraton a lively property as well given its size which lacked making it a dull environment",40
"Nothing to say about how the hotel itself. Big, 5 star, everything how you expect it.  BUT!!!! We met Gloria Hu, front office supervisor. He made our stay outstanding. Brought us to the restaurant, organized everything  around, limo service for the next day. And we even called her to ask for advices which she handled prompt with an amazing passion.   It's hard to describe all the things she did for us but definitely we can highly recommend the hotel and her. A hotel with this kind of staff can be happy and deserves an extra comment.  Thanks again Gloria for your awesome service and all the help during our stay. ",50
"This is our first time staying in this hotel and their service was excellent. It was our wedding anniversary and Sheraton Macau, Cotai central has upgraded us to a junior suite with a big king size bed. Thanks to Alice of guest relations who has extended her warm hospitality, and she even showed us to our room at 1502. Another surprise given by her was that our bed was decorated with red rose petals together with a card & a box of macaroons when we return after our dinner. My husband & I would like to thank her for her excellent service and who has made our stay wonderful in Macau. Great work & keep it up.",50
"This was the first time I had been to such a hotel. A massive hotel with a giant lobby and shopping mall. Maintaining its 5 star Standards Sheraton hotel was exactly how I had checked on the internet. The rooms were very clean, super luxurious with all the facilities. The checkin and checkout procedure was also quick despite the  large number of guests waiting for the same.  The only  thing  I disliked  about this is that you have to walk quite a distance from the main lobby to the room lift, however I cant complain about this because it is supposed to be a Gigantic hotel.  The food court also had an Indian restaurant .  Truly ....a lifetime experience  at the Sheraton !",50
It was my 2nd time to this hotel. The 1st time i came it didn't leave a very good impression but this time it was fantastic. We got upgraded to a deluxe suite as our room wasn't ready and the room was just so good!! The bed is so comfortable that you can have a good night's rest. We stayed at the Sky Tower which had very nice view.  The staff at the club lounge were so friendly and served us coffee and tea while we waited for our room to be ready. Staff were very warm and courteous.   They provide shuttle buses to a few places e.g. airport and ferry terminal which makes travelling around the city very convenient.   Definitely a place to stay when you are here for your holiday.,50
A good hotel to stay for family with young kids.  A lot of programmes for young travelers and easy access to mall and everywhere in Macau with free buses.  Clean and trendy hotel design.  Under Starwood programme with many benefits.,40
This is my 1st visit to Cotai Sands and 1st time staying in a Sheraton property too.  Indeed very impressed overall with hotel location/rooms/F&B and including all staff service!   I had a big room with superb view on 30th floor.  All the staff or most of the staff can speak English and some can speak very good English too.  Staff are very helpful despite hotel is really huge so often need assistance from staff to guide.  Hotel has a huge casino in the lobby and hotel is linked with other hotels next door include Venetian where you can just take the link bridge over. Hotel has shuttle bus to various main transportation spot.  I will stay in this hotel if I visit Macao again in future.,50
"We spent two days in Macau and stayed at this hotel.  It is typical of the modern hotels that you find in Las Vegas - huge with lots of shops, restaurants, and a big casino!  We went mainly to see Macau and the House of Dancing Water Show at City of Dreams.  There are other similar hotels within walking distance - Venetian, Sands, Holiday Inn, etc.  All the major hotels offer shuttle buses to pick up people at the ferry terminal, and from one hotel to another - which was very convenient and economical!  The room was nice, quiet and comfortable, as it should be for the price you pay.  Everything was also functioning properly.  The only possible complaint was the bed was a bit soft. Suggestion - take a shuttle to the Galaxy.  From there you can walk about 3-4 blocks to the older‚Ä¶",40
"Luckily we had a small kid with us so the reception directed us to the family check-in corner instead of queuing up in a long line. It was very busy, crowded and too big. There were 2 towers - earth and sky - and we stayed at the sky tower which was a bit closer to the main lobby.  The room was good, equipped with a bathtub for my kid and all necessary amenities. The sleeping quality was good too. We loved the room and nothing to complain.   Breakfast was of a large selection but poor taste. We walked quite far from our tower to the venue for breakfast too. If I stayed again next time I would not choose an option with breakfast included.  The check-out was super fast. We just told them the room number and returned the key card. After that we could drop our luggage at the hotel‚Ä¶",40
The Sheraton Macao Hotel has a convenient location for Venetian and for the other touristical attractions at new developing Cotai region.The hotel is new and has good facilities.It's the biggest Sheraton on the world yet. Stay at Sheraton Club Level which has lots to offer for guests.The entire team at the club level is very responsible and the perfectionist club manager Ms Myn Lam organise her colleauges in a wonderful way. The sleep quality of the hotel is really good. It's hard to be unhappy.,50
"Rooms are nice and very comfortable, but despite being reasonably new there are a few issues - the bath wouldn't plug so wouldn't retain water, a few standard amenities were missing and the entire (non-smoking) floor stunk of cigarettes, even inside the room. I liked the staff very much, they were very helpful and took care of any issues and requirements. Used the lounge, the free alcohol was very nice and generously served, the food is not bad but a little variable.",30
"Stayed in August 2013. Excellent property and interconnected with Holiday Inn and Conrad with great (albeit expensive!) shopping. The character parade is a nice thing for the whole family to enjoy as is the Shrekfast, although I didn't get an opportunity to visit the latter. Good for Indians as there are Indian options for breakfast and an Indian counter at the food court. Centrally located on the Cotai strip within easy walking distance to the Venetian and City of Dreams (for the House of Dancing Water show). Good and cheaper alternative to staying at the Venetian.",50
"Stayed one night at the Club room during the Chinese New Year period - staffs were still really helpful despite it being busy. Helped with ferry booking to HK Airport from the concierge.  Room was spacious , clean and comfortable. Not forgetting to mention, food at the club lounge was good too! Char siew was delicious!",40
"The very grandeur of the hotel leaves one awestruck.....It was a wow element which we experienced.The Hot water pool and jacuzzi was a topping on  the ice. The rooms were massive with king size bed.The front office staff let us check in ,it the hotel 4 hrs earlier and also let us vacate late.We thank the entire team of Sheraton for a wonderful stay.",50
"We live nearby in Hong Kong and when we fancy a weekend away we often come to Macau. We last stayed at the Sheraton at the end of December for one night. As always the rooms were immaculate and have all the facilities that you require including easy to connect wifi etc. We didn't eat in the hotel this time, but I know the dinner and breakfast buffets to be excellent quality & value with plenty of choice. The rest of Macau is easily accessible from the hotel with lots of free courtesy coaches accessible at the near-by City of Dreams. Would definitely recommend and will be coming back again!",50
"I stay here several times and still place Sheraton as my priority hotel.  The hotel concern and attentive to family stay like us, the kids enjoy the room decoration and small gift provided by the hotel, and like the characters in the lobby that they can take pictures with.  Not only the room, the service provided by the front desk staff make the stay feel warm.",50
I stayed in this hotel for two nights during a business trip in Macau. Bedroom was spacious. Quality of sleep for the two nights was great. Noticed that there were more families staying in this hotel as compared to the others in Macau. The only drawback was the checking in which took some time. Maybe that's understandable since the hotel is huge. Plenty of restaurants to choose from. Shopping area and other hotels are easily accessible.,40
Had a pleasant stay here with the family for 2 nights.  Rooms were clean and the hotel was nice.  Lots of shopping and food choices.  The buffet was really good!  We had breakfast and lunch there and both meals were excellent.  Good choice for a few days in Macau.,40
"I'm happy staying two nights there with my wife and my son, especially so touched with their arrangement to celebrate my son's birthday, like the cake, birthday card, and so many balloon. They are so attentive to the guests.",50
"Our family have decided to celebrate our daughter's birthday in our room. After communicating with the staff, things were promptly organized. We certainly enjoyed the room service special set dinner very much, it even came with champagne and a birthday cake for our daughter. The beautiful room decoration was a nice surprise too.   Special thanks to Ms Amy Wu for making everthing happen. It wouldn't have been the same without you.",50
It is just opposite to venetain and inter connect to venetian .. veriety of food option at food Cort Especially Aruna's indian Kitchen.... It very good connected to other attarctions.. Excellent sopping options ..,50
"The first visit with my wife was so good that we decided to relive it... along with our family of 17!  Again, Sheraton handled everything in the most professional manner. Our group ranges from an 18-month toddler to a 73-year old grandma. But all our requests, from rooming arrangements (plus last minute changes), multiple restaurant bookings, a last-minute birthday cake request...were all handled smoothly, swiftly and professionally.  My kids loved the cartoon themed family suite and already asked if we could return for Easter. Well, that goes for the remaining 15 people in our group, as we all enjoyed the well-appointed rooms/suites, and in particular the well-worth-it Shrekfast with many cartoon characters. Who can resist having pancakes with Gloria and King Julien? Anyway, we‚Ä¶",50
I stayed for 2 nights and I was pretty happy with the stay. things didn't changed much since my last stay in 2013. Our room is in tower 2 ( earth).Room is big and twin beds are comfy. They have a direct shuttle bus from macau ferry terminal to hotel. I booked the hotel through Ctrip and I got a very good deal. I would definitely stay again in Sheraton for my next visit to Macau.,50
"We received a welcoming and guiding Email a few days prior to the beginning of our four night stay. It contained clear instructions on our check-in location at the Sheraton Club level, and explanatory notes on the facilities we could expect to use. This thoughtful extra provided us with basis for an enjoyable stay. The Sheraton Club facilities included a quiet lounge area, breakfast room and bar area. Included was pre-dinner snacks and drinks. All of which created an ambience not experienced at most hotels. The staff at all locations were friendly and obliging on every occasion, which made our visit thoroughly memorable. It would be unfair to point out any individual as being exceptional. Sufficient to say though, that I have not seen so many smiles in one area before this stay.‚Ä¶",50
"Sheraton lives up to its name and its a beautiful property. The rooms are spacious and well laid out. So as far as hotel quality goes full marks to Sheraton.  However the staff leaves much to be desired. We took almost 3 HRS to check in(agreed we were a large group but 3 hours is a lot)... The bfast staff was, putting it gently, uncourteous. However the house keeping staff was super..  So if u leave aside a few irritants its a super property. They have a heated pool and a good gym and free WiFi... Overall it was a decent experience.",30
"This is the 2nd  time we stayed here, This Sheraton really reward their spg members, My friend and I both got upgraded to the executive suite, free wifi and daily breakfast. We had a 1 bedroom suite with a seperate living room, huge bathroom with all the amenities. The buffet breakfast had lots of varities, hotel has free shuttle services to other casinos and the pier. There are also public bus stop close by if you want to explore the city. The hotel also has a food court with more affordable restaurant, even a McDonald! Whenever I visit Macau, I will stay here again!",50
"I am really impressed by the service of this hotel especially the ambassador, Mr Eduardo, who introduced everything clearly and politely to us.  Pls say thanks to him again for the arrangement of celebrating the 13th anniversary of my husband and me. We greatly appreciate his kindness, attitude and professional services.  We highly recommend the hotel to our friends and we will soon stay here again.",50
"Standard hotel in Macau. Not too fancy, not too boring. Had a great bathroom. Free shuttle to and from the ferry. The hotel is connected to venetian, four seasons, conrad, holiday inn. Many shopping options. The restaurant selection was mostly asian and very spread out over the entire complex. Just like vegas, very confusing. The hotel recognized our honeymoon trip which was very nice, also giving us a 4pm check out time.",40
"It was my first experience with Sheraton hotel and my family and I enjoyed stay here.  Firstly, I would like to credit the check-in receptionist for her warm gestures as she offered early check in, free late checkout and extra bed (she offered extra bed immediately when she saw there were three of us). Besides that, She also offered spg membership (free membership), useful travel tips and so. Check in process was fast and filled with surprises.  The room is clean, spacious and absolutely excellent. The beds are really comfy, including the extra bed! Bathroom is huge and comes with bathtub as well as a separated shower area.  Location is superb, as it's attached to massive shopping malls and links to the Venetian. For those who want to try their luck, may not need to go far for‚Ä¶",40
"Hubby and I stayed here for one night, and went to watch House of Dancing Waters for our mini-moon (our pre-honeymoon trip!)  There was a long wait for check-in (around 30mins), but everything else about the stay was excellent. Staff member at counter congratulated us on our recent wedding, and a little treat and card was on our bed when we arrived in our room (rose petals, macarons, gingerbread man cookie and card).   The hotel is in a very convenient area. We walked to watch our show in Hard Rock. Also walked to the Venetian for shopping. Took the free shuttle bus from Venetian to Galaxy for dinner the following evening.   Our package included either free breakfast/lunch so we headed for a lunch buffet in their restaurant. The food was ok, but I imagine the food and selection‚Ä¶",50
Stayed there during Christmas. Maybe that's why it's super busy. Hotel lobby itself has a partitioned casino hence you know this is a casino hotel unlike other Sheraton Hotel chain. If your purpose is bit of finding lady luck and some high end shopping with sightseeing then this is 'the' hotel! It's a distance over from the old section although taxi is easily available here and reasonably priced. Enjoy our stay here.,50
"I and my lovely husband stayed at Sheraton Macao Hotel for 1 night because of Honeymoon. The room was perfect. It was clean, spacious and comfortable. Most of all, staff was so kind. Thanks to their staff Diogo Monteiro for making this a wonderful trip for us. He was so kind and thoughtful. He truly congratulated our honeymoon and gave us the special service. This is a precious memory that we won't forget. Do you find a comfortable hotel? Do you want to make a amazing memory? I recommend Sheraton Macao Hotel!!^^ ",50
"My second stay here at Sheraton macao, just as good as first! Hotel very busy being New Years Eve but all staff still very friendly and efficient . Club lounge excellent for free afternoon drinks and snacks. Awesome breakfast, Super comfy bed, Free fast WiFi, Fast trouble free check in and check out in club lobby,",50
"New hotel in Cotai Strip offering great services at fair prices, excellent mall with good restaurants and shops. Beautifull and modern casino and nearby of everything... nightlife, shopping, landscape, airport,...Great place to stay!",50
"Absolutely loved it. With a family of four, we got upgraded to connecting rooms which was a surprise welcome. The location is awesome. It is connected to Venetian but without the Venetian price tag. You can enjoy all activities of Venetian by being at Sheraton. The breakfast is fantastic too. Mall and the food court is pretty good too.",50
"Starting with our corner suite on the 34th floor.  Entrance.  Living Room.  Dining Room.  TV room.  Bathrooms.  Bedroom.  My gosh, I didn‚Äôt have time to test all the sitting spaces during our 2 night stay there.  It was actually fantastic to have so much space when you got back to your room :-)  Getting to the lobby is another story.  If you get off on the wrong floor because you‚Äôre curious to see what is there - mistake.  Because the property is so big and connected to a shopping mall, I got lost.  Several times.  In the hunt for the lobby and exit.  There is a phenomenal Italian restaurant on the ground floor called Bene.  Highly recommend it!  We had the degustation menu and it was out of this world.  The Sheraton in Macao is a Vegas type experience.  It‚Äôs bold.  It‚Äôs big. ‚Ä¶",40
"I stayed in this hotel for 1 night during Christmas Eve. The rooms were spacious and absolutely excellent. There were also massive shopping malls close to it. However, the food was not so good as the two restaurants I ate, Bene and Feast were not really good especially Bene, as it was 600 Macao dollars per adult. Also, the customer services needs to be improved as I haven't seen any hotel staff come up to my room. However, overall I think that my stay was pretty good and I would recommend other people to live in this hotel if they go to Macao.",40
"We were lucky to get upgrade to executive suite. We are both SPG member and celebrating our anniversary. Check in was smooth and great customer service. Welcome drink was provided and nice rose pedals decoration on our bed with macaron. Can walk thru the bridge to Venetian shopping mall.  Overall, great time and great stay. ",40
We stayed here (3 ppl) for one night. On check in I was told there were only 2 single beds and was not advised these were actually king singles. I explained we were three as per booking and did they expect us to sleep two to one bed and the word single is for one and she said yes. They said I van have another bed at extra cost and after some discussion said it would be free. On arriving in the room I realised it was a king single so cancelled the other bed. Overall as this place is so big with connecting walkways to three other hotels I feel the care you expect of paying what it costs to stay here is lost with so  many people and so a massive place. Would I stay again no.,30
I stayed here for 8 nights. The services was bad. The bedsheets was only changed on the 3rd n 6th day. The bathroom amenities was not daily replenished. The pen n paper was not replenish as well. The slippers was also not replenish as well. The toilet roll given only on alternate days n the what pisses me off was the soap bar n shower n shampoo not given daily. The free water bottle from 4 to 2. I mean i PAY for 8nights but was duly shortchanged by the hotel. To people who going to book this hotel... do remember the hotel is in a shopping center n the human traffic is really horrendous. Chaotic at the checkin n checkout counter. Cos though there is a  que line but jumping que by people is so annoying. Hopeless hotel staff at the reception who dare not stop those que jumping‚Ä¶,30
"Our family stayed at Sheraton Macao Hotel for a few days around Christmas. The room was clean and comfortable while the whole hotel had a jolly and festive atmostphere. Thanks to their staff Amy Wu for making this an amazing trip for us. The Xmas dinner was superb and we also highly recommend Bene's Sunday brunch for anyone that has a big appetite for tasty Italian food. Overall, a wonderful experience. This is a Christmas that we won't forget.",50
"Our family had a wonderful stay at the Sheraton Macao Hotel. The family suite is spacious and well equipped. My kid enjoyed the double decked bed and themed amenities.   The delicious food is another highlight for this hotel, so were the facilities; exceptional. Would highly recommend especially for those with kids. It exceed all our expectations. Fantastic!!",50
"I just stayed at Sheraton Macao Hotel, Cotai Central for 2 nights.  What more can I say... They have the best service in town, extremely comfortable room filled with useful and tasteful amenities.  Restaurants are exceptional too.  Clearly, Sheraton Macao Hotel, Cotai Central is managed very well.  I highly recommend!",50
"Our family had a wonderful stay at the Sheraton hotel in Macau. The room is spacious and clean. I have been told that Macau hotel rooms are all smoky even if you request a non-smoking room, but the room in Sheraton is really nice. I have got a special package that includes ferry ticket and some cash coupons to be used in their shopping mall, and also a cute little teddy bear as souvenir. Check-in line is a bit long because we arrive at the busiest time of the day, but overall the experience is great!",50
"We stayed over at the Sheraton at Cotai central for 2 nights in December and we had the perfect stay. I highly recommend getting a club room, the benefits are great. The room was sprawling although our room overlooked a construction site, unfortunately. The breakfast is served at the club lounge so it's a little more private and there is a all day snack buffet and drinks served at the lounge every evening from 5 -7. After 7 you can buy drinks and it is quite inexpensive.  Can't fault anything at this hotel. They have shuttle service to the ferry terminal, and easily access the venetian , it is a 10-15 min walk. I cannot fault our stay here, it was a perfect place to relax, eat, drink and be merry at. Did I mention it's great value too? And it has it's own little casino at the‚Ä¶",40
We had gone to macau for 2 day trip and decided to stay in Sheraton. It was absolutely a wonderful experience.  Pros:  1.) The staff is extremely friendly and service is very good.During check in it took us hardly 5min to get our rooms..which were kept ready before our arrival. Also during checkout..they had an express checkout service for those customers who had done the payments thru CC ( almost 1 min for checkout ) 2.) There is a huge shopping mall attached to it ..which has a kids play area on the 2nd floor..in case you are traveling with kids..you can let them play there for 2 hrs at a stretch while you can check out the casino (since kids are not allowed inside)..also check out their casino downstairs. 3.)

"Sheraton is one of the hotel among Cotai Sands. Room is extremely clean. I enjoyed the spa downstairs too.  There is free shuttle bus to everywhere, which includes ferry terminal, Macau Tower, other hotels for casino. Taxi ride is easy to get, and cheap also.   Maybe try not to go during high season as it gets really packed.   The shopping area, restaurants and casinos are all on the first floor which is very convenient.   No negative comment.",50
"Stayed for 2 nights at the executive suite of this hotel. We had stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel on our previous visit but I wanted to earn some SPG points on my loyalty card. Had access to Sheraton's club lounge which is huge compared to the other club lounges I've been to. The breakfast buffet at this club lounge was a full spread and not like the other club lounges where you'd tend to get a very limited buffet spread. Although it came with free WIFI, the connection was spotty and slow. The location is great for shopping and there are many restaurants at the attached shopping mall.   We stayed on the 15th floor and trying a find an elevator that took us to our floor was like trying to play hide and seek. This is a massive hotel and has dedicated elevators to certain floors.‚Ä¶",30
"We stayed in Sheraton for 3 nights in Jan 15.  Though it is a really big hotel, the service and cleanliness was very good.  We booked our stay under the Club Lounge experience and it was fantastic with breakfast provided, happy hour in the evening with wine and beer as well as sandwiches in the afternoon and appetizers in the evening.  The staff at the Club Lounge were polite and alert in their service.  It was worth it.  We will definitely stay in Sheraton again when we next visit Macau.",50
"It's a huge and beautiful hotel. Given it was Christmas and New year time there was beautiful decoration and lot of travellers. .... The hospitality of the hotel staff was very good.... The rooms were very well maintained and casino, connection with shopping mall and venetian is at ease. ..... The transport from ferry terminal to hotel is excellent.... It's a beautiful hotel and kudos to the staff for their hospitality.... i surely recommend it to people who look for 5 star at a reasonable price....",50
We stayed for two nights in this hotel and the service was great and the room is big. Good location. The hotel is in a casino so you can do a lot of shopping and good restaurants.  goo location to get to anywhere that you want to go.,50
"The hotel is not at the city centre but we knew this. Shuttle bus runs to the city centre from the nearby hotels but there are always many people. Twice we needed to get a taxi which was not expensive. This Sheraton was quite a disappointment considering the standard of service of Starwood hotels. Too too many people that took us long time to check in even at the spg reception. We understand the hotel is big and you expect the number of guests to be huge but they could manage it better. At the reception the personnel was friendly though we could have a better room. We asked if our room was nice and on a high floor and we received a promising reaction from the receptionist. In the end, we were not on a very high floor and also the view of our room was blocked by the other hotel‚Ä¶",20
"Despite the enormous size of the hotel (3,896 rooms) the service at Sheraton Macao was excellent, the rooms great and the overall experience really nice. Definitely more value for your money than in the overpriced Venetian hotel next door. The only time one actually realizes how big the hotel actually is, is at the breakfast buffet that is really noisy and crowded. We would have gladly paid little extra to get a more quiet and better quality breakfast...  The hotel connects to the massive Cotai shoppes area and has a medium sized casino of its own, although the games are the same and apparently linked to the much bigger Venetian casino.",40
"I stayed here for a night to celebrate my birthday with my boyfriend and a few friends and it was perfect! The room was just heaven, spacious, amenities were perfect! There was a media room which we used for our karaoke, bathroom was soooo spacious! And the bed! Oh gawd, it was so comfy that my boyfriend and I didnt wannt leave!

"My extended family and I stayed here for 1 night to watch the ""House of Dancing Water"" and I was pleasantly surprised with this hotel. Because we didn't get interconnecting rooms as promised, we were upgraded to a family suite - which the kids highly enjoyed. The service staff at the reception were very friendly and accommodating and the queues were well managed. I personally don't like crowds, but it didn't feel too badly at this hotel while I was there over Dec 13, 2014 weekend. No breakfast was included, so we went to eat at the buffet. Price is decent for what you get and the buffet is very spacious. We didn't get to try the pools as it was cold, but I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. It is connected to Venetian via a bridge, so that's convenient and it a quick taxi‚Ä¶",40
"From the minute we entered the foyer we were blown away. We booked 2X twin rooms each for  3 a and 1ch( 8 total) there was a deal when I booked to get club lounge access at not very much more than usual rate and as it included breakfast I booked that. We were whisked past the crowds to the 4th floor and promptly checked in. We enjoyed the lounge with light lunch , coffe and fresh juices. We went out for a bit of sightseeing and arrived back in time for happy hour and endless food for everyone. We ate an amazing buffet dinner with wine and beer. We then spent the night in the jacuzzi with the kids and woke to another amazing spread of food the next morning. By this time we were deperatly trying to book another night as none of us wanted to go - but unfortunately we were not able‚Ä¶",50
This hotel can not be faulted in any way. We stayed in a family suite and bed was super comfy. Staff are extremly helpfull. Kids loved Shrekfast (booking required at extra cost but worth it). Breakfast is amazing. One of my favorite hotels. Would again use it for sure.,50

"It was such a great stay at the Sheraton Macau! The excellent service by the hotel and the service skill of the staff made the hotel outstanding, in my view, outclass other hotels which are not focus on providing hotel services and which are too much casino orented.",50
The hotel is supposed to be the largest of the sheraton chain. It is located in the Cotai area across the bridge from downtown Macao. there are a lot of casinos in this area. the closest casino is practicallly downstairs at the Cotai Sands. Our deal included a breakfast buffett at the Fiesta restaurant. the buffett was splendid! The rooms were spacious. Staff was very friendly. We almost. Booked a hotel in downtown Macao and the price was almost the same. We all had a good enjoyable time and would recommend this hotel to others to visit and stay.,50
"Overall very nice hotel - right in the centre of things. Connected internally to most hotels & casinos in Cotai.  Positives: - Nice service - Nice breakfast spread - though for a separate charge - Giant casino on the ground floor - if you are into gambling - Clean & well appointed rooms, with a nice view - Separate check-in area for SPG guests - Free shuttle to/from the Ferry terminal - Free, fast Wifi  Negatives: - Way too big. Apparently the Largest Sheraton in the World. The walk from my room to the breakfast restaurant was at least 0.5 KM. - Checkin & Lobby were quite chaotic - given the volume of guests checking in and out at any given time - 40 minute wait in the special SPG line to check in  Overall quite nice - just be prepared for crowds and long waits.",40
"Firstly the airport & ferry connectivity with the hotel is too good. As soon as I entered this hotel I'm in love with this. The only negative thing was you cannot find a lobby to sit while checking in to your room, and also due to the mall & casino the areas are too crowded. The room was so big & comfortable, Equipped with all the luxurious amenities. The mall had all beautiful stores I love. The breakfast at feast was awesome. I'm in love with those yummy cupcakes.",50

Feast, the breakfast restaurant, is quite spacious and there are so many choices.",50
"We booked a room for 2 nights stay here through an airline promotion. Access to property is rather straightforward from the ferry terminal - a free shuttle. As we were there over the Christmas season, it was full of people and check-in took a bit of time but staff were generally helpful, especially the lady at the Concierge. She takes time and make an effort to give us directions, map and our options on the ferry sailings. Food and shops are easily accessible from the Hotel, although this particular one is about 15 mins stroll from the main activity area at The V.  Room-wise, it was on the 28th floor and very spacious.

I could not fault this hotel in anyway. We enjoyed our stay from the time we arrived to the time we left. The service provided is up there with the best hotel that we visited throughout my travel.

"This is a great space to hang out when in Macau for a few days - lots of shops, lots of food options and easy access to other parts of town.  If you accept it for what it is you will enjoy it - it is just a casino hotel - not a Sheraton Spa and Resort.  In saying this the rooms are nice, the staff are helpful, the breakfast is tasty; but they want you to hang around the hotel and spend in the casino there is not a lot of energy to help you explore other parts of Macau and if you want more then you can shop in the mass of shops in the vacinity.  We did a few of the childrens activities such as Shrekfast - good but very much the poor cousin to Hong Kong similar activities; however worth doing if you have young children.",40

"We stayed here for 1 nights, the room is big and comfortable.  Our room was facing the construction site, so no view at all, but there was no noise as our room was located at higher floor.  Hand shower was available, and with bathtub. Toiletries were not expensive ones.  Kettle was provided.  There are few towers for the hotel, and our room was far from elevator and lobby, it also take a long walk everytime to go to the taxi stand or shuttle stand, restaurant. I don't think its a good idea if stay here with elderly, just except they like gambling and most of the time staying in the casino of the hotel.  The breakfast was super good with many choices.  Wifi is available in the room and some of the places only.  This hotel is not located in the city center, and it costs around HKD‚Ä¶",40
"Tripped to Macau in Novermber 2014 for family trip. Stayed for 3 nights. We arrived to airport in the evening - the weather was freezing cold due to the freezing breeze. Luckily there is free suttle bus from airport to the hotel with free wifi. Fast check in. Hotel's lobby was crowed with casio gamber and other tourist. Got so much better after smoking prohibited-no more terrible smell. Our rooms were located on 16th Floor with view facing the Vanetian hotel. What i really loved the most is bedding sheets that made from 500 thread counts - it was super comfotable and very soft. I can fully rested after the long flight hour, and woke up late the next day. Hugh bath tub, large bathroom. Straegic location - near to hard rock cafe hotel and venetian. They also provided shuttle bus‚Ä¶",40
"Nothing to complain about.  Cab service was prompt. For three gals it was a Spacious room. If you are going Macau in winter, bring your winter wear or buy from hongkong. Purchasing from Macau was a lot more expensive than hongkong.",40
"The hotel is in a good location close to many must visit places in Macau as well as close to the historic city center itself.   When you first enter the Sheraton as maybe your first Casino hotel you will definitely be impressed by the seize of everything. The whole layout of the hotel is huge including restaurants, shopping areas and casinos.  Considering the challenge of managing a hotel with several thousands of rooms the service is impressively fast and efficient. However, as you might expect, it is more about quantity than quality. Each of the receptions have queuing lines like at the airport and you sometimes feel more like in a factory. But again this is not a negative point, as you should be aware of this before you book a casino hotel with 4.000 rooms.  The rooms itself‚Ä¶",40
"We enjoyed a three night stay at this massive Sheraton hotel in Macau and the overall experience was very good. Check-in is something of a military operation, inevitably given the size of the hotel. Our room was the cheapest on offer but still enormous, beautifully furnished and presented, and very clean. The only downside was a slight smell of smoke (in what was designated as a non-smoking room) but our requests to move to another room because of it were declined. Thankfully, the air cleansing worked well and there was no discernible smoke smell a few hours later.  The location is good for the sights of ""new"" Macau, with the Venetian across the road and the City of Dreams next door for the House of Dancing Water show (a ""must see""!). More traditional Macau is only about ten‚Ä¶",40
"A perfect place for a staycation if you are planning to stay and hide in your hotel room. Service Staffs provided a warm service, they would take the effort to check if there is any room service needed daily, SPG Front Desk is polite and provided me with information I needed during my stay in Macau. Overall, i would recommend this hotel to my family and friends.",40
"We were upgraded to a suite and it was excellent.  Room service was prompt and tasty.  The Club access gets you an evening ""drink"" which is also a buffet good enough for dinner.  The breakfast was also very plentiful.  Amazing experience.",50
"Traveling with my toddler, we were very tempted by the wonderful kid's activities listed on the hotel website. Unfortunately, we were greatly misled. NONE of the activities were open during the period we were there. The tooted heated kid's friendly pool was more like the size of a hot tub, there were so many adults  in the very small area soaking that we were immediately turned off as a hygenique place for toddlers to have fun.     As listed on the hotel website:  ~ ""The hotel offers plenty of children‚Äôs activities in the hotel, from cookie decorating, aerobics, and a pool treasure hunt to recycled art making and weekend movie nights on the Sala Pool deck. Our pools and array of recreation facilities guarantee memorable family fun."" ~   We were excited that Dreamworks have taken‚Ä¶",20
"It's probably too big - as a result everything is too far away and there are far too many people at check-in, check-out, and everything takes forever. They should have done what Galaxy Casino did and that is to make each of the hotels small so that it is easier to manage.  The hotel itself is not bad - rooms are good sized and you see the hallmark of a Sheraton everywhere.",30
"I booked with Sheraton Macau for Dec 30, 2014 - Jan 3, 2015 for New Years with my family. I and my wife also like gambling a bit. We had 6 rooms in all. I always stay in the club floor when I travel for obvious reasons. But I couldn't believe what happened to us in The Sheraton Club Floor.  On our first day, my daughter and her hubby approached a male staff for some information. When they were in front of him, he simply looked at them and left without a word. Upon investigation, we learned that he is Joao Collado, Club Floor Manager. On the second night of our stay, I and another daughter entered the club floor a few minutes before 7pm. The female staff asked us the usual ""room number pls"" and told us to come in. However, a man who turns out to be the same Joao Collado blocked‚Ä¶",20

This new year started for me at the Sheraton Macau Cotai Central and I must admit am simply blown away by the experience. This place is HUGE. ~3890 rooms and definitely the largest I have ever stayed. If you have issues walking ho some place else and not this or other hotels in Cotai central. Most of them you can cover by foot and its worth the walk albeit tiring.  Massive is the word that stands out with all these hotels here at Cotai strip. Casinos Pacifica and Himalaya gaming lounges are massive. Food court at Sheraton serves some great delicacies. Room service though is a bit slow but may be its because they have 4000 guests to serve. Foods excellent. Stay is even better. They couldn't meet my need for a large king size bed though probably due to the heavy bookings.  You go‚Ä¶,40
"This hotel is 1 of 3 hotels, Sheration/Conrad/Holiday Inn, which are part of the Sands Cotai Central mega complex.  I've tried staying for the first time to try to escape the monster crowds at The Venitian, but as it turned out, the experience is not much different.  Check-in lines are long as in an airport. More than 10 minute walk from reception to room, or from room to a restaurant or to anywhere, because this is such a huge complex with endless hallways and corridors.     The deco and design average and not as memorable as The Venitian or Wynn Macau or Banyan Tree.  The swimming pools are scattered in to several small pools, instead of 1 big pool.  The service is decent. But lack the personal touches, since this is such a huge huge complex.   The shopping center is a grand‚Ä¶",30

This is the second time we‚Äôve stayed at a wonderful Sheraton property in Asia this year‚Äîthe other being the Andaman on Langkawi island, Malaysia--also incredible.  Once again, Sheraton outdid the competition in service and amenities for us and our two kids, 10 and 12.  The hotel on the Cotai strip is magnificent, with a self-contained mall, numerous restaurants, nice pools‚Äîwarmly heated for our New Year‚Äôs week visit.

"Travelling frequently has exposed me to a large variety of different hotels of different genres and service levels, and this has to be close to the top experience.  Rarely can I say that I been fortunate enough to be on the receiving end of a true 5* experience, but in the case of Sheraton Macao, that was certainly the case. If I ever experience this sort of service again, I will be truly lucky. The most convenient way to get to the hotel from the airport is by the free shuttle bus service.  It was florescent green in our case, but it is clearly marked up with several hotels.  It is free and reasonably regular. Staying in the Sheraton Club Lounge was a really top idea.  It meant we could skip the hoards queuing at the normal or the Starwood check-ins and head straight to the‚Ä¶",50

The Shrekfast breakfast was awesome my son constantly asks to go back. There are numerous pools with cabanas so you can always find somewhere away from other guests to swim or sunbathe. Food was good although we only ordered room service once as there are too many other food options around. The hotel is clean and very very quiet and right in the midst of all the entertainment options of Macau. I would highly recommend this hotel for families.",50
"I had booked 2 Executive Suites, but on arrival was upgraded to an Ambassador Suite as our rooms were not then available. This was a lovely surprise. From the moment we checked in in the Executive Club Lounge to the time we departed, I have nothing but praise for the professionalism and attention to detail of all the staff we came across in the Lounge. Nothing was too much trouble. The large room we had, which included two separate bedrooms and accompanying bathrooms, a tv room and small kitchen area, coupled with a large seating area separating the two bedrooms was very comfortable, was first class and lacked for nothing.  Breakfast and dinner buffets were provided in the Lounge, as was complementary wine with dinner. The quality of the food was very good and varied, and all‚Ä¶",50
"Stayed at the Sheraton Cotai hotel in Macau in December. Flew into Hong Kong direct from Dallas (a great way to get to Hong Kong form Midwest). The Sheraton is nice, but seemed to smell like smoke in hallways. The staff was very friendly and I was particularly pleased with housekeeping.  This was a business trip and I would have preferred meeting in Hong Kong. The added ferry ride after a long trip over and before a long trip back was a hassle.   Gaming is available but it is NOT Las Vegas.",40
"Stayed here in October 2014 and booked a club room. We were delighted however to get upgraded to a suite, which the kids (6 & 3 y.o.) loved as their bedroom had a Shrek theme.  All the facilities in the hotel, service, food was excellent. The hotel is opposite The Venetian and a 10 min walk from the House of dancing water show (which we all loved).  Taxi prices are cheap and we got to the old town quickly and cheaply.  I'd never stayed in a Sheraton before, but always look for one now wherever we travel and would happily stay here again",50
I liked this hotel very much.  The room was spacious.  My wheelchair fits even in the bathroom door of a regular room (not an accessible room).  The essential pieces of furniture inside the room were strategically placed.  Hotel staff was service-oriented.  The bed was comfy.  Lighting was sufficient.  Housekeeping was accommodating.  They had a great pool area.  There was a food court in the adjoining shopping centre.  We were thankful we chose that hotel.,50

The staff was really helpful and spending time to arrange all rooms on the same tower and floor for us, I believe that was not easy in high season.  I noticed that they even have many check-in counts at different spots, very convenient.  There was a kiosk near the main check-in counter delivering some free popcorn and twisting balloons to kids at a kiosk, my little 3 years old daughter was so happy while waiting for check-in.

"My husband and I stayed at the Sheraton Macau for 2 nights just prior to Christmas. We really enjoyed our stay and I can't speak highly enough of the hotel.  The Sheraton is located in Cotai Central and I think is one of the best locations to stay. There is easy access to the Cotai Central hotels (Conrad, Sheraton, Holiday Inn) plus a short walk across a pedestrian bridge to the Four Seasons and Venetian. There is plenty to do in this area.  We booked a Club King Room and it was large and immaculate. We had access to the Club Lounge which served all day snacks, breakfast and had an evening food and drinks spread.  I would highly recommend this hotel and have no negative comments about our stay.",50
"This was my third time I stayed at the Sheraton Macau.  The first time was during its opening, when front-of-house staff was still green to their service.  The second time was average.  Yet the third time, which was just after Christmas this year, was really deteriorating.  I had booked a three-day package which included free return jetfoil tickets, breakfast or lunch for two on both days, free lunch for two persons, and MOP400 shopping coupon.  The queue was very long at around 4pm, and my family was greeted by a Mr, Huang.  During check-in, he was always chatting with his colleague on his left side, probably having problems with her guest, and the guest on his right side could not find his reservation and was making a complaint.

This hotel is in a good location right on the Cotai strip - there's a lot in the immediate area and the hotel is connected to a shopping centre. Rooms are large and well appointed including complimentary internet. The one thing I would say is that the hotel is quite large and the whole experience feels rather inpersonal - I checked in at the dedicated SPG area but you really just feel like another number. The buffet breakfast was great - although again very large with a lot of people. Free shuttle bus transfers from the ferry or airport available. The pool facilities looked good. One thing the hotel is missing is a decent bar to enjoy an evening drink in - as I was travelling with others for business we missed this aspect - I've previously stayed at other hotels in Macau that‚Ä¶,40

We chose to stay at this hotel for something different (I have previously stayed at the Sintra). We got the ferry from HK island; there is a free shuttle that takes you straight to the hotel outside the ferry terminal (light green bus). The hotel provides easy access to most of the other Cotai strip hotels. We booked a Club Room, and we got a great room on the 31st floor. Not much of a view but we don't care.

"With 3,896 rooms in Macau, this is so far I think is the biggest hotel in Macau. We stayed at Deluxe Cotai Room with view of the Venetian.  The hotel is built with 2 towers: Sky Tower (1) and Earth Tower (2).  To ensure you have a better view of the Venetian, this is best to request a room at the end of the corridor; or your view might be partly blocked by hotel building of Conrad Macao.  The pillow cases at our rooms were found with a long black line on top. We called up customer services for exchange and that took us another 30 minutes for waiting in room.

I have earlier stayed in Venetian and this time, due to it's full booking i had to reluctantly choose any other hotel, Sheraton in this case but guess what, Sheraton has got a new loyal customer.  This hotel is definitely at par with Venetian. Room was amazing.

Assuming that there are 2 occupants in each room, the hotel would have more than 7,600 guests in full capacity, plus thousands of staff, it is more like a small town than a hotel.

I think we were at the SPG priority check-in area even though we weren't SPG members.  The hotel is located on the Cotai strip - walking distance to The Venetian and The Sands.

"The value at this hotel on the new Cotai strip is amazing, if you pay a bit extra for the club lounge you will have a full buffet breakfast and happy hour that is a full dinner, that will pay more in dividends right there than the extra room charge. It's connected to the Sands hotel strip and to the Venetian via sky bridge, tons of restaurants and shopping at your doorstep . Rooms were clean and spacious,no complaints. Staff was outstanding, especially in the lounge! Giulian Langone , one of the managers in the club lounge was amazing and helped us find the hot spots around Macau that we were unaware of, he and his staff were always courteous and extremely friendly and staff is the most important thing to a person when they spend a good deal of time in hotels, you want to be‚Ä¶",50
"I have just spent 2 terrific weeks at the SHERATON  outstanding hotel in every aspect  from the time we arrived until we departed the staff were fantastic. The room was spacious and well maintained, all facilities top class, we had access to the CLUB LOUNGE and as a frequent traveler i do stay in many hotels in Asia, the service and facilities at this lounge level were by far the best I have seen in the last 4 yrs or so, breakfast, light snacks throughout the day and then if that wasn't enough we were treated to full buffet dinner every night, absolutely outstanding and i cannot say enough about the staff, fantastic and helpful at every level   anyone traveling to Macau or even to HK (and that's were is normally stay) i would 100% recommend you visit the SHERATON, i will for all‚Ä¶",50
"Stayed only for a night as i traveled in from HK via Ferry.  Pro: Free Shuttle bus from the Ferry Terminals Largest Sheraton Hotel in the world Plenty of food options in the food court & other restaurants in the Cotai Sands Linked to the whole Cotai Sands Central Clean & spacious rooms  Cons: Too many China tourists (but this is the same everywhere isnt it?) Although free shuttle buses are provided to the Galaxy, it is a hassle if you want to go to Macau town or to the Venetian as you need to take the shuttle bus to Galaxy and take another free shuttle bus from there.  Hopefully with the upcoming Macau Light Rail, connectivity will be much better overall.",50
"Stayed at this hotel for the first time and I must say everything about it impressed me except the looooooooooong checkin.  It literally took me 30 minutes to queue up to check into the hotel. Other than that, everything was luxurious. The room are clean and big with huge bathrooms. King size bed and a great view of the pool from my room. There's a casino within the hotel compound so unless u have some time to kill, can take a stroll towards Venetian.   Good options were ample with restaurants and food courts. Ladies will find lots of shopping choices here with the international brands. The hotel is well connected to surrounding malls and hotels with aircon walkways.   ",40
"Beautiful hotel, excellent service at the lobby, we were also upgraded to a room with view for free (facing the Venetian and the swimming pools) as we were SPG members.   Shuttle services was also great, and the swimming pool was just decadent. Bed was really comfortable and room was modern and spacious with a huge window.  Room service can be a tad unfriendly as we asked for an extra pillow and amenties set and was being questioned by the staff.",40
"This is a huge and very busy hotel. The check in queue snakes for about 50 metres. Luckily there is a quiet SPG checkin counter which was tucked away and hardly used. As SPG Plat, I was upgraded to a 1BR executive suite on the 33rd Floor with partial view of Cotai strip. The bedroom was huge and bathroom was larger!  Had breakfast and evening cocktails in the Club Lounge. The Lounge has a very extensive spread, and was larger than most restaurants in other Sheratons! Excellent service by all staff who spoke English.  Fast and free wifi. Great connectivity with free buses to many places in Macau. Enjoyed getting lost in the Sands Cotai Mall, which links to the Venetian Mall via overhead link bridge.  ",40
"Booked deluxe twin room for our stay. Besides the usual expected of Sheraton n a very helpful housekeeping staff on duty on 11 & 13 Dec, service of staff whom I encountered was a disappointment. 1. Hotel prepared birthday cake for my son which was much appreciated. However it came without a knife nor candle, not to mention matchsticks. It took an hour before I received all 3 items. 2. Housekeeping did not tidy up toiletries at shower area 2 days in a row. 3. SPG checkout area, ramp entrance was closed n I struggled to remove the barrier with staff watching ... At reception, when staff asked for feedback, I related incident but receptionist did not apologize for bad service at all?! No need to say more, the above is not acceptable for the price I paid for a stay at Sheraton.",30
"We travelled with friends to Macao for a night away from Hong Kong.   Wow - this is the biggest Sheraton in the whole world, it was huge.  Over 3000 rooms and we were lucky that our two rooms were on the same floor - just at opposite ends. It was a very impressive hotel - the rooms were very very comfortable and the bathrooms were well equipped. We made use of the different swimming pools and relaxation areas in the hotel before heading to see the House of Dancing Water over the road.  (an excellent production - very much a must see). We also visited the different casinos that the hotel hosts and marvelled at the sheer scale of gambling going on.  It was an eye opener for sure!  But very entertaining.",40
"This is our preferred hotel in macau. Stayed 4 nights at the executive suite which was amazingly huge n well equipped. The club lounge offer excellent breakfast, tea n pre dinner cocktails.  The staff service at the lounge is exceptionally efficient. Staff are friendly and ever so helpful. We will return.",50
Very spacious room with huge bathroom with shower and bath.  Sheraton hptel is in a massive casino/hotel complex.  Mcdonalds very close by and there is a food court section quite close by although We preferred the food court section in the venetian complex.  All the complexes are interconnecting and you could spend days without going outside.,50
"Normally staying at a Sheraton hotel (or any of its competitors such as Hilton, Marriott, etc.) can prove to be a sublime experience. Everything smells of mildew mixed with basic cleaning fluids. That's exactly how this Sheraton was. Because Sheraton Cotai is part of the Sands Cotai complex, one would expect it to be much better. But Sheraton proves that reputations do matter.  Here is the review.  Positives + Absolutely clean room. We had a two-bedroom suite that was kept in clean condition and definitely much better than what we were expecting from Sheraton + We had a suite and the dual bedrooms which were also very well laid out + The hotel's location in Cotai is very close to the Venetian Cotai and features lots of casinos and other entertainment within walking distance +‚Ä¶",20
"The Sheraton Macau is ideally situated, close to other hotels and casinos.  Rooms are large are well appointed.  Choice of restaurants and showing is extensive.  Don't like what it has to offer then it is connect by overhead walkways to the Venitian and the Sands.  If in Macau, this is where you want to be",40
"The hotel is huge, one can easily spend a few days exploring this grand property. Hotel house a casino, pools, food courts and many shops. Staff is courteous. Rooms are good in size with adequate lighting. Beds are clean and comfortable. Wifi is available in the rooms. Good location and transportation is easily available. Most landmarks are at the walking distance. True experience of lavishness.",50
One of Macau's biggest with 4000+ rooms so it is impressive that it runs so efficiently! fast checking! competent staff and respond quickly and considerately to guest feedback and requests. Rooms good as you would expect and exec suite excellent. Good free transport from and to ferry. Part of extensive shopping entertainment and casino complex all connected for easy indoor walking access.,40
"Staff were great. Very helpful. All counter staff had good English skill. Very convenient to casino and shops. Shuttle buses were coming and going often but if you need to get somewhere really fast take a taxi, but get the guys at the hotel to help you unless you speak Chinese, and even then it's difficult. Great free wifi. Would stay again for sure. Very comfortable for business trip.",40
"I reach Macau on 7th dec at 1030am & try mine lucky to check see any room early for me & mine young family(2/4years old gal),I check in club house fast check in since I book excutive room,the staffs I meet his name is Bruno Miguel & I meet him 4* during mine stay here & he remember mine name to mine surprise since this hotel is quite big too,his service & this hotel staffs make me have a wonderful stay for 6days/5nites",40
"Arriving at the world's largest Sheraton is kind of overwhelming. Everything is just BIG! The friendlyness and efficiency at the check-in is outstanding and certainly rare.  Rooms in Macao tend to be large so you would expect Venetian style sizes, but again surprise, surprise - outperformance. With 5 or 6 outdoor pools (some heated) you can relax even in winter months. And the hotel succeeded in my ultimate China test: order a bucket of ice - sounds easy, but believe me it's not. Yet, again full 100 points: the concierge understood and asked if I needed only a few ice cubes for glasses or to cool bottles. Within 5 mins everything was at the room!  Great hotel, super lounge, well trained hospitable staff with a smile! Sure coming back!",50
"If you are going to Macau to sightsee rather than visit the casinos, the location of the hotel is perfect in walking distance of most of the central sights.  The entire staff is very welcoming and kind, going out of their way to be helpful.  The rooms are what you would anticipate for a big city hotel - very nice though nothing unique.  We were fortunate to stay on the concierge floor - the extra cost was well worth it.  You can make dinner out of the evening cocktail spread, there is a wonderful breakfast, and a nice afternoon tea.  We took the ferry from Hong Kong but ended up in the other ferry terminal so needed to take a taxi rather than a free shuttle.Everything about our stay was nice.",50
"I've been coming to this hotel ever since it opened & every time it's been an absolute perfect trip. Service is impeccable. The staff goes above and beyond to help you. The facilities (sauna, gym, etc.) are well equipped and staffed (24/7). The location is excellent, so are the shopping and dinning options. I very highly recommend it.",50
"This is a nice hotel-we got a good deal and the rooms were large .  But the 3900 rooms means queues:at check in/checkout, at breakfast,at the lift etc. There are queues & crowds everywhere.   Its hard to have a memorable experience at such a crowded hotel.   ",30
"We stayed for one night in Sheraton, for  $234 AUD, it is a very good but slightly pricy hotel. Big and spacious and very comfortable bed.  Overall, it was lovely. Free shuttle bus to both ferry terminals and airport. Helpful staff. I definitely enjoyed my stay. ",50
"The main reason for booking this hotel was the free transport from the ferry terminal.  The buses run from 0930 every 15-20 min until 2000 (I think!).  When you arrive in the ferry terminal head out following the bus and hotel signs, down the escalator and up the other side of the road, turn left and it is the little green coaches.  I think you can take this buses to the city/north to see the historic sites also free of charge.  When checking out, you can buy the boat tickets in the travel centre in the East lobby near McDonalds ...  The bus leaves from the South lobby.  The room was big and clean with a bathroom with bath and shower.  Oh and the kettle is in the draw!!  We took a day to find it and had to call ... We were jet lagged... If you are a Sheraton group member, they‚Ä¶",50
"We really had an awesome time at this hotel to the extend that my children refused to explore further. We were served by Alrie at the club lounge upon check in. He was attentive and provided excellent service throughout our stay. He checked with his manager and upgraded us from our club room to executive suite. It benefited us greatly since it is our anniversary celebration trip. My husband and I had the privacy of a king size bed bedroom and my two children had their fun in the sofa bed bedroom. It is a perfect arrangement. My children also enjoyed their time in the bath tub with good water pressure/flow. The best part of the stay is the buffet breakfast, whole day free snacks and happy hour in the evening with free flow of beer, wine etc. We did not have to spend much on food‚Ä¶",50
Free buses from the Ferry terminal make this hotel easily accessible. The rooms are quite and well decorated. Casinos here were will covered up and we did not even notice they were there.  The bathroom amenities were ample and even included a scale. This hotel is features a Dreamworks themed breakfast which is designed for the children. The tickets are about 270 MOP for adults and 180ish MOP for children. There is also a daily parade and photo op with Dreamworks characters Defiantly family friendly.,50
"Would recommend for anyone who wants a decent room, in a good location. Very large hotel (largest Sheraton campus in network). We got a room in the Earth tower, the newer wing. Able to walk to the Hard Rock and Venetian, took taxi to the north side to see the Wynn (poker), and ferries. Hotel has all the basic vegas style amenities, and pleasing, moderate scale, not the flamboyant style of venetian or bellagio. good place for families, sightseers.",40
"The welcome letter in the room starts with ""welcome to the World's Largest Sheraton (yes each word is Capitalized)....and that's because it's BIG.   As you know Macau in a Las Vegas on steroids and this place in no exception to that    Big difference is the Small Service (notice the Capitalization) they offer.   Check in is a disaster with long queues (and I am a premium Starwood member) - and if you succeed to find anybody working here - then you have won at the casino. In fact same chances I bet.   Rooms are nice and bathrooms ""plush"", bedding is superb.   Call it a 5 star if you want - I give it a 3 and 7/8 and a 1 for service.   Can't tell you if this is a Macau thing or the hotel management style, but in a country where labor is affordable it's a big mistake not to pamper‚Ä¶",30
Really nice hotel overall. We are here now spending a special time with my girl here in Macau. Happy with the room itself although I thought I booked a deluxe view and from my room 2128 all I get is a big bar and half a wall blocking the view to the Venetian which I was excited for. Check in tried to charge me triple the price I reserved direct through SPG for but he was nice and straightened it out. Can say I would enjoy the room much more if it actually had a view. I live for views. Nice place though and good access to cabs and the shops across the street. would definitely stay again but would ask to see the room first to see what I'm looking at for 4 days. I suggest you do the same. ,40
"I stayed here for 3 days while attending a conference. It is huge and probably that accounts to the small delays during check in and check out. Room was excellent with a good view of the street and the Vinetian on the other side. Walks inside the place can be demanding for some people, but that is again is expected in a huge hotel that boasts about 4000 rooms. Breakfast and lunch buffet had excellent spread of Seafood, Meat, Poultry (not a Vegie, so can‚Äôt comment on that). There used to be European, Chinese and few Indian dishes available and the desserts session was well stocked.  I have to mention that I was disappointed with the quality of service (ONLY) in the  restaurant, you will find spoons and other cutlery not in place and have to request multiple times to get what you‚Ä¶",40
"This is my 3rd trip to Macau. Previously I have stayed in Venetian and Lisboa and this time I decided to stay in Sheraton Macau due to reviews and good promotion. The room is clean, nice and decent size. Don't expect to be a big room as Venetian's room. The service is tip top. I booked directly through Sheraton and they did picked up from my reservation that I'm travelling with a young child. They wrote back to me asking whether I need a baby crib, a baby bathtub or a baby stroller.   The location is fantastic, 10 minutes from airport and there are plenty of restaurants as the hotel is connected to a mall and Venetian. They also provide free shuttle buses to many places such as airport, Zhuhai border and others.",40
"Amongst the numerous hotels in the Taipa area, Sheraton probably offers one of the cheapest rate. For that rate, I thought my stay there was pretty good.  My stay coincide with the Clash at Cotai. So maybe that is why it was quite crowded although I wasn't there for the Clash. Sorry. Not interested in boxing. But despite of that, the check-in was smooth. I managed to check-in and get a room at 1pm even though the official check-in time is 3pm.  The room was very standard of a 4 star hotel. The king size bed was comfy. They gave 4 complimentary bottles of water everyday. That is generous. The wifi was pretty slow though. And for English Premier League fans, they don't have tv channels for that. So I have to resort to internet streaming, which is a bummer because of the slow‚Ä¶",40
"Stayed here for a few nights with my family. Got a couple of twin rooms on an early bird rate.  Location is goodif you want to be in the Cotai strip.  Located just across the Venetian & COD. They have free shuttle bus to airport, ferry terminal, Galaxy, and Chinese border.  Rooms are spacious and clean. Basic amenities and toiletries are provided. There's a ref and aircon works fine. Bathroom looks elegant with a glass door shower and enough space to move around.  Staff service is average.  Lots of restaurants to choose from, there's even a foodcourt.  For the price we paid, it's decent value for money, considering the good location, quality of rooms and convenience of transportation options.

"Stayed for 6 nights combining a 50th Birthday/Eloping. The Sheraton was OUTSTANDING. Not only are the grounds immaculate and well cared for. The rooms are clean and fresh. Nothing was a problem for anyone from Domestic to Concierge. Special mention to Sandy and the Executive Guest Services who did everything to look after our special day. Must also comment on the fabulous food, wine. Casino was also fun. Did not smell any remnants of smoking which is a pet hate of mine.  Totally recommend.",50
Recommend: YES Stayed for 1 night in late Oct 2014.  Room:  Had a room with 2 double beds and there was plenty of room left even with luggage.  Hotel if quite new so everything felt great.  Bathroom: One of the best bathrooms for a hotel i've been at mainly at the finishings and the size; def clean and very comfortable  Service: my only negative comment is that it took about 50 mins to check in due to the queue of people waiting to check in and potentially the slowness of service staff;  further it took about an hour to get through immigration at the ferry terminal so perhaps its a learning curve issue dealing with the number of people!  Location: You will need to take the shuttlebus/taxi to the hotel but it is connected to a few other hotels whilst some other hotels are within‚Ä¶,40
"We stayed here last week and I am overwhelmed of the whole facility. There are two tower, sky and earth. We enjoyed the very nice suite room upgrade. Thank you! It was my very first time to be upgraded to such a beautiful room with an entertainment room. 3 televisions, great dining table and living room. Two toilets, one shower room and a huge bath tub. The size of the room is super.   Sheraton Macao Is truly one of a kind. The club lounge is huge. everything here is huge :) the Feast restaurant is also huge but the selection of food could be more international than more Chinese food. Overall we enjoyed our stay and will definitely come back.   Our very special thanks to Marilou at the club lounge for such a warm service. And also to Marc Lester Lindo, Rob and the rest of staff‚Ä¶",50
"First thought on entering the lobby: ""Fantastic"". This is the kind of hotel I was looking for!!  Check In: A very very smooth check in, very warm welcome at the reception. Staff at Sheraton was super amazing and super friendly.  Breakfast: A very sumptuous spread. Lot of variety. It was a heaven for non-vegetarian but even the vegetarians had a lot of options (I am a vegetarian).      Room: Huge rooms with superb quality furniture. Room service was very prompt.   Location: Located on the strip and near all the big hotels (all are interconnected).  Casinos, Shopping, Shows: There is so much to do that you can easily spend good 2-3 days here.  Overall it is a perfect choice if you are planning a vacation to Macau.",50
"""This is the world's largest Sheraton"" we were proudly told when we checked in - and at 4,000 rooms, that is almost certainly true.   The hotel is part of a literally vast complex which includes an upscale shopping mall, a casino, at least half a dozen restaurants plus the huge Sheraton and a Holiday Inn.   My room was very nice, spotlessly clean and the staff were unquestionably very friendly and helpful. Shortly after I had checked in, a hand written card was slid under my door, welcoming me to the 'worlds largest Sheraton' - which I thought was a nice touch.   For me, personally, this hotel is probably just a touch TOO big. There was a long queue for check in, I got lost trying to find my room after I'd been for a swim (there is a reasonably complicated system of elevators‚Ä¶",40
Great location in Cotai. Good transfers to help get around Macau. The staff were friendly. Check in was easy but was never given breakfast vouchers or told where to go for breakfast. Free wi fi was great and easy to connect to.,40
"My friend and I were there for a birthday celebration ""again"", well, as a SPG member, I received an email from Supervisor of Front Office, Mr. Gregorio Lim for the express check in under Sheraton Speed Lane Check In program.  It was really thoughtful for a SPG member to check in the biggest Sheraton hotel in the world.  It was vey fast the check in time.",50
"First time in Macau, First time staying in Sheraton Macao Hotel, We arrived at the hotel on a busy weekend in the evening, I will told by my cousin that if I am a SPG member, I can go to SPG front desk for express check in, but the staff there do the check in very slowly, ever ask me to show her the SPG Card, when she can ever check at her system base on my email address. I think if go to the normal check in desk maybe will be faster.   The rooms are clean, huge and well-kept and the room view also very nice(22th Floors). The staff who help us to bring our luggage up to the room ever tell us out front that the door is very heavy, when we are opening the door need to be careful not to injure our self. The In room dining services also quite fast, I call to place an order, they‚Ä¶",30
"i just stayed one night in this hotel but i enjoyed my stay. this hotel located in central of cotai so it near to go to city of dream and venetian. Hotel looks luxurious and their service is good, i arrived in Macau by early ferry from hongkong and already in front of the check in counter on 9 am, i know that we not able to check in on 9 am but i try to request for early check in since i have yet to sleep a long night and thanks...they said we can check into our room at 11 o'clock. Wait for 2 hour is not a problem because we have our breakfast first and go around hotel, it already take 2 hours :)",40
"Second time that I have stayed at the Sheraton and was really impressed with the service.  I was checked in by Paolo Reyes who did a great job in looking after me, especially given that this was big fight weekend and pretty busy.  No doubt every time I return to Macau it will be to stay at the Sheraton.  Top quality",50
"Nothing to really write homer about about this place, but nothing to upset you either, I guess I would come back again, if I couldn't afford to stay at one of the 5 star resorts. This Sheraton is as good as the chain would suggest.",40
"Stayed here for 1 night with my husband and two children (age 11 and 12). Free wifi included and faster than some other hotels in the same area. The rooms are beautiful, huge and well-kept. Good value for money! Definitely will come back and stay next time.",40
"Stay at high floor, away from lift, non smoking and king size bed. Glad that the hotel fulfill all our requests.  Hotel is connected to Venetian through walkways and it's a shopping paradise.   Wide range of food from restaurants to food court and even fast food.  When taking shuttle bus from ferry terminal, look for the sign ""Sheraton"" on their Sand Cotai bus, else it could be to Holiday Inn. Shuttle buses are connected to various hotels. Importantly, it is connected to Galaxy Macau where we can hop on their buses to Senado Square and 5-10min walk to Taipa Village.  The only inconvenience we faced is we took lift down to level 2 to the shops and couldn't take the lift back to rooms and had to make a big detour. Probably for security reasons? Overall, i happy.",40
Nice hotel coz its just beside the shopping center and i really love the scent of the hotel. The room was simple but sooo comtable. Id like to mention the breakfast..was fantastic. Hoping to stay again here.,30
"This hotel is situated in the casino area. As of now, it is on the farthest end of the casino area, but it looks like there will be other casinos and hotels built further along the Cotai strip area.   The room was reasonably sized with basic coffee, tea, water provided along with a kettle. The mini bar is locked so you will not be able to use it to keep your personal stuff cool. There are two bottles of water provided in the main room and two others next to the bathroom sink. But using tap water is not an issue.  There are not a lot of power sockets provided. Next to the bed there appeared to be none. The lamp in between the two beds was so large that the ipod/iphone dock with clock cannot be seen from one of the two beds.  The bathroom has both bath and shower. No bath salts‚Ä¶",40
"Stayed there for 3 nights as a business traveler and really liked the stay. The rooms are new, spacious and I was given a cotai facing room which had a great view. Has every possible facility that you can think of (visited the health center, which was awesome) and is internally connected to Venetian, Four Seasons, Sands and Holiday Inn Hotels. Highly recommended.",50
"I had booked two rooms for 4 of us and was pleasantly surprised to find that we were upgraded to two suites on the 32nd floor (I am Platinum with SPG). This was unlike any Sheraton I had ever stayed it, very posh!!! Check-in was efficient and the food in the Sheraton Club was quite good.   I wish I had stayed longer than one night to of experienced more of the hotel and Macau.",50
We had a fantastic stay at sheraton recently. One of the staff named Bruno was extremely kind and helpful during our check in process as it is our first time to Macau and were with 2 young kids. That left us with a very good first impression of Sheraton's level of service. The room was spacious and clean. My kids enjoyed the Shrekfast as well as the character parades daily. However the breakfast at Xin was disappointing with little variety.  ,50
"This is a really beautiful hotel but in the vein of most Macau/Vegas-type hotels it is massive.  It has multiple towers, which can be frustrating if you are there with friends or a conference (which we were) and on different floors as not every lift went to every floor and all that jazz.  It does make sense though as then you don't have overly full lifts, but not everyone will appreciate that.    There are a number of pools to chose from based upon what you prefer...lap swimming, family time, lounging around.  In fact we were there such a short amount of time I wasn't able to actually see just how many facilities this place has to offer.    The rooms are beautiful, huge and well-kept.  The bathrooms stunning, covered in marble and leaves plenty of room for two if not ten people‚Ä¶",40
"The hotel property is good, the food is awesome and the location is great. rooms are spacious and the casino is ok. what needs to be in place for this to be a great hotel is the service attitude of some of the people in the hotel. we were at a conference and just after the break when i asked for coffee i was told that coffee time is over and hence was not served. likewise when asked early before the conference began it was denied. during lunch we asked for something off the buffet menu and were first told that it cannot be ordered and finally after some negotiations got the same and paid extra for it. some lessons on service to be given are needed to make the leap to a great hotel.",30
"originally 4 of us (two couples)booked 2 standard rooms to stay 1 night at the Sheraton Macau, because I am the SPG Gold member, we were amazingly upgraded to the Ambassador Suite! the room located at the 32nd floor is super large and gorgeous with 2 king size bedrooms, dining room and kitchen as well. let alone the professional and kind service at the SPG member desk, with huge credit to the Guest Services Ambassador Paola Reyes, I will definitely make return visit very soon..... Marco",50
"I will preface this review by stating that my husband and I are SPG Platinum Ambassador members, which means besides all the benefits that we are entitled to, my husband stays in SPG properties over 100 nights a year!  That's 100/365 nights that our money is spent with the property chain and we were more than disappointed with the service that was offered to us.  Indeed, we have very high expectations, but what is the point of a sticking with a hotel chain if we do not enjoy any benefits?  We left the Sheraton Macau asking this very question.  We arrived at the property on a busy weekend (the Grand Prix races were on) and the hotel was supposedly at maximum occupancy.  I understand this is a stressful and busy time for all hotel personnel, but this is also the time big hotels,‚Ä¶",20
"Really good hotel- generous spacious corridors, room n bathroom. Service is good n very organized. The signages are very clear and you won't get lost. Be prepared to walk a lot. Buffet breakfast at The Feast is indeed a feast with an international cuisine. I will go back there again in the future. ",50
this is my third stay in this hotel and this time is the longest one...we stay here for five nights.Im amazed by the profesionalism of the staff at the check in counter...more over one of the staff named Diego for sure he show us his good work habit eventhough he look very tired. we always loved this hotel due to facility and the breakfast provided with so many choices.. even though its casino hotel but you can also bring your family to have a nice holiday here. for sure i will return to this hotel again,50
"Very nice hotel, clean and well-maintained. This is a casino hotel, hence as usual, you don't get the personal touch to the services you receive. But for a 5* casino hotel, the service at the front desk is more than acceptable.   Good value for money! Definitely will come back and stay next time.",40
"Spent 4 days at the Cotai Sheraton with exceeding expectations. The club lounge staff and the quality of service and ameneties were excellent, with credits to the Guest services manager Joao Calado, Bruno Migues, Staffanie, Jaulian, just to mention a few. Had a great room overlooking the 'Venetian' on the 32nd floor. Local visits cincluded, the Galaxy, Venetian, and Taipa village with many nice restaurants, including authentic Portuguese fare. Would return any time.",50

"Had stayed at Sheraton Macao previously (three times in fact) and decided to go back again. As usual, great service, great sleep quality and good food!  Definitely need to mention is how meticulous housekeeping is, not only did they remember my water drinking habit, there is also a welcome card, welcoming me back again and to enjoy the stay!! This is what personal touch and service is all about! Kudos to the housekeeping division of Sheraton Macao.  Am definitely coming back again!!",50
I add money to suite and they have a sofa bed in the living rm. the toilet is very big and nice which I like the best. the service is soso. the bed is comfortable and the room is very clean. the sofa bed is very hard and not comfortable.the food in this hotel is soso. u pay for upgrades but u also have to pay extra for the kids to enter the restaurant. they say u pay for upgrades and u can enter the restaurant for drinks and food for free and when we enter they ask us to pay extra for the kids and we didn't so the upgrades we pay for was useless. the reception didn't explain.i was not that happy.,40

In addition, he helps me to translate my address with typing to become a member of SPG membership which no need to write anything and feeling like a ""king"".  I requested to stay on the non-smoking floor, but i could discover some smoked cigarettes were being remained near the lift and the surrounding area full of smells.  Thus, I request for change to another floor and another receptionist restricted me to change ""without a wise reason"".  Thus I found a hotel manager Mariana to solve the problem and she really had a heart to handle the problem.  For the breakfast in Xin is really hard to taste and far away from my hotel‚Ä¶",10
"another trip to macau, this time a good midweek deal at the sheraton. nice big room and bathroom with walk-in shower. free wifi included and faster than some other hotels in the same area. sheraton is part of huge complex that includes the conrad hotel and the holiday inn. so there are endless ourlets to eat. we had buffet in the one of the restaurants for lunch. indian food really tasty. breakfast was in feast restaurant.  buffet style offering westetn, indian and chinese options. even european style cold cuts and cheese and top class bread. good coffee too. even ice cream offered for the kids.",40
"All in all a decent hotel with average room and good location as it is connected well to four seasons and the Venetian via the cotai bridge, in room dining was a serious let down specially if you wish to satisfy your craving for Indian food. It's unbelievable how a hotel like Sheraton Macau can go wrong with a simple dish like lamb biryani, what we indeed got in our room was steamed rice and mutton curry. I called back in room dining and asked if I could speak to the chef but the lady who picked up my call said this is all that they can serve for biryani and sent a person in 5 minutes to get it picked up with the story ending then and there, a first experience for me in the history of staying with any Starwood brand .  They even took 2 calls and 20 minutes to deliver ice cubes‚Ä¶",20
"I have stayed in this hotel a few times because it often offers good value packages through travel agents.  It is not a luxurious hotel like Conrad or the Four Seasons next door, but at its price, I consider it value for money for an overnight stay for slot games and food in Macau. The rooms are not big but of a reasonable size and decently equipped with all the necessary amenities, and quite well maintained.    We booked two rooms through a travel agent earlier this month.  Our experience this time was bad right from the start, thanks to the poker-faced receptionist who checked us in without any warmth or smile throughout the process.  The bad feeling was further ""enhanced"" by the guest relations staff who anwered my call around midnight.  When I tried to speak to her in‚Ä¶",40
"Executive suite is beautiful 2 full rooms (entertainment room , bedroom) large bathroom with large tub. New hotel larger Sheraton in the world. Suite gives access to club lounge which gives excellent Buffett breakfast lunch and dinner access. Say snacks but have full assortment of foods. Access to business lounge and use of boardroom if needed. ",40
"Get a Starwood club membership online for free And you will feel the extra special treatment from the Sheraton staff. You get your booking on the club desk with welcome drinks and if lucky even an upgrade . Get a club room and you will have free buffet breakfast , afternoon tea or coffee and sandwich and from six to seven in the evening they have a free buffet for members . The staff are helpful. The rooms are clean and the beds and pillows are wonderful . From the hotel you can go o the shopping malls with bridges going to Venicia , Four Seasonsb, Conrad Holiday Inn Hotels. City of Dreams is just around the corner . We will definitely stay there again next time we go to Macau",50
Just came back from a business trip to Macau. Sheraton Macao was a comfortable decently luxurious convention hotel.  The room and bathroom were clean and decent(typical convention hotel kinds) but were a good size. The pool area and the food options were decent. Breakfast was included in the room price and was by far the best meal of the day.  Use the SPG preferred guest check-in area for faster check-in.    Internet and bottled water was free.  The italian restaurant Bene was pretty good too. There is a Starbucks near the high-end store area and food court in the hotel.   Stayed in the Earth Tower. Free shuttle from the Taipa as well as Macau ferry terminal. Hotel is in Taipa and connected to Venetian and NOT in old Macau city.,40
This casino hotel feels enormous. Travelling as a group of mixed ages this suited us.  Very reasonable off peak rates both directly or through the normal booking engines.  Plenty of excellent drinking and dining options and very comfortable spacious rooms.  SPG members area a convenient oasis to relax in this huge place. Efficient and friendly staff throughout. Smooth fast check in and check out. ,40
"Very good rooms, very spacious. Although the reception is crowded but the staff is very efficient. The hustle bustle adds charm to the hotel and the other hotels in the vicinity makes it easier to roam around and catch all the action at the centre of cotai strip.",40
"Been there last August 23 to 25.  The services and facilities need not to mention as you'll sure to have the best comfort you need.  The hotel is connected to three hotels, which includes Venetian Macau.  All you need is lots of cash or card, and everything are all set.  An expensive place, as most of top of the line stores are in there, and the place is casino heaven.  A great place to stay, but you need an excess cash to enjoy.  I won't recommend this place if you've got a tight budget.",50
"Cannot recommend higher ! Stunning hotel, buffet breakfast divine & the room gorgeous ! Location is amazing, situated right next to the Venetian hotel & Four seasons all linked by massive shopping centre. Hubby & I got lost the first day walking around & around the shops trying to find our way back!  Hotel is very easy to get to once off the ferry, just follow the Green signs  & takes you direct to the hotel. From there to get to the surrounding hotels & old Macau is easy, just jump on the shuttle buses ! To get to old Macau simply walk to Galaxy hotel next door & hop on. We never paid for any taxis. Pool was amazing & thank you for the free upgrade !",50
Arrived very late..Spg gold check in closed then with only two people checking in..get a grip management :( also no one to help with luggage Gave me a suite room upgrade..thanks guys..what a room that is even a KTV room sound proofed in the suite Shocked that there are very very few restaurants and their quality not good Great gym one of best in Asia..:) Casino..no USA style games all Chinese No shows in Macau.. Cirque Du soleil canceled due to lack of business Shopping mall next to the hotel..all high end Starbucks 10 mins walk The food court in mall..no western food all Chinese ASK FOR UPGRADE TO SUITE...WOW X 2,30
First impression left by the check in staff was great. Very courteous and helpful in providing information. I had not done any research prior arriving in Macau but it was very easy to find our way within the hotel and even out of the hotel. Sheraton is connected to Venetian Hotel via a bridge. It's quite a long walk though. There are free shuttle buses from Sheraton to ferry terminals and also to Galaxy Hotel where you can catch connecting shuttle buses to many other hotels. Sheraton is nearer to Taipa Ferry Terminal which is less than 10 mins drive away.,50
"Third time stay at Sheraton Macau, Check in and Check out was done by same FO agent Paola(?) At East lobby. Appericiated for smooth process and we thanks for a teddy bear. Our bed was found decorated with flowers and greetings card prepared by Guest Relations team. It's amazing and WoW once step into our suite.We felt great and very happy for the unexpected arrangement. Room was clean, wifi is fast, all equipments in suite functioning well. Strongly recommend to have great Sheraton experience when you visit to Macau.",50
"I stayed here for 4 nights for a business trip, 3 nights was paid by the company and I extended one additional night by myself prior to my arranged schedule.When I checked in, I told the front office that this additional night will be borne by myself, but they insisted that I have to pay for all 4 nights, even they already had a confirmation letter and credit card warranty from the company. Well, finally they locked up my credit card for $8000 as deposit. But on the second night, at around 10 PM, the front desk called me and said the deposit was not enough for 4 nights, so I need to come down and swipe again my credit card. what the heck calling at this hour? Then I explained again to her about the condition above and she understood. My colleague also experienced the same thing,‚Ä¶",30
"The moment i entered the Hotel, i met an ordinary front desk manager, who just changed our holiday completely... "" paola reyes"" the star of the front desk...utmost intelligent, superbly caring, great eyes for detail...in 10 mins that i was checking in, my whole experienced transpired into a vacation of a life time.  She enrolled me for the SPG membership, allotted a better room for my family, arranged the famous shrekfast for my young son, ensured we got priority table in the shrekfast, explained me in details - how could i check in in "" 3 seconds flat""....  Paola, if you reading this, i and family are grateful to you for this wonderful experience.  Superb hotel now...each and everything, you dont need to go for anything...and that means anything, over 500 shops in the complex,‚Ä¶",50
Great hotel. Really amazing staff that went out of their a way to make my stay special. I was upgraded to executive suite and it was fantastic. It included the club room that I enjoyed very much. I extended my stay for an extra night because I lived it so much!! I will visit again for sure. ,50
"A travelers first physical encounter in a hotel occurs at check in - I had a very pleasant experience at check in -Ms Liway Boncado -although I waited a long time to check in since it was a weekend -Ms Boncado was very pleasant, professional, courteous -she saw to it that I got the room that I wanted - I booked 2 rooms, since no adjoining rooms were available, I got the room which is across each other. She was very attentive and saw to it that all my needs were met. I would like to commend her good attitude - instead of being mad because of the long wait, I came out with a smile. Calling the attention of Sheraton's GM, good employees are hard to come by -please take good care of your employees, Ms. Boncado deserves a raise.",40
"Serving breakfast buffet is never easy, not alone at the largest Sheraton in the world. Feast, at the Macau Sheraton, is well organized, staff move super fast, and for some miracle, Mia, their super sweet host, can recognize me out of thousands of guest and remembers what newspaper I'd like. Kenneth is so focus but also show lots of grace admit hundreds of demanding guests.  Food is always good at the Feast, but the staff are admirable.",50
"Dedicated check-in counter for SPG members. Was given an early check-in and surprise welcome gift. Booked the shrekfast by Dreamworks and the kids had fun and great breakfast with the various charactors. Hotel within Cotai Strip shopping, also walking distance to Venetian and City of dreams. ",40
"The first time I tried the Sheraton in Macau, and definitely not the last time.  I was really impressed with this hotel.  In the past the Conrad used to be my favorite hotel in Macau.   However, after trying the Sheraton it has now become my favorite hotel in Macau.  And why is that?  Not only do they offer fantastic value for money, they have spotless large rooms. Best of all, the Sheraton is one of the only hotels in Cotai that offers club lounge access.  Their lounge is tastefully decorated and has an extensive breakfast spread in the morning, snacks throughout the day, and a nice early evening canap√©s and drinks, which can easily substitute dinner.   The lounge did get quite busy in the mornings when we were staying there, so it did not feel as exclusive as other lounges I‚Ä¶",50
"This is a very huge hotel (almost 4 000 rooms and when arriving in the lobby, it looks overcrowded.   Fortunately, we were upgraded in a suite but friends staying with us in a Sheraton Club room had a very nice room. The view from our room were not great because of new hotels construction near the Sheraton but you do not have to worry the hotel is very quiet. Everything is immense in this hotel, even the Sheraton Lounge does not look comfy or intimate as you can wait from other hotels. It is a little to big for us but the staff is very efficient. There is a free shuttle serve from the Taipa Ferry Terminal (every 15mn approx.) and the Sheraton is just near to the Venetian hotel, casino and mall as well as the City of Dreams of you want to see a show. This hotel is in Cotai. If‚Ä¶",40
"My recent stay at Sheraton Macao was nothing short of memorable. We checked in during the period from 19th to 22nd Oct, an advanced celebration for our silver wedding anniversary together. Our heartfelt appreciation goes out to the Guest Relations Team who spared no effort in decorating our room befitting a pleasant surprise. Additionally, I would like to extend a special commendation to Mr Diogo Monterio, the guest services ambassador who went the extra mile in acceding to our requests throughout our stay. He really made our stay at Sheraton Macao that much more comfortable and magnificent. We would definitely be back.",50
I stayed overnight at Sheraton Macao and found that it was made undeniably easier because I was an SPG member. The queue to check in and out can otherwise take quite long.   I was helped by Digo Momteiro at the SPG counter and he could not have been more helpful - he provided me a room close to the lifts as I am heavily pregnant and even changed my breakfast voucher to the restaurant closest to my room. He made the entire experience wonderful.,40
"First, upgrade to Club Class. For a very reasonable price, you get express check-in & check-out which, believe me, is a life saver. Unlimited canapes & drinks on the house in the Club Lounge. Secondly, regardless of anything the staff is extremely friendly & co-operative.  Definitely worth another visit!",50
"Nice rooms, immense meeting room areas, numerous restaurants, efficient staff.  5 min by taxi from the airport, walkbridge to the Venetian hotel/casino - just this is Cotai, not Macau so you need to cross the bridge to go to the old Macau (it's not that big anyway :)",40
"We stayed in this hotel for 6 nights recently. Our room on the 30th Floor was perfect. It was a large room with a king sized bed. Opposite the bed was a big TV on the wall. We had a separate desk and a lounge chair with a foot stool to match. The air con worked very well and was very quiet. The bathroom was large with a big vanity unit with plenty of room for both our toiletries.  The bath was deep, comfortable and good handles to get in and out of it.  Our Executive Room rate included full buffet breakfast, and from 5.30pm to 7pm a light buffet dinner was available free including alcohol.  Good champagne, red and white wines, and beer.  Staff very helpful. In the lobby there was a service to purchase another SIM card for your phone. This hotel interconnects with other hotels‚Ä¶",50
"I‚Äôd stayed in mega hotels in Las Vegas years ago so I suppose I should‚Äôve known what to expect from the Sheraton Macau.  They boast that their Cotai Strip hotel is the largest of their chain in the world, but it‚Äôs nothing worth bragging about.  Situated in a complex which connects to other hotels, restaurants, a mall and two casinos, the whole feel is cold and money grabbing.  I was told by a stroppy guest service operator that we could only get one extra pillow for our room and drinking water was limited to four free 33ml bottles per day (there‚Äôs a plentiful supply of bottles in the free to enter casinos, but you can‚Äôt take them with you).    The bedroom, although bland and generically decorated, was good sized and had two comfortable double beds, plus we had an impressive view‚Ä¶",30
"Last August, my wife and I decided to celebrate our 12th wedding anniversary at Macau. We decided to try the Sheraton this time even though we normally stayed at the Venetian. Upon arriving at the Club Lounge we were quite pleased with the professionalism that the Club Lounge staff showed especially with Mr. Alrie Rocamora, who, upon finding out that it was our anniversary, not only upgraded us to a suite, but gave my wife some maccaroons as a gift - such an affable young man. We loved our suite, the food selections at the Lounge, and the professionalism the staff exhibited. We are definitely staying at the Sheraton for our New Year's Eve trip this year.",50
"First time stay at Macau Sheraton hotel. Pretty much expected the grandeur for most casino hotels.   Room is cozy, spacious and can house 3 people or more. Great for a hangout with friends. The hotel has 2 towers, went banging on the wrong door after our night show on 'The House of the Dancing Water'. Quite confusing with the layout.  The walk to City of Dreams were quite a long one, having made couple of trips in a day.  Food Recommendations: We found this great 'Michelin' restaurant on the way to St Paul... 'WONGKUN' (google for the address since it is written only in Chinese characters) serves house speciality Curry Sea Crab. We did not try since only 2 small appetite, thus tested simple dishes were good enough to AW both of us.   Good Experience!",40
Free shuttle from the airport and ferry port. New nicely equipped gym was one of the best  on our trip.Nice new room with a comfortable bed. Staff was awkward and the hotel lacked quality food options.  I would skip Macao on future trips to Asia.,30
"I arrived at the hotel and found out that it was past of the Starwood hotel chain. I had not done my reservation (my sister took care of that) so I was not listed as the primary guest but Diogo Momteiro who was taking care of us at the front desk did the impossible so I could enjoy the perks of being a member.  The hotel is impeccable, the room very spacious and decorated with exquisite taste. The staff is very helpful, kind and amicable. This is my second time around in Macau and I will definitely book my next stay at the Sheraton Macao.",50
"Recently visited with my wife and our son and on his recommendation , we stopped for just one night but all agreed we should have stayed longer.It is in a very good position for visiting the casino's and shows and old Macau.But it is the quality of hotel staff  the rooms and facilities that makes this hotel special.",40
Large spacious rooms with Sheraton special interiors . The only disadvantage is that it is little far from the happening old Macauc area. Casino on the lobby is a good time pass. Try and get a room close  to the lift else you will end up walking long :) Overall amazing experience but felt it was little over crowded thanks to the Casinos. ,40
"We reached the hotel, which is a very large hotel, and we got personal attention and a warm welcome.  We waited in the room a pleasant surprise in honor of our anniversary.  The concierge staff, very kind, welcoming, orderly manner, taking care of the guests and willing to help with anything.  Helped and explained us everything we asked for.",50
"Stayed here several times for business over recent months. Comfortable, clean and generously sized room, stable wifi, efficient staff and good F&B. Add to that its central location on the Cotai strip and you have a great place to stay. Not thinking twice about returning.",50
"Free and frequent buses to and from the port, train or airport... what more can you ask for?!...Got allocated a high floor and the views were quite nice... of course the next door is a construction site but I think a new and casino is coming up soon! Hotel is located within easy access to Venetian and the Sands... very good location",50
"Stayed here 3 nights for a work trip. The rooms are very nice and in awesome condition, big luxurious bathrooms and great beds.  If you prefer the cotai strip to old Macau then the location is great, extreme touristy though. Its just across the road from Venetian and hard rock hotel.  In terms of the the rest of the hotel, its all clean and well maintained but its designed for groups so you feel more like just a number or someone to be processed, definitely don't get the personal feel you would in a smaller Sheraton. This is the largest Sheraton in the world, it takes a long time to get around the hotel or even get out.   That said, all the staff i had contact with were very friendly and helpful.  I would recommend this hotel for a businesses stay.  ",50
"It ws an wonderful experience staying in Sheraton Macau. The facilities n food of the hotel were so nice. The hospitality of the hotel staff was excellent. In this regard I wish to take the name of Mr. Ryan Tam, he has helped and co operated a lot to make our stay smooth n nice. I wish him all the best. I wish to visit the hotel again soon.",50
"Our stay at the Sheraton Cotai Central Macau was the most incredible experience. The staff, especially Diogo Monterro, were very friendly, attentive and helpful. They offered amazing tips and ideas of things to do in the area making our stay one we will never forget! The rooms were big and very comfortable, the food was simply delicious and everything was clean and well organised, we could not have asked for a better get-a-way and an amazingly relaxed weekend. We cannot wait to return and experience this same quality experience again. Thank you Sheraton for this incredible holiday!",50
"I first visited Sheraton Macao in July / August '13 with 2 friends. The service was not outstanding and there were minor hiccups such as misinformation in pool availability and shuttle bus routes, but I really enjoyed the Club Lounge for me to book another trip to Sheraton Kuala Lumpur later.   I brought my parents back to the hotel on a holiday in October '14. How stark a difference it is from a little over a year ago! I checked in to a supposedly non-smoking room that reeks of cigarette smoke with a door that has a large crack on the side and stained carpets. Housekeeping happen to be setting up an additional bed in the room and they performed a 'cigarette treatment' which was nothing more than a few sprays of an air freshener, which masked the cigarette smell for an hour or‚Ä¶",20
"Beautiful and large swimming pool, up-to-date gym and spacious rooms. Great hospitality, friendly staff and awesome atmosphere. The breakfast and lunch buffet had a great variety and food was also good. Again the kitchen staff was very helpful and went out of the way to provide us with vegetarian food. Great place to stay with kids. We went there during ""Dreamworks Festival"" and there were many opportunities for the kids to get their pictures clicked with their characters. Although it is just opposite the venetian, its connectivity with other resorts is not very good and you might have to take shuttles from venetian or sands.",50
"My wife and I wanted to celebrate our 5th wedding anniversary at a special place together with our 15 months old son. We had enjoyed staying at Sheraton Cotai in Macau before and booked a Club Room which included happy hour, dinner and breakfast. So we could spend our time to just relaxing in the Club Lounge and pool without worrying about where to eat or drink. I have made some contacts from the Guest Relations in prior stays so I mentioned to the Guest Relations Supervisor - Sheraton Club that this stay is to celebrate our special wedding anniversary. We we arrived, we were pleasantly surprised that we have been upgraded from the Club Room that we booked to a family suite. The family room had very nice ""Shrek"" themed decor and childen's bunk bed. It also had a Wii game console‚Ä¶",50
"I've been stay at Sheraton Cotai Central twice and both very good experience.  The first time my roommate left her mobile phone in the room before check out and we just realized it when we already crossed the border and backed in Zhuhai. We called back the hotel and been informed the phone has been founded and will be well kept for us to pick up. After a month when I visit Macau again I went to pick it up, the whole process is well handled and all staff involved are very helpful.  And 2nd time in Oct, the SPG service desk staff handled my early check in request very well with delightful arrangement, really had good time there.",50
"Ive been to Macau 3 times already and Sheraton is always my hotel of choice. Though my routine would be room-meeting-room-meeting-airport for the previous stay, I can still feel the consistency of the hotel service. However, my last visit is kinda different. A bit longer and only short meeting. There's only one thing Ive been craving to do ever since, SWIMMING! So I headed straight to the pool when I got up the next day. RELAXATION. At its best! Sunny morning, spacious pools, quiet surrounding and a sandwich served by Rosalie, AWESOME!!!",50
"Spent two nights here whilst staying with our son in HK, our club rooms were amazing, his had a media room!, the bed linen was excellent, the bathroom amazing, we would definitely stay there again, with club room benefits too!",50
"We booked a room on non-smoking floor but the room is still filled with sickening smell of smoke. It really ruined my stay in the hotel. I couldn't get a room change and the only offer I'd got was air-freshener, which basically means further air contamination. I have been to many Macau hotels but this is the first time I encountered such a problem.  I'd seriously choose another hotel next time, honestly, the last thing I want for a vacation is bad air in my room where I plan to sleep and relax in.",20
"My girlfriend and I visited in September 2014 to celebrate her birthday and were both thoroughly impressed by the hotel and its staff. Check in was fast and efficient and we were shown to our room and given details of the hotel amenities by a member of the Sheraton's excellent Guest Relations team. The room itself was spacious and comfortable and the cleanliness, facilities and quality of furnishings were all excellent. The room had very good views over the hotel's excellent pool areas which were large, luxurious and importantly for Macau, not very crowded, offering what was essentially a private pool area.   The hotel itself is huge and has two large separate towers that are a distinctive landmark on the Cotai Strip skyline. All of the public areas of the hotel are immaculate‚Ä¶",50
"Very big hotel well run with well trained and excellent staff. As you would expect the room was clean, very comfortable, everything was working and in order. The bed linen and towels were good quality.  Good breakfast.",50
"Awesome stay at the hotel, all the staff are friendly, especially Luigi of Bene Restaurant.   Unfortunately had very bad and rude experience with the staff of most of  the shopping complex at the sands, cotai. Also the taxi drivers and also the people of PRC, so dirty and like to spit everywhere, even in lift.  And you will get scolded for asking a direction from the locals!  Honestly, I do not recommend Macao a good place for vacation. ",10
"A very large hotel with 5000+ rooms situated on the strip. Free hotel bus will take you pretty much anywhere to attractions, airport or ferry terminal. Excellent for designer shops, helpful staff but resembles a railway station as it's constantly busy. Food and drink is expensive, but a trip out and you will find some great restaurants at a fraction of a price. No  convenient stores on site of your missing drinks, snacks ECT, the closest Taipa old village, a 25 minute walk away. Taxis very cheap. Personally I'm not a gambler and would of preferred to stay off the strip, too much hustle and bustle for me, families I would recommend staying in Macau away from the strip close to outer ferry terminal where you can take a day trip to Hong Kong, close to Grand Prix museum, tower ect.‚Ä¶",50
I stayed there for 4 days. Very good hotel with nice rooms and very courteous hotel staff. I was there for a office conference. We were 600 people and Sheraton arranged beautifully. the property is very good. I liked the pool side. Very good experience.,50
"They say Macau is Las Vegas on Steroids and this hotel was no exception.  It is massive in itself and then joined to two further hotels (Holiday Inn and Conrad) in a massive block.  Facilities are largely shared between the hotels with a good selection of places to eat, although they vary widely in price!  Quality was very good. Room was clean, well appointed and quiet.   I was there for a conference (facilities were excellent), but also stuff for kids/families mainly focused around DreamWorks films.  You could have ShrekFast (breakfast with Shrek) or go for dragon training lessons and there is a Disney type parade daily in the (exclusive) shopping mall (which is also part of the hotel).  The hotel is on newly reclaimed land and is in an area dominated by hotel/casino complexes,‚Ä¶",40
"I was there about a week ago. Room was great & clean. The bed is so comfortable. Location is great. Service staffs are very polite, friendly & helpful from entrance > reception > housekeeping > restaurant > pool. We booked a table for 9 pax in the Feast restaurant. Ambiance was nice. The waiter that served us is polite & humble. Thumbs up.   But there are few negative things I need to bring up to your attentions: 1. At 2000hrs, restaurant is running out of teaspoon(obviously not the waiter's fault). We ended up using chopstick to stir our coffee & tea. 2. I have no words to describe the satay. It just don't taste like satay. 3. Lastly, near the dessert counter area. There are 2 chefs and a gentleman in jacket(I am sure he is the staff there as I can see there is a Sheraton pin‚Ä¶",30
Was here end sept 2014 n Oct 20-22nd.  Hotel is still looking new and comfortable.  Accommodation: Very comfy beds and quiet. Good for a good nights sleep. Amenities are sufficient and room is soothingly decorated.  Check-in: I checked in at the club lounge 4th level and was hassle free. No queues and was tended to while I was seated at a sofa for the check in procedures to be done.  Security: There are security guards at the lift landing 1st level and it helps that they do spot checks to ensure only guests of the hotel enter the lifts to the rooms.  Club house breakfast: Selection of servings was wide enough. You can't usually eat all the selections. Service here is good.  Bene restaurant: Was tended to by Mr Luigi in sept 14 and his immense knowledge of wine is impressive. I‚Ä¶,50

There was another counter to take care Preferred Starwood Member. If you do have the member should go straight to this counter. The staff that serve me did even show me a map with only the ground floor of this hotel and where to have my breakfast. The hotel was huge. There was two different block. I am staying in earth block. Even earth block, there was different escalator stop at different floor. There was two entry to the escalator and of course the staff would ask your level before let you when into.

End to end.   Check in: The standards of check-in staff were consistently patience and attentive on our return trip. The abilty to understand conversational english were primarily dependent on the middle supervisors and managerial level. Expect some delays during check-in if you are in the rush to get in and move on with your itineraries.   We were offered an upgrade to executive suite.

We even had a note from our housekeeper which was handwritten. So amazed.   We were very worried that we couldn't check out on time due to the queue.

"In my opinion, it is by far the best hotel (value for money) in Macau, not just in Cotai. The rooms are huge, the beds are massive! The hotel staff are excellent and the amenities are top notch, but for me the biggest attraction are the multiple pools the hotel has! You can choose pools on both sides of the hotel, there are mini-pools which you could have all to yourself, jacuzzis and even a waterfall. The only drawback is the VERY poor casino staff service, however that is across the entire Macau, not just in the Sheraton. As far as the hotel staff are concerned, excellent; casino staff - shocking. The breakfast buffets are huge too!",50
"Though I didn't stay here during my trip, I brought my god-sons for the Dreamworks parade as well as the How To Train Your Dragon workshop.   We all loved the Dreamworks Parade! The mascots and staff had high energy and made the whole parade extremely lively. Crowd control was excellent and there was a good variety of Dreamworks characters to entertain the guests. We even got hugged by Shrek! The mascots do a lovely job pausing for quick photos, shaking guests hands and giving quick hugs whenever possible.  As for the How To Train Your Dragon workshop, it was worth every MOP150 (per child)! It was really well organized and we could tell the staff really liked kids. There were more than enough different types of activities to entertain the children and it the biggest highlight‚Ä¶",50
"Simply amazing, every thing in this hotel will add a great value to your trip, the front desk is friendly and helpful, the rooms are spacious, the breakfast is good.   for sure the location is excellent for those who wants to spend time in the casinos.",50
"Free shuttle to n from pier to Sheraton hotel. Beautiful n big hotel with shopping mall within. Just opposite Venetian Shoppe - a very very big shopping.mall with All the big brands, more than 500 shops. Hotel facilities live up to its 5 star status. Room was spacious n big bathroom. If u like shopping for branded goods or gamble, the Cotai area hotels r excellent choice. Can‚Äôt even find any convenient store here.  There is free shuttle bus from the old Macau city to the City of Dream which is just 5 min walk from hotel.  The old Macau is where the local people n activities are. We paid hkd 70 for taxifare from Cotai to d old Macau Ruin.",50
"This is the second time I stayed here within 1 month. The hotel is great by itself with everything you need. The shopping mall is great, huge but now as crowed as Venetian.   I stayed in the deluxe suite, this is worth for money because the room is huge with a  separate dinning and living area 2 toilets, as well as a facility room, with hi-fi system and a double sofa bed. There is also another sofa bed in the sitting room, it's good if you travel with kids and maid. With club benefits, free wifi, breakfast, snacks, all day free drinks, evening beverage, etc.  The only thing that disappoints me is the attitude of an individual staff called Mavis Ma. My hubby was stopped to have breakfast at the club lounge and asked him to pay extra. Since only my maid took my baby girl there‚Ä¶",50

"Brand new resorts concentrate in Taipa area, and SheratonCotai simply locates in central of it. Quite convenient to VenetianMacao and City of Dreams. Also only 10 mins shuttle from airport. The quality and service of hotel meets Sheraton standard, yet the price is reasonable. Staff await near elevator for quick check-out indeed saves my time. Recently the wifi in room becoming free is also appreciated. I'm sure I will book it again : )",50
"We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights and we very pleased with room quality, modern design and all the amenities that came with it. Its a great location with a shopping mall and of course a casino right in the same building. Its also a good 5-10 min walking distance to the Venetian Hotel and Casino and larger shopping area. They offer several shuttle service option to several border points and other hotels of their group making it very convenient.  Since we were there during peak season we had to wait a bit in queue for breakfast, however the selection offered exceeded expectation, though I have to say my expectation was not that high, having had the experience of breakfast at the Venetian. All in all I would stay there again given the better price value compared to the Venetian.",50
"From the first step on the ground of Macau, my vacation begins with a warm and thoughtful guest ambassador in pick up service. Since one of my family members cannot walk fast with wheelchair, I need somebody to help me in carry luggage and taking care of us in transport. As what I did previously, I ordered a limo. All the ways the ambassador brought me from the ferry terminal to the room, even replied my questions with letter in short time. She even did not accept any tips from me! The most impressive is, she gave me a name card and I can call for assistance when I need. This is the first time to receive a name card from ambassador and from Sheraton Macau. I stayed in this hotel many times and experiencing its improving. Therefore I decided to comment her good services and‚Ä¶",50

"Hotel is in center of Cotai before Venetian and hotel is join with another hotel by very big shopping centre and you can visit Venetian with walking tunnel over road. Hotel has nice swimming pools, but jacuzzi was very cold during my visit. My room was in perfect condition (clean, new, luxury) with nice view. Hotel is quiet and very anonymous. Little problem is, that¬¥s very simple to lost in this hotel because it¬¥s extremely big. Sheraton was 1st hotel where room was 100% same like on photos from booking.  I was sir for staff :D it was something unique for me.",50
"I have a pleasant stay at Sheraton Hotel, Macau last weekend.  the staff are friendly and helpful. The room is spacious and comfortable.  I went to Shine SPA and it was great experience.  The therapist is well experience about the procedure of the massage.  I feel relax when im staying at this hotel.",50
"We booked for 2 nights in sheraton and i must say its a fantastic property,great location and very huge hotel....everything was smooth right from checkin to checkout,room service was great and fast and rooms were pretty big too...big shopping mall inside the hotel and u can just check the big food court they have to offer(u get indian food too) there...overall very happy and would def come back again.",40
Great hotel right in the middle of the Cotai strip. Walking distance to the major casinos. Great shopping and two pools one for families with kids and the other just for adults. A great place to have fun and or relax,50
"I recently booked 3 rooms for 2 nights at the Sheraton Macao to celebrate my parents 50th wedding anniversary.  Ivan Nunes, who checked us in, asked if we had stayed previously at the Macao Sheraton, which we had, and what brought us back.   My wife mentioned the anniversary celebration and thought nothing of it after.  My parents were pleasantly surprised and touched by congratulatory card, chocolates and rose petals left on their bed that evening.  It was a very kind and thoughtful gesture which they really appreciated and requested that I provide this feedback to Ivan and the Sheraton Macao on their behalf.    We have thoroughly enjoyed our stays at the Sheraton Macao and look forward to visiting again.",50
"We stayed in the hotel for New Year. It is a great hotel, the location and the service are awesome. It is only walking distance to the Venetian Macao Resort Hotel and the other attractions. The room is not very modern, and it's not very large comparing to the other Shereton hotels, but it's fine because most of the hotels in Macau are not really large. All the facilities are good to go. I would recommend the hotel.",50

I was slightly disturbed but belive me Sheraton is equally good hotel at much cheaper rate.NO doubt in Macau only thing to enjoy is The Venetion  hotel.But dont warry if you stay in cheaper & good Sheraton Hotel because there is a bridge between sheraton & venetion hotel & it takes  only 3 min. to reach venetion from the Sheraton hotel.MOST IMP. thing is that you can enjoy all the facility of venetion hotel even you are staying in Sheraton.You can enjoy Casino of venetion easily  it takes hardly 3 min to reach to casino from your sheraton room.But belive me i found Casino of Sheraton better than the Venetion.Second imp thing that there is no super market in this area so take‚Ä¶,40

If you gonna visit Macau, this hotel will be your best choice, enjoy it.",50

Breakfast buffet was great, many choices, with different styles to choose from. Dinner buffet has beautiful fresh and cooked seafood, plus lots more. Great for family holidays, swimming pool and gym are nice and clean. Services are awesome. Highly recommend to families.",50

Special thanks for jocelyn zhu's warmly welcome. meet a friend at a new hotel is so fantastic it is really a very good trip in macao.",50
"The hotel's location was perfect, about 20mins from the airport, walking distance to casinos and malls. Shuttle was available every 10mins that took us to the city center etc. The hotel lobby and our suite smelled so good throughout our entire stay! They cleaned like twice or thrice daily. Room service was fast and affordable. Excellent and very helpful staff, from the Reservations team to the Front Desk officers to the Concierge staff. My husband and I had an amazing and fun stay there! Will definitely go back and book at Sheraton again. =)",50

"We booked a family suite which is actually two rooms connected by a door, second room is children's room with bunk bed, TV with Wii and all children's amentities.  The rooms are simply excellent of couse it does not come cheap but still reasonable for families travel with children.  Love the set up of the mall and connections to hotel which whole Cotai strip is connected internally and can walk over to Four Seasons, Venetian's malls with much to do and to eat.  Very convenient.  Rooms are spacious and clean.  We simply love it.  The only thing is this is a huge hotel so waiting for elevators waiting for taxi is quite long.",50
It takes a while to realize there are 3 hotels embedded in two good size casinos. Maps are hard to decode. Bus from the Turbojet ferry to hotel is a adventure. There are two ferry docks on the way back. Employees at the hotel referred us to three different lobbies to catch the one back. Inbound bus takes you to a Sands complex on another island. You need to figure out that there is another bus (of many) to get in line to go to the Cotai complex where you wander around to find the right lobby.  Service was great and room was alo. Buffet in am is a bummer. Go to a McDonalds.,20
"We went in March to see the Rolling Stones. The hotel was fine, the room was a twin and perfectly big enough. Nothing exciting or amazing, but nothing wrong with it either. There are other I think better hotels nearby, but probably more expensive. The Sheraton is above its own casino and sort of melds into a shopping mall which has some restaurants and a mix of luxury and mid level shops and then turns into another big hotel. Amazingly (to us) there was no proper bar, we were pointed to the empty lobby cafe which has a few bottles of alcohol. So the concierge sent us over to the bar in the casino of the Venetian - connected by a covered bridge from the shopping mall. And he was right, the casino and the bar were much livelier over there and in fact the bar had a really good DJ‚Ä¶",30
"My family just returned from three nights at Sheraton's Macau hotel, and we had a fantastic time.  I'm an expat teacher in Mainland China, and so Macau was an easy ferry ride away, which left us some extra cash to splurge on one of Sheraton's Executive Suites with club access.  We are a family of five, with two preteen kids and one infant, and so we needed a bit of extra space.  Going the club access route was the absolute best choice we made.  The lobby to the Sheraton - which is the largest Sheraton hotel in the world - was jam packed with tourists coming in for the Chinese National Day holiday, and it was nice to be able to bypass all of that madness for the fourth floor club.  The checkin by Mandy was smooth and painless, and actually rather nice.  She was very friendly, and‚Ä¶",40
"Sheraton Macau is a fantastic hotel close to everything in Cotai. Huge hotel so takes a little time to work things out. We booked the Club room which gave us access to the Club Lounge which is a excellent way to go. Breakfasts there were very good, and excellent choice of dishes. At night, pre-dinner drinks and snacks were very good. We were lucky enough to have the fantastic Gigi looking after us. She was fantastic.\, but all the staff are welcoming and eager to look after you. A very good hotel, and would recommend to anyone. Shuttle to the Cotai ferry is at the front door.",50
"We just spent the 'National Day' holiday in Sheraton Macao, it's the most busiest timing there, as it's the golden week holiday for Mainland.  Was told that the hotel was 100% full, however, with the SPG privilege, we're able to get the room before 2pm and each time we love to spend the time at their Lounge, for drinks/snacks. For me, I specially love the breakfast there.  Amazingly you'll find the 'pancake' maker, which makes pancakes automatically, after you pressed a button, pancake will be sliding out in a minute.  :P  About the room, the room size is big, though not as big as Venetian Macau, it's still big for 2-3 persons :)  Service is always good - as Sheraton standard.  Hotel is connected with shopping center as well as a bridge connecting to Venetian Macao (2/F). ‚Ä¶",50

With the help of their quality staff, I and my family had a wonderful stay. Although I visit there in the peak season, the service provide is still punctual, accurate and willingly, as you will always see they were smiling at you. Check-in & check-out process is quick, room is clean & spacious. Staffs are nice, friendly & helpful.  If you stay more than 1 night, I would like to recommend you to choose their new program that is no need to have housekeeping everyday so as to be more environmental in order to save the world. But in case you want to refill the amenities, they will react very quickly after our‚Ä¶",50
"Horrible service and horrible experience. Place is like a railway station Pool area has no food, no fruit juices, no cocktails and doesnt even serve Pizza. I guess if you are the kind that looks for dimsum by the poolside, u wont be disappointed. Very few english speaking staff and so in-room dining is an experience in itself. Lifts are very overcrowded and offers a monday morning experience in a crowded office lift lobby. Will NEVER stay at a Sheraton again.",10
"Firstly I would like to stress that the quality of accommodation and facilities in this hotel is 5 star - it cannot be faulted and I was impressed.  What really put me off were perhaps expectations I have become accustomed to in the West - hence I wanted to caveat this before my review.  Whilst we chose non-smoking area of the hotel, it was quite clear that this was not observed by guests, nor was it enforced by hotel staff.  During our stay, we often saw people smoking, without discretion, throughout the 'non smoking' section of the hotel.........in addition our non-smoking room smelled of smoke and we actually saw guests in the neighboring room smoking away whilst their door was ajar. Indoor smoking is generally in the norm in Asia and something I am not used to with my family‚Ä¶",20

The lobby with different options for casino fun, the transport is so easy to get... Anyway is a great hotel",50
"The hotel is quite family friendly, with many activities for the kids. My kid joined the junior dragon trainer camp which he was quite fond of. The Dreamwork character parade at 3 pm in the mall was also a highlight for the family. There are also many choice of dining outlets in the connected mall though quite expensive. Its location is not bad, with many shuttles to different places, the Ventian and Foura Season are connected by an air-conditioned flyerover. The room is also spacious and the bed very comfortable. The service is good too, though the hotel is quite crowded at the lobby especially during check-in or check-out time.",50

A typical casino hotel connected with a mall, many average dining outlet, connected to a Holiday Inn.  within 10 mins walk to City of Dream.  Like other Macao Casino hotel,  Complimentary shuttle bus line to Ferry/Airport/Galaxy/Border.  A pity, there should be a line to Macao oldtown (city)/  Service:  The service at the 4th Floor Club lounge was excellent, yet the arrangement at the SPG  dedicated counters on Main Lobby was chaotic.   We booked the Club room, yet the Sheraton Club lounge is a bit of walk from the lift foyer of Sky Tower on 4th floor.  We hated the walk, so we checked out on lobby floor SPG area .

It started with a room upgrade, I booked a twin and the upgraded me to a family suite and my daughter (who IMA still sleeps in our room at home) was too excited to use the bunk bed! Her own personal TV with a Wii made it even more exciting for her.. And then I had booked two nights and somehow we just decided to spend another one, and too our surprise the hotel staff actually compare cheapest rates for my previously booked room online, suggested me the best option and then booked it for me and upgraded me to the same room!

The entire hotel is very tropical rain forest look with small waterfalls.   It is highly quiet in the floor. It is decorated with warm colors to make the guests feel warm and passionate.

From the time of check in, to the nicely appointed rooms , house keeping, guests service all interaction with the hotel and staff was great and above expectations .  We are now SPG and will be back for sure !",50
"Finally we are home!Our Asian tour is over. We spent the last moment of our journey at Macau. My parents decided to stay at Sheraton hotel. So far everything went smooth. Checking in  is a breeze. No crazy long line and front desk personnel are accommodating unlike in Singapore. It was sunny when we got there so me and my mom decided to plunge to one of their pool on the afternoon. The pool was great but one thing I noticed, not enough staff around. Good thing somebody approach us and offer some drinks. We badly needed it anyway so we ordered.. Thanks to Rosalie for being prompt to our needs. She even enrolled my mom to SPG since I'm already a member. It was sunny afternoon and we are so relaxed thinking we are about to go home.

Despite the check-in line was long, it didn't take us too long to be served by one of the front office agent. The check-in process was very smooth and accurate with all our requests being accommodated. The front office staff even asked our preference on our room location, making sure we wouldn't mind walking a bit more down the hallway in order to have a quieter room.

You can register for free beforehand so that you are an SPG member. We got a late check-out at 4pm for our room but no upgrades as SPG Gold as they said the rooms were very full. We did get put on a high floor with views. Wifi is free and excellent throughout the premises.   Hotel shuttles are free and convenient, this Sheraton is part of the ""Sands Cotai Central""  so they are connected together with Conrad and Holiday Inn. The shuttle from the Taipa ferry is directly across the street from the exit of the terminal marked Sands Cotai Central, no need to line up at the Venetian shuttles.",50
"This hotel provides all the convenience you would need to enjoy your stay in Macau. The location is very strategic making it hassle free to go to other hotels and landmarks. I did enjoy the walk going to Venetian without even crossing the street outside. Our room was huge and our bed was so comfy. Staff are all helpful and will always be willing to attend your needs. There are luxurious restaurants inside but if you prefer for a cheaper meals, you can go to the foodcourt in the 3rd floor. Mcdonald is also available in the groundfloor,  I would give an excellent over all rating to this hotel.",50

I strongly recommend this hotel particularly if you are having a vacation with your family and kids! All the best!",50

The lobby was packed with people. I was surprised to find very few chairs in the lobby considering how massive the hotel is (it has few towers I believe). Then it was time for dinner. We were waiting by the hall  for our other relatives to come down. My aunt who is an elderly can't stand for too long. So she decided to sit on the luggage trolley. Then she was asked to get up by the bell boy and he didn't offer any chair for her to sit down. Instead he continued chatting with his colleagues. My suggestion: add few more chairs here and there.

Our experience was that it was about a minutes walk away from reception. Not a long distance.   ""There are long delays in respect to lifts arriving"" Our experience was that this  was not the case.

Great breakfast, afternoon tea and diner and unlimited drinks once the sunsets for a few hours. All the staff were friendly and hospitable. With one member of staff really standing out - Jayson (who was fantastic). We had a great view of the Venetian from our room. And I'm sure all sides would have a great aspect.",40

Once there, you will not be disappointed because the front desk staff is efficient and friendly.  In a matter of minutes, you're on your way to a gigantic room.  I don't know if that is their standard size but my room was with a view of the Venetian.  I wish I could stay longer than one night. This is Macau so there is casino on the ground floor and several restaurants.  There is also access to the mall on the second floor.  A free shuttle to the ferry terminal bound for Hong Kong. I had a wonderful stay at this hotel.",50

It's modern, quality products and big king sized comfortable bed. Wasn't a big fan of the bathroom - if the shower head was pointed in the wrong direction it flooded the floor.   Although we didn't actually go swimming, we went to the two different pool areas and they were impressive. I would have loved the time to go for a paddle. We have been told the pools are very popular at night and the drinks are cheap relative to other hotels.

The rooms are well kept, and the amenities are top-notch. The hotel has easy indoor access to local hotels as well as other shops. One caveat, be prepared for long lines to use the shuttle service to and from the train station. ",50

Point to Note: Almost all the buses are on the right escalator exit, but for Macao Sheraton, it is on the left escalator exit. Do take note.  The bus will bring you to the rear entrance of Sheraton, not the main lobby. However, you will still be able to do your check in at this rear lobby.

Moreover, the staff either does not understand simple English and sign language, or just does not care. Most of the time, they were indifferent to the point of being rude.

Even if you are not staying in that hotel, you can always take the ride for free. You can almost go anywhere without paying for your public transportation. So, I suggest you print the pickup and destination details of those hotels.  Some cab drivers/staffs don't understand/speak English. You can print a map/itinerary with Chinese translation and show to them. Pictures also can help sometimes.  Hope this helps.",50

The hotel (Earth building) features 'red' and 'green' rooms; so up to you to mention upon check in what color suits you best. Siska took very good care of us at the SPG check out area. In between we very much enjoyed the pool and its friendly staff and the Italian restaurant Bene with excellent slow cooked dishes and quality wine served by knowledgeable and friendly staff. Ladies, take a scarf though, as the airco is very performant. Well organised transfer from and to the boat terminals to Hong Kong. A wonderful two day Mid-Autumn break!",50
"great value for money with nice sized gym and rooms compared to neighboring hotels (Conrad, Venetian)  Connected to other hotels, take shuttle bus if coming from ferry  Good food, connected to shopping and family friendly (if you dont mind the big casino halls on lobby level)",50
"I really had great experience there. Of course all facilities were great and I sincerely thanks to all staff helped a lot me to make wonderful memory. They took care of my personal events and also provided celebrations for my birthday as well.   Also I recommend to use club lounge which provide really nice food and snack. Happy hour meal is good enough so that I didn't feel to go outside restaurant.  Lastly, thanks Samuel!",50
"This is a Sheraton property. Just clean and nice hotel, with very comfortable rooms. Staff is good, but since they get wholesale guests from mainland China they are loosing the personal touch and they answer your queries like an answering machine. Overall it was a good experience.",50
"Having just stayed here on a family trip we would definetley recommend this hotel. Check in was fairly simple, the staff were pleasant and informative. The hotel room was nice with an excellent bathroom. As expected robes, slippers, tea, coffee, safe, iron etc were in the room.   The hotel is located above a big shopping mall which adjoins 2 other hotels, each with their own casinos. The hotel has 2 pool areas with a few small pools and jacuzzis. The hotel is walking distance to the Venetian, city of dreams, hard rock etc and there are free shuttle buses that take you all over macau and to other casinos free of charge. Also there is drop off and pick up for the ferry port.   We have booked to go again and are staying here as we had such a good time. The only thing I would‚Ä¶",50
"excellent hotel. good service, the front desk lady welcome us with smile, greetings for our honeymoon and gave us free Internet. room was amazing (the deluxe room - you can see our photo). good free shatel service from the Ferry and from the hotel to other few destination in the Island.  things to improve - not much of nightlife. not even late night restaurants.  beside that - it was one of the best in our long trip honeymoon.",50
"I stayed there for our 7th anniversary with my love for 2 nights. Thanks hotel gave free chocolate and had a little decoration on the bed.  But I have a little bit disappointed. 1.When we arrive the check in counter, a junior staff is with smile, but the senior staff is no smile and seems impolite (who stand behind the junior and helping the junior for our check in ).  2.When we first come inside the room, few dirty and used pens are on the floor.  3.There is no comb in the toilet. I have to take it from 4/F changing room.  4.When I want to leave some opinion on the hotel opinion card , I found that that card is used and there is guest's information like telephone no.

"We went for a weekend in May,really enjoyed ! The hotel is well designed and the swimming pools are amazing! Kid's club got our five year old boy busy plus a movie night! The dreamwork parade is another hotspot.Specially recommend the bbq at the pool side, good seafood and steak cooked by chef upon order, very nice for couple to enjoy a meal and kids can still play around. There are two more hotels connected to the Sheraton that loads of shops and restaurants choices if you don't like the swimming pools as much as we do. In general, it was very pleasant stay !",50
"The hotel is connected with other hotels and shopping malls.  It's better to be a Starwood SPG member for expediting check-in. It's walking distant to ""the House of Dancing Water"", which is located at the City of Dream.  Hotel shuttle travels frequently from hotel to pier.  Morning buffet offers great variety of food.  There are a few outdoor swimming pools for family members to enjoy, and there are heated pools as well.  Gym is well equipped.   The double twin room has a spacious bathroom.  The beddings are clean with nice quality. The only draw back that internet is not free.    It's better to stay at a brand name hotel for paying a bit more for the quality.",40
"I'm in Macau right now on a business trip. I been staying at Sheraton for two weeks and service here is very welcoming. The service at Club(S.P.G) is very personalized. The staffs truly looks into my needs every time  I'm  there. This particular staff Jimmy Qin has been very help full to me and my friends. Every time we request for any information on how,where and why.. this particular staff has been very help full providing us with the prompt information. He truly made our current stay very comfortable and pleasant.  The room is very comfortable after a long day out on business. Its well cleaned and set up well by the staff especially( Rafael). As i say again the service in this place is very personalized weather its your room ,the dining or the shopping.  Great service and‚Ä¶",50
"Reception area was crowded and slightly overwhelming but if you were a Starwood member, there is a separate reception area which was less chaotic. Having been here before, I am pleased to say the standard of service remains consistently good. Receptionist recognised returning guests and that is always a plus.The bathroom of the room I was given had not been cleaned and I requested a new room. This was done promptly with a member of the senior staff in attendance. I was immediately put in a room with a view of the Cotai strip  and that made for a great weeks stay.  The linen in this hotel is second to none, the duvet heavenly and soft and the pillows just made for a perfect stay. The new room was spotless and elegant. Did not want for anything while staying here. The gym is‚Ä¶",40
Awesome service. Bensum Lo did a great job while i checked in. Huge room and well equipped bathroom. Plenty of luxury shops nearby. Nice breakfast buffet with plenty of choices. Would definitely visit again.,50
"Booked a junior suite via Starwood SPG website.  Chose this hotel because it was the cheapest upscale international hotel in the Cotai area. By the number of guests rooms, it is also the biggest Sheraton brand hotel in China, perhaps in Asia.    In-room decor is acceptable considering the cheap tariff.  Pictures attached.      The service at Sheraton Macau is exceedingly impersonal, if not degrading.  It is the worst of all Sheraton or SPG group of hotels I have stayed in China.    1) No bell boy at lobby to assist with luggage into and checking out of the hotel.    2) First time I have been told at an upscale hotel that towels has to be exchanged instead of extra towels being provided.  This is insulting for myself who neither steal nor have the need to steal.  If Sheraton is‚Ä¶",20
"We arrived at the hotel by free shuttle service at the airport.  It is a large hotel and casino, the lobby was crowded but fast checked in and the great service by front desk Ms.Aida and bell boy made us feel good. This was my first time had suite room upgraded, room was extraordinary spacious and elegant: living room/dining room/kitchen/two bathroom and suited for 5 of us. I just didn't want to leave the room.   Thanks so much, we love it and we will be back.",50
Was there in the 1st week of September. Got an early check in In the lobby you could hear the noise of the slot machines in the casino although I had paid in advance for the two rooms for two nights I was asked to deposit 2000 dollars as a refundable deposit which i got back The room was Huge approx 60sq mts with two large queen size beds and a well stocked mini fridge with free wifi the rooms was overlooking the water . next day the room service was really good the place is value for money,50
"My friend from Vancouver came back to HK and wanted to pay a visit to Macau, l did some research and base on the location/ room rate/ reviews, we have chosen Sheraton.  We are overwhelmed by the first class services offered.  A special thx to Miss Amy Wu, we met her at the front desk, she is polite, friendly, with a smiley face all the time.  And she was kind enough to upgraded us from a double room to a suite at the sky tower.    A really pleasant stay and will back for sure.",50
"Stayed one night at Sheraton Macao due to the hotel next door was fully booked.  Since this hotel has over 3,000 rooms/suites, we had to be in a long queue upon check-in in hotel lobby.  Maybe we booked through online booking agent or we were the first timer of this hotel, we couldn't see or feel a warm welcome at all.  With 2 separate towers, i.e. Sky Tower & Earth Tower in Sands Cotai Central Complex, the Front Desk Officer didn't remind us which way we should approach while they gave us the room keys, and we just realized we went to the wrong tower until the advice by security officer at lift lobby.  The room is just enough for 2 persons, and no space for an extra bed.  Don't expect any turndown service in the evening.  Though the hotel states that they provide free WIFI‚Ä¶",30

Thank you and your lovely staff for the incredible service to my stay. Thank you for being accommodating, friendly and professional for providing some of the highest standards I have experience. Many thanks again for the great stay! We had a very nice holiday at your good hotel and for sure the ""double"" upgrade more than made up for the waiting period upon our arrival. We'll for sure come back and enjoy your hotel again. I truly enjoy my stay and I would like to recognize the exceptional services provided by Amy Wu at the desk reception. Amy from front Desk offered passionate and sincere service with excellent attitude! Top Class!",50
"There is nothing wrong with this hotel, but there is also nothing exceptional about it either. The staff was friendly - after we resolved the disaster at check in. The room was a nice size - I had 2 doubles. And the bathroom was  a very nice size wtih a good shower. The location is not really in Macau proper - it is in the new part of town in Cotai, which is fine - just takes longer to get to when coming in from the Ferry. All in all, I had a fine stay...there is just nothing that really stands out about it and if you are in Macau, you want to be wowed!!",30

Another surprise was quick check out.  Very efficient staff  in reception, concierge and bell service. Friendly lady at concierge printed taxi card in Chinese for me as taxi drivers in Macao do not speak English ! Lots of western Managers on the floor and everywhere people to assist you and answer all questions. I had a really nice suite in Sky Tower with access to Club Lounge.

It was great as always.  Check in experience: While I'm checking in, they ushered my family over to the Club Lounge for some refreshments. My kids loved the snacks. When we entered our room, they had balloons all over the room! What a surprise! My 2 kids were ecstatic!  Room: Being one of the newest hotels in Macau, the room is just splendid. Good technology, good bed, good size. The room was very clean. One of the few hotels where I wouldn't be scared to let my kids crawl all over the carpet.  Facilitiies: We used the pools and the gym.

"Travelled from HK for weekend in Macau and stayed at the Sheraton on the Cotai strip. We were in a family suite which was spacious and suited our family. The focus of our weekend was to relax by the pool and around the hotel.   Unfortunately we found staff customer service to be quite inconsistent and raised concerns with a very professional Duty Manager in Reception during our stay. However, this is a higher end hotel and some of the following inconsistencies are not satisfactory.  Our experiences with inconsistencies in customer service started with the 'guest relations' staff on the phone once we had checked in and were in our room. There seemed to be a language barrier when the call was made to 'guest relations'  and our problem was not understood. It took several phone‚Ä¶",30

"Spent a two day break at this hotel.   The size of the place is just astounding with never ending corridors of rooms.  Considering the scale of the operation, we were very happy with the service.  The room was modern and clean with a separate shower and bath tub.  It shares a shopping mall and restaurants with the Conrad so there is a lot of choice for food at both the expensive and cheap end.  The pool area was lovely.  They seem to cater well for children, though the gambling areas though screened off are very obvious, so one to be avoided for anyone who doesn't like to gamble.",50
Great hotel. Fantastic facilities with great pools. All conveniently located . It's the largest Sheraton in the world. Only there for one night but overall a great experience. There are free shuttles to all the other casinos. Well worth the money,50

We found that the breakfast voucher include 2pax buffet in Xin and the other 2pax in Feast. I was wonder as the breakfast place was different under the same booking.

"Scanning the reviews of this hotel, you will expect luxury and a quality of furnishings and service that are common of the Sheraton and Westin chain of facilities. Our experience of Macau Cotai is no exception to these opinions but with the major exception that we considered even these attributes to be unacceptably expensive. The fact that this also applies to the surrounding hotels, is no excuse. Macau Cotai is in our opinion overpriced for what it offers. Certainly this is an exaggerated offering of all types and the thrill of the gambling casinos within this complex of huge hotels with all they have to offer is startling, dazzling and entertaining. If that is what you want to pay so much for, then you have hit the bulls-eye. If you are more discerning and less demanding, then‚Ä¶",30

The staff is extremely friendly and competent. The breakfast offers a large variety of European and Chinese breakfast dishes. The cleanliness of the rooms and the premises is very good. We recommend to book club access. It is really worth the money as it offers many benefits and a really excellent light supper in the evenig. We enjoyed the Saturday evening barbecue very much.  We particularly thank Nick Lam and Tarran Goodwill for doing a great job in the Sheraton club and the fitness and pool area.",50
"I chose this hotel for a quick weekend getaway with my wife for 1 night. It didn't disappoint. Right after I booked online via the hotel website and inquired about spa reservations, I got email reply confirming the spa and room and even restaurant recommendations. It's always nice to have some human interaction, as opposed to only computer generated responses.   Upon the very efficient check-in we found out the room was upgraded to a 1 bedroom suite, which was very nice. We order room service breakfast which was delivered within minutes. My wife says the spa treatment was good, while I enjoyed the gym. The Italian restaurant was wonderful and we savoured the meter-long pizza for lunch.

"Stayed at the Sheraton Macao for a quick two nights and was absolutely blown away.  Coming from the US this is definitely the nicest Sheraton I've ever seen and quite possibly the nicest Sheraton in the entire property portfolio.  Except for the Sheraton branded toiletries it really did remind me more of middle tier St. Regis or Luxury Collection property.  Location is right in the heart of the Cotai strip, Macao's entertainment and shopping district.  In a way it was like a mini Las vegas with the Venian right across the street, tons of shopping and gaming, and everything attached with skybridges and people movers.    While the hotel facilities themselves were already nice, what made the stay special was the extraordinary level to which each staff member went out of their way‚Ä¶",50
Sheraton Macau is strategically located and they have access to a shopping mall and a food court. The rooms are clean and the sheets smell fresh. Service is very good and the staff are very helpful and accomodating. Value for money guaranteed!,50

"My family and I had enjoyed the stay at the Sheraton.  Staff greeted us professionally and gave us extra DreamWorks gift for our accompanying kids that wasn't staying with us. Concierge staff Lambda was great on fixing us with a taxi as we were already late for dinner and extremely difficult to catch taxi in Macau The only downside, the hotel was too crowded on the lobby level and felt like we were at a 3 stars hotel. The family suite was great and the kids loved it! Pool was small but good enough for little kids learning to swim Will come back!",40
Had a room with two king size beds with a view looking across at Venetian Hotel and down on swimming pools. Our baby grandson was with us and a cot was provided for him for no additional charge. Bathroom was well appointed and very clean. Hotel is above shops and casino.   Is in the middle of Cotai Strip so you can walk to other hotels and casinos and restaurants etc.,50
There is reason why this hotel is Cheaper than other 5 stars hotel in Macau. Chose this hotel just because of the breakfast for my kids. And you can walk to the'Water show' hotel in 5 mins. Room is big but decoration is cheap. Expect to see lots of guest from China. One good point of this hotel is the Italian restaurant there is great. But for dining there you dont need to stay in the hotel.,30
I went there along with my friends. We stayed over there for 2 night 3 days. I got few options for staying in Macao. I choose this over others. Staff of this hotel is very friendly. They explain you each and every things before you checkin into hotel. They offer us upgrade at nominal charges. That was really value for money. Huge room and all the facility were there. It's a such a huge hotel that you will lost. So you have to check and remember your room and follow the sign. :) For Indian they have good choice of food. Specially in room dining which me and my friend try at 2. am. I must say in Macao it's best choice.,50
"We made an excellent decision by choosing to stay in this property which is supposed to be the largest Sheraton in the world. While I was a little skeptical because of the many online reviews about long lines, late check-in's etc, we did not encounter any such thing in spite of reaching the hotel at about 3 pm (which is the check-in time). Our stay was great and the highlights were as follows:  1. We took a Cotai View room, and it was huuuge in spite of NOT being a suite! The view was great and totally worth paying the extra price for the view. 2. The breakfast buffet was very lavish. 3. Since we visited the Venetian anyway (which was a walking distance away and connected by a bridge), it gave us the chance to explore another huge mall of which the hotel was a part. The mall‚Ä¶",50

I find this truly ridiculous and in fact having stayed in hotels all over the world  this is the first time ever such happened to me.

However this monstrous hotel, which has apparently over 3,000 rooms, was a real let down. Room quality was poor although the room was huge. The fittings and bathrooms were luxurious in about 1990 but dated and poor now, although the bed was comfortable. Worst of all, every available square inch of the common areas is given over to gambling. There is no nice bar or decent coffee shop, apart from a hopelessly inadequate one on the ground floor which is constantly full of families apparently waiting for the gambler to come out of the casino, for hours at a time.

The deluxe room is smaller than the TA photos would lead one to believe and lacking in character (see photos posted separately).

The highlight of my stay was the queue outside and opposite the lobby for the taxis.  It took 45 minutes to get one.  The taxi situation in Macau is a major headache.  There are far too many visitors for the infrastructure to support.  This isn't a Sheraton.  It's way too much below par to deserve the name.",20

The evening meal was also very good and the choice of drinks was good, they have a dedicated bar area within the huge club lounge now and we enjoyed the opportunity to sit outside on several occasions.

"After a night of a dinner, show and other fun I went back to my room.  While trying to fall asleep late a night there were many young kids running around the hallway.  I think the parents left them in the room while they were down stairs gambling.  These kids sounded like a heard of elephants and were screaming their heads off.  I called guest services to complain and they said they would take care of it.  They did not do what they said and did not send anyone.  The noise continued for 30 more minutes.  I called again and they told me I could move to another room.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!  Instead of taking care of the issue they wanted the me to move my room at 1 AM in the morning.

Ok back to the hotel, rooms are big, comfortable and clean but of course the long walking distances to the lifts from most drop off points, prolonged waiting time for the lifts and perhaps another bit of walking to your room. Bath room is grand with a lot of space, and with a great family pool to match.

Check in was a hassle then the long walk to the elevators through a throng of shopping and gambling crowds.  Room was okay, I found service culture completely lacking and scale of the hotel makes everything chaotic.  Looked for somewhere to eat on my own and gave up - myriad of faceless buffets.  Eventually went to another hotel and ate there.  Booked a club room so had breakfast the next morning in the club.  Didn't get coffee, none offered and no service.

After we complained and complained, the attendant offered an upgrade of room with a double. We didn't ask for an upgrade, we need a standard twin room!

"If I am not wrong, the Sheraton Macao is the largest Sheraton Hotel (more than 3000 rooms?) in the world; and at the same time, I believe it is also the most crowded one since everywhere in the hotel are full of mainlanders.  The worst is the gambling area is on the ground floor and connect to the reception hall, you just cannot avoid the crowd.  Room is okay with reasonable large size in Macau, but a lot smaller than the Venetian at the opposite.  I find the room is very quite although I was on the first one near the lift lobby where all other guests have to pass by mine, I didnt hear any noise at all and I had very good sleep.

The breakfast here is the best. Nothing comes close to this. Since I'm from India, it was surprising to see Indian dishes as well. I've not seen such varieties at other hotels.  BUT the only downside is the location. its in Cotai and not city center. So if you plan for Cotai strip, its the best bet. Shuttle services are good as well.",40

Sheraton should be ashamed of adding this mocking of a hotel in their portfolio. It is my 2nd disappointment in the Sheraton franchise.   Positive: The shopping mall during the day attached to the hotel is full of shops and with a lot of choices of restaurants and retail stores.

Hotel has direct connections to cross-road hotels like Venetian which keeps you dry on rainy weather.  Rooms are good, amenities are not bad, in-hotel casino is big enough. Check-in procedure took a bit longer than expected, check-out was faster.  Very nice outdoor swimming pool also available for guests.",40

Not only the size of the room is spacious, the toilet is spacious too. The view of the room is good as we can see the swimming pool of the hotel. The bed is big even enough for 2 people sleeping in one bed. What I appreciate the most is the free lunch buffet in the Feast restaurant. There is a lot of food for choosing and the taste is good. We also got $200 cash coupon for each room. We used it to have the continental breakfast in the Palm cafe. It really saved us a lot of money!",50

Room upgrades for me (as an SPG Gold member) are hit / miss, though I recently got upgraded to an Executive Suite presumably because I booked a couple's spa treatment at their Shine Spa -- which is actually quite wonderful.

"Stayed at this property for 3 nights during a business trip. The hotel is to the standard of most Sheraton properties however because of the size of this property it feels very impersonal. This property is the largest Sheraton in the world and it definite feels like it. Because of how many people stay at this property there is a fight in the mornings to get down the elevators. By the end of our stay we realized that if we wanted to go down, we had to go up first in order to get a spot on one of the elevators.   Overall the rooms are spacious, beds comfortable and decorated very nicely. Bathroom is huge with a tub and shower. The pools are well maintained with lots of room so you don't feel crowded.",40

"Macau is a chaotic, exciting place, whether you live nearby or are visiting from afar. I've been visiting for 10 years, and the Sheraton is my favorite hotel already because of the personal touch despite the large scale, the availability of rooms regardless of your gambling preferences, and the location and ease of access to all of the properties in Cotai.  That would be enough for any seasoned traveller or Macau visitor. What happened during my last stay has elevated this property to a new level.  Upon entering my hotel room, having checked in just after 2am after a night on the town, I realized I had lost my wallet that I use for carrying cash (too much cash) and casino cards only. I immediately retraced my steps hoping that I had merely dropped it at the check in desk. I‚Ä¶",50

Well, the hotel property is modern and clean, but apart of that there is nothing to commend about.  The room is basic, even the toiletries are basic and no touch of luxury whatsoever, even so it commands a US$250 per night price tag.  Didn't try the restaurant outlets as I was told that they are no that attractive - you could get more reasonably priced and delicious food at coati or back to the Macau peninsula.  Taxi queues can be a big problem for hotels along the Cotai strip and this place is no exception.

The taxi situation (especially on a hot rainy Friday night) is pretty bad in Macau but the shuttle buses can take you almost anywhere for free.  The pool on the 8th floor is quiet and more friendly to hungover adults than the lower floors which are better for families and children.  Our check in was relatives painless and the rooms are an excellent standard.",40

The walk from reception to the elevators was like navigating an underground station at rush-hour. The elevators were all full. The hotel lobby is more of a shopping mall than a foyer, with hundreds of people all about. Every experience also seems so mechanical with sign-in needed at the pool even. Actual sign-in. With a pen. And an attendance register.

For breakfast beverage they don't offer anything other than orange-juice, filter-coffee or pre-boiled tea. The selection is a nightmare, a damn nightmare, nothing else can describe that.  I wonder which crazy nazi maniac planned this kind of hotel, but maybe it is a culturel difference. Maybe for mainland Chinese this is actually their dream of having a vacation.",10

The room was spacious and clean, bed was comfortable and internet was responsive.

In the end they gave us two rooms next to each other but not connecting. I was a bit annoyed but they were so polite that I couldn't really get upset, and it ended up good in the end. Rooms were clean and tidy no complaints. The Sheraton is linked to Dreamworks, this time I booked the Shrek Breakfast on the last day, which my eldest‚Ä¶",40
"Was here for a massive company party in July. Arrived at 7am and went straight to the pool area which they had reserved for us. The staff were good and pretty much let us do what we wanted.   Rooms were standard Sheraton style, comfy beds, decent size. Couple of weird things though... No power outlet in the bathroom & you need to play a game of hide and seek to find the hair dryer (not telling!). I had to play a game of charades with the cleaner in the hallway to figure out where it was hidden. Also, the shower door opens inwards which makes it ridiculously hard to get in and out. Tiny details, but they count.  Casino was a bit boring... Pretty serious gaming atmosphere.",40
"I have stayed in many hotels in Macao. This is by far the best value for your money, especially on weekends in Macao. The standard of the hotel are high, really nice beds. There is a multimedia system in every room and an iPhone speaker. The hotel is located at Cotai strip. It‚Äôs a great location, close to some of the largest casinos. It‚Äôs only five minutes walking to COD where Macao‚Äôs most popular night club, Cubic, is located. It‚Äôs also where the House of the dancing water and Taboo show are located.",50
If you're looking for a Vegas style hotel in Macau.. This one will not disappoint. It's a super large hotel with a somewhat Polynesian/Honolulu vibe. The casino area is massive & the rooms are really spacious & modern!   Super clean inside & the morning breakfast buffet is amazing!! The cons? There's 1 for most & 3 for some such as us. The 1st one is the noise.. It's super loud especially in the morning as outside the building on the North East side there's heavy land reclamation & construction.. We woke up to this every morning.   2) The windows from the outside are super dirty due to all the dirt/dust from construction outside.. We could barely see out of our window.  3) The Vegas style area where this hotel is located in what's called the Cotai area is a decent drive area‚Ä¶,40
"Stayed for 1 night only, booked a standard room and avail an upgrade worth MOP$700 for a club room (suite) with buffet breakfast, free wifi, everning coctails and all day snacks.  Huge and amazing pool area but too crowded. Staff were accommodating and helfpul (front office and F&B).  Had our dinner at Bene Italian Restaurant; food were under salted. We ordered a giant three scoop ice cream that was half melted already when it was served to us.",30
"I had enjoyable stayed with my family in Sheraton Macao for second times last week. Their staff are very friendly and helpful too. Special thanks to Sheraton Macao Guest Services Manager, Front Office, Mr. Ricky Chan. He had been very helpful and friendly during our stay for second times.  The lunch buffet at ""Feast"" are awesome, many varieties, and friendly staff too. They have 2 swimming pools, and both are perfect for family.  Sheraton Macao location is perfect, well connected and sheltered with Venetian, and other Cotai Central Hotel (Holiday Inn and Conrad). Their on-time free shuttle bus are connected to Galaxy Macau, Venetian, airport, macau & taipa ferry terminal. You can walk for 5-7 mins to hop-on free shuttle bus at the next hotel ""Hard Rock"" to go to Macau city. ‚Ä¶",50
"Stayed for one night and as normal for a Sheraton resort, excellent stay. The room was clean and bigger than expected and the casino was good to look around. Short walk to other main casinos, with undercover walking through to Venetian.",50
"I stayed in Sheraton Macao with my colleagues as part of our business trip. After finishing our meetings, my colleagues and I decided to relax at the pool area. I went to Sala pool which had so many children playing there. Hence it is not actually suitable for us who wants to chill by the pool in ''peace''. But overall, it was a good experience since there is a Sala pool bar around, we could order some drinks, food and have good conversations with the service team there. It felt less like we were in a kiddy pool. Overall, we have all our necessities covered without any hiccups from Sheraton Macao.",40
"We stay for only 2 short night here in June 2014. The hotel itself is very big area. It got shopping mall downstairs also beside the casino. They also have complimentary shuttle to other hotel, ferry terminal and also airport.   As we book the Suite that come with the Club benefit so we can check in at the Club Lounge which is much faster and nicer as no need to queue at all. We book the Deluxe Suite which is very great. The room itself is very clean and very big. The Club benefit is great, they offer free snacks and alcoholic drinks from selected time but for me is more like a meal than a snacks. The staff in the Club Lounge is all very friendly.   We didnt enjoy the pool area which is quite dissapointing. The pools closed down while we are there due to thypoon warning. This is‚Ä¶",50
"I stayed here a few weeks ago with a work conference, which was well hosted by the Sheraton, with 3500 staff they knew exactly what to do and didn't leave us hanging around. The hotel in general was fantastic, clean, big rooms, comfy bed, nice staff and close shopping. The only thing that works against it, is probably the size of the property, in order to get anywhere in the hotel it involved a long walk and a long wait. When I say that I am referring to the elevators, sounds crazy but at one point myself and a friend stood for 15 minutes waiting for a lift that could take us down. The reason for this is cause they only have 2 lifts that work certain levels and even if you say down, on the 24th floor, and someone on a lower level gets on and wants to go down it will service all‚Ä¶",40
"When I first step in Sheraton Macao, I think it is a good choice to stay in this hotel. Concierge staff are attentive and directed me to the reception counter. A female receptionist serviced me & my partner in a smile & very politely. Check in is quick just around 5 mins including introducing their membership program - Starwood. Room was upgraded to higher floor (25/F) with a good view. Guest room was maintained new and nice. Free in-room WiFi is smooth. The bed was the most comfortable that I stayed. Big bathroom with high pressure shower head. We've tried the buffet in one of their restaurant - Feast and it was worth to dine. Great food & many choice there.  I've stayed in other hotels in Macau like The Venetian Macao Hotel & Sofitel Macau Ponte 16 Hotel but they were quite‚Ä¶",50
"Stayed for business at the Sheraton, Macao for three nights in July. The hotel is spread over a very large area, doesn't give the warm, cosy feeling. It is difficult to say where the mall ends and the hotel begins, and vice versa. The staff is helpful but, I guess overwalked!! The breakfast spread is good, the coffee shop is reasonably stocked. The location of the hotel is good, walking distance from other malls and hotels. I would not prefer it for a family vacation.",40
"Spent a weekend there earlier this month. Hotel is clean, room is good and comfortable. Size of the room is considered big in the area. Beds are very comfortable. Bathroom is big with stand-in shower and bath tub. Water pressure is powerful.  The shopping complex is mostly expensive name brands. Casino is big and nice, hence there will be a lot of Chinese people around the hotel and can be noisy sometimes.  The gym is open 24 hours and equipment are very new. The gym covers all ranges of exercises. I love it!  Swimming pool no.1, the main pool... cannot call it a pool, it's long and narrow, basically cannot swim laps for sure and it gets crowded with kids. Well should not expect too much from a casino hotel, staff are friendly and helpful, that's good  Swimming pool no.2, the‚Ä¶",40
Great hotel. Well situated. Good size room but the view from our room was on a construction lot ;( Large hotel but it takes forever to get an elevator. Check-out was super quick. The Italian Restaurant - Bene - was great.,40
"I recently spent a few months with Sheraton Cotai due to business purpose. Changing the hotel to another doesn't come to my mind so far as the services here are fantastic. A special thanks to Jessica, Alice, Ria and Vera, as their warm welcome everyday and helpful services, make me feel very much at home.  As a SPG member, check-in at the hotel is easy and effortless. As I stayed at the Club level, apart from full breakfast, I could literally have drinks and snacks almost all day through. Particularly, I wish to mention the evening lounge cocktail which is really a treat. The cocktail is in buffet style: vegie salad, hot and cold food, and sweets. It also supplies free of charge soft drinks as well as wines. The staff there are ever so friendly and helpful.  The room is brand‚Ä¶",40
"We stayed here for 4 days at the end of June and had a wonderful stay. We had a room on the 17th floor looking over the Ocean ( side view). The hotel was very comfortable, quiet and clean.   The room offered relief from the constant  masses of people gambling in the casino.....not my cup of tea but obviously why people go to Macau.   Breakfast at the hotel offers everything from fresh fruit to noodles and dumplings ....wonderful.  A great place to stay, recommend to others particularly if you are a gambler, if not, then it is a bit limited. Try visiting historic sites, markets and museums, all are worth the effort.",50
"My family have stayed in Sheraton Macau for many times.  This hotel is good for family and the Dreamwork activities are the highlight of staying here.  My son just loved the Dreamwork parade at 3pm so much and we had to stay at the hotel to wait for the parade everyday.   The changing room of the swimming pool really need some improvements, the water temperature is odd, after few seconds of the warm water coming out, then the cold water for the next few seconds which the kids and babies are very easy to get a cold.    The hotel location is ok, it is opposite to Venetian hotel and City of dream; it has free shuttle bus to go to the ferry terminal; Venetian and Galaxy Hotel, but there is no shuttle bus to take you to the city centre and there is always long queue at the taxi‚Ä¶",40
"I am not here to talk about how fantastic  Sheraton Macau is . They do much better job there compare with not just other Hotels in Macau , also with all Sheratons in the world . Awesome Facilities , clean rooms - if i am not mistaken it might be 3,000 room in this hotel , great service, fastest internet ever , free Wifi in lobby while all others charging ..  I would like to send a special Thanks  to Mr .Sukendran  who is the star member of this great team , and his service is one of the best reason  to choose Sheraton Macau , not just me and my clients as well ! Compare Venetian service is terrible but they are still the biggest and most popular one in Macau , I am sure they have million things to learn from Mr Sukendran and his team to improve .  The best in Macau .",50
"Wanted to say thanks to the hotel manager Amy Wu and our host Lance! I went to the Sheraton on a small family trip with my parents and they've been around so they've seen their share of hotels and are very picky. And they had nothing but good things to say about the room. It was really clean, the bathroom is amazing (Comfortable tub) and the service personnel is extremely friendly.  The only problem I had was the size of the hotel. It's one of the largest hotels I've ever been to. Four days is definitely not enough to see everything. So I guess I'll have to go back again soon! I definitely recommend this hotel for families and other visitors. ",50
"My first trip to Macau and it was made even more special by my stay at the Sheraton. My sister and I were travelling together, as she was attending a conference at the Sheraton. Our room was in the sky wing and was a good sized room, over looking 2 of the pools and the Venetian across the road. The bathroom is really nice and big! Air con and TV all worked well, however there wasn't much of interest to watch on any of the channels. 4 bottles of drinking water is provided in the room, gowns and slippers, tea and coffee facilities. We had free WiFi in our room and at the pool. Beds and pillows were comfortable. We had great sleeps. Although the hotel itself was very busy, our floor was quiet and there was no noise at night. Staff at the hotel were very helpful and if they did not‚Ä¶",50
"This was my second stay here, and my 20th+ trip to Macau,. I won't stay here again.  The rooms are OK , well fitted out, but the conference team ruined my stay  I brought 50 people here to an event - and they offered to send two Madagascar characters to our training room.  About an hour into our training, I realized they were going to change me MOP22,000 for a 15 mins appearance from two characters in suits. Can you imagine what you could do with MOP22,000?   So I cancelled them immediately, but the Conference team told me they needed to charge me 30% of the total cost (MOP6,000) for them NOT to show.......  Thoroughly unprofessional approach. While this may be a suitable hotel for an overnight stay for the Casino , I would avoid it at all costs for conferences.",20
"Was there in Macau for ""The House of Dancing Water"" and wasn't ready to pay a premium for staying at any of the 3 hotels in City of Dreams. I am grateful that I made a right choice to stay at Sheraton though I need to walk a little (ard 10 mins) to the performing venue. Check-in was swift at the main lobby even though I did not do it at the SPG counter (yeah...I am a SPG member but I must be half -awake that day..didn't see it at the entrance, miss out on the comfort on check-in for being a member). Hotel was huge and grand. Security was there at lift lobby of my Sky Tower checking if you are a card holder. Stayed at Club Level 35. Room was big and comfy with free room wifi but my room view wasn't fantastic though. Room dine -in service was fast. We were told to wait for 40 mins‚Ä¶",40

"One of the biggest Sheratons. Really nice location and a good hotel. Just that next time, I would probably pick a smaller hotel which has a more intimate feel to it. This one takes you through very long winded corridors and you would probably not see a single soul on your floor sometimes. Also, the hotel staff is not conversant in English. I was stuck outside my room since my key stopped working and it took all of 45 minutes and 4 staff including the manager to sort it out. I had already missed my meeting by then. Probably not much that the manager can do about this but I would suggest keeping those staff in customer facing roles who understand english. Overall a good hotel in a great location.",30

"The staff at the Sheraton in Macau really make you feel welcome. Upon check-in, we were assisted by Aida who was extremely helpful in ensuring we had a swift check-in and aiding us in extending our stay. We were upgraded to a suite on a very high floor. The rooms are spacious and pristine. I must recommend saving at least one meal for Xin, a hot pot restaurant within the hotel. The food is first-rate and again the staff is world-class. We were specially tended to by Victor who is the manager of Xin. He was even kind enough to give us suggestions on other restaurants to try within Macau (specifically local ones off the beaten path). If we were to return to Macau we would most certainly choose the Sheraton again.",50

We checked in, and then struggled to find the tower to get to our room, a couple of nice staff members pointed us in the right direction. The room itself is lovely, brand new, big spacious bathroom and bedroom.   In terms of food, it was good - nothing fancy. Breakfast had a huge selection of things from cooked western breakfast, Chinese, and even Indian curry. There were 3 swimming pools, we couldn't find the adults only one, but that sounded like where we wanted to be.

We also wanted to be close to the Venetian and the shops. As a result, we were pleased with the hotel's location as we were able to walk to the Venetian by a skywalk/passage.  The service at the front desk was pleasant. The room was surprisingly large and clean. We were very surprised by how clean the room was. We enjoyed our 1 night stay at this hotel/casino very much and would consider staying here again.",40

My originally plan was turned down due to hotel policy, but Sandy thoughtfully provided suggestions and alternatives that can achieve the same goal as I originally planned. She even brought me to the spa room, where I will be proposing at, to make sure it fits my expectation. After we met, she sent me that day's agenda to confirm the details.

"Cannot recommend this Hotel highly enough.  We stayed in a Club room for 3 nights and were over the moon with size n cleanliness.   It is so central you can spend days just finding your way around the interconnecting Hotels, Casinos and shopping malls.   However the old city is truly a delight to visit n explore.  The sheraton has so many pool areas to choose from and all extremely well cared for  The biggest advantage is the staff, special mention to Jason in Club who made it his business to ensure every visit in the club area went smoothly for us.

Stayed here for a work conference. The hotel is huge and is connected to the Sands cotai and Four Seasons and the Venetian  Rooms are massive and very luxurious.

She explained how we could find our way around the hotel and how stuff worked. She even offered us an upgrade to Executive Suite at no extra charge.

Ticked alot of boxes.   Given the size of the conference I felt that the hotel had some problems with service, simply being stretched to far, but this would be understandable.   The property is huge and the only downside was that I found it hard to find a bar to have a drink at.   Overall positive experience",40
"We spent 4 nights at this magnificent hotel about a week ago. Being a SPG member and having booked a executive suite we got a 2 room suite of 83 square meters, very well decorated and equipped. Two 42"" Tv, two of most everything you need. We also had the privilege of dining and drinking at Sheraton club at the firth floor which means you eat and drink free three times a day if you want. Excellent staff in the club, especially  Jenny from Vietnam and Ceasar  from Portugal/Mosambicue made a very good impression. All the staff deserves credibility for trying to do as good as they could.

Good buffet spread but only drawback is large crowds if you are booked during peak periods since the hotel has 3,800 rooms!",50

Free shuttles from the ferry terminals were easy to use, as were the free buses between hotels (we walked over to the Venetian to catch those). We had B&B but we had to leave really early on our last day and I was disappointed that a hotel of this size couldn't provide a breakfast box for us to take away, considering we had paid for breakfast. Wifi was not free.",40

They are unresponsive to the guest.  I'm here with a convention and asked that my SPG number be added to my account so I could be count this stay toward my 2014 nights.  The response was, sorry you are booked at a group rate.  Now while that is true I do not understand why you would not allow one of your better customers to count these nights toward my 2014 qualification.  Makes no sense and makes me want to move my loyalty to another hotel chain.

I stayed in Sheraton Macau and booked two rooms ! they give me connected rooms and high floor ! The room was perfect for everything also the things that made me so happy was I didn't need to wait for check in and check out for not even one minute!!!! one week before my stay I received an email from hotel and asked me which type of rooms I want and I reply them so they was arranging my rooms before I got to hotel even my room keys was ready ! I just show my passport and they give my key cards! less than 30 seconds! and also for check out u will  give your key cards to the staff that standing in front of express check out desk and just need to say I want to check out !! so fast!!!!,50
"Staff in the Hotel are very courteous, polite and helpful. We uggraded to an Executive suite with SPG. We ate in the hotel each meal, as it was so good, and reasonable priced. The hotel is large and is linked to the Cotai Strip shopping precinct. If truth be told the Club lounge is one of the best we have been in and service was second to none. Like Vegas, due to the sheer size, everything looks much closer than it is. So grab a cab to get anywhere that is outdoors and when indoors walk through all the adjoining malls to the other Hotels and casino's. We found shopping in the Strip cheaper than HK or Macau proper....size and numbers I guess. The pool is excellent and with private cabana's a bonus when there is a flood of pool revellers.  Will stay again...very relaxing.",50
"The room size is adequate large. The hotel is new so that it is clean. We accommodated at smoking-free storey. The attitude of the staff is very good.

Brilliant Hotel right in the heart of the Cotai Central Casino Strip.  Rooms are spacious staff our very friendly and attentive.  It has a great Gym and Sauna.  Some fantastic restaurants throughout the complex which is connected by a shopping mall between the 3 hotels that serve the 3 different casino's in this complex.  It's also connected via a bridge to the main Four Seasons and Venetian Hotels and Casino's as well as the huge shopping mall of the Venetian.

Anticipating requests, thinking with us and being there during the event. She, together with her colleague Hanny and all their colleagues, made sure that the whole day went as planned.

The most important thing was, the party hit a sudden rain shower, and Sheraton organised a great and efficient venue relocation!  The occasion was very much enjoyed by everyone and Sheraton Macau delivers to high standard. I am highly recommended for private event and all kind of celebrations.",50
"I stayed in a number of hotels in Macau before but I found that it was the worst. We arrived in the shuttle designated clearly for Sheraton Macao but we were dropped off in a side door and we faced very incompetent receptionist. The checkin took ages and the experience was worse than a one-star Mainland China Hotel. I booked through the Hotel's website but it seemed they didn't observe anything of my booking from their system. The receiptionist did not know that I had booked the club floor and did not notice I wanted a non-smoking room. After the disastrous check-in, I could not find the way to my room. It was written on the room card that i should be staying at Tower 1 but you could not find something called Tower 1 there. The signs only show you to Earth Tower and whatever‚Ä¶",20
"We were looking to make a quick trip to Macau for the night from Hong Kong since it was cheaper to stay a night, knowing we were flying out the next morning.   Through Tripadvisor we found availability here and got wind of a Sheraton package including ferry tickets for the return to HKG and breakfast, which was exactly what we needed knowing we would have a long day ahead. When trying to book said package, their website wasn't working (pain in the butt). I used their calling service to have them call my mobile, which I thought was nifty until they called and I could barely make out anything the agent was saying due to a poor connection or accent - couldn't tell either way. They did manage to tell me however that they could honor the package for me if I booked upon arrival at the‚Ä¶",20
"I'm not one for writing reviews unless something is outstanding or appalling and I have to say The Sheraton was outstanding. The hotel was beautiful. From the moment we arrived till the moment we left we received VIP treatment. The room was spacious and lush with an incredible view of the strip and the pools. The bed was extremely comfortable and welcoming after a night in the casino. The staff were extremely welcoming and tended to our every need, which is incredible for such a large hotel but you wouldn't realise it. The food and drinks in the lounge were very good, as was the breakfast which there was no queue for - we were straight in with no queuing at the buffet either.  We had a wonderful experience and would recommend it to our friends.",50
This Sheraton hotel is the biggest in the world and also the most welcoming hotel I tried in the area. The skills of personnel is high and most of them speak fluent English including housekeepers. The hotel has a huge swimming pool area and is in the biggest shopping area of Macau also connected minute walking with The Venetian hotel. The lobby area is often crowded but once in the room all is made to guarantee the maximum comfort. This hotel is definitely my place in Macau.,50
"My partner and I stayed for 3 nights at the Sheraton and we really enjoyed ourselves. Once we arrived at the airport, we took the shuttle bus service to the hotel and it was only about 5-10 mins away. Check in was a breeze as we were led to the SPG counters. The lobby is quite busy but staff were very efficient. We had a King room on the 30th floor of the Sky Tower and it was quite big and very comfortable. It's great that the hotel is located in the Cotai strip and it is convenient for shopping and connected as well to the Venetian if you want to drop by there for a look see. There are also a number of casinos within the complex.  The buffet breakfast is open until 10:30 am and there are a number of food stations and choices to choose from. It seems like it is always full, but‚Ä¶",50
"We spent a night using the Cash + points at the Macau Sheraton in Mid June. The check in was smooth and I got the high floor which I requested,. Maybe because it was a  almost free room , the view was not what I expected. The bed was comfortable and the room is at a good size. The bathroom amenities were limited as there were only one set of shower gels shampoo  and 2 sets on towels and . Normally, you will get at least 2 sets of shampoos  shower gels and 3 sets of towels. You have to request extra amenities.  Other than that, everything was expected.",30
"With 3,896 rooms, it is listed as the 14th largest hotel in the world in Wikipedia. It was opened in Sep 2012 so its rooms and facilities are new. Standard rooms are clean, large and comfortable. Centrally located on Cotai Stripe area which is few minutes walk away to the Venetian and City of Dream. Taxi to the old town center is about HK$90 The hotel provides free shuttle from/to airport, the ferry harbors and the Zhuhai border. During my stay, there was always taxi available at its taxi stand which is rare as Macau has a taxi shortage.  It is a city within a hotel completed with casino, shopping, restaurants and health facilities. It is large, so be prepared to walk a bit or getting lost. It had the typical busy tourist and gambling crowd. It was not the most luxury hotel‚Ä¶",40
"It's a huge property and the service is impeccable. The entire team is always very willing to help. The rooms are big and the show and pomp of the Vegas of The East is visible. All around the Cotai strip, with the Venetian and all the other hotels in close proximity, it was an good experience. Highly recommend this hotel for couples and family outing too!",50
"I and Mom stayed with Sheraton for 1 night on 21 June.  The hotel is a big one and I was told that it is the largest Sheraton in the world.  I was very satisfied with the efficient and friendly check in service.  There were over 20 counters to handle check in and I felt welcome by the staff (sorry forget about her name) handling my check in.  She also quickly helped me to enroll in the spg club while she gathered all the coupons in my package.  The room is spacious and comfy.  Both Mom and me had a very good night of sleep. However, I just noted that some of the furniture was getting old despite the hotel is not that old and the water boiler was not cleaned thoroughly.  If not, I will rate it with 5 stars.  I also went to the fitness centre.  It is not very big but not many‚Ä¶",40
"As this is Macau you lose the luxury of the waiting areas, reception areas, foyer entrances due to the mass amount of people and all the people waiting around and sitting and finding somewhere to sit. This is understandable as it is Macau and it is one of those gaming destinations.  The hotel room was of a good size but I found a few things that should of been checked and kept in line with a brand like Sheraton. My hotel room clock radio was set at a totally wrong time and I had to fiddle around with it trying to get the right time. In the bathroom the wallpaper was peeling off and not seen to or attended to.   Swimming pools are great, I was in a slightly cooler seasons but they have two heated outdoor pools amongst many other outdoor pools they have. They are more fun relaxing‚Ä¶",40

There is a pool,it was very nice,but a bit expensive.The staff was ok but not as good as i expected...  ln all i like this hotel, i will be back again....",40
Superb personalized service provided by staff. We were always greeted with a smile. The hotel room was as usual up to our expectations. In terms of location it was also good. Will certainly be back again! ,50
"My wife and I planned a long anniversary trip and we've decided to stay one night in Macao.  Our only regret is we didn't plan to stay here longer!  At check-in we let them know we are celebrating our anniversary, and a Platinum member they upgraded us to Deluxe Suite, their second biggest room at the establishment.  With a bottle of wine and flower-decorated bed with two towel swans.  The entire stay, as short as it was, was excellent.  Both of us were very happy to be here.  There are so many things to do, shop, and enjoy at the hotel or nearby establishments that we do not want to leave! We are also traveling with two children and they had a great time as well.  Dreamworks was there as well as Transformers exhibit.  Also plenty of kids club activities.  SPG lounge serves‚Ä¶",50
I have always been a fan of Sheraton but this is the first time I'm staying in one in Asia.  The rooms and check in service are good and the hotel is not bad at all.  But I was very taken back when I called and requested for one extra big towel and they said that each room is only allow two sets of towels.  They can only do an exchange and is not allow to give extras.  I was so surprised by the answer that I just said ok and hung up.  I just feel so disappointed by being denied such simple request.  I could totally understand if its from a motel but from Sheraton? This experience totally changed my view on Sheraton.,20
The hotel is very nice and very accessible. :) Staffs are very friendly and helpful although they should learn to speak in English because there are also foreigners who doesn't understand Mandarin. They also have good food that is served during breakfast. We will surely stay here again! ,50
"We stayed at the Sheraton for 5 nights in a Club Room on the 31st floor of the Sky Tower with full access to the Sheraton Club.  This was a recommendation from other travellers comments on Trip Advisor and the best advice we ever got.  We walked into the foyer after a long journey and was amazed at the number of people walking around but was greeted immediately by a staff member who took our bags and escorted us to the check in counter. Within minutes we were on our way to our room which was large and clean with wonderful furnishings and fabulous views.  The Sheraton Club is brilliant and well worth the extra few dollars to utilise the facilities. Breakfast was good, coffee was good and Happy Hour from 5.30pm onwards was a perfect way to wind down after a busy day. The service,‚Ä¶",50

"Short two days family trip, but highly recommended. My son loves their swimming pool, we love the room and all services.  Especially from check-in, I remember his name was Mr. Sunny Chin, very well managed and friendly.   Shopping there is also great!  However, all prices in the food court area is abit too high, didn't expect to pay $50 for a water-melon juice. Overall, 5 stars for sure, and will definitely be checking in to Sheraton Macao Hotel again for our next visit.",50
"I stayed at Sheraton Macau for a one day stopover. The two bedroom room was spacious and new ( the bath was especially nice). Sheraton Macau's location is also great, with shuttle buses to the other casinos and to some areas in Macau. I can easily recommend this hotel to other travelers.",50
"For us it was a short vacation trip after a lot of business trips in 2 months. My partner and me both wanted a break and the Sheraton in Cotai definitely made sure we had this break.  From the check-in (which was expertly handled by Mr. Bruno Miguel) we where whisked off into our room. Generally here you will find the one or other thing that might spoil a break, but the room was immaculate, very nicely designed and furnished and most of all, for my partner and me, very spacious with ample space to stow away our luggage.  Dining at the Sheraton is of course always a pleasure although - and this is just for those of you who do stay up late - between 3pm - 5pm it might get a bit difficult to find something that is open. Not that that is a problem at all, but still. Would be nice to‚Ä¶",50
"Nice hotel, spacious rooms and bathrooms. The hotel is huge, close to 3000 rooms operational.... Phew!!! How do they manage this mega structure? Staff is quite helpful and prompt. The check-in and check- out was very well managed. Only issue is if you want to visit the ""Square"" and the historical city with its attractions, it takes a thirty mins drive one way and costs close to 80 HK dollars per trip. So best is to spend a day near the mainland, visit the local attractions and and then do a pilgrimage to cotai sands, where the world unfolds. There are enough attractions to be visited within walking distance, it is a saga of huge activity, great retail therapy and good eateries. I suggest best places to eat are the food courts in the Sheraton compound and in the Venetian. On the‚Ä¶",40
Hotel is well appointed and clean. It meets the expectations of the Sheraton brand.  You had to show your key to security to gain access to the lift lobby. Guest floors were well maintained. The room was nice and well serviced. All areas of the room were clean. Bed was ok although the pillows were very soft. Room was quiet and had a nice view over one of the pools. I loved that the curtains kept the room completely dark even in the morning. Great wifi signal in the room. A solid 4 to 5 star hotel based on the room and amenities.   Pools were nice but a bit small.   Unfortunately staff were not very friendly at all on both checkin and checkout. Nor were the concierge and events booking staff very friendly. Front desk seemed to be unable to cope with questions and very grumpy.‚Ä¶,30
"Second time for me to stay at this hotel. All the things are good (rooms upgrade suite, staffs are helpful and friendly). However, there is a minor problem for breakfast in club lounge. The staff outside the lounge could not find my booking correctly in the system! It wasted me a 2~3 minutes to explain and finally solved out my another staff (to check my room by my room card).",50
"Cut and dry, the Sheraton Macau in Taipa is the place to stay. My first experience staying in Macau was at the Venetian Hotel which met my expectations at best in regards to the room but the service was impersonal and sub par to say the least. After researching hotel rates I decided to book the Sheraton hotel for myself and a few colleagues, and we could not have been happier with our experience. (So much so that we had returned several times following within that same month).   What sold me on this hotel was the front desk staff and front office managers who go above and beyond their job expectations.     So here's what happened: Following a meeting my friend was running late for his flight back to Canada so front desk and concierge booked him a helicopter to fly him to Hong‚Ä¶",50
"The Sheraton Macao Cotai Central, one of three hotel operators in Sands Cotai Central, is one huge hotel located opposite the Venetian Macao and City of Dreams. Underneath the rooms is a sprawling mall loaded with many boutiques, caf√©s and restaurant. On the 1st floor is a link bridge to the Venetian. There are shuttle buses on offer to take you to the airport, ferry terminals and Sands casino located in the main island. However for real convenience take the shuttle bus from the hotel to Galaxy Macau, 5 minutes drive away, for connectivity to the many various places of interest in Taipa and Macau main island. This place is loaded with buses that at times it looks like the main bus terminal of Macau.   Checking in is a breeze with 3 check in lounges to cater for the huge crowd.‚Ä¶",50
"Wonderful experience and excellent services by Delilah and her team. Delilah was very helpful and welcoming and escorted us both to the Club's check-in counter and our room. We booked the Ambassador Suite, and since it was my birthday, the hotel staff decorated the room with loads of colourful balloons and flowers. It was an even nicer surprise when they brought in the cake, card and the icecream teppanyaki tray! Everyone was so thoughtful and sweet, and this certainly has been my best stay in Macau so far. We will definitely be returning in the future!",50
Stayed in the deluxe suite with club access in the beginning of June. I was also a spg member. The hotel emailed me a preference list few days before the stay. Check-in was bit confusing as I was directed to the spg lounge instead of the club lounge. Finally got to the club lounge where Jessica checked us in.  Jessica was great thru out our stay. Felt as if i was really a privileged guest. Breakfast and cocktails were served in the lounge. The standard of the food was average. I should have saved the extra $ and have my breakfast in other outlets. We stayed in the sky tower on 32nd floor facing the pools. I was informed during check in that the top 2 floors were undergoing renovations but we stuck to our choice for a high floor. The noise was bearable . Sheraton's shuttle was‚Ä¶,30

Definitely One of the best hotels in Macau. Spacious and clean rooms with good food. We were very greeted by Mr. Alexander wessels. He was extremely welcoming and helped us get our rooms very quickly. The concierge was very helpful and helped us a lot in planning our trip.,50
"Upon entering the ""World's Largest Sheraton"" I was overwhelmed by all the people in the hotel but luckily I was greeted by Airi. She was very welcoming and assisted us to the check in area and even escorted us to the room. The hotel itself is very massive and the facilities were great! As we did not plan anything to our arrival we asked of any suggested plans and she recommended the palms lounge as they were having social hour. This was a great idea especially with the free flowing wine. As we reached our room it was decorated for our anniversary with a thoughtful card from guest relations. They really know how to make a guest feel special!! Thank you for the lovely services sheraton! It surely was an unforgettable experience.",50
"We stayed here for one night during our honeymoon to experience the casino. The staff and the hotel were lovely and couldn't ask for more. As the Cotai strip generally is very much a resort, we found to have dinner in the restaurants, even the buffet restaurants was extremely expensive. Worth bearing in mind when you visit. Otherwise a lovely stay and fun to experience the casino. ",40
"Stayed here for a night and thought is was an excellent hotel.  They upgraded us to a fantastic room with amazing space, bathrooms etc.  The shopping centre is attached... and they have shuttle services from airport, ferry, and to the downtown areas.  I would highly rate this hotel if you are going to Macau.  Beautiful rooms and good space for the family.  They provided cots at no charge.    Service was excellent all around.",50
"The front desk ppl are polite and cheerful. Managed to get upgraded to a family suite  which is really great for us since we had 2 kids with us.  The kids room comes with Wii which they spent hours playing it . There are kids bath amenities with their own bathrobes . What more can I asked for .  Unfortunately the experience was marred by the poor housekeeping team .    They did not clean the room properly,  leaving rubbish behind.  They also forgotten to replace the glasses.  They also did not clear away the dirty dishes (yogurts stuff)  that we had on the first day . We had to wash away the leftover before it goes bad.  I would still recommend this hotel , maybe the staff just had a bad day or the ""rooms"" are too big to clean.",40

We were pleasantly surprised and she even volunteered to make reservations. Last but not least Ms Sandy. She attended to me prior to our arrival with enthusiasm and even came personally to greet us upon checking out.  In addition the staffs showed concern about our well being.

"I have stayed at Sheraton Macao numerous times and this is my first review to the hotel.  The hotel is located in a big complex with Holiday Inn, Conrad and Sheraton in it. It's a 10 minutes free shuttle bus away from the Taipa pier. It's also within walking distance to The Hard Rock Hotel/ City of Dream complex and the Venetian.  Rooms size is on average compared to other hotels in Macau. It's the expected Sheraton style.  On my second stay at Sheraton Macau two years ago, a SPG manager Sunny Chin took care of all my extra family needs on arranging most of our activities during the stay. Ever since then I call up Sunny every time I go back to Sheraton (almost 10 times) and he provides the same excellent personal services. I can say he's one of the reasons I keep returning‚Ä¶",50
"We only stayed there one night and could not have chosen a better place to stay. It is extremely well connected to the Venetian and the other Sand Casinos and only a quick bus ride away from the Galaxy.   The staff was extremely helpful, told us about the tourist attractions in the area (including the non Casino related ones) and how to get there.  The only down side is that if you want to go to town, there is no direct free shuttle and you have to take a cab or connect for the free bus shuttle at Galaxy.",40
"The Sheraton at Macau is beautiful but simply too big for my liking.  The rooms are lovely and the staff are friendly but it's a headache if you leave something in your room. Our room was on a high floor right at the end of a very long corridor! Of course most hotels in this area are huge and I believe they're building even bigger hotels.  Housekeeping was faultless and the room was spotless.  I ordered room service that was sensational and beautifully presented.  The bed was super comfy. Breakfast is big and a good selection.  There is a shopping mall in the building with some great shops and a food court on the third floor with a big selection of cheap eats and drinks.

This room was incredible with a separate living room, dining/work area, huge bedroom, huge bathroom with separate guest bath and my own Theater.  It was very windy and stormy out so I didn't get a chance to use the pool area, but it seemed really nice.  We stayed on the concierge level which included access to the private lounge which was also great; three giant rooms, with a full bar and a great buffet spread in the morning and evening, all complimentary with our rooms.

From the minute you arrive the bell staff are right onto you to assist with luggage and any needs.  It would be easy for this property to rest on its morals in just being a great building with facilities but like oi say I've come back many times and they keep getting better.

The hotel is interconnected to other hotels, and that makes it most convenient to go to the Venetian which is across the road.  The hotel has an excellent gym and a great pool.  The breakfast is huge, with great options for vegetarians.  The check-out too was fast.  My only concern is that the deposit taken at the time of check-in by card is yet to be reversed.  It is better to pay the deposit in cash, and ask for a refund in cash too.",40

Nice and spacious hotel. A new hotel and you can still smell fresh renovate wood in the room. They have a nice swimming pool and comes of heated pools in case you are there during cold days. As usual casino is right below and the shopping malls across hotels. It is walking distance to clubs and shows. For those wanting to go to Macau island the best bet is to grab a cab else you may need to do a 10 minutes walks to the hotel bus bay.,50

Holiday inn offers late check-out at 3pm and Sheraton always depend on availability of room. Last time was at 1pm and I had to call and confirm on the day itself. This time was 2pm as I made some prior arrangement.  Wonderful stay but little hiccup this time, 1) My nephew asked for a swim, but after a visit to the pool, we decided against it. Water was cloudy. Just wondering what went wrong? Rain in the morning should not have done this.  2) During check-in, I was offered 1500pts for not changing bedsheets. Thats is fine, so I went for it.

Sheraton's pool looked perfect for this kind of event because they have a 4:30 PM visit of DreamWorks characters where kids can take pictures with them.

"I'm not sure what star rating this hotel is, but to me it was like a 6 star! Staff were excellent, hotel complex is part of the Sands Cotai complex and has many shops and restaurants to choose from. Breakfast was SENSATIONAL to put it simply. Rooms were nice, spacious enough and the pools were very good. Excellent transport options as they operate many shuttle services to ferries and other locations that operate every 10 minutes or so. Excellent WiFi. The only thing I can say against this hotel is the smoking, I understand that many people in China smoke, however it doesn't mean we need to breathe it in. The hotel has signs up stating what the fines are, but as the fines are not policed and they are so minor no one cares. But overall a big thumbs up.",50
"We booked a Deluxe room which was nice large clean and spacious. Overall, it felt more like a 4.5 star and its best to non stay during the weekend period as the hotel rate surges incredibly.   The two pools were nice but one opens at 7:30 am and the other opens at 10:00 am. It is linked to the Shoppes at Sands Cotai which has nice shops and a good food court. Not too many less expensive dining options at the actual hotel.  This hotel also has much less shuttle buses then the Venetian, City of Dreams or Galaxy. Recommend the walk to COD or Venetian than catch their many shuttle buses that go all over Macau.",40
"Stayed in Ambassador suite on 35 th floor  and it's memorable for lot of things. One great ambience, you feel stress free, second homely treatment and personal care by staff with humbleness. God bless and all best.",50
"This review is really for travelers with families/ small children. Rest of the stay was standards standard room, standard buffet, standard amenities.  We went for 2 nights 3 days with our daughter, and stayed in a deluxe room. Overall, we felt uncomfortable with the facilities and standards for safety for children. Now for specifics:  Travel to the hotel - We got into the shuttle alright, but when we reached the hotel there was no one to watch over buses coming and going. The driver simply stopped and opened the luggage carriage as asked us to exit quickly since he had to leave immediately. So I climbed in (cause our luggage was at the back) while my 2 year old daughter stood IN THE MIDDLE of the road, because she wouldn't stay on the side alone with dozens of guests trying to‚Ä¶",20
"It was our first time to stay in this hotel. The moment we got out of the Cotai Jet from Hong Kong, we took the free shuttle that led us to the strip where the hotel is located. I was amazed of how big the place is. While my parents were in the reception to check in, my brother and I decided to explore the lobby. The surroundings were great and gave us a safari feel because of its indoor garden landscape. Kids or the young at heart can check out the DreamWorks parade just located in the lobby. I like the fact that guests can use the free wifi they have although; some areas do not offer. They have shops within the reach. It was very accessible in case we needed to buy something. The room was clean, big and fit for a family of four. The hotel staffs were very friendly especially‚Ä¶",50
"We had an excellent time in Macau thanks to the great teamwork at the hotel. The rooms are superbly appointed and it was difficult to get my Kids out of bed and the room. We liked the Bene restaurant a lot, as the service made a great effort to please my family. Concierge was very helpful in getting us to the places we wanted to explore. One would not think this hotel has nearly 4000 rooms! Only downpoint from this trip was the TAXI service in Macau, these cars are probably the first generation after they switched from the rickshaws!",50
"I booked this hotel without any expectations for its service and room after reading other reviews here, but was pleasantly surprised by my stay. The standard twin room at Sky Tower was great with a nice view and a comfortable bathroom.  The hotel has 2 entrances with check-in counters, use the side entrance (south) near Sky Tower for fast check-in. SPG members are recommended to check-in at the designated counter. Overall, service from the hotel staff was great! Faced issue logging in to Wifi from my room and an IT staff came personally to help me solve it :) Location of hotel is good, just opposite The Venetian and beside City of Dreams. Kids could check-out the DreamWorks parade around 3.30pm daily at the hotel shopping lobby.",40
"As a fairly regular Macau visitor, I decided to stay on the Strip for a change, as I was travelling with a group of friends. It's fair to say that we were not the target demographic of the hotel, but the pool shut at 6pm, and there was no bar apart from a weird lobby cafe. Good food options were also very limited: fortunately, we know Fernando's! A strange hotel. Back to the Westin or one of the other Strip hotels next time. For the biggest Sheraton in the world (and presumably their flagship hotel), this place needs some work, as do the staff who were unable to comply with a simple request to leave a couple of water bottles outside the room, so as not to wake my friend up. Come on, Sheraton, you can do better than this!",30
"The hotel is located very closely to the airport.  Although there are not many things to see around the hotel itself, it is the best shopping site, and the venetian hotel is a walking distance (there you can enjoy the famous ""Gondola"").  The hotel staff on the first floor will print out most of the tourists' destinations up on request, which can be shown to taxi drivers. Moving around Macau with taxis will not be expensive.  The staffs are very kind, and will provide you with every possible helps to enjoy Macau. Rooms are tidy, foods are great. You won't be able to get a great view outside the window though.  If you are looking for a relaxing stay in Macau with reliable concierge, this hotel would be the right choice.",40
"Stay two night, I got wonderful time there. Great service,convenient, very enjoyable.the room is clean,free wifi,very comfortable. There are a lot restaurants,they supply kinds of yummy yummy food. The staff are very sweet, great service.",50
"I checked out from this hotel with mixed feelings. First of all, the facility itself is great. Everything is in good condition, there is a large casino downstairs and hotel is connected to a proper shopping mall.   I stayed in executive room, which was actually a suite with a small living room, bed room and large a bathroom. All the whistles and bells you may expect. Excellent room and I was thoroughly satisfied with it.  The negatives? Based on the hotel information leaflet, this is the world's biggest Sheraton hotel. Crowds of people everywhere day and night. Busloads and busloads tour groups coming and going. Breakfast would have been ok, if it wasn't so crowded that you literally had to use your elbows to get a piece of anything.  Not a bad stay, but I'll probably try‚Ä¶",40
"We were given first class service even though we went at their peak season. Firstly, if you have SPG membership, be sure to ask the hotel staff where to check in, it may save you waiting in long queues. There's a Sheraton club at 4th floor where you can check in while having a drink and a snack! The staff are super friendly, we even got some door gifts. Well done to Myn and Cherry. ",50
"All the staff I came across, either through phone or in person, were very helpful and responsive.  The hotel was flexible in accomodating my request.  High level of customer service!  We were in a group of 4 adults and 1 child.  Pay a little more to enjoy club access, with faster check-in at the club lounge, breakfast and afternoon cocktail buffet.  The cocktail buffet in the late afternoon at the club lounge was much better than what I expected.   Spacious ambassador suite with foot massage machine was an excellent facility after a long walk. It was enjoyable to have access to the swimming pool on the 8th floor.  It was less crowd and 5 of us could occupy one big swimming pool!  The downside was it was quite a long walk from the swimming pool on 8th floor back to Sky Tower.  If‚Ä¶",50
"This hotel is efficient, clean, spacious and fit the bill for an overnight stay.  The walk between hotels is enjoyable along shopping halls so is out of the weather.  City of Dreams and the Venetian are easily accessible.  The pools on the 4th floor are large and weren't being used during our stay although open. The overall surroundings at the moment are designed like a forest in a Shrek movie.  The kids can have breakfast with the movie characters on the 4th floor.  We opted for a coffee at McDonalds as we had dinner the night before and were going to the Macau races for a luncheon.   I have to say I was really surprised at the water pressure in the beautiful bathroom as the bathtub filled in what seemed like nanoseconds.  The deluxe room was large as was the bathroom.  We‚Ä¶",50
"The hotel is connected with Venetian and very convenient. The room is very nice and clean. My only complain is the wifi is only free in the public area. The hotel is located in Cotai If you want to go to Macau city, you can get a free shuttle bus in Venetian.",40
"Our 3 night Club stay was faultless.  Our room was very spacious, the hotel pool areas were glorious, the Club extras were excellent value and all hotel staff very curtious and kind and always will to help.  Breakfast was in a very comfortable and pleasant setting with so much variety to choose from and supper was different every night with so many delicious dishes to choose from.  We had time to enjoy the hotel facilities, so a lot of sightseeing and even see a show without feeling as though we tried to fit in too much during our stay ... the pool area was a great place to relax and wind down.",40
"In this trip, we spend one night to live in Hotel Okura Macau and one night in Sheraton. If you think the Starwood association which provides SPG (Starwood Preferred Guest) always has great  and amazing hotel, you might disappoint on the Sheraton in Macau. We spend about 250 USD( in the weekend of the holiday) for one night and I think it was not worthy. The lobby smells of smoke (maybe the Casino is next to the lobby, the smoke might come from there). The room is just a normal size and it provides not enough towels and base rope. I think I'll spend more 100 USD to live in Hotel Okura Macau again, because the room size of Okura is triple size than Sheraton and everything in Hotel Okura Macau is better than Sheraton. You only need to spend about 100 USD and you will feel‚Ä¶",20
"This is world's largest Sheraton Hotel located in Macau Cotai area.  There are two reception area and SPG reception area on 4th floor. Try to avoid the reception area in front ot MacDonald which is rude and lack of SPG knowledge.  For SPG members, room upgrades are not given unless you strongly asked for it.. We booked suite room which is large and luxury with standard above typical Sheraton room.  Service level within the hotel is good except for those in reception area.   If you are looking for better service, go to Conrad Hotel.",30
"Nice place, We first booked our trip @ venation but later changed to Sheraton as it is just opposite to Venation and is interconnected via over bridge. By doing so we saved some money also. Rooms are equally good as Venation, As owner are same for both Sheraton and Venation so not much difference between the two. Casino is also good and very big.  Nice place for a family vacation. We were a group of 17 people and had booked 4 Rooms.  Only problem we faced is the breakfast. Though the spread was good problem was the waiting time to go inside the restaurant serving the same. Its preferred to go early to have it.  Hotel should look into it and make some arrangements for a larger place.",40
Check in is efficient. The people there are knowledgable for inside and outside of the complex. The club is the best choice with lots of value added points. The spa is relaxing and great. Not to mention the location is closed to everything- walking distance. Will recommend to friends for sure!,50
"We just recently stayed in Sheraton Macau for one night coming from Hong Kong. We had a wonderful experience! The hotel is HUGE (4000 rooms!) It very comfortable, the room is big and feels very new and modern, and the bed is very large and extremely comfortable, with crispy sheets. The view from the room was breath-taking. The personnel at check-in is very sweet and attentive, great at answering questions, and they gave us a late check-out without any problems. There is free wi-fi, and a free shuttle to ferry terminal. The hotel is located on Cotai strip, which is a gambling/Las Vegas-like area of Macau. It is connected to two other hotels by a huge multi-level mall with all luxury stores imaginable, plus a few nice restaurants and a fast food court. There is a sky-walk to the‚Ä¶",50
"We enjoyed our second trip to Macao just as much as the first one. I booked this hotel for the size of the room and also its location. Previously we had stayed in the older part of town, which was great, but we wanted to be in Cotai area this time. This area is closer to the old city of Taipa, which is a great place to visit. It is very easy to get to with the buses that run between hotels. Just ask at the concierge and they are happy to explain and give you directions for anyplace you are interested in. Although this is a huge hotel with a casino, and the airport is close, the rooms are very quiet and comfortable. The breakfast was great and service was excellent at every point. We will not hesitate to go back to this hotel again.",50
"Booked deluxe room with twin bed, was surprised by the spacious room with super single bed (almost equivalent to queen bed) and huge bathroom with bathtub and separate shower. However, the bath tub may seems small for tall people as it's quite small but just nice for me :p. The room is clean, new and with trendy design. The location is very convenient with free shuttle bus provided, and walking distance to The Venetian and City of Dreams. Staff are friendly where you can just ask anyone for travel tips. Swimming pools are designed as several private pools where you can enjoy your time with your family. Plenty of eatery places, shops along the Cotai Central where the hotel is located. There is also a casino at the Ground floor. The hotel allows for early check-in and the staff‚Ä¶",50
"Stayed here for 2 nights in April 2014. This hotel provides many of the same luxuries and services of the other chains in the area but for a fraction of the price. Free hotel shuttle bus to and from the ferry terminal/airport, a 5 minute walk to City of Dreams for free shuttle buses into the city, Macau Tower and anywhere else you need to go. Short journey via the indoor walkway that joins the Venetian, Four Seasons and Sands to the Sheraton complex - just follow the signs.  Many shops and eateries are also in the Sheraton complex, including a food court, McDonald's and several restaurants. Would highly recommend the buffet dinner (dessert buffet!) at Feast International Buffet, near the Earth tower.  Rooms are very well-equipped and spacious, especially the bathroom.  Sheraton‚Ä¶",50

"Unfortunately, we did not stay in the Hotel. But we visited the Italien Restaurant and loved the surroundings. I think its called Bone or Bene or sth. It was such a pleasure! The Food was exzellent and the staff really helpful and nice! Especially the German working there. Was a pleasure meeting her. Even special requests are no problem. We will be back in Macau in autumn and will stay in the Sheraton then! Thank you and see you again! ",50

Rooms are big and comfortable.. the best thing about it is that it is connected to venetian by a bridge so we are able to use venetian facilties until wee hours of the night and still walk back.. amazing breakfast.. great variety and theres even indian food available which was an added bonus for an indian family like ours.. pools look good though we did not get a chance to try it.. the dreamworks parade is cool to watch for youngsters and adults all!,40
"We had 2 nights at the Sheraton, we were a group of 3 couples, and had a fantastic time. Great holiday, location is fantastic and easily accesses other attractions in the area. Shopping malls are great with a wide variety of major brands to go wild over. Breakfast buffet was more than you could ask for and the cakes were fabulous. The room was large and clean and provided free internet within the complex. The pool area is fantastic and offers 2 pools  and a fantastic gym area. Would thoroughly recommend the Sheraton.",50
"I shared a room with a colleague. The room and toilet were spacious and the quilt is fluffy and warm. There were service staff everywhere. So even though the hotel is massive, there is always someone nearby to get directions from. Unfortunately, the wardrobe was way too small for 2 ladies on a business trip for 4 nights. It also does not have enough cups and spare pillows. You have to call housekeeping to get them. ",40
The hotel is centrally located because it's near to shopping centers and to other five star hotels. the service was excellent. staffs were very nice and accommodating most especially to Ms. Eurica. We were upgraded to a suite room for free. Rooms are very clean and big and the wifi is strong. We will surely go back to this hotel again in December and I will strongly recommend this hotel to my friends who will be going to macau. Keep up the good work.,50
Would like to thank Sheraton for making our stay wonderful and memorable.  Booked a Club room with 2 dble beds..  but to our surprise they upgraded us to Family Suite facing Cotai Strip.. what a start. A very good room indeed on 19th floor. It was looking like a New room with two connecting rooms.. With two bathrooms.. Children room had shrek theme.. Wii video game available..  Check In was quite smooth on 4 floor in Sky Tower as we had booked Club Room.  There is security all around the towers.. So that no unwanted..unregistered person enters there... Very good feature and I think its in each upscale hotel in Macau.  Breakfast was in the Club Lounge and it was good but not with many choices for Pure vegetarians.. We also had SHREKFAST which was fun for kids and biggies too!! ‚Ä¶,50

When entering the front door for the first timed we were immediately escorted to the VIP check-in as it wasn't busy at that moment, where a Mr. Alexander Wessels (the Director of Front Office) greeted us.  Mr. Wessels was not only extremely congenial but very helpful as he was able to provide us with an upgrade to a fantastic and very spacious suite for a small/reasonable increase in our rate.

What a way to celebrate unforgetable milestones in this wonderful hotel.

"This was our ninth hotel of 10 on our tour. Hotel located off main peninsula on Cotai Island. This area seems to be a replica of Vegas. Huge hotels with halls going on forever filled with boutiques that don't display prices in the windows because if you need to ask, you can't afford it. Restaurants are expensive - not good value for the money but I can say the breakfast (included in room rate) in the Feast Room was fantastic. Rooms could have been from the any of the big hotels in Vegas - large, nice, clean but with a utilitarian feeling (thus the lower rating). If you want character and a location nearer the really nice old town try an older hotel on the peninsula. If you're only here for the gambling, this (or the Venetian or Holiday Inn next door) is the place for you. WiFi‚Ä¶",40
"This hotel is connected to The Conrad, Holiday Inn and The Venetian, across from The City of Dreams complex housing other hotels (The Crown, Hard Rock and Grand Hyatt) as well as shows like House of The Dancing Waters. It is also conveniently connected to the shops and restaurants that are in The Cotai area.  The 3800+ rooms at the Sheraton also makes it a very busy hotel and the breakfast at the Feast restaurant has queues every morning.",40
"My husband and I had an awesome stay here in March 2014. The staff were all polite and friendly and went out of their way to accommodate our needs and made sure we had a comfortable stay. We had everyhing one can expect of a Sheraton. The whole place itself was beautiful and the walkway to the other hotels and shops were a bonus. We especially liked the coffee shop where we hung out a couple times and enjoyed their free wifi. We didn't have free connection in the room but it didn't matter as we were out during the day anyway. Overall, this hotel was great and I would love to stay here again.",50
"Sheraton provide free shuttle bus from the jetty, its very convenient. Beside it was walking disctance to City of Dream and Venetian Macao, it's worth to pay a visit.

I would highly recommend travellers to stay in this hotel no matter is a business trip or honeymoon, you will love it:)",50
Great location on the Cotai strip connected to other hotels and shopping. Only 5 minute walk to City of Dreams for the Dancing Water show there. They have shuttle buses from ferry terminal to hotel free of charge.   Service from front desk to housekeeping was quick and friendly. When requesting amenities from housekeeping it was very fast. The gym was nice and quiet too with many machines available. ,50
sheraton macau is a good experience though the very popular venetian looks more royal. sheraton has every bit of luxury and is centrally located. the rooms are excellent and clean. The staff is very helpful. The breakfast buffet is a big spread and gives vegetarian options also. I would highly recommend this hotel as it might be a cheaper option in comparison but with all that you would want from casinos to rooms.,50

Early check in at 10am was possible, in rooms it¬¥s information that late check outs can¬¥t be provided.Check in experience was very good and fast - without getting overwhelmed by information.  Rooms are spacious and comfortable, good working air acconditioning.  Breakfast if not included in package is quite expensive.

"Stayed here for a night in December 2013. On arrival, we were upgraded to a 1 bedroom suite (not sure why, didn't ask for an upgrade - must have been booked out of rooms leading up to Christmas). The 1 bedroom suite is probably the biggest hotel room I've ever stayed in.  The bedroom was enormous, leading into an equally large bathroom with a seperate shower and centrepiece bathtub. The living room was just as spacious, with an additional toilet near the entrance.  Bed was a very comfortable king - probably one of the best nights' sleep I've had in an Asian hotel.

If I go Macao again, I will stay here, again, and this time I will go pool.( because of weather, I couldn't enjoy the big swimming pool...!)",50

Walking distance from Venetian and city of dreams, you have good access to all the shopping, casinos and entertainment around. There is a food court inside Venetian that offers a lot of variety and is considerably inexpensive.  As mentioned in other reviews, it's big and busy, which means there is always a lots of people everywhere. The breakfast has very good variety.  The rooms are big, spacious and clean. Absolutely comfortable beds! Taking cabs to macaus historic centre is cheap and fast.  Overall an awesome experience.  ",50

This was my second stay at this hotel, and i remember paying about a third of that rate the previous year.  I had a short time in Macao so i needed a hotel with a decent casino, and the Sheraton turned out great for me this time. Firstly, I was very impressed at how quickly the reception staff checked me in. This hotel is massive but the staff are very well trained and everything runs like clockwork. The hotel is part of a larger complex which has a shopping centre and many food places nearby. The hotel also offers complimentary shuttle buses to the airport, ferry terminal and Sands‚Ä¶",50
"True to their commitment, star wood hotels once again surprised us with their hospataltiy. being a platinum member of the SPG club, We were received in the club lounge away from all the hustle bustle and a member of the staff collected and processed our registrations and handed over the keys to us while we ate snacks in the club lounge.  we were staying in the family suite, excellent accommodations, and the service was even more impressive. The hotel is centrally located and very convenient, we didn't have to leave the hotel even for shopping since everything is located int he ground floor.     breakfast was fantastic and club lounge privileges is worth it and the staff and accommodations are very very impressive. would recommend this hotel very highly.",50
"Sheraton usually upgrade and give membership to all first time guests. They have on-going promotions which can give you star points. SPG members can accumulate poi ts over time and use as discount.  They have one of the delicious room service food. The coffee in the room taste really great. The ground coffee,i mean. The shops in the ground floor are quite branded.  However, you need to walk to the City of Dreams if you want to get bus ride around the city. They have limited bus rides. Also some of Macau's attraction are in the other hotels across.   As for accommodation, the rooms are huge, clean and they have a very good shower,",50
"This is very efficiency hotel. Once we stepped in, we could realized its efficiency. The check in was fast and smooth (especially for such a big property). Check out was also short and sharp. Room is reasonable size with the amenities well stocked. During our stay we have requested services to rectify some of the faults in the room and that were all promptly rectify.It really impressed and amazed us.However some of the concierges though were friendly but were not knowledgeable. Some had even given us the wrong information and caused us confusions and unnecessary delays.",40
"Check in was fast and we were upgraded from an executive suite to a deluxe suite.  The room was great, impeccably clean and very good size. Staff was helpful and understanding.  The casino was good enough and club lounge served light dinner with drinks in the evening which was very good. Breakfast was OK. The staff at the club lounge was simply amazing.  We tried room service as well and it was prompt. They take a deposit of HKD1000 at check in, we used a credit card to make this deposit and hence the check out was a breeze, simply a key drop and any extra charges are later deducted from the deposit.",50
"Check in was absolutely fast. Bryan Chong (front office) is very warm, helpful & open to offer assistance.  My friend and I had a great time in the hotel, comfortable and relax! Worth to return to stay again in near future!  Great location, easy access to cotai strip.  Fantastic place.  Sands Casino's local chinese staff are relatively bad & really disappointed.  ",50
"in fact I used to have a quite bad experience about this hotel during the first time visit. And last week was my boyfriend's birthday so i want to plan a Macau trip for him. This time i decided to give one more chance and visit this hotel again. I just told them this is for my bf's birthday, but then they are so highly motivated and help to decorate the room for me!! When we entered the room there are so many colorful balloons on the floor, and the most exciting part is they help me to make a ''HAPPY BIRTHDAY'' slogan by rose petals and put it on our bed!! that was so romantic!! And they also gave us a birthday cake to celebrate, how thoughtful! Also their club lounge is so good, although the weather was so bad and had heavy rain all day long during our stay, we spent a lot of‚Ä¶",50
"The rooms which we stayed were awesome and had plenty of space and best of all, it's clean on the surface but do check-out the hidden corners esp the drawers as I had plenty of plastic bags in the drawer from the previous guest. Had informed housekeeping however nothing was done.   Anyway this place is great as it is near the airport and almost everything is under one roof but only setback would be the service standard of the staffs at Feast. Entire group of staffs there are like zombies with no life. Asked for my coffee and was served with a bang on the table plus chipped mug.. wow how cool was that?   Went to the dessert counter to get some ice cream and was greeted with a slam of the fridge door and after i asked for my ice cream, i was again greeted by a bang on the table.. ‚Ä¶",40
"Check In flawless and speedy.    Room internet lightening fast.  Huge TV screens with many channels to choose from.    Staff almost overly friendly....where did they find so many great kids who know how to cater to a customer?    And the suite!  Bigger than my apartment at home.  Flawlessly decorated.  Everything worked perfectly.  I actually thought I had some special sort of upgraded suite, but was assured that I had a regular club suite.  Better than any Four Seasons or Mandarin Oriental I have stayed at.  I could live in that Cotai Sheraton suite.  More dining options than anyone could imagine.  Two nice casino's under the same roof (with NON SMOKING areas!).  Enough high end shopping to tire even the most fashionable gal.  Free transport every few minutes to the other‚Ä¶",50
"We stayed 2 nights on a Club Lounge Floor and really appreciated the breakfast and dinner buffets.  We had the lunch ""snacks"" once and it was enough to tie us over til dinner.  Customer service at the Sheraton was also better than the other hotels we've stayed at in Macau.  Staff in the Club Lounge were especially helpful and friendly.  My 10 year old daughter loved the Shrek/Dreamworks Parade.  We all enjoyed the heated outdoor pools.  We would stay hear again.",50
"This is the second time we stayed at the Sheraton with our 3 kids - now 8, 6, and 4. The hotel offers a Dreamworks themed family suite which is 2 rooms, 2 bathrooms. The adult's room is a standard king bed but the kid's room is complete with bunk beds (single on top of double), DVD player and video game console - not that they had time to play! At check-in, the kids received a backpack full of Dreamworks stuff which made them very happy, not to mention the kids' activities thru the fitness club and the pools.   With a family our size, this suite was much more reasonable than 2 adjoining rooms and the theme and bunk beds made it a hit with the kids. We wouldn't consider staying anywhere else in Macau as a family.",50
"Guest services (Front Desk) is good,  although there were some hiccups upon checkin, they managed to turn it around very quickly.  Compliments to the Korean GSO Kim-sorry didn't get his full name.   However, I would not say the same for F&B, the cook manning the pastries/ice cream station has a horrible attitude, when someone asked for ice cream, he would give an unhappy stare.  My mum (an old lady) asked for a some ice cream, he actually slammed the cover chiller and throw the bowl at the conure for her.  No one needs to be treated this way, and Do not assume we are from mainland!  Then requested for coffee, the service staff would bang the cups on the table.  I had to tell one of them, if you are not happy, don't serve, we can afford to pay.  And no one clears table! But on‚Ä¶",50
The rooms are spacious and come with all the amenities one can dream of. The gym is absolutely new and equipped with the latest machines and the service is outstanding. It is a huge hotel and everything seems to be so easy going. The only letdown was the bill of my international phone call which definitely was unduly.,50
"1 / The lobby having long queue and need me to wait at least 15 minutes.  The hotel have a lots of counters but no good signage or direction system just guiding by the staffs (seems higher level), specially I noticed a male who is short fat guy is the guiding staff, but he was talking with the mobile phones, then walking around and just walk away to the back office in sudden.  Why he came to guide us and ran away if he is too busy?  That is not a good service which Sheraton should be  2 / there have a lot of lanes, but the mainland Chinese always jumping the queue or just go directly to the counters from the exit area, but no security guards force them to lane back.  So, what is the meaning that I wait so long for lining up?  3 / The front desk staff assist me to do the check‚Ä¶",10
"I have stayed at other hotels in Macau before and I can say that this is one of the best hotel stay with nice environment.   The hotel staff are courteous and well equipped with knowledge. They are able to advise you well on things especially on places of interest and transport options.  I was also there for my birthday celebration and the staff was nice enough to notice it and wishes me a Happy Birthday. A birthday cake was also presented together with a hand written birthday card. The hand written birthday card impressed me the most as most of the hotel would have just printed the greetings with a simple sign off, so thumbs up for the personalised service.    There is no special queue for SPG members when i check in which I wonder why (as usually there is for other sheraton‚Ä¶",50
"this is a very nice hotel, clean rooms and good staff with limited English but they get the messages. the great thing about the location is the coati central set up, with 4 hotels all joined and having all the shopping and restaurants under one roof , the Venetian is also across the road but with a walkway attached, which was handy when it didn't stop raining for 3 days. Also all the free shuttle buses are great to get around town, DO NOT get conned with a private taxi at the ferry terminal like we did ",40
"Now we all know that Macau/HK people are comparatively rude compared to the rest of the world but I would never expect that the staff in a 5-star hotel are the same. I am talking about the staff stationed at the entrance to the lifts (those who check your hotel key-cards).  The manner in which they spoke to you made it seem like you were passing through a security check-point (gave off a vibe that made you feel as if you were someone trying to sneak through the security into a hotel that you could not afford). To top it all off, no smiles, no 'good mornings, good evenings'. Heck, even staff in budget hotels know very well that those are the basics in the hospitality industry.  While I have no problems with the rest of the hotel, this one blemish is enough to warrant an 'average‚Ä¶",30
"The location is fantastic. It's a bridge away from the Venetian, a block away from City of dreams and 5 min bus ride to the airport or ferry. We were upgraded to a suite on a high floor. The room was enormous and so was the bath room. All very clean but lacky a bit of class.   We used the room service for breakfast. It was excellent and really fast (less than 15 min).   The hotel is part of a complex of towers that are side by side, which means the vast majority of rooms are actually facing another tower. It makes for not so nice views.   The casino floor is really nice but not that sizable. For those who have access to the SPG lounge, it is very nice and really one of the larger ones I have seen. It also has the convenience of having outdoor area.",50
"Checked in at 12pm, concierge staff Mariana was extremely friendly and gave us free room upgrade plus late check-out. She also went over details with us very diligently. Room is very quiet, clean, and comfortable. Internet is also free with wifi service. Will definitely stay again in the future if we visit Macau. (The only downside being that the front desk baggage claim staff aren't so friendly and are really slow, but still acceptable).............................................................",50
"Staff was helpfull and special thanks for the lounge personnel. Didn't get a late check-out due to labour day, which is kind of understandable.  Low ceiling even on the executive suite and that's maybe the most annoying thing. Lounge area was large and mostly comfortable. Ok, if you don't mind children running around.",40
How we wish we hadn‚Äôt booked our return ticket! I would have extended my stay at this magnificent hotel which is even bigger than the Venetian!!It is a 3 minute walk to the Venetian so stay here and wander around there. It is in Sands where all the entertainment and hotels to look at are located. We were upgraded from a Club room to a suit and we were blown away by the room and a birthday cake for my husband birthday. Simply magical. There are 3 swimming pool zone areas-one had 17 small swimming pools. We nearly fainted when we went for the Club Lounge for cocktails at 5. Instead of light snacks and refreshments it was a full buffet-which meant we could have dinner and hop with our 4 year old back to HK on the ferry. The biggest regret was spending only a night in this hotel.‚Ä¶,50
"On Holiday with 10 school friends for 2 days. Hotel is well located and everything about it is what you expect from Sheraton. Rooms are standard size rooms (I was expecting bigger rooms like the Venetian). Check in was easy and overall a good hotel.  It has a good size Casino but it‚Äôs not the same as playing in Vegas. Crowd is too serious, they do not server alcohol if you are playing and you need to buy it. They offer milk, tea and coffee only which is ridiculous. Other thing is minimum bet is generally RMB 500/US$80 (which is really expensive and if you are lucky you will find a RMB 300 table which will always be packed). However this is not the issue with Sheraton but most casino‚Äôs in Macau.   However Macau is a GREAT place to party.",40
"a very large hotel in a casino as are all the hotels on this island. Very clean, great service and the buffets are good value.  I think the hotel is good value for money- too bad its is part of a very large, busy and noisy casino!",40
"We made a spontaneous visit from Hong Kong during the Buddhist's Birthday holiday. This was our 3rd time staying in this Sheraton but we left with great disappointment.  Upon arrival, we noticed that the priority check in area for SPG members are already closed, so we had to queue up for quite a while at the reception. The staff was pretty slow and their English level was far from the proper standard. As a loyal member, we didn't feel welcome at all as there were no special greetings and offer etc. The staff started asking us questions like one bed or two beds, smoking or non smoking, higher or lower floor - I told him I already listed all my requests in my booking and it was shown in my member profile. This is ridiculous!  Then my issue with them was - since I made the booking‚Ä¶",20
"A nice hotel to stay in. In comparison with other hotel, it is not that expensive. However, under the standard of casino hotel, it is not as good as you expect. The room is in a okay size. If you expect to see a big room in this casino hotel like the one in Vegas, you might be a little bit disappointed. But the bathroom is big, though, which you can enjoy very much. The weak point of Sheraton is that it is in the extremity of the cotai central, and far away from city of dreams and Venetian. As a result, you have to walk a long distance to go to other casino. Even though you just want to do some shopping in cotai central, you have to walk through the big casino and the check in counter, which is a little exhausted. Another disadvantage is that you have to wait in a extremely long‚Ä¶",40
"It was my second time staying in Sheraton Macao Cotai Central, and it has been by far the best, I have experienced both the Earth Tower and this time the Sky Tower, the staff were extremely helpful especially Bruno Miguel and Luciana. They ensured that the check-in and check-out went extremely smoothly. In between the welcoming and farewell, They recommended the most fascinating places as well as current festival and events. Because of them we found out about the annual wine and dine festival, the new restaurants, the new shopping venues and the upcoming Starwood Hotels in Macao. The room was extraordinary & incredibly comfortable and we were pleasantly surprised with the upgrade they provided. Also, don't forget to check-out the pool side which is excellent for lounging around‚Ä¶",50
"We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in mid-April.  First impression, it looked pretty good however that quickly deteriorated by the time we got to the desk.  I understand that I am in China - not back here in the US but the communication issue is so frustrating.  For a brand that I believe (pls correct me if I'm wrong) is based in the US, I would expect at least one person in the desk all the time that speaks fluent English. (This was an issue with the rest of our stay here). The next day - we had better luck asking for directions from the concierge  on one of the other hotels (Holiday Inn?) that is adjoined with this one.  The accomodations were pretty good.

"I will start my review arriving in Macau, wow that was an experience ! Immigration was so slack that I still have my embankment card in my wallet as no one collected it or checked as we came through from Australia! We were confused as signage was poor or in Chinese which we can't read as to where to get our bags, could not find anyone who spoke enough English to help. Finally got our bags and went to find the shuttle to the Sheraton . Again we had no idea as other hotels had people with signs at the airport but not Sheraton. It was actually a tour guide from Whyn hotel who showed us how to get to the shuttle. Once there we had the rudest and most unhelpful driver I have ever come across who just pointed and grunted at us. We arrived at reception and got checked in and shown to‚Ä¶",30

The door man of the Earth Tower doesn't know where the Conceirge is!!  The bell boy who store our luggage after we check out doesn't know the shuttle schedule.

My wife and I stayed for two nights at the Sheraton Macau and enjoyed it immensely. The staff is very friendly and efficient and although the line was long at check-in it went fairly quickly because they had a large number of people working. It would be nice to have an express check-out available but it is a minor annoyance. The club lounge was convenient and the food good although some of the items weren't as hot as they should have been. The service staff was very good. The rooms were very comfortable and very clean. My biggest complaint was the inability to enforce the non-smoking rules in the hotel. We were on a non-smoking floor and saw other guests smoking in the hallway and saw cigarette butts put out on the floor near the elevators. With all those cameras it shouldn't be‚Ä¶,50

"We were shuttled from Macau ferry terminal in their very recognisable bus/coach, dropped off what seemed to be the back entrance and was checked in pretty fast, for our 2 nites stay. It pays to be a SPG member, getting priority at the check in desk, else there was a reasonably long queue. We realised later it was also a secondary check in area, the more impressive main check in obviously at the front of the hotel.  Apparently there are 2 towers, Earth & Sky. We got the Earth, and was a long walk to the elevators, essentially circumventing the centrally located casino. It can be confusing as was the case with another guest trying to access our door with her key card claiming the same room number.

I have had long stays at stays at Sheraton Hong Kong,  sometimes up to almost a year at a stretch. I used to greatly enjoy the hospitality and efficiency of the staff and the quality of the rooms and other services.   So it was a shocking experience in Macau Sheraton. Though the staff try their best to look courteous and attentive, there seems an air of utter chaos every where.   The moment you enter the main lobby, you are lost in the sea of people and the chatter and clatter reminds you of some over crowded flea market. Chaos seems to prevail everywhere and in everything you want to do.  I  Maybe it's because of the large number Chinese mainland tourists??  No I don't think‚Ä¶",20

Upon entering room, no room slippers, one table lamp and two ceiling light bulbs blown, no bar soap. Nice coffee provided but no fresh milk capsule - only creamer which really spoilt the drink. This should not be a 5 star standard. Leave message on table on above so that housekeeping can do the needful but too bad the staff cannot read English and message was left unattended. Also after cleaning room no bath mat and no refill for shower gel. Need to call and request staff to bring. Typically there is no supervision to ensure everything is properly in place. This is really shameful!",30
"Stayed 4 nights in a deluxe king bedroom.  Arrived by ferry from Hong Kong and took the shuttle bus from Macau ferry terminal to the hotel. Disappointed that we have to load and unload our baggages onto the shuttle bus on our own; the hotel staff at both the ferry terminal and at the hotel did not help us with that. Worse still, hotel staff didn't even bother to help open the doors as they stand to watch guests struggling to open the doors themselves while handling their baggages.  Service wasn't good as well during check-in. As I am a SPG member, I took the SPG priority queue lane and was the first in the line. However, the receiptions kept serving guests from the normal queue lane and noone attended to me in the SPG lane. There was also no counter specially reserved to serve‚Ä¶",40

From the luxury stores, easy access to other hotels, shuttle bus service to anywhere you could imagine - this was our favourite destination among the 4 cities on this trip (Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Macau).    Rooms are nice but look a little dated to Macau standards and relative to the common area.  Not smoky whatsoever.    Other reviewers weren't kidding when they said that this is a VERY large hotel - we wasted a lot of time walking back/forth confused where we were relative to the place we wanted to get to (ex.

"I was told that this is Sheraton biggest hotel property in the world with 6000+ rooms! This place is huge but soulless. I don't feel like a hotel guest but a shopper in a huge shopping mall with casino. The room is spacious but of standard design. I hardly get to interact with hotel staff at main lobby and concierge because they are located so far from my Sky Tower room. Due to too many hotel guests, one can do an express check out by dropping the room card into a box at lift lobby. As a result, hardly any chance for human interaction. As a SPG, the hotel offers a room wifi service at MOP 30. I won't recommend purchasing any wifi service because the connection kept dropping and the speed, well... there was hardy any speed I guess... Compared to Galaxy Hotel, free shuttle bus‚Ä¶",30

There are multiple small outdoor swimming pools and they heat up 2 smaller ones during cold weather. But if you want a spectacular pool, better book the Okura for their massive wave pool.

Given that this was peak season, Sheraton was one of the better value 5 star hotels. However I felt that compared to other hotels along the cots strip (which then is another discussion whether it is better to stay here or stay at Macau city), Sheraton may not be the be the hotel that makes you feel most proud.  There are hotels like Venetian and Galaxy that are much grander and where the shuttle bus terminal is available. Of course one pays for it.

While the other hotels had clearly marked buses, Sheraton had a print out of their logo on a piece of paper mounted under the steering wheel. Suffice to say it took us some time to find that one bus among the dozens randomly parked.

The same applies for getting to Macau by Ferry from HK: when you arrive at the main ferry terminal (Macau Maritime), just hop into a Taxi or take one of the many hotel buses. The Taipa ferry terminal is obviously closer, but fewer ferries go there and you might get stuck in the masses of tourists. There are also less taxis available at Taipa ferry terminal.

Over 3200 rooms or so, but the service is overall very good and attentive. The executive lounge is more of a restaurant with a vast choice of food.  The Hotel is part of the Cotai complex which includes 2 other hotels, casinos as well as shopping malls. The hotel has a shuttle bus to a bus station where a bus takes you to down town..there you only need a few hours and all the sights are done. A hotel which is very large, but well organized and has a good design overall.",40
"Nice hotel with the usual 5 star facilities ... the takeaway for us was the very friendly and helpful staff. We were on the 33rd floor so had a great view from our room.  Connected internally to the Venetian, Sands and a couple of other hotels makes it very convenient to move around from one hotel/casino to the other.   We saw long queues at the check-in counters, which we were fortunate to avoid being SPG members, so we breezed through the special check-in area for members.  Fabulous breakfast spread - dont miss it.",40
"We enjoyed our stay at Sheraton Macau, it is certainly one of the best sheratons we've stayed in, I presume it's still quite new. The rooms are well appointed with a lovely style, helpful staff and an expansive breakfast. We opted for a package deal which included wifi, tea to take home and also high tea in their palms cafe which really added to the experience. The hotel package also included a one way transfer departure by ferry to Hong Kong with Cotai Jet (Taipa ferry terminal), be mindful that there are two ferry terminals and the terminal with more frequent ferries (especially to HK airport) is Macau ferry terminal.   The food within the complex was of a surprisingly high quality as well, we ate at Dynasty 8 and Edo, both were good.   The hotel was conveniently connected by‚Ä¶",50
Wonderful check-in staff from SPG dedicated check in lobby. The rooms are clean and well-maintained. Security screening before entering lift lobby offers added peace of mind. The shared premises with 3 hotels offers shuttle bus services to the ferry terminal and Galaxy hotel and its Venetian is within walking distance. I have stayed there a couple of times and find Sheraton ahead of the stiff competition from the rest of the established hotels and recommend others to experience their stay there.,50
"The Sheraton Macua on the Cotai strip is fantastic and the largest Sheraton in the world!  I decided Thursday morning to escape Shenzhen noise for a few nights.  I made the reservation through SPG for a very good rate of 1300 HKG and then read some notes that there was some reno going on so I emailed the hotel and asked that they do their best to keep me away from nosier elevator lobbies, be on higher floors and as far from the reno as possible.  They wrote back‚Ä¶‚Äùno problem, we have you in the EARTH Tower where there is no reno‚Ä¶and we have upgraded your room!‚Äù  As usual, the room, bath, bath products, bedding were great.  There is an ipod docking station that will play your music, plenty of free water, a mini bar, slippers, robes, a safe, iron‚Ä¶.Quiet, quiet, quiet!  Awwwwwww! ‚Ä¶",50
"We were awaken in the morning (that too after a late night sleep) by continuous attempt of opening our door even when the DO NOT DISTURB was turned on (we guess they could not ring the bell as DND was on). We were too annoyed by the noise and opened the door to find out some random guests thought that it was their room. Mistakes happen, so no big deal. However, what we could not believe is that they were accompanied by a hotel staff who took them to our room not realising their room was in other tower. Not only the staff did not check their room number but also he did not respect any value for our privacy (neither the red light for DND on our door bell). How pity!",10
My girlfriend and I stayed here for our one night in Macao to experience the casino atmosphere.  Unbeknown to us this hotel is combined with several others all under one roof and is linked to The Venetian across the road via a flyover walkway. The hotel is designed so that you never need to leave the complex which is fine but not what we were looking for. The gambling arena and shopping facilities at The Venetian are pretty good but I felt that we were on the outskirts of the action. We got a cab to the MGM grand at night and visited The Wynn and The Grand Lisboa. This seemed much more central and where the action was at.  Notwithstanding the above the rooms were very nice and the hotel itself fine enough with plenty of good eateries to choose from. There was also a free shuttle‚Ä¶,30
"Honestly, the hotel was perfectly fine. Its Sheraton so you can't complain. The room was perfectly clean the staff were more than pleasant. 1 downer was the cattle line up at reception. Its a busy hotel with lots of people trying to push in so it's maybe the best way to handle it. In other words not Sheratons fault, but more of the guest Macao attracts. Don't get me started on Macao. We were expecting Vegas, i.e. an entertainment destination. WRONG. Macao is definitely NOT an entertainment destination. Every time you go down stairs you can literally feel the great vacuum of energy sucking the life out of the people mindlessly gambling the family's fortune away. I can see why the mainland Gvt has clamped down on issuing visas to Macao. Good on them. No one laughs or screams with‚Ä¶",40
"We ordered and extra bed and blankets for our room. Someone came in 20 minutes and brought the blankets but no bed. When we called the front desk and asked where the bed was they said we first needed to pay at the front desk. They could not just charge the room. When we wanted to use the internet...same story, come to the front desk and pay for it first. When we wanted to have a coke from the mini bar it was locked. Guess what they said?? Come to the front desk first to pay for it first. All the food was high priced Asian crap except for Bene. The problem with Bene was the hair I found. ",10
"Spent a long time deciding on a hotel to stay in for a birthday treat for my husband. Have just returned form Macau and had a great time at the Sheraton! Checkin for  a family of 5  was very smooth by Sri. The rooms were large clean and the bed was top class! The staff were on call watching and automatically there for any queries or needs. The shuttle bus to others hotels or the old town regular and a bonus. If there was a downside it was that the pool wasn't heated and only one pool open, and couldn't find a brochure in hotel room of spa menu otherwise might have gone. But would recommend very much ...also this hotel is not at all smoky which I had heard was a problem in Macau!!! Will use the sheraton group again!!",40
"To start with: while the rooms are nice, the location is just wrong. Construction sides all around, and a rather poor casino in the complex. Rather recommend to stay in Galaxy (much nicer inside) or better stay on Macau side which is more authentic and less clinical. If you go for Sheraton, upgrade to a lounge room, the premium is worth it. ",30
"Whereas the room itself was fairly modern and tidy, got few points to note -  1) There are areas in the pool side which are full of exhaust gas smell from the adjacent kitchen(?), which brings cooked burned oil smell in the pool area. Fairly unpleasant - we ended up changing our seats twice before found a spot where there is no ventilation noise or smell. Just poor design really.  2) It was a slow service to order food to pool area, drinks took borderline 15minutes and pool snacks about 40 minutes. Suggest bring your own drinks & snacks.. easier. There's a McDonalds nearby :)  3) Wi-Fi connection non-existent to poor - tried and tested in the room and also on the pool side. Perhaps cable connection is better (provided in the room too).  4) Overflow of rubbish along the hotel‚Ä¶",20
Free shuttle bus from the ferry. Easy check-in. Very helpful staff. Room large and very clean - also surprisingly very quiet. Nice selection of restaurants within the hotel complex. Easy walk to the Venetian hotel - also frequent free bus connections to other casinos.,50
"Being a platinum lifetime member in this club , I would probably reckon that this is the warmest service group I have encountered in the many hotel clubs I have visited . Your staff is one of the most professional, thorough, and courteous groups I‚Äôve encountered with.  Especially the club lounge Manager, Myn she has demonstrated a compelling desire to follow up with detailed information, and even my most seemingly pedantic requests have been noted and incorporated into it. On top of her performance, her stuffs are  outgoing, friendly, and thorough. This is, for me, the mark of a truly service-minded operation and  and I can‚Äôt think of a single negative.  I look forward to visiting again.‚Äù",50
Sheraton was the fourth hotel in Macau that we visited since December 2012 and I must say that this hotel was a surprise to me. I wasn't expecting so much except to have a relaxing weekend but everything was so perfect. We were allowed to check-in early (130pm) and check-out at late (1pm the following day). Our guest service agent was Alrie Rocamora who greeted and attended to us immediately when we entered the Lounge. He was very efficient and friendly and he made it a point to explain what we need to know during our stay in the hotel. Our room was beautiful and modern and we were upgraded to a Cotai View (what more can i ask for?). One of the best things in this hotel is the access to the Sheraton Lounge.  The package that we booked consisted of an Afternoon Snacks from‚Ä¶,50
"Such an amazing hotel! They say it is the biggest Sheraton in the world and definitely it is so! I almost got lost. Plenty of palms, flowers inside, waterfalls, just must see. Even if you visit the hotel for the gaming, you should take 10 minutes to go around and get the emotion! Very nice room, cozy and comfortable, all amenities as needed. Loved it, very much!",50
"Went on an overnight trip to Macau from Hong Kong, most hotels we rang were fully booked or expensive.  Sheraton was cheaper but believe me was very good value for money.  The hotel is indeed very good.  If you book though would be better to book through Starwood.  Receptionist at hotel had poor English but she did apologise.  Therefore took 25 min on roaming mobile phone (hopefully they improve).  Hotel check-in and check-out is excellent although general check-in had a bit of a queue.  We had club room and this was very good value for money and you can check-in and check-out seperately (although did we didn't know this when we checked in).  The hotel is part of a shopping centre and casino which has a good vibe.  The rooms are and the hotel is VERY spacious.  Can get lost but‚Ä¶",40
I have been to Macao for business conference and got a chance to stay in Shreaton Cotai Central. Checkin formality was managed by our company event management team hence that was okay.  Pro: Rooms are good with all the basic facility provided within the room. / Size of the room is also big enough good space. / Bathroom is also very big and good. Cons: Staff is not well aware on the English. / Almost no option for Vegi like me. / Very difficult to get in to room being a very big hotel and confusing ways. Do think twice before visiting with family. be ready to walk a lot within the hotel itself.   Overall its a mix experience to me. did not find cool feeling.,30
"This might have been because the hotel is just so brand new, but everything about the decor and the layout of the hotel gave off a great vibe.  The only complaint one might have is that most of the restaurants were a little bit expensive and all bunched in one location, and they really dont have the notable restaurants that other hotels have already such as the Venetian.     The rooms were great, worthy of 4.5 star class.  We were put on a very high floor, so the view of the strip was awesome.  It's really got a lot of gambling action on its own, but if you need more you can always head to the venetian just a short walk aways.    Dont miss out on this hotel!",50
"With the Sheraton name you expect a little more from a Casino resort. As soon as you walk in the hotel is confusing. The SPG check in area has no ramp access from the front so if you have alot of luggage that's going to be an inconvenience. The woman at the check in counter lost our initial reservation and tried to make up for it by offering free wifi. In reality my entire hotel floor has free wifi. Laptop connection is just fine however, it will kick you off after 5 min for inactivity on a wireless device fyi. I would have rather paid for  my own access to avoid this. Felt like a cheap ploy from the receptionist to offer free wifi when in reality it's free. Rooms are nice and the pool is great. I've only eaten the buffet breakfast so far and it was pretty good. Just plan to‚Ä¶",30
"Everything was 5 star quality but there wasn't really much ""wow"" about it.  Reception: Everything standard - Porters to take our bags to reception, no queues, friendly staff who spoke fluent English and could answer every question we had. Check out was equally as efficient.  Rooms: Quite far away from the reception as it is such a large hotel and only certain lifts go to certain floors, but there are staff to direct you. Actual rooms nicely decorated, a fair sized, quiet, two queen beds (for a twin room) which were comfortable. Bathroom was a good size, clean, and with everything you would expect, including scales. The only small negative I would say is the shower only had one water pressure.  Hotel in general: It was a large hotel with a small Casino, but is walking distance to‚Ä¶",50
"We stayed in a normal room with our infant son. It was the weekend and the Rolling Stones were in town so you can imagine most people came and stayed for a night or two.  It's a huge complex within the hotel and the connecting shopping mall.  You can literally stay in the complex without having to go outside.  With that said, the service was good in relations to the hotel size. There were many people  around and the restaurant lines can be long, especially for breakfast.  Overall, it's a typical Sheraton hotel with good service and quality.",40
"Really like the room and spacious bathroom interior. A slight oversight by the hotel when the hotel amenities were prepared for two guests while we booked the room meant for three. This was promptly rectified when the hotel staff delivered the missing things after making one phone call.  Location wise, it's a short walk to Venetian and City of Dreams with frequent shuttle service to Macau Taipa Temporary Ferry Terminal.  There might be a queue for check-in but the waiting time was short.  Free wifi was available at the lobby but you had to join the crowd who were there for the same purpose and bear with the smell of the cigarettes from the casino.",40
"To be completely honest, the hotel was great and I really don't have anything to complain about other than perhaps it's sheer size. I guess there is such a thing as too big for a hotel and when a hotel gets this big, somehow it makes one feels like an item in a factory production line. I know this is all subjective and it's up to personal preference & judgement of course.  Now, to it's defence, despite it's size, it's trying hard to impress and it's noticeable. I checked in for one night with my elderly parents and this was taken notice by one of the many lobby staff. They quickly ushered my parents to the sitting area in the Preferred Starwood Member section which was less crowded and offered a more personalised service. Mind you it didn't matter to them that I was not a member‚Ä¶",40

We could not believe our eyes when the the free shuttle bus had collected us from the Ferry station and pulled up outside the hotel!!! We walked through the doors and thought... ""This is a shopping complex, what are we doing here?"", but then we were directed to the checking desk and we realized...this is no shopping center is the Hotel Sheraton resort... and EVERY GIRL'S DREAM!!!   Have you ever imagined being locked in a shopping complex by mistake over night, well you will get that experience here, except you have not been mistaken lock in, but have checked in to stay here.

"We stayed for 4 nights. We enjoyed our stay. Very comfortable rooms. Lovely large bathrooms. We requested a room with Cotai view which looked great at night. Only issue our room was at the end of a long hall from the lifts. We had 2 beds in our room as requested to accommodate 3. We had room service one evening and enjoyed our meals. We chose not to have breakfast with our accommodation, but did go to one themed breakfast (see below). Instead we got McDonalds in the shopping area at ground level or ate at he food court in the Venetian - lots of variety. The poker machines at the venue were ok. Nothing spectacular really, older machines in smoking room. There is free water bottles in all gaming room/areas everywhere in Macau. We were one of few to use one of the many pools where‚Ä¶",40

And for my any requests and questions. He had patient to explain to me and help me a lot.",50
"Biggest Sheraton in the world and it doesn't dissapoint! The place is massive with a few check-in/check-out desks, easy to get lost in the lifts (make sure you remember what tower you're in!). Had a room that faced the back so view wasn't great and the room itself was standard but huge in comparison to other Sheraton's! Very clean, great pool on the 4th floor (would have loved to see the one on the 8th floor but it was closed) and staff were very nice and patient especially concierge considering I had no clue where anything was and they helped me figure out which shuttle busses go where! Close to the Venetian and all the amazing casinos so overall great place to stay in Macau! If you want to experience a quiet dinner away from the lights just head to Taipa village in Cotai, nice‚Ä¶",40
"This isn't so much about the hotel as the area in general. Our tour company booked us into what is billed as ""the biggest Sheraton in the world"" with something like 3,880 rooms (yep). The hotel is spic-and-span new but its hugeness is overwhelming. A one-night stay saw a lot of time spent trying to find the right lobby (several of them) and the right bank of elevators. Our room was utilitarian compared to other five-star hotels. The breakfast buffet (included) was the best feature, we felt. This Sheraton is located on Cotai Island, a section of Macao under international mega-development as a clone of Las Vegas, lots of construction going on, themed ""City of Dreams."" Right: it's far from the historic centre of a very interesting city, with no local neighbourhoods to explore, or‚Ä¶",30
"Its quite a big hotel at excellent location. We got the higher floor as requested. Rooms were well maintained and view from room was amazing. The hotel provides pickup and drop from airport/ferry station which was good. The Hotel is opposite to Venetian. Also is 3 min walk from City of Dreams. Staff was helpful with queries but were no bell-boy/porters to carry luggage to the room. We took our luggage by ourselves which was quite inconvenient. Otherwise, it was a great stay.",40

Very clean and just spotless. Even though there are nearly 4000 rooms, the elevator was very fast and never crowded. Breakfast in Club lounge was included, and there's a great selection of hot and cold/western and eastern food.  Gambling: the Venetian is a short 5 minutes walk across the ""indoor"" walking bridge. City of Dreams and Hard Rock Hotel are also within walking distance. The casino in Sheraton is less chaotic and crowded than the Venetian.

The Venetian is a 3 minute covered walk from the Sheraton, and they have a great show every night for the kids to watch.  Food choices are limitless - both Western and Asian.  3 hotels are connected together - the Venetian, Four Seasons and the Sheraton.

Gotta love it all ;)",50
"Second time to stay here. Lovely stay, spacious, clean and up to standard! Compared with holiday inn next to it, more quiet, private and comfortable. They were also nice to extend our check out time to 1pm. Don't forget to check with the hotel for shuttle buses to major points as it will save you lots of money on taxi and the time waiting for taxis.",50
"Room is comfortable. We arrived on monday afternoon, the check in line was kind of long. Fortunately, I registered for as preferred guest before the arrival. I took the advantage of a shorter line specifically for the preferred guests. There's really nothing special about the hotel compare to others around the area. The shuttle buses only go to the piers, border, and Galaxy hotel. So, if you want to go to the Old City or City center, you need to transit at Galaxy. The bus stops are located in different entrances. If you're not sure where you want to go, make up your mind first before you look for the shuttle buses. Very inconvenient. They also charge for Wifi, $30/hr. There is no connection in the lobby also.It's really not acceptable in today's standard.",40
"I made an excellent choice. The hotel is more reasonably priced then the Venetian and Galaxy and Conrad, but the standard is excellent, on par with these hotels, and it is all interconnected...you can travel to any of the above hotels thru an indoor mall and interconnected walkways.

The rooms are luxurious , service is efficient and a good experience.",40

It is also right opposite the Venetian Macau which makes sight-seeing worthwhile.  It is the largest Sheraton in the world and has two towers - Sky Tower and Earth Tower.

It just keeps getting better so we continue to come back.  The rooms manager Alessandro upgraded my family of 4 to the best suite with 2 bedrooms, a media room and kitchen area.

They really know how to look after families here and everywhere you go within the hotel the kids are spoilt by the staff.  The room was furnished so beautifully and the bathrooms came with Ferragamo toiletries.  The Chief butler‚Ä¶",50
"To start, accessibility to the hotel is amazingly convenient and free (shuttles galore servicing the hotels)! Sheraton Macau is a part of the Sands Cotai Complex which houses several hotels, shopping malls, restaurants, food courts and casinos - leaving us spoilt for choice be it for food or shopping.   We stayed at the Deluxe Suite, which is spacious in size with great amenities and superb service. The housekeeping team is highly commendable for their pro-activeness and eyes for details. There is an issue to note about the bathroom, the floor could be quite a slippery trap during shower, thus we used the bedroom slippers for firmer grip.   Breakfast at the club lounge is good, although a more varied food choices over the days would be better. Great service from the staff‚Ä¶",50
"We stayed at the Sheraton Macau for 2 nights for my husband's birthday.  On arrival we were upgraded to a suite by Sukendran Kulasekaran the front office manager who was fantastic and very friendly.  The room itself was huge, and very clean.  We especially liked the TV room (being 6 months pregnant in Macau this was a good thing!)  The club lounge is the best I have been to in all of my travels with huge food and drink selections.  Overall we had a great stay, this was our 3rd visit and I know we will be back.",50
"To start with, you'll get  lots of yellow buses to take you to this hotel from every entry point to Macau. The hotel itself is a part of the Sands Cotai Central Complex which houses several other hotels, shopping malls, food court, casinos. It occupies the middle and the right most towers in Cotai Central and is diagonally opposite to the famous Venetian Macau. There is a foot bridge across the road, which directly connects Cotai Central to Venetian Macau for your convenience. The rooms are really large and lavishly decorated with huge bathrooms. Our room on the 16th floor had a great view of the Venetian Macau. Dining options are endless and suits all budgets.",50
"If you are a regular traveller used to staying in western 5* hotels, this hotel is everything you would expect- spotlessly clean, great amenities (best gym in any hotel we have experienced) , great choice of restaurants and great service.   One tip, if you have the ability to visit mid week, do so, as crowds double over the weekend.   You can get anywhere in Macau using courtesy coaches from the Sheraton or other hotels within 5 min walking distance.   ",50
"We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in March and were impressed by good quality service and nice rooms. Nothing luxurious, but clean and spacious, with nice bathrooms and a good selection of TV channels. The hotel itself is very big, with lots of amenities, shops, restaurants and, obviously, casino. Breakfast is ok, though nothing spectacular. Overall, thanks for the great stay, will certainly consider staying again.",50
"We used our SPG reward point for our 2 day stay in Macau. Located in the famous Cotai strip it is  most conveniently located within the cluster of all other hotels like Venetian, Hard Rock hotel etc. We had a junior suite to ourselves , super luxurious and comfortable.  Decent spread at breakfast in lounge and in case you don't have access to lounge there is a food court and good number of restaurants located within the complex.  Ofcorse the biggest attraction point is Casino there are two on the ground level and if you are the gambling variety there are plenty of high end shopping experience, either way you will end up spending money :)",40
Hotel in a good location with large rooms and bathrooms.Only problem we had was when we checked into room it smelt of perspiration and had to be sprayed.Club lounge was one of the best I have been in and spa and pool facilities excellent.  Definitly would return to Hotel,40
"This is the third time i stay in this hotel. The room is still very good, spacious and  make me feel relaxed and comfortable. However two of my friends room card didn't work when we come back to the room after having our breakfast downstairs. We called to the front desk for help and we wait for the staff for 15 mins to open our room which had not been check out. This is our first time we experienced this bad situation in any hotel we visited.  Please ensure your room card system stable, not to bother your customers like that.  One of the staff in the express check out counter is not very helpful, i forget her name,  but her attitude is really bad, make me a bit angry. this kind of staff cannot be found in any service industry.",30
"I really like this hotel. I have stayed here many times since opening.  Great gym, very nice pool's  Good spa Facilities  But the room service choice is very limited especially in relation to western choices and quality  Simple things like no club sandwich or standard hotel room service things like steak or chicken Been like this for over a year and always frustrates me when I visit  Also currently some construction taking place on the higher floors",30
"Having had the chance to stay again at this wonderful hotel it must be finally mentioned that not only the hotel accomodation and comodities are very good, moreover the people which are treating guests exceptionally well .... During my recent stay in February especially Domingos at the concierge and Daniel at the bell counter were standing out but also the rest of the guys there did a very good job. Both highlighting an overall perfect organised team taking care being very friendly and helpful with organising any kind of transportations and other useful needs.",50
"My family and I stayed at the hotel last February 28 - March 3, 2014. It was actually my first time to visit Macau. However, the hotel staff never made us feel lost as they patiently answered all our direction inquiries. They even provided us with a map and the business card of the hotel for our reference. Furthermore, their (free) photobooth corners were really nice and a great way to provide their guests a remembrance from the hotel. Staff were very friendly and accommodating and their rooms are very clean. The beds are very comfortable, aircon easy to control and the bathrooms are just EXCELLENT. If given a chance to go back to Macau, I wouldn't mind staying in the same hotel. =)",50
"First and foremost the locat"" on of the hotel is so peaceful and convenient which makes it more rejuvenating. The food is awesome specially being an indian its when you get to have poha and indian breakfast thats makes your day, i must appriciate they have taken care well in all the terms. It is located in a strip along with two other hotels which connects eachother and gives you a feel of comfort with all shopping stores and"" restaurant inside it. I loved the food at the italian restaurant ""Bene"" specially the mocktail ""raspberry mojito"".  The hotel rooms are spacious with an awesome view. They have a Inhouse casino whicu will make you feel so damn lazy to step out the hotel :D  Above all i would definitely suggest and recommend a stay with family and friends.",50
"Excellent service, friendly and genuinely caring staff..as for bathroom amenities maybe they should consider having  his and hers body soaps and shampoos...breakfast buffet was great... would definitely stay here again...",50
We had a 3 nights stay at Sheraton. The staffs was great and friendly. Room is spacious but a little disappointed on the carpet floor in the room. I have a baby crawling. Her clothing having black stains after crawl. I already had informed earlier in my reservation that I have a baby staying with me. Other than this our stays are great. ,40
The service of SPG counter was excellent. The hotel room is spacious. The gym and swimming facilities are good too. The iPod player was good too but it would be excellent if adaptor for use of iPhone 5 or ipad air will be excellent. Will stay here again for my next macau trip,40
"This is the second time I stayed with Sheraton Macao Hotel. The check in process took less than 10 minutes. The check in officer was efficient and friendly. The interior of the room is also superb. WiFi is not free. If you are not into gambling there are retail shops located inside the hotel (Gucci, Bottega Veneta, Ralph Lauren, and Rolex to name a few). There is a connecting bridge from the hotel to Four Seasons Hotel which made it even easier for you to cross to Venetian and Four Seasons.   But I was thoroughly disappointed with the concierge. I made several calls to guest service and asked to be connected to the concierge, In all those calls the concierge was busy and was not able to pick up the call. The guest service assured me that the concierge will call me back regarding‚Ä¶",40

"Travelling around, one gets used to the big chain hotels, and the small independent ones. Typically, I find the latter more flexible and personal, more genuine also in their approach to the client. I have been delighted, on two recent short trips to the Sheraton, to feel a personal touch that does approach the genuine, and this in a huge property, with many guests and - doubtless - many requests.  It's the little things that make the difference. The recognition of you when you come up to the desk to ask a trivial question about printing; the individual email - with a person who introduces herself at the hotel also - before arrival, to ask for any particular requests.  The main coffee shop is huge, but even there I was served coffee as I wanted it (fresh brewed, not just from the‚Ä¶",50
Lovely stay at the Sheraton Macau . Check in - check out was the smoothest ever .  Thank you to Lars Reyes - you are just amazing and Alrie Rocamora.   Superb service - great staff . Was our first time stay at Sheraton Macau and will not be our last for sure.    Convenient location - good food . We will be back .,50
"We took the ferry from Kowloon to Macau. At the terminal was a shuttle bus waiting which takes you straight to the hotel. Staff at the hotel were prompt and efficient and we did not have to wait for check in. The rooms are comfortable and large and had the usual Wifi, Safe etc. The hotel is located in a decent area opposite the Venetian and there is a walkway across the road to get there or you could spend a few hours wondering around the shops in the Cotai Strip. Breakfast at the Feast lounge was the typical hotel buffet and was very very busy everyday that we went, but with the number of guests at the hotel it's to be expected. No real criticisms of the hotel or the staff.",40
"If you wondering if Sheraton Cotai is value for your money.  Let me tell you, it's worth evey cents you pay and more.  Evertime I visit Macau be it alone or with friends, I would only stay at Sheraton Cotai . It's the establishment , the service and mostly the security that make me feel safe and able to wonder around alone.  It's convenient to move around, there also a good mix of restaruants within the hotel. No better way to describe how delighted I am after each stay so I says it's comfy to my soul.  Keep up the great work, Sheraton and look foward to visit soon.   Pipi  Singapore ",50
"Positive - easy and fast check-in (spg-prefered member lounge) - very comfortable soft bed - quiet room (3111 sky tower) - quality spa services (massages) - 4 blackjack tables (that is already a lot for Macau casinos) - very good location, next to Venetian and City of Dreams (Hardrock-Cafe, Cubic a.s.o.) - connected to Sands and Conrad (shopping, restaurants) - nice gym and good locker rooms (Sauna, Turkish bath)  Negative - work in progress next to the spa (sometimes loud) - late check-out not possible (only until 12pm)",50
"Very easy to get to the Hotel from the Airport, 5 mins maximum, but then the fun starts.  The check in desks (there are many) are accessed by a immigration style line queue, and all though they had about 8 desks open, it still takes an age to get to the desk.  Finally I make it, find out Im in the Earth tower, 21st floor.  You make your own way to the elevators, nobody carries your bag or guides you in the right direction and it would be quite easy to get lost, this place is massive.  Up to the room, very impressed, nice layout excellent bed, nice and quiet, all good so far.

"3 days in the lap of luxury. The rooms are large and well appointed. Huge king bed. The fitness centre is excellent as are the pools, and the SPG club lounge is stunning. Full breakfasts and dinner with drinks all part of the deal for either a club room, or by paying 650MOP per couple to use the facilities if in a normal room.  We used the buses to get around and there is a bus stop right outside to go to Coloane, and the other side of the road to head to the centre of Macao.  If you are into gambling you are in the middle of the casino and a short walk through shopping malls to get to the Venetian and other locations.   many restaurants to choose from either here, as part of the sands or at any of the near by hotels and casinos.",40
"Landed in Macau under cold weather 6¬∞C, we left Thailand at 31¬∞C, it was very surprised! Anyway on arrival, the shuttle bus took us to hotel. Sheraton Macau is huge especially lobby area, you have to queue up in line a bit to process your check in (like queue up in line to buy movie tickets but just for a minute). We've booked Deluxe Room with twin beds, and everything was just perfect! Comfy beds, great view overlooking The city of dreams and The Venetian Macau. In room full amenities and services.

For a person on vacation, he probably wouldn't need to step out of the hotel at all if he is there just for ""Mini Vegas"" but it is a long way of from the Centre of the city with all the forts, cathedrals.  The bus service provided by the hotel is excellent and complimentary, although you might need to change a bus or two to get to the city.

I had an extra night in Macau after a week of conferences in a nearby hotel. I must say on reception the concierge was very helpful through to check in. Lots of opportunity to shop and eat or if you want to look around there are some great sites such as the Venetian across the road ... A great central location and must stay location,40

Even though there was a queue but it moves VERY FAST compare to me.   The rooms that we had was in the Sky Tower 34th floor. The deco of the rooms ware very nicely designed and the rooms are very clean with all amenities that you may think of in the rooms.  The variety of the food in the Club Lounge was more than enough during breakfast but the happy hour was way above standard. Wifi is available in the rooms and also free in the public area.

Hotel in Macau are getting very expensive now day and this one is very new and everything is five stars. Apart from you will feel like you are in China more as everywhere you see China visitors. The bfast is very nice and lots of food selection and getting to other places are all connected with free shuttle buses. Casino are everywhere too. ,50
The checking by Ms Aida was great and pleasant. She was professional and friendly and took efforts to explain the facilities and shuttle services location which is a great help. She gave a advance birthday greetings and took special care of my stay. She's a star in her service. The rooms are good with comfortable bed.,50
"This is a lovely hotel well situated on the Cotai Strip. Pleasantly surprised to get an upgrade due to my 25th stay at an SPG hotel. The suite was enormous, clean and had two toilets. Very clean, excellent service. Ordered room service dinner and got a delightfully prepared meal exactly how I liked it.  Despite the rush and commotion at the hotel with hundreds of guests plus casino patrons, the staff were very polite, helpful, genuinely attentive and check-in and check-out was a breeze. The only downside was the rush for the breakfast - 8 AM onwards both restaurants are very crowded. I waited 15 minutes and then gave up as I had a meeting to attend. Next time will go for room service unless I can get to the restaurant by 7 AM. Apart from this - one of the best Sheratons!!",40
"Sheraton is located right in the Cotai Central complex which has a casino, mall for high end brands, restaurants, hotel conrad and holiday inn and which is across the street from The Venetian ( link by an indoor bridge and offers more varieties shops from high end, mid to local brands) the city of dreams, hard rock hotel, grand hyatt and four seasons.   The room is a standard sheraton, comfortable beds, nice linen, clean and hygienic. Considering they have almost 4000 rooms and been operating for the past 1.5 years, they are doing a good job in maintaining the rooms and public facilities with thousands of visitors per day for 24 hours. One thing that is not up to the standard is the lobby area and the corridors along the mall which heading to the guests room's lift are so‚Ä¶",40

Upgrade to the Club lounge it's good value. ",50
"This was our first overnight trip to Macau to attend the Rolling Stones concert.  We chose the Sheraton because it was so close to the concert venue and due to availability, quality and price.  This is apparently the largest Sheraton in the world and it showed in terms of the huge numbers of people in and around the hotel.  We took the shuttle bus from the Macau Ferry Terminal and were very impressed with how easy it was to get to the hotel and check in.  I'd booked through an online site and on arrival was informed that neither breakfast or WiFi was included in the booking, but that I could add this for a cost as an SPG member, which I did.  The place is HUGE, but the room we were given was very nice.  The hotel itself is part of a huge shopping complex that attaches 4-5 hotels‚Ä¶",30
"I have stayed at the Sheraton in Macau before and I have to say that even though they are the biggest Sheraton in the world I keep coming back because of the personalised service. From the limo collection at the Ferry, check-in in our suite to the friendly service in the restaurants. The suites are stunning and reasonably priced and nothing is overlooked. It is placed in a great lovation for Macau and it is walking distance from most major sights and from the major shows in Macau. Thanks to the team for making this a great stay.",50
"I have stayed in many new hotels in Macau and Sheraton Macao is probably the worst I have ever stayed.  Inattentive Staff I booked the hotel room and transportation through the travel agent in one go to save time and effort.  As I wanted to request for a non-smoking room with king-size bed, I wrote an email directly to Sheraton Macao.  In the email, I clearly informed the officer that I have already booked a room (with my personal particulars and date of stay) and would like to add a remark to my booking.  Sadly, the officer handled my email unconcernedly and gave me a room quotation instead.  I have never expected such heedless working attitude or poor language proficiency from Sheraton Staff.  New but not worth I regretted choosing Sheraton Macao instead of other big brand‚Ä¶",20

Absolutely halarious 'Shrekfast' featuring all the Dream works characters, they wonder around and have pictures taken with you, as well as perform a mini show on the stage at the front. The breakfast food wasn't the best, mixture of Asian and western cuisine. The breakfast room is immactuely themed - Fiona's Castle. Very well decorated indeed. The breakfast can be for any age - families, couples or the more mature aged group. So much fun.  After arranging in advance, the hotel also had our room ready on arrival.

Very good breakfast buffet spread. Noisy but expected at brekky time. Overall, a pleasant experience. Check out was hassel free. Good food. Good selection of wines at the bar. Direction to the Sky and Earth Towers can be better but did not pose a serious problem.",40

The lobby is massive and awe inspiring, you just cannot believe the sheer size of this hotel! However there were smiling faces all around and we felt welcomed immediately by the door people outside. I must say that the rather long q intimidated me initially but I quickly found out from the managers directing us out front that there was more than one check in location. The q moved quickly and I was checked in under 15 minutes. I must say that is impressive for such a large hotel. I was expecting longer wait but it worked out fine.

Since it has a lot of rooms, so the lobby is very busy without any 5 star hotel touch. The sound proof of the room is terrible.

In-room breakfasts were delivered at rapid speed by very friendly staff and our room was spacious and stylish with a walk-in shower and bath.

Bravo to the housekeeping team. The only issue and a fairly big concern was the shower. The shower was weird... The knob for the water temperature and the volume of water pressure is the same.

The rooms are standard Sheraton quality. The staff was very nice and friendly. The breakfast was actually really great.   You're in Macao so you're not likely to be spending much time in your room.

My little girl stayed in lot of hotels over the world with me and she was so happy when she saw the big lovely living room of the suite, so was my wife. I could tell it was such a busy day by the heavy traffic in the ground lobby and also in lounge. But i was extremely satisfied with club's service, Daniel Lin in‚Ä¶",50
Sheraton is one of my favorite hotel chain... The room is spacious; clean and the bed is comfy.  The hotel do provide free shuttle to/from Ferry terminal which very convenient and saved the cab fare...,50
I arrived at Macau ferry on 15th Feb and took the free shuttle bus from the ferry to the Hotel. The bus that picked us up was spacious and very clean. When we arrived at the hotel I was very happy with the way the hotel looked. Checked in at around 10:00 pm and the queue was small. Had no issues checking in. Stayed in the Earth Tower twin room with two double beds. The room is large and spacious. The bathroom was clean and looked amazing. The bedding was fantastic. The best sleep I had in a hotel room. During the stay I needed a replacement room key and was dreading the line to the reception desk. A very helpful female staff member in the lobby was able to assist us by taking us to the SPG members area and to replaced the keys. She always offered us late check out to 2:00 pm‚Ä¶,50
"I took the offer of Sands to enjoya cheaper rate of this hotel but I never expected the service quality would follow the price.   But with same charge, I could  book Ponte 16 through a travel agent and enjoyed much better service quality of Ponte 16  although the casino there is much smaller in size, but within 15 mintues walk, I could go to other casinos.    Previously, I could check in and get the room before 12 noon.  This time, even I offered to complete the check in procedure and got the door key after 1 p.m., I was still rejected.  Only few guests at the two front desk zones at that time.   Being a SPG member, without the membership card, for the first time, I was refused to the membership zone for checking in.  I had to go to the other check in zone to verify my identity‚Ä¶",10
"The time I spent in the Sheraton was very memorable. Mainly because of the service which was excellent; Peter in the club lounge couldn't do enough for us and Delilah went out of her way at breakfast time to find us bananas (I think popping to the shop herself!). The service was above and beyond. I must also mention Rachel, who was very personable and any queries we had she  found an answer to, always with a smile. The Spa was also most enjoyable. Joanne in the Spa was a really delightful person and the massages she gave me really helped with my Sciatica (I just had to give her a hug after every treatment!). The restaurants within the hotel were all excellent and we thoroughly enjoyed every meal. I hope to make it back to this superb hotel in the future.",50
"Reception staff very attentive and efficient, especially the manager-Bensum very helpful and provide many information to us. The hotel shuttle bus very convenience and wifi network smoothly. It should be definitely stay again while go to Macau in next time. Overall, a very good experience and great hotel in Macau! ",50
"Within two hours of arriving at this hotel,I could tell you more than five things wrong with it. (1)asked to change room, none was available.(2)not all elevators goes to all floors, confusing.(3)can't charge restaurant bill to room,system down(4)largest hotel, by who's standards.(5)who in their right mind would design rooms facing each other, so your view is the room in the other tower. Sheraton, what a wasted investment,five star hotel, maybe,but definitely one star experience!",10
"We just had to glorious days at the Sheraton Cotai in Macau with a terrific room overlooking the Cotai Strip & The Venetian Hotel.  I am partially disabled & walking is not great for me & the only downside about going to hotels like these & places like Macau is you need to be able to walk.  By the time I had left my room to go to Xin for breakfast & back I was ready for a lie down.  Everyone at this hotel was exceptional with their help for me in all circumstances that something was needed they seem to have ready my mind & was there even to get a guy to bring a wheelchair as I was stuck in the Venetian Shops & couldn't walk back.

Check in was a breeze, the welcome drink was awesome and the wifi is fast. Of course the important things to consider, the room was super clean and comfortable! We're also touched with the handwritten card given and the super delicious cake!  It was another unforgettable experience. Can't wait to be back once again!",50
"We purchased a package here which included various vouchers for eating within the establishment as well as joining the hotel group as a member.  It was booked by my sister-in-law during CNY and was fairly expensive.  The hotel is huge, it takes forever to walk around inside and it feels so grand compared to the crap we have back home in Australia.  The service was awesome, no complaints.  The room service food was delicious.  The casino is okay and has a smoking area.  I say okay because they ate my money.  There is also an abundance of shopping and all the usual luxury brands within the complex.  It is also an easy central point to get around with free shuttle buses everywhere as is usually the case in Macau.  It is modern, fresh and new and in my opinion easy comparable to the‚Ä¶",50

Then you called hotel, then they told you that your room number is in ANOTHER building. What ? Why not tell me when I checked in ? Their answer, 'sorry, we forgot'...  2. OK, then you have to drag your luggage and go to another building. Finally found your room, open the door. You got confused again. You asked for a NON-Smoking room. But the one you got is obviously heavily SMOKING room. You called and they said, 'sorry...' again.  3.  Fine, maybe just open the window to get some fresh air. Then you wanted to check your email.

I got in very late so did not have the opportunity to check in at the Club room but the front desk staff were excellent.  They even had a message to call me doctor(a pet peeve of mine).  They explained I had been upgraded to a deluxe suite and that it was a pretty long walk, I did not mind being at the end of a long hallway.  Thew room was great and even had a multimedia room with surround sound.  When I realized I left my DVDs at home the staff was kind enough to offer me a free movie.

"Whenever we do a weekend trip to Macau, our go-to hotel is the Sheraton at Cotai Sands. The boy likes to collect his SPG points and I like the free suite upgrades; not to mention the Cotai Sands complex is loads of fun, even for a non-gambler like me!  This Valentine's weekend, we were upgraded to an executive suite room which is wonderful. We love the large, luxurious bathroom and the living area was cosy yet roomy. The service staff were 5 star - extremely nice and friendly. The TV had some issues on Saturday evening but this was quickly fixed.  The only real negative point of this stay (and why I took a point off) is that we didn't get the free buffet breakfast we were usually offered. SPG should definitely make this offer more consistent to its Gold and Platinum status‚Ä¶",40
"My family and I stayed at the Sheraton in Macao in October 2013 and the Hotel is absolutely amazing.  The rooms were great and the staff was really sweet. If someone is travelling with kids to Macao then this hotel should definitely be considered. They have a parade, which includes the Madagascar movie characters and some other Dreamworks movie characters, that goes around the lobby everyday and the kids just love it. The hotel screens animated movies around the pool area.The breakfast buffet is never ending. Along with other things, They had candy, cupcakes, ice cream, etc as part of their breakfast menu and the kids in our group freaked out.   We booked seats to watch the House of Dancing Water at the City of Dreams and the Hotel is walking distance from it so it was very‚Ä¶",40

Outstanding service at all levels at hotel from check in (Crystal Chao) to club lounge (jimmy).platinum room upgrade immaculate. Bed very comfortable. Location is ideal. This is a world class hotel and one of best sheratons worldwide.,50
"My first time staying here. Got upgraded to corner room with Cotai Stripe view. Free Wifi provided and allow me to late check out. Lifts were too crowd and stopped in almost every floor during check out, this need to be improve. A bit surprise without rainforest shower in the toilet. Will definitely try the neighbouring Conrad and Holiday Inn for a comparison.",40

"I stayed at the Sheraton Macao in December 2013 for two nights. The hotel is centrally located to get around Cotai Central and visit other casinos as well. The hotel is huge, but there is plenty of staff around to help. We were greeted by the friendly front desk staff when we arrived and check-in was fast, friendly and efficient.   Our room was spacious and nicely decorated. The beds were comfortable. Everything was perfectly  clean. We had a club room (meaning that we paid an extra fee per room), which means that you can get breakfast and dinner in a separate area - seemed like a good deal to us as we were planning to have breakfast and dinner at the hotel.

"We really loved the 4 night stay at the Sheraton, everybody was friendly and always helped if we had any questions, this was nice especially staying at a hotel with nearly 4000 rooms. We arrived at check in and were immediately taken to SPG check in where a young lady went through the process and took her time to explain what was available at the hotel and in macau, I think it's the first time ever that check in wasn't rushed, a very personal service. On going to the room I have to say it was luxurious compared to a lot of hotels we've stayed at, clean and very spacious, the bathroom was the same.

The young lady also gave us a short introduction of the main sections of the hotel complex. Special thank to a german guy from the front office team. He also took care of us during the check-in procedure b/c we were germans too.

Shuttle service to and from the airport was reliable, based on my experience. No shuttles going to the center city of Macau during the time of my stay.

Although Internet should be payed extra, and there are details that are strangely not included in the price, still, experience is more than satisfactory.",40
"I booked an executive room and checked in at the Sheraton Club Lounge. Mavis ensured that we were well taken care of - offered an upgrade to Family Suite and personally shown us the suite. The family suite is 2 adjoining rooms, one is kids focused ( wii, bunk beds, kids table and chairs, shek toiletries, etc) and the other a standard room. This setup is great as my kids loved the room and I could enjoy some quiet times in my own room and TV. We had all breakfast at the Sheraton Club and the spread was fantastic and the evening hors d'oeuvres was adequate as dinner for me with free flow of beer.

The robe was put where my husband left that morning, which was on the chair.  The worse part was the housekeeping did not clean the coffee maker.  We needed to clean it by ourselves.",30

I had to make some calls to Cathay Pacific Marco Polo Club for a booking. Unfortunately, Marco Polo made it very difficult to call in - the call gets connected but then drops into voicemail.

"It was the second time we stayed in Sheraton. Last time was last CNY when the hotel was just opened and needed lots of improvement. I came again in CNY this year and found the signage problem and availability of express check out were improved. However, this year my disappointment was on dining. Being a 5 star hotel,  all hotel restaurants did not accept booking because they said it was CNY. How ridiculous. It turned out that I dined in four seasons the first night which not only accepted booking, table was also ready when I arrived on time. The second evening, in order to avoid the crowd, I have an early diner at 6Ôºö30 in the italian restaurant. You know what happened? The restaurant staff asked whether I made a booking!!!!!

That I paid for their second biggest suite, threw a dinner which cost USD 600 in the same suite, and they still refuse to credit me with my loyalty points.  Butler service was good, in fairness.  Oh, and the second room in the suite smelled of sewage. No apology was forthcoming.",10
"The hotel is located right at the centre of the Cotai strip so is quite central in that sense. Unfortunately the very common and un exclusive experience starts from the time you come out of the ferry and have to wait around for buses and the bus to get to Sheraton is also confusing. When you get to the hotel, given how large it is and in the midst of almost a circus/carnival like atmosphere, the first impression you get is one of ""how can this be a Sheraton property!"". You have to carry your bag yourselves and that too quite a distance, wait for ling lines to check in. Once you check in, the rooms, for close to USD 225/250 a night are just not value for money. Overall too expensive for the experience and I wouldn't stay here again. This given that iam an SPG GOLD MEMBER and stay‚Ä¶",30

It's very centrally located - The Venetians and City of Dream are all within walking distance. The room size is decent with comfortable bed for resting after a long night out.   The staff was friendly and helpful. As a SPG member, we had a dedicated check in counter and everything ran pretty smoothly. We requested a late check out for next day and they did help arrange that without any issues.

We had a very pleasant stay at cotai.  Hotels are  easy to roam and enjoy the venues since they are adjacent and with easy access by foot. It is at this pt.

It is ideally located in an area called Cotai which houses a number of well-known hotels and where new developments are rapidly taking place.  After clearing immigration from the Macau International Airport, just turn right as you exit the building and look for the complimentary shuttle bus (color green) to take you on a short ride to the hotel.  Note that other major hotels also offer complimentary shuttle bus.  Check-in was a breeze and our deluxe room with 2 double beds fits just fine for my family (2 adults and 2 kids).

We had a room on the 24th floor of the Earth Tower and this gave great views of the local Cotai and Taipa areas and the Venetian Casino in particular.  The room was largish, quiet and clean.  Couldn't really ask for anymore in a hotel room although there was a limited selection of tea in the room.  We were fortunate to have complimentary wifi in the room for our stay and this helped.

There are a number of towers clustered around the casino that form the Sheraton and a Conrad and a Holiday Inn within the same complex along with the expected Macau luxe retail experience. It's huge. It also means that the checkin lines are also huge however they seem to move at a reasonable pace.

This said, the room is fantastic and the concierge staff were outstanding.

The service is also excellent and friendly. On check-in, we were asked if we wanted a 'baby bath tub' to put in the bath for washing the baby; never before have we had this in a hotel and it was most welcome!

I stayed in a standard room, and it came with a slightly big size, which is around 40 sq.mt. The bathroom was very big I should say. All standard in-room amenities were very properly set.

City of Dreams is also the departure point of many free shuttles that bring you quickly to the old town of Macau: a very efficient and practical service !",50

Having said that, rooms are large & well-lit with good amenities & the staff are generally pleasant & very helpful but that little personal touch we have so come to expect from the Starwood Group was just missing. It is very conveniently located with all the casinos, the theatre (Dancing Water) as well as the dining district (two great Portugese restaurants, check out my reviews)all within walking distance.",30
"It is our Annual Group Meeting (L & E International Ltd).  We selected Sheraton Macau this time.  Overall service and hotel room is good.  One thing just want to highlight.  The conference room is not as good as our expected.  1. One of the electric plug is not work.  2. TV cord do not connect with conference table, we need to move Notebook close the that plug (not user friendly).  3.  We have more than 10 staffs in the meeting.  It seems tooooo small for us to work.",30
"We stayed here over Christmas Holiday with three kids. Booked the family suite. Kids had a fabulous time with the bunk bed, and Wii game console in the room. The room was decorated for children, colourful, spacious, and with chairs and table for kids. The bathroom was fitted with amenities for children, and with a step stool as well. It was good to have the step stool as my three year old needed it.   My husband and I had our own room, and connected to the kids' room. That is actually two rooms but it's standardized into a FAMILY SUITE at the Sheraton. As I was told, there are very limited number of these suites in the hotel, therefore, book early if you want one of these.  Location of the hotel is great. Very convenient access to Venetian Hotel, and City of Dreams. There is a‚Ä¶",50

"If you are into gambling, don't worry you can easily get to all the major casinos regardless where you stay. There are free shuttle buses running all the time to take you everywhere.  This hotel is not as close to the city center as the other hotels, but the deal was great. Everything about the hotel is amazing. The only thing was the service is not a great as the other Sheraton hotels I have stayed in. I think this is because there is so many people coming in and out of that hotel it is very hard to offer the higher level of service. However, check-in and check-out times were very fast.  The hotel has plenty of restaurants, shops, and facilities. Really there is no need to leave the hotel. Don't spend all the time in the hotel though, Macau has some great attractions other than‚Ä¶",50
This is a very outstanding hotel in Macao offering excellent services to guests and particularly to elite members. The VIP lounge offers many extras compared with a normal lounge. Rate is reasonable and you get your money worthed. Highly recommended to potential guests.,50
"I've stayed many times at Sheraton Cotai. It offers one of the best value for money in Macau. The room is large, comfortable; the room service runs 24/7 and has a great selection (this is essential for me, as when you're a gambler, you often eat in the middle of the night).  the king size bed is large and very comfortable.  the TV Channels is a bit crappy though, as a European Champions League night is scared, and none of the sport channels would broadcast it despite CL being very popular in Asia.  The checkin is efficient, it's essential as it's such a big hotel (they told me it's the biggest Sheraton in the world, and one of the biggest hotels in the world in general).  Be careful there are a few rooms at each floor that are above the ventilation system, and despite you're on‚Ä¶",40
"Enjoyed my stay at the Sheraton.  We stayed in a suite which had an amazing view of the Venetian opposite.  The suite was large and luxurious - the bathroom was the best asset, it was amazing.  We had breakfast in the club lounge which had possibly every choice of breakfast food you could imagine, and all to a high quality.    Staff on reception were extremely friendly and helpful.  I would stay here again but only in the suite, but could only probably afford one night.",40
"Very happy with my stay at the Sheraton Macao this January. They improved their room service standards from an appalling 3/10 to a 6.5/10. It still isn‚Äôt the best but it‚Äôs a great step.  Also this hotel provides one of the best recognition for Plat members. Despite it being such a large hotel (the largest Sheraton in the world), it has recognized more often than any other properties I visit the special occasions of mine or my friends. Be it a birthday of my friend whom I booked a room for or an anniversary mine.  I am also very happy with the breakfast Plat SPG members get at the lounge. Very impressed by it and so far it has been my favorite lounge of all SPG properties. Would be giving my business to this hotel.  However I was very disappointed with the renovations going on,‚Ä¶",40

Evening cocktails was quite generous spread which ones can skipped dinner, as for breakfast, we are only allowed to dine at the club lounge which have limited choices compare to full international breakfast at Feast. The location wise, the hotel do provide shuttle bus service to the ferry terminal in taipa, macau and also airport which is very convenient for the hotel guest.

"I've just spent a fun weekend in Macau with my girlfriends!  We stayed one night in a deluxe room with an extra bed added to the average-spacious room at the Sheraton.  We took the shuttle from Macau Pier to Sheraton and had some difficulty locating the Sheraton's check-in lobby since the place is so big.  Check-in is very smooth and we were brought to our room without delay.  The concierge ladies are helpful enough to help us book dinner and lunch reservations.  The room decoration is quite dull and disappointing for such a NEW hotel.  The TV table is so old-fashioned.  Apart from that, I'm overall satisfied with the view, room size and especially the bathroom since it's huge.  The bed sheets are silky smooth too.    All 3 girls tried the Sheraton Spa, our responses varied. ‚Ä¶",40
"Recently stayed here for 2 nights. The celebrated Sheraton Sweet Sleeper beds and roll-away bed certainly lives up to its reputation. They were the most comfortable hotel beds we've experienced. We were given an early 10:45am check-in instead of the normal 3pm without additional charges. Check-in process at the SPG counter was fast and staff were very friendly and helpful. Our room on the 24th floor of the Earth Tower was pleasant but the bathroom was a big disappointment. The tower rail on the shower door practically fell off making it very inconvenient for us. The bath amenities were one of the poorest for a hotel of Sheraton's international standing. There was also no power socket for the hair-dryer in the bathroom. Although we check-in as 3 people, water and toiletries were‚Ä¶",30
"Very good hotel. Attended a convention at the Conrad Hotel and decided to book here. Excellent location for business, shopping and relaxing. Close to the airport too. If you want to go to Senado Square or other places there is a free shuttle that you can take at the City of Dreams which is walking distance from the Sheraton. It is a fairly new hotel hence very clean for a casino hotel. I would definetly go back to this hotel whether it is for business or vacation. Of course I would highly recommend this to my friends.",50
Stayed in Sheraton last year n back again this year. They have a special area in the center for spg guest thus check in n out take not more than 10 min if not crowded. The front desk service staff are very nice. The bed is soft n comfortable. They have free shuttle to ferry terminal n macau - gongbei custom n to galaxy where we can take free shuttle bus to most of macau places. About 5 min ride to galaxy. So is quite convenient although located at cotai. The only negative side is the compliment wifi in my room unable to connect. Always network slow and can't been connected. That is the most disappointed experience. ,40
"My family of 5 stayed at Sheraton Macao, the newest hotel in Macau, for just 1 night on Dec 22, 2013.  Being an SPG Gold member, we paid for a regular room but was upgraded to 2 connecting executive suites.  Each suite had a spacious separate sitting room with a double sofa bed and a king-sized bedroom.  My mother-in-law even received a birthday cake with a birthday card.  It was a truly amazing to stay there.  Front desk staff Crystal Chao was excellent when she helped us with check-in.  She was unbelievably friendly and helpful.  I would definitely vote her to be ""Employee of the month"" if there is such an event at Sheraton Macao. Way more positive experience with the Sheraton than Venetian which was like a great big maze and the Holiday Inn that was less grand.",50
"The hotel was comfortable and staff was very helpful, but I need a bar! If I stay Sheraton, I'd expect a bar or a lounge to drink during taking a break from casino. It was pity to have drinks with my friends from mini bar. Doesn't Chinese casino work with alcohol?",30
I did my research work before finalizing on this hotel through Trip advisor reviews and booking.com.Finally booked the hotel directly from their offcial website.Since I had read all the reviews I was very clear as to where to go for check in.........being an SPG member I had no issues in check in ....infact I was the only one checking in on 01/01/2014 at around 12.30pm .The rooms are fine and the bathroom is huge.The toiletery quality is very bad.....which is the only bad thing I can say.The outdoor heated pool was nice which my daughter enjoyed a lot.I had taken the breakfast package but the same was pathetic as it is has no options for people who are veggies or who only eat chicken!Location is about 15 mins by shuttle from the main macau but since I did not prefer staying in‚Ä¶,40
The Club Lounge was great!  The staff during breakfast and evening cocktails in the club lounge were very helpful and professional. The food was of great quality and had a lot of attention into the details.      Well done.,50
Stayed here for two nights. Check in and check out was a breeze. The good thing about this hotel was it was inter connected with other hotels like The Venetian Hotel and Holiday Inn and a huge shopping mall. Free shuttle to and from other hotels located in Taipa and Cotai. Breakfast buffet was also nice!,40
It was a short trip but great memories with my family. We didn't have a chance to visit the Spa that my friend told me about but I think I can do that next time coz I am definately going back!!  We arrived the hotel around 14:00 and was allowed to check in..... The Italian Restaurant with 3 course set lunch was WONDERFUL..... The breakfast in Feast with all kinds variety with enlighten our morming!!  The bridge to the Venetian and the night life in the Cotai Strip- easy and convenient!!  I see you soon Macao & Sheraton!,50
"This Sheraton exceeded our expectation. Unlike most other Macau hotels, this does not have a casino but is connected the Sands Casino and across the street from the Venetians.  We like the quietness and the relative lack of tobacco smoke exposure.  Restaurant choices are good. The only drawback is that it does not have a shuttle to central Macau and one has to walk to the City of Dreams or take a taxi to get to the center of town.",40
"Huge hotel with over 3800 rooms massive check in/out area super quick .the hotel has casino ,shops , restaurants you name it they got it .our room was on the 30th floor it had great views and well appointed room very good value will stay here again",50
"It is certainly a massive hotel with 2000 rooms. Check in counters were always busy even in the middle of the night. With high occupancy, there were tables set up for express check out for those leaving. It has free shuttle to a few places in Macau such as Sintra Hotel in Macau Mainland (pick up and drop off for the ruin of St Paul's, Galaxy Complex, airport and ferry terminal. Room rates are high at Sheraton Cotai. So are all other hotels in that area. I guess if you are happy to pay the price for not much value, then so be it. But next time I will certainly find something in the mainland closer to restaurants (which won't be as costly as those in Cotai area) and if you fancy some chip-throwing activities, there are plenty of casinos in the mainland too. It took them 30 minutes‚Ä¶",40
"This is my first time to stay this hotel, and I was happy to choose that hotel as well. Since i was there on 24 Dec, and booked by the hotel website also become a SPG member too, So you can quick check in also earn a point from their group for every stay. Also their staff is quite response and before they will send you an email to ask about your time departure and any request. i was exactly done what I need even on a peak season. The room is cosey and comfortable. and the hotel shuttle bus you wont need to worry about in or out to the ferry pier .meanwhile there have few hotel combination, so the ground floor shopping centre is huge , if you want to gamble there also have casino too. so you can enjoy your stay .",40
"Just spent 1 night there early December2013 and had a great time! We stayed int their family room with our two children which we can only recommend.  You get a nice double room connected to a children's room with bunk bed (the upper bed is only suitable for up to 30kg I think, so not for a teenager and the bottom bed is bigger, probably 130cm wide). It is very nicely (not too much) decorated with characters from popular children's movies (i.e. Shrek) and (smaller) children sized table and chairs as well as WII.  Breakfast was great (what else would you expect from Sheraton), staff in reception and lounges were very friendly and attentive. We hope to come again.",50
"It was a family gathering event with 4 adults and 3 kids and wanted to stayed in Cotai strip.  We finally decided to stay in Sheraton because the Club room seems provide very good value and we were not disappointed.  The Club lounge is in level 4, which it was much quieter than the ground floor.  Bear in mind this hotel is the biggest among Sheraton hotel group, which has more than 3,500 guest rooms and the check in area on ground floor gets really busy, sometimes chaotic because it's just next to the shopping arcade and the casino.  The advantage of choosing Club Lounge is that we can check in from the Club lounge reception on level 4, which was much quieter and offer a more personal service.  The club lounge includes a big buffet restaurant (free breakfast, free all day snacks‚Ä¶",50
"What an impressive infrastructure the hotels have got in Macau. The Hotel has got almost everything, pool, gym, restaurants, Casino, large lobby, large rooms. The Hotel design from outside is a very nice convergence of Chinese & Western Styles. Other hotels are connected internally and one doesn't come to know when one hotel ends and the other one starts. Connecting corridors are amazingly done with most expensive showrooms. It hosts large malls like showrooms in the connecting lobby and corridors. It is indeed a great work of architecture by mixing so many styles seamlessly.   Only I would say that there was good rush at the time of check-in, and hotel stall was not too well prepared to handle that.",40
"Just recently stayed here for 3 nights with my family after spending 5 nights in Hong Kong.  It was our first time in Macau and I am glad we picked Sheraton. The check in was smooth through designated SPG members checkin. The only problem was, we were drop off at the back lobby of the hotel. It‚Äôs a bit of a long walk to our room and no one was readily available to help with our luggage. We eventually got help from the main lobby to get our stuff to our room. Need to improve on that. We had a club room on the 31st floor in Sky Tower and the view of the Venetian was amazing!  We also got a surprise birthday cake into our room for my wife birthday! The club room was a bit small for us compared to our previous stay in Harbour Grand Kowloon HK specially we have two young kids.‚Ä¶",50
It was our first time to try this hotel in Macau and wasn't disappointed with our stay!  As an SPG member we were upgraded to the next room category.  It was very spacious with a separate entertainment room!   We were really happy to choose this hotel! The staffs were very nice too and helpful with our requests.  Excellent service!  There is a counter/area designated for check in/out for SPG Members only so it was a lot easier and faster in our part.  It is an advantage to be a member and it's a FREE membership!   The location is also very good and there are shuttle busses to service you to and from the ferry or airport.  I will definitely stay here again!,50
"The hotel is huge and new however Cotai in general is like a tourist trap especially for those who is not familiar with Macao.  I have been to Macau 2x and stayed near the central and enjoyed my stay.  My recent visit, we tried to stay in Cotai for a change but was a bit dissapointed as to the lack of things to do except for casino and shopping.  To summarize my experience  Pros: -Beds are heavenly! -Rooms are of good size -Great views of the Venetian  -Huge Swim Pools (didn't use) -Easy access to shopping & other hotels in the vicinity (via footbridge)  Cons: - Feast (Lunch Buffet) - food was very bland, though there are numerous choices -Lack of things to do in the area -Location, a bit far from the City (though taxi's are cheap) -No food options in the area  This Sheraton‚Ä¶",30

"Sheraton has always been my favorite choice to stay whenever I travel and I have recently become SPG Platinam member in December and during my recent stay they upgraded me to a nice suite and I find the bed very comfortable.  I enjoyed the club lounge facilities and the staffs are very friendly.  Amy Wu is very good at introducing spa to me, however I was too tired to go this time after spending hours in the casino, will definitely try next time and she has been very helpful!   I went to Bene late one night to have late dinner, very much enjoyed the mushroom risotto and the red wine!",50
The hotel is amazing when it comes to shopping and rooms. However the casino here is not so lively as compared to the Venetian. It is the biggest Sheraton in the world. I think this should only be the second choice to the Venetian.,40
"Cotai Strip is nothing but several hotels ( no shops outside) connected to each other. This one is good hotel which offers everything as any good 5 star property. Everything is beautiful, shops, casino, food, service, staff.. Nothing to complain. You have too much of everything, and one can get easily tired looking at the glitter and decor. So many good restaurants in the hotel and other hotels which are literally connected to each other. Food court on the top floor is average. Rooms are very good and clean. Free wifi in the lobby and every restaurant offers wifi. Breakfast is very good. Buses to Ferry are always running and Taxis are easily available.",40
"My family (2 Adults + 2 young children) stayed in the Family suite for 3 nights in early December 2013. We arrived Macau early and we were very pleased that we were allowed to check in the room around 11am (way before the allowed check in time) which we requested earlier by mail since we are travelling with two little monsters. Check in was prompt (at SPG priority counter) with compulsory deposit given. Also, we were glad that we could borrowed 2 baby strollers to us throughout our stay! Well, the baby strollers were not in a very good condition. The wheels often got stuck halfway pushing.. Suggest the concierge team to check and repair the strollers consistently.

The staff at the check in at club lounge was a bit slow but it's okay and guided us for the waiting table with snack there and  we also allowed to check out late too, which is wonderful.

What the problem is only whe we check in the reception work is very slow and not care with the guest. really bad service in the reception and guest relationship, they really don't care about the guest. Maybe is because the price of this hotel is cheaper than other in cotai strip.",10

"For a one time- never again stay-  in Macau its got really to be the Venetian- however for coming back I would definitely come to the Sheraton. In lots of ways in my opinion the Sheraton is better, the kids club, the club lounge and the staff- wow- the staff are really well trained- and just nice! The pools are heated- well some are, but not as nice as the venetian, the club lounge is super- well worth the upgrade- I need to mention Brian from the Philippines who was very professional and friendly too- a difficult combination! The rooms are nice, very clean but not as ostentatious as the Venetian. First time in Macau go to the Venetian every other time the Sheraton has it for me!",50
"Am so glad that we couldnt find booking at Venetian and were forced to choose this place. But we were not disappointed at all...Venetian being just across the road (while we spent the max time there) we got our personal family time to experience luxury at Sheraton. It is pricey! no doubts about it ( 25K per night) but once in a life time i recommend that one experiences this city of dreams ... we were on the 23rd floor on the sky towers giving us a beautiful view of the wonderfully lit cotai strip/central area ( we were here to spend the December 31st night...so you can imagine how each hotel on that road were competing with the other to showcase themselves!

A decent food-court located at the shopping mall below, not many choices but you can get seat more easily compared to the market street at Venetian.  Best thing about this hotel is the spacious room, double-double bed for family with kids, big bathroom with separate shower and bathtub. Worst thing is the crowd. It took me about 1 hour to check-in queue and about 45 minutes to queue for a taxi. The crew were excellent, I really appreciate a check-out crew that allowed me to have a late check-out because of an urgent matter.",30

At the same time it is connected with Venetian also with a walkway.  Room was spacious and facilities were complete. The hotel is quite new so interiors are very good. Free wifi in the lobby but in the rooms you have to pay for internet. Used the gym and you can do a complete workout with their class A facilities.  If you get sick of the hotel food, you can eat at the food court in the mall.  Shuttle services are available if you want to go the ferry terminal, airport and other places and hotels around Macau.

The Hotel is fairly vast and can be a little difficult navigating your way around. All the Hotels on the Cotai strip are interconnected, so you can wander from one place to another. The Hotel offers a free shuttle bus pick up from the Macau ferry terminal, the coach is lime green and is found in the car park once you exit the terminal.",40

Troupes of tour groups from mainland China. Everyone is shouting and shuffling people around. Escalators were jammed pack. From a supposedly classy place, it became a market place. Sheraton on the other hand was quieter, more refined crowds.  Sheraton room has 2 double beds but they were pretty small. The curtains were old fashion considering this is one of the newer hotels at cotai strip.

The lobby is big with pretty chandeliers. It is pretty busy, meant that guests love it. Our room was big enough for the four of us. It had a cozy atmosphere, beds are soft and comfy, bathroom is spacious. I say, the view from our window of the Earth Tower is amazing! You have to be conspicious though and remember the tower you're at or else. We got lost a few times but the staff are friendly, approachable and attentive. I remember one name, Mr. Samuel Aberin, who did not only make us feel welcomed but helped us with our luggage.

"Hi, This property or any other on Cotai Strip seem to be very luxurious. I stayed at Sheraton for being a renowed name. The complex is awesome, its seems like I am in Las Vegas of Asia. More of like a Hotel in a 5 Star Mall. Stayed there for 3 days, rooms are good and so is staff & services. However patrons from India may get a bit disappointed if we compare hospitality of Indians as compared to hospitality of Macau people. I mean staff at Indian 5 Star Hotels are more bent to your comfort & need. However, there was no flaw in Sheraton Macau's hospitality, but it could have been better.",40
"My wife and I returned yesterday from a great Christmas in Macao and Hong Kong, and it was made ""great"" through our five-day stay and treatment at the Sheraton Macao, on the Cotai Central.  My personal compliments to Brian Tong, the Hotel Manager, for training his people to function as professionals in the most important service industry in Macao, if not the entire Far East!  As an International Graduate Professor of Business Administration, I tell my students that their first impressions of any business are generated through their dealing with the first people they meet, and those people at the desk at the Sheraton made an extremely positive one.

The setup of the hotel is not so user friendly as there are very long corridors from one end of a floor to the other end. The rooms are clean enough, but lacks that opulence that one searches for the extra detail which made you feel that ""thoughts been put in to make the guest as comfortable as practicable"".

Casino & hotel is amazingly maintained, and the access to most of the tourist places is good with their shuttle services through out the day.

Most of the other staff we met throughout our stay seemed cold and never greeted us.    We did enjoy our first stay at this hotel though.  The location is convenient with easy access to shuttles and taxis.  There's a covered footbridge which leads to the Venetian complex too.

We stayed one night at this hotel for a concert at Venetian. They have a foot bridge connects to the venue. We checked in using the SPG counter which was quiet pleasant. Room was of good size but interior was some what basic. No impressive decoration or design. There were some cabanas in the pool area catering for children activities. Lobby was very crowded and busy. Breakfast buffet was cafeteria  alike. Did not enjoyed it very much due to the busyness.,40
"A bit disappointed with the room! We had two joining rooms, to my surprise, I think the hotel was opened a year ago, the carpet in one of the rooms was torn and the door locks already looked tired!  The lobby was so busy that you would not like to sit at their lounge for a cup of tea!  Staff are very polite and helpful!",30
"This huge Hotel has endless miles of corridors and open expanses of halls, carpeted with lush soft material. The rooms are good, have wifi which is chargeable, and all that a business traveler would normally require.  You will have to carry your own power adapter though, since the outlets are not universal. The restaurants are top class and the buffet spread is superb.  The Hotels in Macau are linked by internal walkways to one another, and the Venetian is a ten minute walk through a shopping mall, which has an interesting graphic waterfall.",40
"We didn't go to gamble but as an alternative family Christmas holiday on our way back to mainland China from Taiwan. What can I say? Probably best summed-up as having something for everyone. On the hotel side: the rooms were large, clean and very well appointed. As some have posted it can be confusing at the start but that is more because of its sheer size rather than poor planning as it in fact only has two towers with a central complex. The staff were excellent and obliging at every turn.  We booked an executive club room and got very good value for our money. The club itself offered a fantastic breakfast every day without having to queue and a dinner buffet which by itself covered the difference in the up-grade. If you then consider the express check-in and check-out and‚Ä¶",50
"We booked an executive club suite.  We received email communication from the guest services team prior to our arrival with details on how to get to the hotel, where we should check in and other useful information.  This proved valuable as upon exiting the ferry terminal it was quite confusing and could have easily took a taxi to the hotel instead of using the complimentary hotel shuttle service as there was no signage to indicate that the service exists.. In fact we learnt that all hotels offer a free shuttle service.  Our initial check in experience in the club lounge (level 4) was very confusing and we were being asked to provide a confirmation email of our booking as she could not find us in the system.  We were confused at this as we had received emails from them not 24‚Ä¶",50
"We recently visited the Sheaton Macao hotel.  I found the hotel to be too big and confusing for people travelling with kids.  We are SPG members so we checked in at the SPG counters.  We were the first in line, but waited at least one hour before the room keys were handed to us.  It's a long walk to the swimming pool and to restaurants.  We visited in the second week of December and the swimming pools were too small for the number of rooms and guests at the hotel.  I will only stay at Mandarin Oriental Macau if I go back and visit Macau again.",30
"We stayed here for 5 night in mid-December. This is possibly the best property in Macau at the price. Bang opposite the Venetian and grand canal shops, the Sheraton also has it's own set of shops and a food court. The food court serves only Asian food (including one Indian restaurant) unlike the food court in the Venetian. An internal bridge connects the Sheraton, sands and holiday inn and the Venetian. Just like the way multiple hotels are internally connected. There is a casino shared between the sands, holiday inn and Sheraton. The casino is managed by the Venetian hence you can encash all your winnings either at the Venetian or here. The rooms were spacious and fun. The view was fantastic though we would have liked more English channels on TV. The lobby was always crowded.‚Ä¶",50
"Had there in second week of December 2013 for a conference. They have nice conference facility and service at the conference hall was really nice. Though finding our rooms was a difficulty on first day but then we could find it easily once got used to. The buffet at breakfast was huge and good Indian food options were made available for our group - (may be because it was a big group of 45).The most easy was the checkout though the package was given to us by another agency, the check out facility was available on the TV set in the room it self - never seen before. Also quick check out counter was there for those who have no bills to pay for room service. Lunch was also Indian food, surprised to have Indian food in China which was made available in the Hotel which was better than‚Ä¶",40
"I find this hotel very confusing to commute around... Though it's confusing to go between the 2 towers, it's a nice hotel to do shopping and restaurants... too many options to choose... too difficult to find the right choice... I presume Macau is like that too short at the same time too confusing... keep surrounding the same place time again...",30
"The third time checking in this Hotel,  Funny issue no. (1) :check in and check out still a problem. It was a bit better in the SPG special area but should still be expected to wait for 4-5 guests before your turn, which means at least 30 mins. Staffs are polite and tried to be helpful, but as some other viewers said, they are very busy with their computer keyboards, I had no idea why they need to type so much items. Funny issue no. (2) :staff like to tell you that as they got more than 2000 rooms, guests are expected to wait in various areas, says, lift, breakfast, room service, even your call to the front desk. This "" We are a huge hotel with over 2000 rooms "" was heard most during my single night visit. Funny issue no. (3): No matter how Non-chinese looking you are, hotel‚Ä¶",30
"Great location on casino strip. Great service - asked for extra pillows and water with no issues. 10 mins from ferry terminal and airport. Breakfast at Feast and Xin have great selection. Made to order eggs/omelette, varieties of noodles, pork/salted egg/ fish rice porridge. ",50
"I am a passive and lazy reviewer, but if I write, it must be either superbe or shameful. And this time is the latter.  The experience is so bad that should warrant the attention of a Sheraton management who better cares enough about the hotel's reputation, especially when it can cause dishonest sales and promotion.  We spent a bit more for the Club Lounge package under which guests are supposed to be entitled to a series of benefits including breakfast at the lounge, late check out, welcome drinks / food, a higher floor room etc.. Freebies aside, I assume a hotel should understand that guests spend extra with a purpose - to have a relaxing, less disturbed stay. But the truth is we suffered more than what we paid.  We couldn't get a seat at the Lounge during breakfast time two‚Ä¶",10
"With almost 4,000 rooms, the hotel is expected to be busy during our visit from 19-21 Dec 13 with my husband and 4-year old child. Arrived via ferry direct from HK airport. Took a quick 15 min cab ride, costing ~ USD 10 though there are free shuttle buses to hotels in the Sands Cotai area (Conrad Macao, Holiday Inn Macao, Sheraton).  Service Check-in was relatively queue free but the reception basically lied and gave us a room with 2 beds instead of a king sized bed on a smoking floor even he specifically told us that our request isn't a problem. Thank goodness we got to change to the room we wanted but it was unnecessary and extra work for no reason. Take note Sheraton!!  As expected, breakfast line was long at even 10am but it was breezy and service was speedy.   Room Dingy‚Ä¶",30
"Free shuttle buses from ferry terminal, Quick check in, Huge clean near new room and super comfy bed.Fantastic view of the strip. All staff were friendly and courteous , Buffet breakfast to die for especially the omelettes cooked in front of you to your liking, Great location in the centre of coati strip. Will surely be back, Thank you",50
Check in staff is very polite and helpful Room is very clean and the bed is soooooo comfortable. Bathroom is also very big but the standing shower has a little water leakage. I am sure to stay in this hotel on my next visit to Macau.,50
"Quite a decent stay.  The hotel is centrally located, rooms are huge, the breakfast spread is extensive and price was OK compared to other places.  But unless you are a casino buff, there is not much to do especially if you are with young children and / or elderly people.  Also there were mosquitoes in our room on Day 1 and the checkout process was a bit painful. So all in all - 4 out of 5.",40
"Free shuttle from the Macau Ferry to Sheraton and it's like 10-min drive distance. I was astonished when I walked into the room. It's a suit-one living room, one king size with pretty view. It's really clean, and the bed is so comfy. Oh, and the bathroom is spacious- one bathtub in the middle and there's one shower room as well. I spent most of the time in the hotel cuz there are many stores in the Sand Cotai Center. I went to the Shrekfast this morning and I had lots of fun. The characters from Dreamworks gave us a good show and everyone took photo with each of them :) I have to say that the restaurants in Sheraton are so good.

My wife and I stayed for just one night on 18th Dec and I am happy with the way they handle the whole thing - from the moment of check in to check out - rock solid, no surprises.... One word - Professional! And this is how anyone should run their hotel.  OK, the mainland China men can be a little bit of a nuisance but the hotel place is spic and span and the room is of good size and nice and comfortable. Really can't fault it  The bath is a little short but the shower is lovely. What's more, the walk-in shower is designed by someone has brains!  The door opens inwardly and it doesn't leak!

"This is not your usual Sheraton hotel both in size and quality.  A huge hotel in a great location in Macau yet somehow they seem to make you feel like you are their most important guest.  We are travelling with our 2 small children and staying over the Christmas and New year holiday period.  We were greeted at the front of the hotel by the chief butler Delilah who had looked after us on a previous stay.  Delilah along with the manager of the rooms division Alessandro had organised the most spectacular room for us.  We were upgraded to a suite for our 12 night stay with a separate room for the children to sleep in.  Not only that, the room was decorated personally by Delilah with a Christmas tree and decorations for the kids. Truly amazing service from genuinely warm staff.   The‚Ä¶",50
"This is a behemoth of a Sheraton with several thousand rooms in two towers, and forming part of a larger 'strip' with a number of sister hotels and malls.  The hotel was personal before we arrived, emailing me to ask for room preferences, and check-in was efficient if perfunctory.  The room was very spacious, on a high floor, and with a view of the strip - comfortable bed, excellent bathroom, very clean.  It's difficult to fault the hotel, but its sheer size made it feel rather soulless and charmless (the fact it's situated in a new strip/building site didn't help).  If you're in Macao, certainly stay here, but don't expect a personal Sheraton reception/service.",40
"I went there early this month(december), and was surprised. It is the worst hotel i have ever visited. First, let me tell you about my check inn experience, the lady at the desk was so rude she refused to even pass a smile and welcome. I told her it was our first wedding anniversay and she did not even bother to wish us. Secondly, the whole place is such a mess..so many people everywhere and no one is managing the crowd. Thirdly, the hotel staff is super rude, each time i went to their casino i was asked to show my passport,even after telling them i am staying there, they did not bother. Forth, every morning we had to stand in a queue for breakfast outside their restaurant. that was disgusting. i mean a five star treating you like this ?????

A lot of restaurents to choose from and good shopping destination..   and good value for money",40

Heated swimming pool in Dec with bathrobes & slippers for kids.",50
We stayed at the Sheraton for 1 night this December. We were very pleased with the high standard of the rooms and were particularly impressed with the view. We looked out over The Venetian and Cotai Strip. Free shuttle to hotel from Ferry terminal great and perfect location for main attractions in Coati strip. We took a taxi to old Macau but this was easy and inexpensive. A great base to enjoy Macau from.,50
"The best thing about Sheraton Macao Hotel, Cotai is their dedication to giving you the best service in guest relations. They are obviously well-trained---know how to please guests with requests, friendly without being fresh, curious without being intrusive, and over-all giving a positive energy that is honest, and sincere.  Getting to Sheraton Macao Cotai was a breeze. As you exit the Macao Int'l's baggage area, just go towards the doors where the buses are parked. Look for the the green shuttle bus that says Holiday Inn/Conrad/Sheraton Macao and it'll take you to the hotel for free in just a few minutes.

"Sheraton Macau is a mess with no system / no character what so ever. They are so big that they cannot handle it. Lets start with checkin. It is nightmare, if you are not SPG you have to stand in a really big queue. I was staying in a club room, and I could have checked in the club lounge, however, there was security on the ground floor who was very rude and did not allow me to go up and did not speak English, thus had to checkin in a big queue.  In club I had made request for some special meal requirements, which was duly acknowledged, however when I went for first day during evening hours, my request was not fulfilled, and rather it became very embarrassing for me. After some harsh exchange of words, they treated me well for next 2 days. On last day in breakfast the same story‚Ä¶",20
"Rooms are big and clean. Friendly hotel staff. Very strategic location with shuttle buses to airport and ferry terminal. Most importantly, the price is good!  The only setback is on the booking of Shrek Fast organized by Sheraton. During check in at SPG counter, we were asked to go to the Feast. Walked all the way to the Feast and were told that they did not handle booking. We were told to go to Holiday Inn. Walked to Holiday Inn and were told to go to the Feast. We were upset, however, we went to the Feast again. After waiting for so long, we were told that the place was full. What a terrible experience. If Shrek Fast is organized by Sheraton or its group, can‚Äôt SPG check in counter handle the reservation? What a big misconnection!",50

First, I got an email in September to thank me for staying with Sheraton Macao and I was in shock. Did I book the wrong date? So I wrote to them and after two emails, it was due to a lapse in their system and they mistook another Audrey for me. So I tot the episode is over. But in December, when I checked in at the counter... the same boo-boo happened. The staff took very long to verify all my details and it was not a smooth check in.

We were in Macau to attend a Conference of Lawyers - Union Internaionale Des Avocats (UIA). I booked the hotel on the website and not through the Conference Organizers. We stayed there from 30.10.2013 to 4.11.2013. We were given a royal welcome especially as  we had booked the suite directly on the internet. The suite itself was superb and HUGE. The service was excellent. Our stay was a truly memorable one.  The only problem was that in the huge suite there was no vessel or container to dispose off the tea bags/coffee containers near the sink area. I hope the management looks into that and makes it convenient for waste disposal in the future.  We are most likely to come back to the Sheraton.,50

They seems know everything, which could provide any information you want. I definitely will come back and tell my friends about this fantastic hotel!",50
"The stay at Sheraton made up for all the grouchiness and grumpiness that we experienced from the taxi-drivers in Macau. Staff at the concierge always greeted me and my family with a smile and were very helpful and attentive to our questions. We were also really pleased when the staff at the check-in counter offered complimentary Wi-Fi to all three rooms that we booked, to make up for keeping us waiting through the relatively long check-in procedure. That was unexpected and we were indeed very pleasantly surprised. Rooms were very clean, spacious and comfortable. I have no problem with sleeping at all (I usually have issues falling asleep in the beginning of any hotel stay). Thank you Sheraton for giving us this awesome stay!",50
Staff are friendly and accommodating especially the Filipino staff. Easy check in and check out. Stayed here will a 7 year old kid and he enjoyed the stay and the heated pools. Will definitely stay here when I come back,50
"As with all nearly all star rated hotels in Macau, the Sheraton is a luxury hotel, shopping malls and casino rolled into one. This property is located on a stretch of road (Cotai Strip) which has all the major hotels lined up on both sides - Holiday Inn, Hard Rock, Conrad, Grand Hyatt, Crown Towers flank Sheraton while Four Seasons, Venetian are just across the road, all at a walkable distance. What this means is that you can hop from one hotel to the other, and be spoiled by choices of restaurants, entertainment shows, any events, and obviously casinos. Reaching the hotel is easy, just take the shuttle bus from airport/ferry terminal. They have 2 check-in desks, one at ground floor and other at Level-2 for SPG members. Check-in was a breeze.

Then I just took the free shuttle, which is many, to the hotel. Sheraton Macau is very big hotel, there is a lot of luxurious shops, restaurant, food court even Mc Donald inside the hotel. I booked family suites because I was with my wife and two kids. The suites has two room and very spacious, one with king size bed for us, the other has bunk bed for my kids, they really loved it. The service was very standard for 5 stars hotel, buet the pool was great.  The one that I really like about hotels in Macau, they mostly have free shuttle to take you almost anywhere in Macau.",40
It was my first leg of a week long vacation. The room size is considerably large and loads of amenities that are linked between hotels. Many free shuttle buses to take. I only wished that info is more made available to tourists once we step out of the ferry terminal.   Travel to the tourist attractions are mostly free and getting around is not difficult.,30

We are in a small group of friends, some of us stayed in Venetian and I decided to stay in Sheraton since it was introduced to me by my niece.  The staffs are all very friendly and accommodating.  We have been upgraded to a Suite Room with a nice amenity.  Room is spacious with a nice view.  There are smiles everywhere.

""- but try the service ,and you could have been the only guest there !  It starts right from picking up the phone in the room (seperate common no. for all guest services for SPG members). The room and bathroom were immaculate , the bed was just right (with both thick and medium pillows)u ,and the hot shower perfect I used housekeeping a couple of times for Coffe,sugar,Ice etc and it was very prompt and corteous. I used room service once for a late dinner (seafood and Burgers),and both were very good. I had requested a higher floor, got 23rd with a nice view of the pool and‚Ä¶",50

Room is nice spacious and comfortable.  I went to club lounge which locate at 4th floor of sky tower, it was amazing huge! I think almost it almost 5 times biggest than other lounge. Staff is friendly and always carried smile when they see guest.

"The hotel is conveniently located 5 minutes by taxi or shuttle bus from the airport.  Free Shuttle bus location is on the right exit upon exiting the airport.  Bus color is green with Sands, Conrad, Holiday Inn and Sheraton written on the side.  Shuttle bus runs frequently to the hotel.  I booked a club room having known that the hotel caters to Mainland group visitors so I can bypass the regular checkin / checkout line which can be intimidating due to the large amount of people.  Club checkin is on the 4th floor.  The lounge is one of the biggest I've seen.  I love the foot massage machine they had.  I was offered a welcome drink and check-in was relaxing and swift.

"Last year my husband and I stayed at the Sheraton Macao Hotel for our anniversary, and it was so delightful and we were so spoiled that we decided to go back again this year for our 45th Wedding Anniversary, but this time stay longer than our two nights last year.  We stayed for five nights this time and were not disappointed.  The Sheraton is among several interconnecting casino/hotels which means that you can walk from one to the other with ease.  There are complimentary shuttle buses available which will take you from one casino to the other either on the Cotai Strip or in ""town"". These complimentary shuttles are also available at the ferry ports if you arrive in Macau from Hong Kong International Airport, or Hong Kong itself.

"Macau is known for gambling and the hotel surely did not disappoint. Its  casino is located right at the lobby and between the two main towers of the hotel. One can easily hear the alarms and sounds of the gaming tables upon entering so be sure to be ready to stake your claim. The hotel is among the several interconnected hotels within the Cotai strip which is filled with lots of jewelry and high-end fashion boutiques. The rooms are relatively new, amply equipped, and nicely decorated There are also all kinds of restaurants within the strip to suit everyone's type of cuisine. By its nature, however, the hotel seems more suited to gamers and not to business travellers or those having a family vacation.  There is only one business center which is about a five (5) minute walk from‚Ä¶",40
Most impressive!  The staff are amazing and I felt important to them. The Club experience was wonderful. The happy hour served as dinner because the buffet had a large selection of 'supper'. Was there with friends last week from Canada and am returning this weekend with family visiting from Canada. ,50
"We really enjoyed this hotel, great location, and the rooms were clean and very nice.  Lots of shopping right in the lobby area and a very big casino.  You could walk to the Venetian and enjoy the scenery on the walkway, very interesting place, bigger than Las Vegas.  What I didn't like is that there is no central strip, all the hotels are very spread out.  We enjoyed our stay and would go back.",50
"i came for vacation without planning. it was my 2nd time to be in Macau and first time in Sheraton. i met Jessica in lounge and i asked a lot of information about where i could go for tour, restaurant and shopping. she is very patient and always keep smilling. she even printed out the map and address of the restaurant to me, guide me to the main lobby for taxi. concierge is very helpful as well. i found out that they have big numbers of information and it is very convenient since i could buy my ferry ticket from there. ok, talk about the hotel, it is big and it is in  good location. sheraton is connected with four season and venetian, I enjoyed shopping and bar there. It was a enjoyable and unforgettable trip.",50
This is one huge hotel with all the facilities you can ask for. I guess nothing much to do in Macau other than gambling. But the stay at this place is great and the service is excellent. The rooms are huge with great view of the city. All the other famous hotels are just close by. Try it out.,40
My initial experience with this hotel wasn't a good one. I asked the concierge for assistance to book tickets to a show and all I got as a reply was to book the tickets myself. This is certain a first for me. Bellagio (Vegas) and Conrad (Macao) do provide booking assistance to their hotel guests with preferred seating or special deals. I booked a 3 nights stay at the suites and do expect a little more attention from the hotel. An email was sent to the hotel to register my dissatisfaction and disappointment. I took the shuttle bus from the ferry terminal and alighted at the back of the hotel. There was a check-in desk which wasn‚Äôt impressive compared to the main reception at the front of the hotel. I understand that I could check-in at the lounge but was not shown the way. Mark‚Ä¶,40

Housekepper came to clean up my room every day. i went to have breakfast in ""Feast"", there are many kinds of food can be chose. i like the food there and feel really satisfied!! it was a really wonderful trip and enjoyable stay, i would like to come back soon!!!!",50
"Largest Sheraton in the world (apparently) and it felt like it!  Miles to walk to get to anything but once there - rooms nice enough with good bathroom but disappointing view of construction sites. Pools amazing, restaurants surprisingly good quality.  Business centre is miles away and not worth it.  Access to other casinos good but very far from downtown/colonial centre.    Very smoky air quality (as are all casinos); smoke spreads and bleeds into all areas of the hotel.  most unpleasant.  Lots of staff throughout and especially good service in the Club Room.",40
"Honestly, we didn't really enjoy the Cotai strip at all, shopping and gambling isn't our sort of holiday - we only went for one night to have a look around Cotai but really just to have access to old town Macau. Everything on Cotai is completely soul-less, distances to get anywhere are huge because everything has been built on a seriously large scale; maybe that helps with the volume of guests in high season - but I can only imagine it would be a horrendous place to be if everywhere was full. Off season, it was just like walking around a big almost empty shopping mall. Nothing new for casinos but they all seem to allow smoking which is just downright unpleasant for non-smokers like us, so we didn't stop to spend in any of them.",30
"My family and I enjoyed a few nights break at the sheraton, the bedrooms are nice and spacious. It's in a good location for the shops and has links to the Venetian and the four seasons. There is a heated outdoor swimming pool which was very nice. The hotels Italian restaurant was very good, serving tasty homemade pasta. I would stay here again.",50
"They was very nice and help me to arrange everything....the best of the best hotel, thanks hotel Manager and staff again.",50
"Spent two nights there as a weekend break to see the Taboo show as all other hotels nearby were fully booked for the boxing fight. Hotel rooms are nice enough and service is ok. Swimming pool and gym are hard to find if ok. However the lobby lost in the casino with throngs of people checking in and out at all times, smoking cigarettes inside and the rest, plus the very confusing layout of the ground floor and the long queues at breakfast are NOT ok for a 4 star hotel. Thank god we had the SPG card so had some advantages and took refuge in City of Dreams across the road . Would not stay here again ...",30
Environment - 4.5 star Service - 4.5 star Food in general - 3.5 star can be better   All and all it was a very pleasant stay and we really appreciate their professional staff's effort in making our stay as comfortable as possible.   We will definitely choose Sheraton Macau to be our choice of stay when ever we visit Macau again in the future.,40
"There is nothing you can complain about in this hotel. Service is good. Ambience is very conducive for resting. Standard and predictable Sheraton standards, simply so consistent. Hotel lobby comes with a mini casino for those who can't sleep at night. ",50
As many other reviewers have said the staff here are very helpful. My only gripe with this hotel is that it is sooo BIG! Getting to your room is a challenge as there are two towers and we (and later found out many others) were sent to the wrong tower. This was quite frustrating as you are trying to get into your room but the room number is exactly the same on the wrong tower! So you think your room key just doesn't work.... Its a VERY long walk to the same room on the other tower. So be very careful when you check in! Location is great. Lots of facilities. Plenty to do.,50
"18/11 checked in and front desk staff told me to show my credit card for deposit guarantee. I have never signed any slip with my credit card.  Then checked out next day at express check out counter. The staff just asked me if the minibar was used. She did not tell me there was already a chargeable bill to my room.   When I got back to HK, I found there was a bill of HK$380.59 charged to my credit card by Sheraton Macao. I was absolutely amazed and wondered how my credit card can be used w/o my authorised signature. My card issuing bank suggested this might be a criminal fraud!

"This hotel is managed very, very badly!!! We were sitting at the outside terrace of the Club Lounge on 4th floor at 21:30 and suddenly we got a shower with a very bad smell. We turned around and had to find out that just behind us they were spraying the plans with chemicals. Despite the very bad smell they were not able to tell us with what kind of chemicals we have been sprayed, we've just been informed that it's 'fertilizer'. This is absolutely not acceptable!!! A decent hotel management should be aware that the Club Lounge is open until 22:00 and therefore no chemical treatment should be done before 22:30.  But I'm honestly not very surprised about such a mismanagement at this hotel: after check in we came to our room and saw a lot of long black hair on the carpet and on the‚Ä¶",10

"We picked the Sheraton Macau because we wanted a well-priced, family-friendly hotel. I had originally booked one room with two double beds but was upgraded to the family suite upon check-in. What a treat! Everything from the Kung-Fu Panda bathrobes and the Wii to the bunkbeds and balloon lady in the lobby - made this stay memorable for our kids. My spouse and I loved the big bathrooms, the clean rooms and the amazing customer service. It made a very good impression and we will now consider other Sheratons when travelling in the future.",50
"This was my first time to Macau and I didn‚Äôt know what to expect. Once arriving to the island we found out that it is divided into two parts: Macau and Cotai. Macau is considered the old town where you can find all the oldest hotels, the old village and all the ancient monuments. Cotai is exactly the opposite; the hotels are brand new with modern designs, streets are large and you wont find any residential areas. Sheraton hotel is located in Sands Cotai Central (in Cotai island) which is a group of hotels sharing the same area and same facilities.    I cannot say that Sheraton is the best hotel in Cotai but for the price that we paid it is of course one of the best deals available. The Sheraton Concierge desk was the most helpful i have ever seen. Another reason I stayed in the‚Ä¶",40
"The room was beautiful & large. Beds were very comfortable too. Carpeting was thick & plush. Sound insulation from the neighboring rooms were very good too. I was pleasantly surprised that the tv could swivel around from the wall rack.  What could have been better: 1. Air filters in the air conditioning can be improved. The moment I stepped out of my room (located on a non-smoking floor), I was hit by the stench of secondary smoke. It gets even worse at the lobby where the casino is located. Sheraton should consider means to contain the smoke within, perhaps the construction of glass doors / partitions. The smoke was so bad that it made my eyes watery, my children were choking and basically confined ourselves to either the room or outdoors. That said, the situation is the same‚Ä¶",50
"Overall, the hotel experience was great. Great value for a beautiful room. The room was large, and the bathroom was pretty nice. Everything you need is in the room. Probably one of the nicest sheraton hotels i have been to. Get a room in the upper floors for better views of Cotai. If you want access to spa, pools and gym, consider choosing the sky tower as opposed to the earth tower as it is closer. Breakfast was ok - we ordered in-room service and the quality of food did not match the price. Cotai itself is a much quieter version of Vegas with only a few big hotels and few people roaming around, granted we were there mid-week. Sheraton offers free shuttle service from Macau ferry terminal, taipa terminal and the Chinese border.   Gym was great, probably the nicest hotel gyms.‚Ä¶",40
"Despite the hotel and rooms being very nice, the food served at the pool cafe was by far the worst meal we have experienced in Asia. The menu only has 6 items and we ordered 3 of them so it is fair to say that we had a fair representation of what was on offer. The salads were caked in mayo and the 3 sandwiches we ordered were bordering on inedible. All deep fried till they were like rubber, on rock hard bread, and again covered in mayo. Unbelievably disappointing, we won't be back ",10
"I only stayed for one night but it is a memorable stay. The best part is, this was the hotel stayed by my favourite Korean program-Runningman! So, we booked a Club Rooms with breakfast at Club Lounge. Delicious International buffet breakfast to start our new day!  The hotel is at Cotai, so it is near Macau Ferry Terminal and airport but a distance from Macau. So we have to travel to Macau by cab or bus. I was impressed by the speed on the replies from the staff when I was enquiring informations about the hotel through thier official website online.  My requests prior on the hotel rooms were atteneded. The front desk staff are polite and friendly.  The room was spacious and clean with simple and elegant design. We could relax in the room after a day tour. I highly recommend this‚Ä¶",50
"I found the location to be an issue. This hotel is based on a small strip with some other hotels (Venetian, Holiday Inn etc.). It is far away from the main strip with the really good/fun/well-established hotels (eg. Grand Lisboa/MGM Grand/Wynn). You need to get a taxi or shuttle bus to get to the other area. The shuttle buses stop running at 11pm.  I found the choice of restaurants and bars limited and mediocre in and around the Sheraton. There was only one bar open after midnight in the hotel, and I was charged more for a Tsing Tao there than anywhere else on my week long trip to HK/Macau. The room was comfortable and quiet. The breakfast was good - a very wide range of options. I was staying again I would stay in the central area of Macau. You have not only a much, much better‚Ä¶",30
"I stayed at Sheraton Macao for a week and was extremely impressed with the superlative professionalism of every staff member that I encountered.  The services that I used included porter, club-rooms, room-service, business centre, meeting venues, housekeeping, bell-hop, concierge and the Sheraton coach.  Without doubt, the staff were consistently the most professional, courteous, helpful and friendly staff that I have ever experienced.  I thought that the room I had was amazing (you have to try room 13202!) but the staff were even better.  I cannot say enough about how much I enjoyed my stay in Macao.  I would strongly recommend the Sheraton Macao to anyone visiting Macao.  If you get a chance, take a peek at how the bell-hop system works.  It was incredible!",50

More often than not I'm in Macau for work and get a great suite that really makes me feel its a home away from home.  The media suite is a must experience!!

"Was there for 4 days on business trip, visiting all Macau gaming companies. We were told that standard room sizes for Conrad/Sheraton/Holiday Inn, the new block on Cotai Central are the same; while Sheraton is among the cheapest thus more value-for-money.  Room was clean, well appointed. If you opt to have wifi in the room, show them that you are SPG member, or apply one on check in; rate is MOP30 for 24 hours which is considered cheap. For non SPG member they will charge MOP240 if I recall correctly for 24 hours. Else wifi is also available at the Feast restaurant (breakfast area), and lobby lounge, wifi reception is ok within the premise.  Breakfast if ok but repetitive after 2 days, service staff were courteous despite being busy most of the time.",40

As I booked four rooms, they manage to arrange the rooms to be close to each other at a high level. As only 2 rooms are ready at that moment, we checked in to the 2 rooms first. Breakfast vouchers were also delivered over to 1 of the 2 rooms while my family and I went to get lunch first.  The deluxe room is big and comfortable and we did not expect it to be as big as pictured on hotel website.

"It was our first trip to Macau, thus not sure where is the best place to stay. Did some research, read a few reviews and decided on Sheraton. Booked the room through the hotel's website at their promotional rate, without breakfast.  There's free shuttle service to the hotel from the airport, its just right at the entrance of the airport. Trip to hotel took only 10 mins. Check in was fast, but maybe because we reached at abt 5pm. Reception staff were friendly. She's aware that I left a note to ask them to prepare a small cake ask it was my hubby's birthday. The only mistake was that she wished me Happy Birthday instead.

All the important places are interconnected - be it the mall or the shopping areas. It also has a large casino downstairs, although people would prefer going to Venetian which is right infront of the Sheraton.  There are ample amount of choices when it comes to food - you would easily find all the cuisine. The italian restaurant downstairs is just amazing - the chef is touted as the best Italian chef in the town.",40
"I rate The Sheraton Macau on the Cotai strip very high, the check-in staff were very friendly, informative and efficient, room service was very quick and all staff were extremely helpful, most spoke English, rooms were very comfortable and every little detail was taken care of, they will even book your ferry tickets to Hong Kong and have a courtesy coach that services a lot of areas, will stay again for sure the next time I visit Macau.",50
"Only stayed 1 night during a 21 day group tour of China. The best part of this hotel was the large casino downstairs and the covered walkway to the Venetian Hotel and Casino across the street. The breakfast buffet was great with lots of choices including a separate area that made waffles. This area included all the bread, toaster and pastry items so it didn't hold up the buffet line near the other items.  The room was a nice size and clean. This hotel was typical to one of the many large hotels located on the Las Vegas Strip in the USA.  Caution:  all table games that we observed here and at the Venetian required a $300 HKD (about $38-39 U.S) minimum bet and that was only at a couple tables at each casino. All the other tables were 500 or 800 HKD minimum, roughly $65 and $103. ‚Ä¶",40
"From A to Z this has been a trully memorable experience. If overwhelming at start for the size and the overall Macao grandeur, everything and everyone makes your stay pleasant, food room service restaurants, shopping avenue, location etc will definitely remember a long time",50
"Stayed here for only one night, a party of four people in July.   This was my second time of staying at the Sheraton and for the hotels around the area (Galaxy, Hard Rock, Banyan Tree, etc.), the Sheraton offers the best value. We stated before that we would like a late check out and connecting twin rooms, and both were provided by the staff at the Sheraton without hesitation. Being an SPG member, there was an area provided specifically for SPG members to check in and in this regard, it was perfect and the staff that greeted us and checked us in was warm and friendly.  The rooms do not have a free wifi, which wasn't a huge issue considering they had it in the lobby but it would've been nice if they had included it.  The rooms are spacious enough and was more than we needed.‚Ä¶",40
"Stayed here for 11 nights in ""deluxe double"". Everything ran very smoothly and I can warmly recommend this Hotel to everybody.   Only thing that bothered a little bit was the pricing of wifi. I think they should consider for example product ""Internet connection for 1 week"". Now the options are 3 hours or 24 hours so it is a little bit frustrating going through the registration process every day and the prices itself are okay for 3 or 24 hours but for example 11 days quite expensive. Quality of the connection was good!",50

Transportation was also so easy and free of charge.  We just took the free shuttle from the hotel to nearly every where we wanted to go (might need to make some transfers at some points.)  The staff are really helpful and friendly.  It was really very nice of Peter, the Guest Services Manager to give us a late check out as our flight was late and we had 2 young kids travelling with us.

However, there are so many casinos and shopping in this area, it is still a great place to stay.  Service: Even with the size, the service is incredibly efficient from the concierge that booked all the restaurants",50
"From the moment I stepped into the 4/F Club Reception area, I was treated impeccably, especially by Reception Associate, Daniel. I had a marvellous time at  the evening drinks and snacks session and could even get some business done in terms of printing and accessing contacts trhrough the Club Lounge Internet portals. The suite I was assigned was fantastic with a deeply relaxing Entertainment Lounge off the main dining room. The 4/F gym was also impressive !",50
"It was my second time staying in this hotel and would be my last time. I have no complain on the hardware there but the staff were below the average. 1. There were more than 10 used towels left on the floor of changing room of swimming pool.   2. The staff in the restuarant have no intention to give way to you for breakfast but cut your way.  My table was next to their cupboard  and one of them placed the whole tray of folks and spoons on my table before they put them back to drawer. 3. I used the express checkout and wrote down my email address for official receipt but i could get it after 2 weeks.  I chased for SPG for another 2 weeks without any action done, until i gave up and went to Macau again.  I got it in person and SPG communciation sent me the receipt on the same day.‚Ä¶",20
Stayed at Sheraton Macau for the first time earlier this year and then subsequently in October and since then there is no turning back. This is the largest Sheraton (I have been told) in the world but the massive size has not compromised the quality of the guest experience at all.   Breakfast with Shrek (themed breakfast) was amazing and strongly recommended for the family. Staff's level of attentiveness was impeccable and I would like to highlight the excellent service from Cindy Hsieh and the rest of the Sheraton team. The people really does make a difference in this industry.  Spa services were excellent and there was a promotion for bonus Starpoints of 1500 for spa services (although I still haven't seen it credited to my SPG account yet) during my last stay so that was‚Ä¶,50
We had a wonderful time at the Sheraton. Staying in a Family room was the right decision. It is really nice decorated and the kids had a lot of fun. The movie night for kids is a cool idea and they serve popcorn for the little ones. Only the techno music -which I normally like - from the bar close by was a little bit annoying for the kids during watching the movie. Except this the stay was perfect. We will come back.,50
"I stay with this Sheraton for three nights, the hotel is located at Cotai next to all other big and luxury hotel group and ongoing construction. The location was alright if your purpose is just for Casino but definitely have nothing heritage on that site unless you go across to Taipa area or downtown Macau. The exterior and interior of this hotel is grand and the room was big and have the 5 star vibe on it too. This hotel do offer a free shuttle to or from ferry terminal or airport like others hotel do. The staff in front desk is good but the other ground staff can be more difficult cause they don't speak English or just limited that can pin point to different direction as ask. The only downside in this property is too crowded with mainland China visitor that can be so annoying‚Ä¶",40
"We stayed 3 nights at the Sheraton Macao Hotel, Cotai Central in a Club Floor Room. The hotel is I believe, the largest Sheraton Hotel and it is big!  The Club Room was like a ballroom. We had dinner in the Club as there was a full buffet. The breakfast was also very good. Our room was spacious and clean and we had a lovely view over the Venetian Hotel across the road. Service at the hotel could not be faulted. The only reason we did not like the hotel was it's location. We are not gamblers or high end shoppers and that is all that is offered at Cotai.  Large hotels with big up market shopping malls and casinos. After looking around Macau (and we had not been there for 30 years) we were sorry that we did not stay closer to old Macau which offers more interesting sightseeing in‚Ä¶",40
"Great new property in Cotai Strip. The location was great, connected to most of the good hotels. Had a good casino in the hotel. The bed sizes were bigger than normal, very comfortable. Great for a family holiday.  I haven't seen such a big hotel reception. The only concern is lifts when there is big crowd lifts are always fully otherwise no issue.",50
"Stayed here for a poker tournament @ the city of dreams. So glad we booked here, the service & attention was spectacular. The rooms were new& great, but the staff was what made this place stand out. Tip. Pay the extra for the Sheraton club. Express check in & out, snacks all day, free drinks 5:30 to 7:30 & if you have had a busy day the snacks at night are equal to a full dinner.",50
"It's our 7th anniversary trip to Macau and i would say it's unforgettable one! Being first time to Macau we was very excited. Upon arrival at the ferry terminal we contacted the hotel concierge for directions, with the help, the way to the hotel was easy with complimentary shuttle bus right to the hotel's door step. Arriving at the hotel at around 8.30am we was amazed by the ambiance of the hotel and all staff were very helpful and welcoming. After a midnight flight from Singapore we was very tired and yet we were eager to starts our tour. Knowing our early arrival, Mark help us for an early check in and this was a great help.

"The hotel is excellent and rooms are pretty big and clean. They are worthy of its price. it also keeps two drinking water bottles as complimentary per day.The breakfast in Feast is mouth watering. it serves masala Tea which every Indian long for in any foreign country. it has large verities in breakfast mostly palatable. the only issue is Lack of proper Indian meal.It has Aruna's Restaurant for dinner but it does not serve water at the time of dinner. one has to buy @ 12 HD. if inevitable, carry bottle of drinking water. We could see a parade of Shrek, Donald duck, dragon  and other fairy tale characters.",50
"Great new property. The location was great, connected to most of the good hotels. Had a good casino in the hotel. The bed sizes were bigger than normal, very comfortable. Great for a family holiday. Would recommend the place!",50
"Personal experience only:  Good: Room is spacious and comfortable  Bad: comforter is a bit dirty (with hair)  No lobby at all, quite confusing and nobody escorted us to SPG area (I've never seen a 5 stars hotel with no sofa near check-in area) ( finally found sofa available in SPG area)  Not efficient during our check-in, took like 15 minus and speak only Mandarin (don't speak Cantonese)  Breakfast is quite far away from our room, like 10 minus walk, and we've waited like 10 minus outside the restaurant assigned and it took me another 5 minus for queuing up for a scramble egg  Staffs seem to be inexperience, took me about 5 calls to check for a TV broadcasting schedule, and there were misleading information provided  There is no convenience store like 7-11 nearby, the nearest‚Ä¶",20
"I don't go to Macau for the casinos, but for the 5 star quality of this hotel. Really. It doesn't have the crazy crowds of other places nearby, rather in maintains it's dignity and grace through great staff and impeccable standards. Everyone and everything is world class .. obviously a very well managed hotel. I suggest the club rooms with the breakfast and happy hour fun.  Also the gym is one of the best hotel gyms you'll find anywhere. The pools and pools areas are very spacious and comfortable. The outdoor buffet/barbecue was amazing,as was the food standard everywhere (although a larger food menu and more staff in  the lobby bar would be nice!).  I live in China and highly recommend this Sheraton as a great getaway destination. Or I guess you could just go for the gambling,‚Ä¶",50
"To think of it, this is the World's largest Sheraton. with over 2800 rooms and when they do a 90 % occupancy they still have over 290 rooms to sell, which is more than 100 % inventory of majority of hotels in India.  Unlike many places in China, Macau is famous for its Casinos and you can see some serious gambling here. Most of the hotels offer casino services, and the most commonly accepted currency is Hong Kong Dollar, Macau Currency and USD.   The casinos are open throughout the night and close mostly in between 5 pm to 10 pm in the evening.  The Galaxy Hotel and Mall, The Venetian Hotel, where they have given the look and feel of Venice, with Gondola's and boatmen are worth seeing.  It is not a cheap place and if you are vegetarian then you would struggle as there is limited‚Ä¶",50
"There is a SPG counter at the main lobby and I was offered to check in at the 4f club lounge but I declined since it's easier to check in at the main lobby. We loved the cookies and hot chocolate at the Club Lounge. The ""evening cocktails"" have foods good as dinner already. The breakfast buffet also have variety of foods and it's delicious.  The staff at Club Lounge were very helpful, polite and accommodating. Especially Bryan Pineda, Al and Jason, the butler. they treated us very well and gave us tips for our trip. Most of the staff can speak English. The hotel have lots of facilities that we weren't able to try due to lack of time: fitness center, spa and swimming pool.

"First of all, I've never been to a 5 stars hotel that has no real lobby area, no sitting area, no sofa no nothing.... It is a huge building divided by a few hotels and casino area in the middle.  Poor direction signs, very confusing with the shuttle bus get off and pick up service ( to different entrance and they are far apart!)  Very weird swimming pool layout.... when we were there, the 8th floor pool was closed...so only the 4th floor one was open, very strange 7-8 tiny pools, only 2 were heated... others were cold as hell! Basically, they were just for a dip...  However, the service was fine, friendly and helpful staff. the room was spacious, big bathroom with bathtub and shower.  Wifi in the room for more than 2 device use. thumbs up to that! Shuttle bus from the ferry‚Ä¶",30

I booked online via their website and emailed them right after about our arrival with a request of birthday cake for my 9 year old. I was so happy to see that everything was in order when we arrived.  Check in was a breeze and it was so friendly and hospitable that it didn't quite feel like a big hotel.  The rooms were amazing. We booked the family suite which had a shrek themed bedroom with bunkbed for the kids. They even had a wii !  Each room had spacious bathrooms with sweet smelling toiletries and even had kid friendly toiletries for our kids.  The gym was also well equipped with a steam room and sauna which I enjoyed. Their swimming pool was good. Not too deep so you can relax while the kids swim.  Room service was quick and delicious. There are also plenty of restaurants‚Ä¶,50
"I thought it was just another hotel in Macao with casinos, shops & nothing else. Upon arrival, Front Desk informed me that they have a Spa available and they help me for the booking. Amazingly, it was only slightly more with what we paid already. Me and my partner would enjoy 60 minutes massage with a BIGGER room......Very Nice!",50
My family and I stayed here for a weekend to celebrate my grandmothers 70th birthday. I have stayed at many Starwood brands over the years. This Sheraton is amazing. Simply the best Sheraton I have ever stayed at. It felt much more like a luxury collection hotel. We were taken to Sheraton club level to check in by an arrival host who was so polite and warm. Very nice touch after traveling all the way from California. My suite was about 1000 sq. ft. And I got a butler which is usually a service only provided by St. Regis. I mentioned to her that it was my Grandmas birthday and she set up a beautiful cake while we were at dinner. The attention to detail was perfect.

Had a best of holidays in sheraton hotel macau with my family last oct. With great service with warm hospitality especially the manager from ms.myn lam. She has been most attentive with our requirements show that we can made the best of our time in macau. Good job.,50
We have a Cotai view room but the view was a bit disappointing - keep in mind this hotel is in the middle of 3 large blocks and you know what to expect. Room was spacious and of good quality but nothing really stands out (iPhone speaker was cool but does not support iPhone 5...).  They can't find my reservation through booking.com at the first place but a senior manager came and swiftly solved the problem.  Given that was the first day of Chinese long holiday they were really efficient.  But I bet there are better choices in Macau in the same price range...,40
I was in Macau to attend a conference at The Venetian. I wanted to stay somewhere nearby since taxis in Macau can sometimes be a pain. The Sheraton was the best priced option in the immediate vicinity. It was very easy and convenient to walk to The Venetian. I would stay here again.,40
"Spent 3 nights at the Sheraton, 19 ‚Äì 21 October 2013 ‚Äì lovely spacious room in the Sky Tower.  Be aware that there is a lot of construction in Macau and therefore it can be noisy but only in the daytime.   The hotel is very busy ‚Äì being a Starwood Preferred Guest is a bonus as check in is speedier and there are other benefits too (for example, 10% off food and drink in all SPG venues).  The staff are helpful and polite.  Our room was big and clean ‚Äì lovely bathroom.  We took breakfast in Feast on one day but wouldn‚Äôt go back ‚Äì the choice of food and drink is excellent but the restaurant was very busy and there were a lot of children ‚Äì no fault of the restaurant ‚Äì just not very relaxing!  The communal areas of the hotel can be a little chilly so taking a cardigan or pashmina‚Ä¶",40
"Forget about those bad reviews that a few people gave here! I would spend my whole life here if I could! Most complainings here is about the price, but if you are planning to come here, you need to know about that! Its not cheap, but its worth every single penny! And if you want, ALL the prices are listed on the website, so its not like its a surprise!  But, overall, i cant find a single fault here! Staff really amazing,  All restaurants are top class! Dinner at Ithaa was one of the most amazing experiences of my life and food was awesome!  esepecially their club lounge services is so good.  manager ms myn is helpful and always put a great big smile on the face where we al feel like home!!",50
The great exp started with quick and smooth check in at reception. Rooms were spacious and gave the fresh feel - (although the view outside was worst - construction site were visible suggest to ask for venetian view). The food court provide a huge variety of asian food and the shopping area is nicely set and the overall feel is extraordinary. You will miss the activities such as theme shows unlike other hotels of equal standard exending it for which you have to pay and watch. While the location is good the casino is average.,40
"Excellent service. We had a very large room, with everything we needed. Very clean and nice decor. The club lounge was perfect. We enjoyed the evening spread, and a delicious breakfast.  The pool was nice for a swim. Location was god for walking around the Cotai area.  In the afternoon we had drinks outside. All staff members were pleasant and friendly. We felt very well taken care of.",50
"This hotel is located in the Cotai area which in my opinion is great since it offers more entertainment and shopping for those who don't gamble and the ambience is more touristy. The hotel offers a complimentary shuttle from the ferry terminal but its a little confusing to find and be very forewarned the service of these buses are awful, they do not assist you with your luggage, the drivers don't smile and they want you off their buses ASAP. Since this hotel is enormous there are many different check in counters/desks, the bus dropped us off at the east check in counter/desk which no one greeted us at the door or open the door nor did anyone help us with our luggage.  The silver lining was the check in process, the gentleman helping me spoke ""okay"" English but he was great since‚Ä¶",40
"A group of friends and I had tickets to a concert at the Cotai Arena (inside The Venetian.) We got a much better rate across the street at the Sheraton which is connected to The Venetian by a sky-bridge pedestrian walkway. The Sheraton has lovely large rooms with sleek design and although we didn't use the pools they looked nice!  Depending on your budget, this hotel or any of the Sands Cotai Central properties attached to it would be convenient choices for accommodation when attending an event at the Cotai Area.",50
"After a week in HK, arriving here was like paradise. We had a family suite which was awesome for the kids. Definitely worth upgrading to club for the amazing buffet breakfast and afternoon cocktails, as well as free wifi. Lovely well maintained pools, easy access to kids entertainment zone, great shops, even better restaurants, amazing staff and service. I could have stayed longer!",50
This is an excellent hotel.  Large separate area for SPG members.  The rooms are a nice size and breakfast is excellent.  The casino is in the heart of all the other casinos which makes for a very convenient experience.  I would highly recommend this hotel for people with kids as there are so many activities to keep them happy!,50
"This hotel is in the same area as all the other glitzy Macau hotels on the Cotai Strip, right across the road from the famous Venician and in a shopping mall connected to 2 other hotels.   This is the largest Sheraton hotel in the world (4000 rooms) so don't get expecting the personal touch you receive at other Sheratons, but they still manage to give you that 5* feeling. The free buses that connect you to the ferry terminal, airport and boarder gates are great ideas. and you can use the free buses from the other hotels next door to get you to and from the city!   We took a Club room which included breakfast and snacks and drinks in the evening.  This is excellent value for money! The ""snacks"" in the evening from 5-7 consist of make your own toasties, fresh soups, carved meats,‚Ä¶",40
"I loved this hotel a lot.  Big beautiful first class room, big t.v., great sound insulation.  Great transportation:  free shuttle bus to both Macau airport, and also Macau ferry terminal.   It's in a big complex of several hotels:  the Conrad, Holiday Inn, and the Sheraton, all in the Cotai ""Central"" complex.  There is a covered bridge that takes you directly to the Venetian Hotel across the street.    The hotel has a nice pool area, big shopping areas, lots of restaurants.  Cheaper restaurants and food court types are in the back side of the hotel, far opposite side of the main entrance.  It's a big walk to get anywhere in this complex.  No convenience store walkable, so bottled water is like $2 or $3 a bottle.    Friendly staff, but if you need something delivered, you will‚Ä¶",50

If you need help (in English), look for the concierge named Carla.  She was very helpful and very detailed.  We didn't get lost and was able to take advantage of all that was available for us to enjoy.",50
"Stayed on the higher floor for SPG club members. Room is huge, clean and well equipped. Secuirty is good especially at the lift lobby to prevent access by non guest. Buffet breakfast at both Yin and Feast restaurants is fabulous with great spread. Freshly made noodles, rice rolls and porridge available besides the usual western and local food. Wifi was charged at HK30 per day. Transport within macau attractions was convenient using the free cotai shuttles provided.",40
"I just wanted to share an experience I had while on holidays in Macau. I fell over in the shopping mall & the Sheraton immediately came to the shopping mall and provided assistance.   The hotel sent an employee to accompany us to the hospital, he was very patience and tried in all ways to help us where possible. He was also very good with our son and tried to keep him happy which is hard to go with a very tired 2 year old for until midnight.  I cannot fault the support and assistance provided by the hotel and wanted to note the efforts provided by Jason - who is a very good embassador for the hotel. If only all staff in all hotels were like this, then image what trip would be like.   Great hotel that has something for everyone and their service & help was outstanding.",50
"Must be one of biggest Sheraton on the planet.Couple of thousand of rooms Elevators can get  crowed at he busiest time of the day Casino hotel , very luxurious and new Breakfast are well organised and delicious friendly staff all over",50
"We've stayed at Sheraton Macau Nov of 2012. It was newly opened then. With my experience from other hotels, hotel with club lounge is always good. And indeed, it is. They have the massage for your tired feet and computers. You can really relax in the place. Breakfast was good while the pre dinner at club lounge is great. There are different wines and other food options.  As for the room, it's not as nice as the Venetian where you have your own living room but it's still fine and clean. Shopping options is limited too.  Overall, it's a very relacxing experience. An unforgettable one. If you are going to book Sheraton, book the club room. (So there's free internet too!)",50
Not a good place. Concierge is always busy to pick up the phone. Casino dealers cannot speak a word of English and don't follow requests appropriately. This hotel has a long way to go to meet international standard of a quality hotel. Room seems like it was renovated in the 90s.,10
"Got the special promo rates for the brand new Sheraton along the Cotai strip... 2 nights in a suite for S$672... As the hotel was really full got upgraded from executive to deluxe suites ! It's really too large for 2 of us, about 1300sf, with a large bedroom, attached giant bathroom separate shower/ toilet / bathtub/ dual sinks , powder roomÔºå 2 sets of sofa sets. One conference table... Actually we felt rather uncomfortable in such a large room with very executive type of furnishing ... Prefer more trendy lifestyle type of furnishing ...  The club floor was on the 4th floor in a separate area, and one of the biggest club area I've been to.. Easily seats 40-60 tables in 3 areas... Staff were stretched but really polite ...",40
"The hotel is perfectly located opposite to the venetian hotel on the cotai strip. Great shows such as the house of dancing water etc are located at walking distance. The gym is very well equipped and the swimming pool though not too deep are big enough. The casino is okay and the restraunts offer u a large variety of cuisines. The rooms are very clean and tidy. It has a very updated and alert security system. The staff is very helpful as we got late for catching a ferry to hongkong and the next available free coach would ve taken some more time, so the manager at the concierge arranged for a limo within no time for us to be droped at the ferry terminal.",50
"The Sheraton in Macau is really a massive hotel, but its managed really well, as there are a huge number of people staying at any point of time. Multiple check in counters, special desks for SPG members etc. But its managed very well. I got a room overlooking the pool and it was large and spacious. The wifi worked okay, was a bit erratic at times. There were complimentary coaches going into town and to other hotels, so it was really convenient. The breakfast was really excellent with a wide spread that takes care of all possible tastes. All in all a very enjoyable stay",40
"This hotel was one of the best hotels I've stayed in.  Huge grounds, the food is excellent and the service is superb.  We didn't use the swimming pool because it was cold but it look fantastic.   The staff left a birthday cake for me as it was my birthday, nice touch!   The hotel is attached to the mall so everything is within walking distance, though the mall was crowded.   The bed was amazing and the bath robe was fluffy and nice that I ended up buying one and taking it home.   I had a great time at this hotel for my birthday get away! Will do it again :)",50
"Loved this hotel, my last stay was not so happy, so I wrote comment to them.  I got prompt reply and they handled the issue well.  This time I came back and they upgraded me to Executive suite with complimentary wifi and breakfast.  These arrangement made our stay very wonderful.  We will surely back again for longer stay. ",50
"I took a promotional package as it was the cheapest option on the Cotai strip so I could take the kids to the JB concert (won't mention the full name). The hotel is quite accessible from both the Ferry Terminal and Gongbei Border gate with a free shuttle service. The coaches are the yellow one with combined service to the Sands/Holiday inn/Sheraton.  Arriving at 1pm we were early for the 3pm scheduled check in but it did seem the ideal time as being lunchtime the check-in counters were relatively empty whilst the check-outs absolutely packed with mainlanders.

The room was great - very spacious. Good view of the strip and a sizeable bathroom as well. We ordered room service beverages which arrived pretty quickly, and the server was very friendly, singing along to Rihanna tunes as he left!   We spent some time by the pool. One of the pools was packed but we found some sun loungers by the other pool. We ordered drinks that took a little while to come but no real complaints.   The pool turns into a cool outdoor bar at night. The decor with the lights is fun and the cocktails really tasty. A great hotel for a short getaway. ",40
"It was my first time to Macau. I was travelling with my husband and our two young kids, so Sheraton hotel is our top choice since my husband is a SPG member and we frequently stay in Starwoods properties when we travel. So far they have never quite disappoint us.  The hotels in Macau are all screaming opulence! And the malls along the Cotai Strips are magnificent! Expensive branded boutiques lined the shopping areas. However food in the area is really pricey and taste is pale in comparison to Hong Kong. So having a McDonald's close to the hotel is truly a plus point.  The room in Sheraton Macau is spacious and clean. I love the huge bed in our room, it could fit my 6 years old, my huband and myself very comfortably. The casino is located right beside the lift lobby, but both my‚Ä¶",40

My only complaint is that for 2 nights we checked in, there was no newspaper delivered outside our hotel room. But other than that, all other service were good.  The best feature of this hotel is that its lobby is very near McDonalds. Good news for anyone out there who wants a Sausage McMuffin sandwich every time you get sick with the always salty Chinese foods while in Macau.",40

Beautiful hotel , very helpful friendly staff. As an SPG member check in and out a whizz. Food fantastic, casino at bottom of lift and easy access to restaurants , Venetian etc...   Only downside I noticed this time was the ignorance of some Chinese guests. Smoking is prohibited but they were smoking  in lifts, putting out cigarette butts on elevator floors AND then we noticed when going down to the ground floor one day on one of the floors we stopped at there were cigarette butts and empty water bottles laying on top of the marble feature which is at every elevator entrance on every floor. Absolutely disgusting.‚Ä¶",50
"Standard room with standard amenities.  No special offer for SPG members. Far away from Old Taipa City.  Need to walk a long way to the swimming pool.  Scattered small swimming ""pools"". You have to remind them if it is your birthday trip. And it is their discretion to offer you a complimentary birthday cake. And you also need to phone them to deliver to you room (though promised to deliver the cake at a specific time).",40
"We popped over to Macau for a quick one night stay.  Upon arriving at the Taipa ferry terminal, there were loads of free shuttles to all hotels on the Cotai strip with frequent departures. The shuttle to the Sheraton takes maybe 10 minutes at most so within 15 minutes of clearing immigration we were in the hotel.  The lobby is ginormous.  There are at least two separate check-in counters plus a separate one for SPG members. We started out in a fairly long line for check-in but the staff are so efficient that we didn't have to wait long before we were at the counter.  The woman who checked us in was super helpful and quick - it actually took longer to find the right elevator than it did to check in!  The hotel is split between two towers with a massive casino, several restaurants‚Ä¶",40

A little noisy as we seemed to have kids around.  But if you go for one thing, go for the Spa experience!  We did the couples package at the Shine and it was incredible.  Everything about it was pure relaxation, from the hospitality, to the ambiance, to the champagne bath.    The couples massage room was incredible, with a huge change and shower area with massive ceilings and an equally impressive treatment room with a jacuzzi for the champagne bath.  Exactly what we needed after fighting the Hong Kong crowds for a week.  Would definitely do it again!    The hotel itself was worth the stay.  Good location with shuttles to all‚Ä¶",40

Wife and kids very happy - I was hero and got to go to the casino for a while!!",50
"My friends and I stayed over in this hotel for one night recently.  Our goal was to find a hotel near Venetian and Sands complex which was not pricey.  This hotel fit the bill: price was very reasonable and location was great. The rooms as a bonus were also simple, comfortable, and nice.  The only negative is the check-in process, the service, and the all out craziness in the lobby which is expected in Macau...at least the hotel room felt simple, clean and convenient.  I would definitely stay here again.",40
"Stayed in Oct 2013 as couple.  We spent a weekend getaway with Sheraton Macao, the property is pretty new, and the room is up to the normal Sheraton standard, but not a superb!  During the check-in, there's no SPG line, no matter whats your grading is, and there's loads of people at check in, and whatever we asked the staff at check-in, he wasn't quite listening.   Sheraton featured the 3 impressive outdoor swimming pools, that 2 of them are warm as 28 degree. However, we found out that the 3 impressive outdoor swimming pools are split into smaller pools, like the one on 8th floor is split into 4 small pools, and on 4th floor, split into alot of pools....... and out of the pools, only 2 small pools are warmed, which is very disappointing.

Great pillows. Go to 'Yum Cha' a Chinese restaurant there. It was excellent. Loved the cake you gave my son, made his day. Great shops in Cotai Sands. The pools are great. Very efficient shuttle buses. Would definitely be back for my sons birthday next year!",50
"I stayed with Sheraton Hotel, Cotai, Macau several times during this summer vacation. Generally the hotel is nice to stay.  However on one occasion there was trouble during the check-in in which the reception counter staff spent long time in identifying my booking.  They asked me a lot of questions to verify.  Subsequently I checked with my wife (accompanying me but who was not allowed to enter into the queue for check-in) and found that the last time booking was done in her name which I mistaken it was booked under my name.  On reflection, the trouble might be avoided if the hotel can review its existing procedure to restrict only one person to queue up for performing check-in.  Though I understand the hotel aims to minimize the number of guests waiting in the queue by such‚Ä¶",40
"Stayed one night at the Sheraton Macau to go to The House of Dancing Water with my family. We booked a Family Suite. The Family Suite is two interconnecting rooms permanently set up with one side having a King bed and the other with a kid's bunk bed, child-themed furniture, a TV and a Nintendo Wii.   The room set up is excellent and my kids loved having their own room, even though I expected them at 14, 11 and 9 to be a bit old for the kiddie decor. The parents' room is also well appointed with a comfortable bed and nice red-themed decor which is not in any way child themed.  The hotel itself is the usual Cotai strip Casino-fueled nightmare, but that is the Cotai Strip and all the hotels in this area suffer from this. If you want quiet, old-school Macau head to the Westin in‚Ä¶",40
"the newly open Sheraton Macao have everything to offer. SPG Members only check-in counters, next to a shopping mall, lots of restaurant outlets, everything... Unfortunately, after wandering the streets of Macau, there is no oasis of quietness in any part of the hotel expect in your own room to wind down. It is the biggest Sheraton with 3,896 rooms in Asia's Las Vegas!   The Club Lounge is a feeding ground. When the pre-dinner drinks start, comes flocks of people eating and then off to their gambling stations. No sense of calmness at all. Suggestion: maybe offer a special lounge for your Platinum members only?    Other than that, nothing much to fault this new property.",40
"The hotel rooms were very nice - clean and comfortable. The service at the hotel was also generally very good (with some execptions, explained further below).  The woman at conceirge who helped us was SO nice and helpful.  We wanted to find out how to get from the hotel into the city to see the sights, and she gave us 2 options, showed us on the map how to get the free shuttles from the other hotels, and gave us a free guide to Macau and some recommendations on what to see. You could tell she enjoyed her job and was really happy to help us, which always makes a difference.  Me and my husband tried out the room service, which was suprisingly good - the burger my husband ordered was amazing, and the staff who brought our cart in was super nice.

"I stayed here with a friend for one night when we went to Macau for a concert. While I'm impressed with the room, everything else seems to have gone downhill from there. We were told at reception that we get free wi-fi service in our room, but apparently that wasn't the case, as we keep getting this pop-up message saying we need to pay in order to use the wi-fi. Needless to say, we couldn't use wi-fi during our stay at the hotel. Not something I expected from a 5-star hotel.  Ordering room service was another disaster. They told us our food would arrive within 40 minutes after we placed the order, but we had to wait for over an hour. When we call to check, the staff acted as if he did not even receive our order in the first place (then hung up on us). We finally had to call‚Ä¶",30

Lobby:  Big lobby however, there was maintenance on-going, free-wifi in the lobby and hotel restaurants  Reception/Check-in:  Quick check-in at the SPG counter and quick check-out through the express checkout counter  Room:  Surprised that it was very spacious and we had a partial view of the Cotai strip which is great.  The bed for me is the highlight since it was very comfortable. Toiletries were generic Sheraton items but they did smell good (Mandarin Orange).  No free-WiFi if you booked via agoda.

"After reading my review if you think, I have been paid to write this.. It's incorrect because I am so impressed by the Hotel that I think they truly deserve to be written about. I generally travel a lot but I am too lazy to write reviews. Anyways, here's my story, 5 of my friends were staying in Sheraton in Macau, when one of the nights my husband dropped his phone and USD600 on our way to Casino. He didn't realize this until the next day. We informed the Hotel , the staff was extremely helpful and courteous; my husband got his mobile and money back. Later we were informed that both the things were found at two different locations in the hotel.  I want to really thank the staff of Sheraton for being so helpful.",50

For food, the sen serve us great lunch buffet and we always full. It was hard to have dinner at the night.",40
"Location is great, close to city of dreams and the venetian, there was plenty of shops around - but to be honest i wouldnt do shopping in macau for prices are too expensive. Rooms were spacious ! Beyond my expectation, the photo they have on the website does not justify the real deal,  bedsheets were to die for, pillows were just heavenly and bathroom was spacious too. The pools is a must go to, I recommend the Jaya side because you get more sun but Sala side is bigger. Breakfast buffet downstairs is awesome, great food ! I definitely will be coming back next year !",50
"Spent 2 nights at the Sheraton in an Executive Suite. Simply one of the best hotel stays ever experienced in the world. Big Claim, but worthy of such. The rooms are incredibly spacious, well appointed with everything you could ever need, extra large bathroom and large lounge area. The staff, food, concierge and location could not be faulted. The Casino itself was small and not one of the best on the strip, however the Venetian is just across the Road (through elevated walkways) so this was a very small inconvenience. The club lounge was large with lots of different food offerings (there was no need to purchase food outside the club unless you wanted something after hours). The small increase in price for the Club Sheraton Rooms and Executive Suites was well worth it for the food‚Ä¶",50

But because of the peak period over the mid-autumn festival, we didn't have many choices and so we decided to have a try.  Out of expectation, it's a pretty nice property with good services.   Thanks to some of the reviewers advice, we booked a Club room.  It allowed us to have Club check in and so we need not line up with the crowd. And club lounge offers a nice and quiet place for snacks and afternoon tea. The staff is very friendly and we were escorted to our room and after that, some candies & cookies are sent to us for our kids.  It's a lovely surprise.

We enjoyed and had fun while hopping up and down with the connecting free shuttles to city of dreams , Venetian , galaxy and sands ........ Only one thing keep in mind they have the best spread of breakfast , lunch and dinner but dinner buffet is on a high side . As you can have cheaper food on the third level of the property inclusively to save a few dollars to shop for your pleasure!!!!!! I give a thumbs up to this hotel cheers!!!!!!!",40
"Sheraton is a new hotel just opened last year along with Conrad and Holiday Inn Cotai Centre. Since I'm a SPG member and also it claimed that it has the largest number of rooms (close to 4,000?), so I chose to stay at Sheraton for an experience. The room rate per night is quite expensive, about HK$1,600 including tax without breakfast and it's already a promotional rate. OK, it's like other 5 star hotels in Macao, they have a nice & big lobby area and the shopping mall is connected to Conrad and Holiday Inn. Of course, there's a casino down there too. When I checked in, the front desk staff spoke to me in Putonghua. I talked to him in Cantonese, but he didn't understand and then I talked to him in English, but he's english is poor.

We came back an hour later and approached another Philippine staff to get the room keys, he seemed not welcoming with no smile.

"Big is the obviously the word to use for  the Sheraton Macao, Hotel Cotai Central ( it's the largest Sheraton hotel in the world) and it's also apt to describe my stay at the hotel. Larger than life, overblown, overblown...these adjectives characterize this hotel where everything, from size of rooms to size of the meals, is extravagant and  truly about luxury. The hotel is perfect for once-in-a-lifetime, totally outrageous holiday and if you're doing so, then it's better to take a suite where you can enjoy all the amazing facilities of the club room. Thumbs up!!",40

Only thing is we asked for 2 hours late check out, hotel allowed us to only one hour. I do not think extra one hour make different? Still you had to line up for check out take long time.  ",40

The hotel was clean and the check-in reception staff were extremely friendly and helpful.  The room was very nice and the bathroom was luxurious.  Our room had 2 very comfortable beds.  The bathroom had a powerful shower unit and a separate bathtub with a new rubber duck - cute.  I will definitely stay here again.,40
We stayed at the Sheraton for 2 nights in September.If you are looking for a great hotel with large clean rooms helpful staff and a convenient location this is the place for you.Nice pool and poolside bar serving great beers and cocktails if you can find the time to drag yourself away from the casino.Would definitely recommend this hotel and hope to return again in the future.   ,50

The rooms are comfortable and clean but I can hear the construction works across the street.  I am totally impressive with their breakfast operations in one of their many ballrooms.  Despite the crowd, the chef was happy to cook my special order of egg white only omelette.   The staff refilled our coffee without asking.  The hostess at the entrance attempted to address me by name.  Kudos to the management. ",40

From 22 to 24 September, in spite of the typhoon, we stayed in the Sheraton Macao for 3 days for pleasure. Owing to the inclement weather, we stayed in the Sheraton Club for most of the time. The food for breakfast and evening cocktail is fine and delicious and the services provided by the club staff are friendly and professional.

"We had an excellent stay here. We booked an executive suite for $2500 HKD per night, as a birthday treat. And the first thing I can say is that paying a little extra makes a HUGE difference.  As people have posted below, the hotel is ridiculously large. It has two towers with 40 odd floors and has around 2000 rooms or something equally crazy. So what does this mean? It means you're treated a little less 'special' than you would be in another hotel. That's just what happens when a hotel has to accommodate so many people.

Once we checked in, I was welcomed by a nice german manager to the ""world biggest sheraton"" Well, when I heard that I was a little bit concerned.

Jet Airways in collaboration with Sheraton Hotel had offered a package of 3 days all paid for and we jumped for it and added two more nights in our stay by paying additional pro-rate charge. we were received by a very attractive chines lady at the reception who was very good in English and could understand all our requirements. After entering the arrival perform ea  we were given a coupon for complimentary drink which we could have at the coffee shop.we were advised to carefully remember the bay from where to take the lift to go to our floor otherwise we may waste time in looking for the room.The room was self sufficient with all the amenities.

The free shuttle service made it all very easy and convenient to get around, especially from Cotai to Senado. The room was spacious and we were provided with more than enough amenities daily.

New,good rooms,casino,entertainment and a lot of restaurants under the same roof,or close by;it attracts numerous tourists from mainland China.The only poor mark is its location not fit for visitors who want to enjoy the genuine Macau.You must take free transportation to reach Macau city,a walk is impossible. The best quality/price among the great hotels of Macau when discounts are available.",40
"Nice hotel in general, location is great.   Did read the comments about breakfast, that is true we had to walk over to the next resort to get breakfast so that's a pain.  We did have a load group of young kids beside us that came in at 5am and continued to yell and scream, we called security and they came up asap and took care of it so that was good.",40

The swimming pool on the 4th floor is a refreshing place. But the Dreamworks parade at 1600 hrs is the cherry on the cake. Do not miss the parade come what may if you are at the property. All in all a lovely experience. Waiting to go back to the Casino Country.",50
"I was honestly surprised by this hotel, almost 4000 rooms and the large rooms along with the smooth service. If you speak a bit of Mandarin or Cantonese, you are safe to communicate with every one there as most of the casino people are not speaking any English, not surprising considering that most of the gamblers where Chinese. Will certainly and highly recommend as the hotel is connected to a shopping mall. Go for the rooms in the sky tower.",40

I think on the weekend, there needs to be room to move with the serving times of breakfast. We then had to go out of the hotel to find something to eat. I ordered room service and that took over an hour. That wasn't too bad but I heard many other customers over the weekend complaining about how long their food was taking to arrive, especially at the pools.

"Sheraton was one of the cheapest hotel among the ones in the cotai central area and guess the reason for that was the huge number of rooms that they have.

Particularly impressed with their contingency plan when the day that we were checking out, there was a forecast typhoon 8 to be declared, they gave us a letter to inform us what we could possibly do in an event that our ferry or flight might be cancelled. Luckily our ferry was affected and we return to HK safely.   The rooms was huge, new and just so comfortable, location was just opposite venetians and city of dream‚Ä¶",50
"Was there for one night on 5 Sept 2013.  Great hotels have great concierge, and this applies to Sheraton Macau. Totally agree with another reviewer here that Sheraton Macau has a 7-star concierge. To the hotel, please continue to maintain the high level of service in your concierge team.  Pre-trip, I emailed the reservations team to forward my email to their concierge team (strangely no concierge email address on their website) to make a restaurant reservation, and 1 hour later, I got an email from Concierge saying it's done. Fast response, great service.  We reached Sheraton at 10.30 am for early check-in, no queue, so check-in was fast. We asked for early check-in (i.e. then and there). I didn't have much hope as 99% other hotels would have turned us down, but we got the room‚Ä¶",40
We have travelled throughout mainland China and are now in Macao. The checkin took 1 hour and the rooms we booked online 2 months ago were not ready. Room service meals took 40 minutes so once again have to say Sheraton does not meet our service expectations. beds are comfortable and well appointed. Think I will be giving Sheraton a miss in future,30
"Full marks to Ms. Heidi at the concierge desk! Our first trip to Macau and whilst I was attending a business conference my wife approached the concierge desk for assistance with places to see and things to do. Ms. Heidi went far beyond expectations in helping her throughout our stay, not only were her recommendations accurate but she took feedback regularly and even went to the extent of preparing a personalized itinerary with sufficient details and material.   Ms. Heidi is an outstanding example but most interactions with the hotels staff had similar pleasant experiences.          Its easy to expect such service standards from a boutique or luxury hotel with few rooms - however such levels of personal service from a 4000 room hotel is unbelievable.",50
"Stayed here for 5 nights, booked 3 rooms.  So I've seen their Executive suite (upgraded), the normal deluxe? room and the Family suite.  We were very impressed on the first day, right from the airport transfer, to the amazing rooms. During the stay, we got less impressed with the service until finally, some of us got locked out in the pool.    Good: - Family suite is actually 2 identical rooms combined. On 1 side is the kids room with Wii games (Madagascar only), double-decker beds (which got the kids so excited until they realised the upper deck's bed was hard), play area, and yes - a bathroom all by themselves. The space and the extras (kids bath set, slippers, robes) made it worthwhile.  The other side will be the parents room.  The design was such that you could close the‚Ä¶",30
"checked in @ early Sep 13 for a Basic Deluxe room. Lobby, check in (even the SPG area) food outlet are all very busy filled up with Mainland Chinese. However, the rooms are spacious and clean . Two set of pool areas named Jaya and Sala, Jaya with tons of kids and cannot dip in, Sala is better. The down side is they only provide free Wifi in lobby area, for room Access it charges HKD 120 per day. Room service is up to standard.",40
Hotel/Room: A new hotel in Macau equipped with comprehensive room facilities. Room is clean and tidy Easy to access by taking free Shuttle Bus nearby Pier. Hotel provides free breakfast. I must to say that the food provided satisfied different people from different nationality. Good Job!  The hotel is too crowded. Everywhere is people. No matter doing check in/check out.,30
"Sheraton Macao Hotel, Cotai Central is the best hotel! We enjoyed your service and facility very much. All staff are sweet and listen to guests requests. The hotel performs beyond my expectation!

"The hotel is very crowed during the weekend and too lose during weekdays. Its better to go around during weekdays.  Location are very good. Walking distance to Venetian, City of Dreams and also Galaxy Macau.  Alot of restaurants to dine in and shop for shopping. The hotel main entrance you will see the casino first before the lobby.

"Had selected this hotel for our family vacation to Macao. Took 7 hours flight and then 3 hours of waiting at airport for ferry and then nearly 1 hour of ferry to Macao. As a result kids were very cranky, but when the reached hotel they happy to see the live Hawaiian dance ( which was on when we reached ) so kids were happy, i finished the formalities. The front office was very kind to give us 2 rooms instead of 1 ( seeing our 2 kids ). The front office lady was kind enough to guide us to our room, when we entered our room, kids were very happy to see that they had given us connecting room with another room having all the kids theme room, ( bunk beds, small table, video games, their size wardrobe, bathrobe and kids bath amenities)  We were very hungry so we ordered room service‚Ä¶",40
"My family of five went to Macau to celebrate my birthday and we stayed for one night at Sheraton Macau.  We booked two rooms and because it was my birthday, they upgraded us to a two-bedroom suite which was very spacious and comfortable.  There was ample space at the work station for my elder son to get online and Skype with my relatives who wanted to wish me a happy birthday.  There was also an entertainment room where my younger son and daddy watched football.  The hotel also sent me a birthday cake which was a heart-warming gesture.  But it was their staff and the customer-focused service which cast a lasting impression.  I will surely return to this hotel next time I visit Macau.",50
"The stay in the hotel in Aug proved to be fruitful. The room was proper cleaned up, bathroom was excellent just few things were missing such as personalized service, Luggage pick up. We had to take our luggage to our rooms personally, no porter service was provided. The bathroom was extraordinary excellent and had shower in it with wall as well as hand... which is quite comfortable and missing in many other hotels. Hotel is quite big and have good ambience.",30
"I had a very brief stay at Macau and was very disappointed at the service provided by the hotel. The room facility was barely a three-star, though the hotel claimed that it is a 4.5 star... This asides, my biggest issue is with their concierge. The staffs were not helpful at all when I asked to purchase boat tickets to get to HK airport. They were very stubborn and suggested me take the shuttle 2 hours before the boat departure time. I questioned whether I needed to prepare that much time in advance, but she insisted. I took her advice and waited at the port for 1.5 hours...  I think they should provide more realistic suggestion to tourists as it's their job to provide guests with a good travel experience. Maybe it is just Macau style, but I am very unhappy about the stay there.",20
"The hotel itself is very very nice, it has a very impressive check in area - with a LOT of counters.  As expected, the staff were incredibly efficient and helpful yet very friendly and welcoming.  When we arrived we were told that we can receive a free upgrade because we were Starwood members , which we were quite happy about.  The room was nice and spacious, with a great view of Macau.  However, it had a very strong smell of cigarette smoke, even though we specified that we want a non smoking room when making the booking and again confirmed it again when we were checking in.  Even though both of us don't smoke, we had no choice but to try and ignore the smell or otherwise we would have been late for our arrangements for the day.  However, we found the smell especially difficult‚Ä¶",40
"Sheraton Macau Sands Cotai Central SPG guest level Sky Tower Floor understated elegance that is expected from a Sheraton.   Pool however gets overcrowded at Sheraton side, not Conrad.   Definitely go there again. As usual SPG guest check in has elevated pedestal priority check in with barriers to segregate from the tourist group masses waiting to check in.   Present the SPG card upon usher request.",50
Central for fantabulous Experience that u must have. Kid friendly great pools. Buffets are large   Communications in English could be better. Must visit in Macau Gambling another good option. Large Reims with great view of pools n city. Malls all over. ,50
"I stayed in Sheraton Macau by end Aug, and really surprise about the hardware is so great, besides that their service is also great even the hotel is really full but their staff provided an excellent service especially one of their manager Ms Amy Wu, her service is outstanding with other hotels compared with i stayed others before, she is very patient to provide me every single in details, and she made my stay comfort and unforgettable,",50
"We stayed here for one night so we could see a show. Location was good. We were offered an upgrade for the room and breakfast included. The room itself was very good but hotel guests obviously don't look out of the window! The view was over a lot of building rubble! The breakfast was, in a word - terrible! We ended up going out to a coffee shop. If you want to go to the casino and see a show then the hotel is fine abd rhe front desk staff tried to be very helpful. Just don't  have breakfast! ",30
"My husband and I live in Shenzhen china and regularity visit the Sheraton Macau. The hotel is gorgeous, well appointment, has friendly helpful staff and a GREAT club lounge! The club lounge services 3 meals a day...a full gourmet breakfast with hot and cold choices, afternoon snacks and then drinks and snacks in the evening. But the evening snacks are soo abundant and hearty that you can easily make a meal out if it! One time they had lamb and mini cheeseburgers! Yum!! We have been upgraded to suites on many occasions.  The hotel is also part of a beautiful luxury shopping mall with restaurants and is located in the heart if Macau waking distance t many other great casinos and hotels.  On our first stay there one of the customer service mangers, her name is Amy Wu gave us her‚Ä¶",50
"Spacious brand new and well appointed room. Lovely pool/pools, and very cool pool bar area with very good service. Very good gymnasium and spa, high standard, all new and immaculate.  Although facilities meet the grade. Don't expect 5 star service on arrival. This is a mega hotel built in a huge shopping mall. Be prepared to have a long queue to check in and then to negotiate enormous corridors for 20 minutes with your own luggage to reach your room. Staff are pleasant when you finally get to deal with them.   Breakfast while an extensive buffet is very poor quality like a bad Chinese all you can eat buffet.   Overall though I am going to give 5 stars based on the room and facilities and value for money.",50
A nice and clean hotel but possibly not 5 star. It's felt like a 1km walk from the coach drop off to the reception desk and another 1km walk to the room. Maybe OK if you have no luggage but exhausting with three cases. The room view on the upper floors over Cotai Strip are fantastic. The check in at 3pm and check out at 11am make this hotel a sleep place only if staying one day. The Italian restaurant on the ground floor has great food and wine at reasonable prices.,30
"We stayed in this hotel for vacation during the summer. Some points that people may consider before making the choice:  1) Very small and crowded swimming pool.  2) No lifeguard on duty at the swimming pool. This is stated on the stainless steel signage in the swimming pool area.   3) we have complimentary buffet breakfast provided at G/F restaurant. However, there was too many people queuing up even at 10:10am ( the breakfast time will end at 10:30 am), we were led by the restaurant manager to have breakfast at 4/F function room. No need to queue up there, but the variety of food choice are much less than the ordinary restaurant .  4) The hotel room is cozy and clean. The bed is also comfortable.",30
Sheer Oppulence. The 2towers and location is excellent and beats any other property on Macao strip. Huge size banquet for MICE. Worth staying. I was there during the opening ceremony of the hotel and attendies were huge. What a spectacular show it was. Howsoever within a 2day event we could enjoy the best of their services from all corners and the service standards are still the same for a normal traveler too.,50
"It is really a beautiful hotel with great facilities and staff, the only drawback is the expensive wifi services, within the hotel, there are a lot of shops available to cater to your shopping needs. Nice view overlooking the whole cotai area and its interlink transportation to various casino and harbour make it easy to move around macau area, the only drawback is it does not have transportation to the city area of macau, which you have to call a cab or take the public transport.",40
"I enjoyed my stay at the Sheraton in August. The staff is very helpful and friendly. Special thank to Alex and Stefan that gave me the feeling, this is the home away from home. To the rooms, they are very nice, clean and spacious. Also the Italian restaurant serves good and authentic Italian cuisine.",50
"From checkin to checkout, we were treated like VIPs, staff were very good and friendly. Our Executive Room was very comfortable, great bed and with the Club Lounge, we hardly needed to leave the hotel. Loved the complimentary breakfast, cocktail drinks and dinner. Not much else to do there unless you gamble.",50
"We visited this hotel during the Christmas holidays. It felt like a whole new experience all together. Luxurious, neat, and really nice staff.. Would prefer it anyday over any other hotel around there.",50
"Opulence everywhere - thats Sheraton Macao Hotel for you. Agreed the place is not over the top like the Venetian, but the amount of space and planning that has gone into the construction of this hotel is amazing.  The rooms here reflect the Sheraton brand - if you've stayed at their other properties around the world you'll find their standards have been maintained. The only problem here is that the hotel property is so vast - what with The Conrad and The Holiday Inn sharing the space - its easy to get lost in the vast labyrinths.  As always food at a Sheraton property is stellar. The restaurants Bene and Xin are beyond amazing. The shopping arcade attached to the hotel offers everything from the most expensive diamonds to knick-knacks for kids. There is even a McDonalds and‚Ä¶",40
"Stayed there this weekend for a trip with friends for Golf.  The staff were helpful and the place was nice enough for the normal Macau type trip (full of mainland and Hong Kong people gambling and shopping, lots of smoke/smoking etc etc)  The gambling tables had a bit more atmosphere than Singapore Casinos and were right at reception, but Vegas, this is not...  My room was spacious and clean, and appointed quite nicely.",40
"The hotel was packed when I arrived. The check in queue snaked all over the reception area. Since I had booked the club room I hoped to skip this queue and check in at the club level. Advice given by the staff was confusing. They have two towers and the staff who told me the floor failed to mention this. Of course I had to go to the wrong tower and it took quite a while to get to the club floor, lugging my big suitcase too.  Checking in at the club floor took quite a while. Soft drinks were available but no hot drinks! I was told hot drinks would only be available from 11 o'clock. I think this is the first time a club lounge offers no hot drinks outside scheduled time.  After checking in, there was no one to show me to the lifts to my room. Again I had to lugged my bag around‚Ä¶",30
Liked everything in this hotel. Great place to relax with kids. Good food and great location. The location is opposite of venetian macau. We can walk through bridge. You can also use complimentary bus from airport to /from sheraton hotel.  Close to Cotai strip airport and Jetty terminal.,50
We stayed here for three days coz of its closeness to Venetian Macao . Cordial & helpful staff and value for money stay .Hotel has a good casino and interconnected to several other hotel . Thats a advantage one doesn't have to move out much . Shopping arcade is beautiful with presence of all major brands ,40
"Stayed here for 3 nights in Feb 2013. Room decor was ok. Nothing very spectacular and I wished they could position the overhead spotlights so that they were not directly above pillow. Room was quite clean. Bed was comfortable although its not the best I have slept on. Food court wasn't so great - best foodcourt in Macau (at Cortai Strip) is still at Venetian (which I stayed in 2009) - useful considering that Macau food options are not as plentiful as HK and definitely a lot more expensive! Lastly, service was not consistent. Met helpful bellboy during arrival and he walked us all the way to Sheraton (kinda got lost coz place is big)  ... oneof the concierge staff pointed us the wrong way to the shuttle bus pick up location on the day we left.",40
first impression was poor with the hotel check in being a mere 5 metres from the casino floor and the smell of smoke was very strong coming from the gaming area. If you're not coming to Macau to gamble i would suggest to choose somewhere other than here. On the plus side even the standard rooms are massive and the beds are super comfortable and with the complete blackout curtains and soundproof walls it was easy to get a peaceful nights sleep. Try to request a view overlooking Cotai as the view at the back of the hotel overlooks a desolate swamp and is a little depressing. Also be mindful there are limited good western food options outside of the set breakfast/lunch/dinner times.,20
"We stayed here last September during their opening and it was a disaster.  However, for this time, we could see a lot of improvements from our last visit.  Major improvements could be seen where they have more check-in points than before so that check-in and check-out guests would not be jammed in 2 points only.  Besides, the Club Lounge service was more efficient with more staff on the floor than 1 year ago.  Food variety and quality for Club Lounge breakfast and cocktail hours was better than before too. However, service can be more personal.  Club room is acceptable but can be further improved by giving better amenities instead of the standard ones.  A surprise to us is that they have the DreamWorks parade going on everyday at their property.  The Italian restaurant, Bene,‚Ä¶",40

Located at Cotai Central with Pacifica Gaming and Himalaya Gaming, right on.  Great way to spend the night in the casinos and crash when you feel like, way into the night.",50
it is a nice hotel in a good location since there is a bridge to go to venetian and just cross the street to go to The city of dream.  the room is nice and big with nice decor.  the negative is only the reception staff who is a bit unfriendly during the check in. i know that this is a big and busy hotel but that doesnt mean that you do not have time to interact to guess and  look at guess when answering the question. seems like he ( i cant recall the name) doesnt want to talk to guess and just want to finish the check in process quickly.  breakfast is standard.  the room has a strong cigarette smells when we checked in but the housekeeper quickly spray the room with air freshner and so it is ok.,40
"This Hotel is decorated in 'Earth'  tones, which has been fashionable in the hotel industry in the last few years.  All that brown makes the hotel very dull looking and it would seem contributes to the  bored looks on the face of the staff. The Feast restaurant at 3.00 pm took up to 40 minutes to serve me and my friends with Prawns Piri Piri, a Beef burger a Hot Dog. We were the only 3 people in the restaurant.  My friend thought that her massage at the Spa was excellent  We were on a one night package, in a standard room. Very average. I would not visit again",30
The location is opposite of venetian macau. We can walk through bridge. You can also use complimentary bus from airport to /from  sheraton hotel. The room is nice but the breakfast is horrible. You eat your breakfast the meeting room. I rate 3 star hotel for the breakfast.,40
"The room was spacious and the bathroom very good with a great shower. Bed was OK without being great. Lovely furnishings. It was very busy due to Asian school holiday's so this meant the pools were crowded. This is the sort of place you could spend your entire holiday in without leaving the premises. There are shops galore, over the walkway to the Venician which has some 600 shops, cafes bars and casino's. The Sheraton has two casinos and plenty of trendy shops as well.",40
"I stayed there after finding an interesting offer on the hotel's website. The room is big with a huge bathroom. The casinos are nice and the hole Cotai Central complex is well served by free public transportation services. The only drawback, because of the hotel's size, its public places like the restaurant and the swimming pool can be overcrowded.",40
"Great Hotel, very new, very clean. service impeccable. Stayed in a family room with 2 small kids. It is what you would expect of a 5 star hotel in Asia and was significantly cheaper that some of the competing hotels in the Cotai area (E.g. Venetian, Galaxy)  However, some things to improve or be aware of.  1. The swimming pools are pretty small, it can get very crowded, especially when there are crowds in the summer. I would have expected a larger pool. Many other hotels I've visited have bigger and better pools. Additionally, the water was freezing, you don't normally get that in Asia, but it felt really cold even during the hot humid August weather in Macau. It was too cold for both of my kids who felt uncomfortable getting in and staying in the water for long.  2. Crowds,‚Ä¶",40

I was upgraded to a nice suite with free breakfast and happy hour, plus free wifi. There are a lot of kids at this hotel.  They even have a special suite with 2 rooms and bunk beds and special decorations.  School will start the 1st week of September and the situation may change.  I was there on weekdays and it wasn't too crowded.  The weekend may be different.  There are constructions going on and it starts around 8AM,  I can hear the pounding, but not too bad.

As a Starwood Guest I was first offered an alternative room with a better view, but on learning that my wife and I were staying for a couple of nights to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary we were upgraded fully to a suite that provided us with luxury we could only dream of.

"First off, when you walk in, all you smell is cigarettes. It's ok to smoke in the casinos and the casino is the forefront if the lobby. The lobby feels tiny because it wraps around the casino.   It's hard to find where to enter to check in. Hoards of other mainland chinese block the entrance to the check I'm entrance. There was a worker standing there and could see I was looking for something but completely ignored me. The front desk check in was easy and painless. When I asked about wifi in the room, they said pay $30 an hour or you can have it for the whole day for $120. That was a huge disappointment.   The next morning we awoke to a tiny dead cockroach on our sheets. I was furious. When I brought it up to the staff, they said it happens and would gladly switch rooms for us.‚Ä¶",10
"Conveniency is the name. This hotel almost has it all! Good restaurants, accommodating and helpful staffs, clean room and most importantly a huge relaxing bed after a whole day walk. They have shuttle services from the Macau Ferry Terminal and the Cotai Ferry terminal. They also have buses that runs every 15 mins that brings you to hotels like Venetian, Galaxy, etc. If you want to see the different points of interest like the senado Square, Ruins of St. Paul's and other historical landmarks,then u can take shuttle for Macau Tower  which can be found at the City of dreams just across the Sheraton Macao Hotel. My kids enjoyed the pool and the shows (sponsored by Dreamworks at that time). In short, we really had a wonderful summer in Macao at Sheraton macao Cotai hotel.",40
Stayed in lot of presidential suites but Sheraton Macao' s one is ultimate and truly enjoyable. Interiors make you romantic. The suite has two large bedrooms and excellent sitting n dinning areas with great ambience. stay once and feel like a king.,50
"This was the first time I stayed in this hotel for two nights.   But my experience was when I entered the room, the size and view of room were not totally disappointed.  Extra charge for wifi in the room was required.  I will not recommend my friends or relative to stay in this hotel.   Since another hotel in macau with similar charges but better services and view than here.",30
"First time staying at the Sheraton in Macau. Must be the largest Sheraton I ever stayed. They maintain the same standard for the room we stayed.   As this part of Macau - the Cotai Strip is still experiencing rapid growth. There are many constructions going on around the hotel.   The room we stayed is right above a development that has piling work going on the whole day. Fortunately they stopped work during the night. Unless you do not use the room during the day, ask for rooms away from the construction sites.  This is more a resort hotel than for business. The buffet breakfast is provided in one of their large meeting rooms. Do not know if this is a temporary arrangement. So the atmosphere is like going to a large convention with breakfast provided compared to say a large‚Ä¶",40
"Initialy we have booked an execuctive suite for our 3 nights stay. When we checked in we where very surprised about the size and amazing suite. The only minor issue we had was the view on the bay and construction works. We went down to the club lounge kindly asking for another view, they where so friendly and decided to give us an upgrade to a deluxe suite with view on the strip and Venetian hotel.  This new suite was even more amazing and bigger the one we have booked. We have absolutly enjoyed our stay in this great hotel. (see attached pictures).  The club lounge is simply great, a very large breakfast buffet, in the evening food is served and drinks until a certain time. This was all included with the room price and is simply well worth the room price! Wifi is free of charge‚Ä¶",50

Very huge and it makes us  feel very comfortable during our 2 nights stay. I checked in in the noon, was out for dinner but when I returned to my room my sofa bed is not fixed yet. As I was told it will be fixed soon right after I left the room. Not to mention the bathroom was extremely fun and modern. A nice bathroom that we had, only cons is there isn't any hot water when we are getting our  shower. Breakfast on the last day was ok, we were queuing for the breakfast, until it was our turn the manager asked us whether our room are included with breakfast? and I said no.. So he looked at me and said, breakfast needs to pay if you want to‚Ä¶",30
"Huge hotel in a huge complex. Rooms were a standard rectangular box affair. Hotel is only a year old, already looks a little worn, I think from constant high occupancy. Suitable, comfortable but not something to rave about.   Lots of kid stuff here, including breakfast with the shrek characters and lots of meet and greets with characters from Shrek, Madagascar and other dreamworks shows. Would be a good stop over with kids.   One day I will bring my kids here. We are not gamblers and the casino sections can be avoided",40
The Sheraton is sadly poorly organized with unmotivated staff and lack of basic training. Maybe it's the gambling environment that makes all staff so disinterested and slow to act.   A very disappointing experience for the normally fabulous Sheraton chain,30
"Being the largest Sheraton, there are long walks to anywhere you want to go. It is especially difficult to get to the ""Earth"" tower for some reason from the hotel lobby. We had booked into a club executive suite room. The room itself was BRILLIANT! it was spacious, located on the 34th floor which was good. Had a great view of the Macau Airport runway. The hotel has 3 pools but we used only one of them. The club lounge is big, since it is a huge property, but unfortunately, the charm of an actual club lounge is lost due to the number of people utilizing it. Food (breakfast and canapes) were buffet style.

Great to entertain the kids, especially with a typhoon outside. All of the things in the kids' room are very well-thought and considered. It even has corner protectors on every furnitures' edges and socket covers. BEDS ARE VERY COMFORTABLE, in both rooms, I literally needed to drag myself out of the bed.

I know, I know it's free, included with the room so I shouldn't complain, what can you expect from a free service. Well, I expect better.  I travel a lot and normally stay at a competing chain's hotels but they don't have a property in Macao yet. So, I booked at Sheraton expecting similar level of service.   The problem was just a lack of choices. They had waffles but only syrup for toppings, limited breads & salad choices and the bacon looked like a pile of undercooked soggy noodles. Bacon should be crispy for heaven's sake!  I ate a plate of fruit and left. This morning I chose to skip it altogether. For me the breakfast‚Ä¶",30
"I am a loyal customers with Sheraton and SPG guest, and have been staying in Sheraton hotels for more than 50 times around the world.    However, our last two visits with Macau Sheraton were an unpleasant stay for us.  Firstly, due to the uneven air-conditioning in room, I wanna to request for an extra blanket, however, I was told that it was not available and even I requested to pay for the service but in vain.     In addition, I stayed with my room for 2 nights, however, the housekeeping rang the room bell twice to wake me up at 10:00 a.m. on the 1st morning for cleaning up, a 2-star service?     No extra toilet paper in washroom and  should I call room-services to request for urgent assistance?",20
"This is the largest Sheraton in the world. Be prepared to walk a lot to get to and from different parts of the hotel. Aside from that, the hotel has pretty nice rooms and facilities. There are also frequent shuttles to and from different parts of Macao including the two main ferry terminals. This hotel is also located right next to the City of Dreams and is convenient if you book shows (including House of Dancing Water).   Check-in:  It took a long time to find the Sheraton Club Lounge for check-in. I'm glad I found it eventually because the process was quick, efficient, and friendly. Having seen the lines on the first floor, I'm sure the wait would have been quite long.   Room:  Was upgraded to a suite and it was really big. There was a guest bathroom, a large living room, and‚Ä¶",40
"Overall he very good stay, It was a week end holiday for two nights from Hong Kong. I was with my wife and daughter who is two and half years old . Rooms were clean and tidy, maybe a little small, but I had no complaints. The Sheraton is linked to Dreamworks, so I guessed it would be good for my daughter.  Frankly I think its a wasted opportunity for them to really target families. yes they have a breakfast with a DW theme, if you pay extra. Any yes they have a lady who turns up with ballons, and organise some activities. But you really have to go looking for it. When you get into the hotel,there's not alot in the literature they give, telling you what to do.   There play area's are strickly short term interest. We ended up going to City of Dreams play room across the road which‚Ä¶",40
"We really didn't know what to expect prior to arriving but I can say that overall we had a great stay at this hotel. We LOVED the beds, they are so comfortable; the bathrobes and bathtub were also great. We really enjoyed our deluxe room and appreciated all of it's comforts especially while we waited out the typhoon. The pool was great, but the hours seemed a bit short. I think it opens around 11/12 and closes around 6/7? Not positive, but we love swims in the evening and that wasn't possible. The restaurant called Tastes in the casino nearest the Earth Tower is AWESOME! It has plenty of delicious chinese and macanese dishes for reasonable prices. We ate there almost every day. The pork chop buns, African chicken, pineapple buns, Singapore style noodles and traditional Macanese‚Ä¶",40
The Sheraton Macao is a huge quality 5 star hotel at Cotai Strip. As usual being a Casino hotel there are stacks of ignorant Chinese who think they own the place but that's one thing you have to put up there. The hotel rooms are very nice with all the amenities you would expect from the Sheraton. There is a decent choice of restaurant's but the hotel lacks a decent bar. I have stayed numerous times in Macao and would say this hotel is worth staying at. The staff are friendly and always looking to help.,50
"First of all I would like to thank Angelina Lazuardi for making the arrangements for our special occasion. From the moment you walk in your are treated with nothing but class. Would advice becoming a SPG member for quick check-in. Was upgraded to a Executive Suite which was fabulous and the Breakfast was fantastic. Although there was no reservations left for the Buffet in the hotel, the friendly staff at the ""Club"" Lounge did their thing to accommodate us. Very new hotel with a fantastic casino we didn't bother visiting any other casino as Sheratons was sufficient. Would stay here again next time I'm in Macau.",50
"We were very excited about the DreamWorks holiday advertised and booked a family suite and unluckily, the weather was stormy and we arrived during Typhoon 8. While the hotel was not responsible for the weather, the entire experience was far below average and where do I start?   The room was fun for the kids but that was about the only good thing about this entire stay. Service was dismal and everywhere, staff seemed reluctant to help, disinterested and overworked. Towels and amenities were not replenished daily; one day we were missing hand towels, another day, there was no bath mat.   We have family holidays in Macau often and we usually stay at the Galaxy. After this experience, we will steer clear of Cotai. I never appreciated the design, layout and service at Galaxy as much‚Ä¶",20
"Like many 4 to 5 star hotels in Macau, you get really good room with easy access to practically anywhere. Since it is just recently opened, the price they offered was quite tempting. Compared to other hotels that we have stayed in Macau, however, Sheraton feels lack of impression. Nothing was bad really, except for the missing in-room free wi-fi, but I did not end up with many stories to tell from our stay there.  On a positive note, the check-in and check-out process were very efficient. This was fairly important as we were trying to catch on our ferry back to HK.",40

"Having stayed in Macau numerous times, I can say that this hotel falls short. This hotel opened up less than a year ago so the standards should be high being that Macau is continuously growing becoming more competitive.   First off, I was put off by the fact that the wifi here is not free. Free in the lobby but you have to pay in the rooms. $30 an hour or $120 a day. Quite ridiculous. So needless to say, it looks like waves of hoarders in the lobby. They sit wherever there is room to, which is already limited, with their faces glued to their phones taking advantage of the free wifi. So no sitting room in the hotel. This leads to the next turn off:  The lobby is set up oddly. The casino is dead center so the rest of the hotel sort of wraps around it, leaving a narrow walkway that‚Ä¶",30
"I traveled in Macau last 4 monthesÔºåstayed in the hotel for 54 nights.Many employees  made a great impression on meÔºåthanks for your patience and passion. As a p mumberÔºåi enjoyed room upgrade every stay. About breakfast,it could be better to add some chinese food.",50
"good place to stay. But their call center heard like sleepy. and don't know what is loofa. And take long time to bring up the duvet. But still a good place to stay. upon check in, there is one handsome like duty manager, escort to counter really nice and warm. btw, the guest service luggage staff seems not so welcome.",40
As soon as we entered we were amazed by the size and scale of the hotel. We were given a priority check in as we booked from their website which saved us a lot of time. The base category room provided to us was just huge. The price was also very reasonable at 130 usd + tax which is way better then what you pay at the venetian or galaxy which is few minutes away. If the hotel provided breakfast complementary it would have been a bonus but you can‚Äôt complain as no hotel in macau provided the same. Even our check out was very quick overall a great hotel  option in macau,50
"This is my 2nd stay at Sheraton Macao, was there in month of March'13 and now from 9th - 11th Aug ... very nice property with lovely rooms ... very good location if u want to be in Cotai ... surrounded  by all other lovely hotels & mall ... venetian is just walking distance .... good food, good service ... only i though, pool are too small as compare to size of hotel, though they have 2 pools (operational) and when i was there on 10th evng, it was impossible to swim there with number of people in the pool ... also i found water very unclean, that's probably 'coz of too many people in such a small pool .... but i don't think Sheratons of the world can have such excuse!! Beautiful pool side but very small .... so advise not to be on poolside atleast on week end if you really luv‚Ä¶",40
"I couldn't have asked for a better place to stay for my first trip to Macau. The rooms were spacious, the beds were heavenly and the service was great. We were right next to the mall, right smack in the middle of the Cotai area, walking distance from many places we wanted to see. It was also very easy to book a city tour (shoutout to our tour guide Becky!). When I need to print some boarding passes for our web check-in, the people at the business center were very helpful and efficient. I highly recommend this place!  (The only two downsides I noticed are: no free wifi in the room and no bidet in the bathroom)",50
"the hotel offers quite decent value for money, although do not take the club lounge benefits, as there are no benefits and really not worth the extra money.   rooms are decent size, clean and has all you need for a couple of nights.  The hotel is part of the Sands Cotai complex and it's easy to walk around and get to adjacent City of Dreams and Venetian / Four Seasons.   There is a casino in the hotel which is pretty average too.   It was August and must have been peak season school holidays - the place was so busy with huge tour groups and kids everywhere.  Breakfast was a real free for all and due to the amount of people, a lot of the dishes were quite often empty.  Worst egg chef I've come across.  Food is very average to say the least.",30
Very helpful staff but be prepared for 'lone check in'  time... Otherwise this glitch the place is superb... Nice location... Frequent shuttle bus service... But all the eating joints close by 11... Not something you would expect... But this is true for Macau...,50
"The service, quality and facilities are what you can expect from a Sheraton brand. We arrived 2  hours early and they have no problem letting us check in. Checking out is also a breeze at the express check-out counter. The pool and sauna are also excellent. Our room is facing the swimming pool.",50
"I stayed just for an overnight at Sheraton Cotai, but what I love best about it is that I can just roam around shopping and going to the adjacent hotels to do the same!  The rooms are wonderful, clean and spacious enough! We were 3 in a room (with one extra bed!) and the ambiance was a relaxing one.  I also loved the lemony smelling toiletries!  The only black lining to the visit was the grouchy local waitress who was impolite!  My mom being the tactful one decided to just ask her how long was she working there and asked if she enjoyed her work. (She was thinking of complaining to the manager about her at first.)  Their filipino staff however, were as per usual, very nice, asking if they could get us more food.  The buffet spread was rather plain, very chinese and very indian...‚Ä¶",40
"I stayed there with my family for a night sharing two standard room. The overall feeling of the hotel facilities and decoration is good. But I would have to comment that the first step into the room, there was a strong smell of smoking. I called two times to room service and asked for air refresher. I would also give credit to the front desk staff@ Jay Liu for helping me. I encountered a problem about the boatjet tickets and he is very helpful.",40
"Stayed here for four nights with family for vacation. Superb brand new property with impeccable services!! Definitely the best Sheraton property in the world. Just a minor negative comment, if you want to have a meal through room service be prepare to wait for more than 1 hour since they are catering for about 4,000 rooms especially on the high seasons!!",50
"I am a loyal SPG member (been a gold member for the past decade) but mostly tended to use their hotels for business (but rarely the Sheraton properties) .  This time around however, given the central location of the Macau property, I decided to give it a try for a short family break..and we were so glad we did...Firstly this is a top notch property comparable to many of the higher end hotels in Macau but at a much more reasonable rate -- and you can't beat its location right at Cotai Strip and interconnected with all major attractions and major entertainment complexes (Venetian, City of Dreams, etc).  Secondly, it is an ideal property for families given their child friendly facilities (especially with their partnership with Dreamwork and the hosting of one of a kind Shrekfasts‚Ä¶",50
"We stayed overnight in Macau July 31-Aug 1.  This Sheraton is the largest in the world with over 3800 guestrooms.  The hotel has only been open since fall 2012.  We stayed in room 2405 with a nice view of the strip and the swimming pools.  Guestrooms were large.  We had a king bed with a very nice large bathroom with separate tub and shower.  As SPG members we were upgraded to a deluxe room on an SPG floor.    Complimentary green shuttle buses, marked Sands Cotai, were available at the Macau ferry terminal.  You had to exit the terminal main entrance (where all the girls holding hotel signs stand), cross the street to the hotel buses via an escalator/stairs and an underground pathway to board the buses.    We checked-in just inside the bus drop off area at the back of the hotel.‚Ä¶",50
"We had a fantastic time with the family at the Sheraton in Macau, my little one had the time of her life by having breakfast with the Dream Works movie characters...Shreik and Puss in Boots..etc. The room was huge and kept very clean and fresh, great view over the pools. Alessandro and his Club Team really looked after us, and his team were very genuine and knowledgeable.  The hotel is central to shopping and events on the Cotai strip, there is no other place I would stay than the Sheraton.  Thanks again  David Jacquie and Ivy",50
"Stayed at this hotel on Saturday 3rd August.  Arriived early from Hong Kong - bus was easy to find at the terminal and very soon we were at the hotel  Lined up the check in and were then taken to the Preferred Guest line.  As we were early (9.30) we obviously couldnt' check in but were told that a room shoulkd be ready about 11am and we could leave our luggage.  Went back around 1pm and got the room keys and the bags were sent up to the room. Stayed inm Sky Tower.

The breakfast at the ""Feast"" was also great. Large variety as expected from any 5 star property. Overall, a very pleasant stay. However, wifi is not complimentary which is a pity.",40

Plasma tv great  Room service: awesome order the marshmallow dessert with ice cream!  Locations: awesome shopping and casino downstairs  Service: everyone is amazing and accommodating!  Make sure you get breakfast included breakfast options at the buffet are second to none everything you could ever eat. Short walk to the Venetian which is why we stayed here. Venetian was too expensive. Try and see the dragon water show while your here.",50
It seemed like a Vegas-like huge hotel which is attached to two other hotels. The rooms were big and comfortable. The location was excellent as the Venetian and its shopping center are right opposite. Not as exciting as some of the other nearby hotels but was a pleasant stay nonetheless. ,50
"This looks like a brand new property in Macau, quite huge one with the casino in the ground floor. The hotel is just behind famous Venetician & Galaxy resorts and casino. The hotel itself has huge casino part of it. The rooms are quite spacious and functional the only dis-advantage which I found was there was no free wifi in the room, of course it was available in the lobby which it use be erratic due to may lot of people using. Bath rooms are also spacious and comfortable.  The break fast spread was too good including vegetarian spread and to my surprise the 3 days we stayed there use to be one indian dish was always part of the breakfast which was very good. Overall experience was very good.",40
"I seldom think of writing a review for a Sheraton hotel, but the one in Macau is definitely an exceptional.  Stayed in a Deluxe Suite, it is having an extra entertainment room when compare with the Executive Suite. When I entered the suite, I am confused if it is a Sheraton or actually a St Regis, the interior design is luxury and gorgeous, far exceed my expectation on a Sheraton.   What should I complain? Well, the hotel is too big, 4,000 rooms, instruction are not clear enough, it took me quite a lot of time to find the Club Lounge to do the check in for SPG members‚Ä¶...",40

From a McDonald's to a fancy Asian restaurant that charges $1000 USD plus, for a live Alaskan King Crab. Are these wealthy Chinese being taken for a ride. Keep your wife's credit cards and leave them at home, as there is no Walmart close by. All of the stores are Hermes, Chanel, etc. Want a purse - prepare to spend $1000 on sale.

They even arranged free of charge extra bed for being not able to provide me with a bb bed.  Very nice hotel with spacing room and toilet inside.  We also enjoyed the pool with kids and other families.  The size and depth are ok for kids, just not for adults who know how to swim.  I will recommend it to others for sure.",40

I was fortunate enough to be taken care of by Ms. Lazuardi, After many emails, ( due to my barrage of questions) she arranged to have a lovely bottle of wine and a special birthday cake, with a note from me attached, waiting in his room.

As such it is much like other casino hotels around the world such as those in Las Vegas. It was comfortable but not luxurious.

The service Nick and his colleagues provided was second to none, from the get-go Nick was in constant communication, followed up and answered the many questions I had. Nick always came up with solutions and ideas to make the weekend as memorable as possible and nothing seemed like too much trouble. Over the weekend itself (I have no idea how he managed to do this given he must have had so many customers to attend to) he always seemed to be present and visible and I didn‚Äôt once have to try and find him or track him down. He kept in constant communication, always checking in if everything‚Ä¶",50
"First impressions upon arrival are that it is big. Very big! The ground floor is a maze of shopping malls, casinos, bars and restaurants and the Sheraton is not the only hotel on the site. Finding the check in was a bit of a challenge - particularly for a weary traveller after a long journey. However, we were dealt with efficiently and quickly once the right desk was found.  Room was very good. Spacious and comfortable with a great view across the city. Breakfast was excellent with a wide choice and was included in the price.  Taipa, where the hotel is located, is some way from the ferry port and not actually in Macao itself. Taxi drive takes around 15 minutes.  Would certainly use again if and when I return.",50
"I feel that the staff members of Sheraton Macao provide very good service and attention to details, especially if you travel with elderly family members. Check-in was smooth and efficient, and they tried hard to accommodate my request for a convenient check-out time for my elderly parents. In December 2012, my sister had a bad fall at the hotel entrance, one staff member Peter W made arrangements for most of our requests to be met efficiently, such as the provision of a wheelchair, a later check-out time...etc. We were very pleased with his efficiency. This recent trip June 2013, I was pleasantly surprised when he actually recognised me at reception and asked about my family members who had checked in separately earlier. It is indeed rare to have such an excellent staff member‚Ä¶",50

"This place has it right. They are COMPLETELY in tuned to their customers' experience. We came here with 3 little ones. They have mastered the art of providing a kid friendly hotel while maintaining the high class of a 5 star hotel. We were a bit nervous about the reviews claiming highway noise. Our family suite was no where near the highway. I had a peek at the rooms that were on that side of the hotel and it is still enough of a distance that I doubt most people would have a problem. Just ask for a plug in fan and you'll sleep like a baby. The comfort, cleanliness and service make this hotel a no-brainer.",40

I stayed at one of the standard rooms a few months after it opened. Compared to the other hotels in the Cotai area the Sheraton is one of the less expensive ones. For the price you pay it delivers the 5 star hotel quality you expect. The hotel itself isn't that big but it is connect to a shopping center that links to Holiday Inn and Venetian across the road. So there is definitely lots of gambling and shopping if that's what you're in Macau for. If you plan to be out most of the time but still want the comfort of a 5 star hotel this is definitely a good choice.,50

"You stayed at the family suite with 2 young children while they have the big summer Dreamworks promotion. The rooms are perfect for families, it has bunk bed, tv and games. Kids enjoyed it a lot. When we arrived, front desk staff accommodated us with early check in. Front desk staff needs to be more familiar with the own promotion package. I was missing free wifi, qube tickets and breakfast for the children. Their also comes with a welcome packet for kids. Unfortunately, they kept telling me only one per room. I have 2 kids, are they supposed to fight for it? After I talked to the staff on the phone, they sent another staff to bring us another welcome packet and qube tickets.

They never tell you  that there are two lobbies to check in, which could have made it easier.  Also, the directions to your room are not clear, particularly if you come off the ferry bus at the back of the building you need to walk through the arcade for quite a distance to find the lift lobby.

Although its long queue but check-in and check-out very smooth. Doorman always approach to assist the direction. Free shuttle bus from airport and pier is superb. Direct connected to big shopping mall with a lot of choice of restaurants and sky bridge to Venetian! The only choice in Macau.",50
"Spent a night with the Executive Suite which was nice, well-equipped and relaxing. NO argument on facilities and provisions as they are the first class.  However, services are the issues, especially for the club lounge and spa reception.  The club lounge is not that private as it is like a restaurant serving big crowd of people during breakfast and cocktail. Not the type of privacy you could find normally on a E Floor. The individual quality of staff there need improvement.  Spa treatment was good but the greetings of reception was poor. Time to improve.",30
stayed for 5 nights. `the room service is very good much better than the Conrad where I stayed last year. my room was not cleaned well on check in but this problem was fixed very quickly.  the rooms are small and nothing fancy.,40

"I read a review and a lot commend about the room a bit small. When I check in, they upgrade me to the suit. The room was huge with living room and 2 toilet. All the staff here was very warm welcome, polite and professional. All facility was great, the breakfast was nice selection. There are free wifi everywhere except in the room.",50
"After out from Airport, free shuttle bus direct to hotel just around the corner.  Fast check in and check out by friendly staffs. Fantastic room: room is big and bed is just so so comfortable. Food: My parent just love their breakfast so much.",50
Stayed four nights in Macau for a business conference. The Sheraton complex was well situated near lots of restaurants and shops which came in handy since my suitcase didn't arrive until the third day.,40
This is our first visit to Macau. We chose the Sheraton partly because we are spg members. Our first contact with staff occurred the moment we arrived at the door. We were graciously greeted by the doormen and welcomed to the hotel. We made our way to the fourth floor spg check-in. We were greeted and led to a comfortable sitting area. A minute or so later we were provided with a refreshing cold cloth and a ice cold beverage. Little time passed before someone came with our room keys. After explaining all of the amenities we were advised that we would receive a room upgrade. You might have thought we were royalty as we were given a beautiful well appointed suite. The room was spotless and filled with all the amenities you would expect in the finest of hotels. While the hotel and‚Ä¶,50
"We recently stayed overnight at the Sheraton Macau. The hotel was lovely and the service was impeccable, especially the woman who checked us in, and the staff at the pool and on the club floor!  The concierge who booked our ferry tickets was also fantastic.",40
"We booked this Hotel just for the family suite which included a child bed and wii. Overall, the Hotel is spectacular and the staff is awesome. There are 2 reasons why I would rate this Hotel average and not excellent:  1. Had a very bad time getting to the Hotel. Once you get out of the ferry terminal, you can see signs and people from almost every Hotel in Macau. What you could not see is a sign of Hotel Sheraton. Carrying luggage up and down to find the right shuttle was a real pain. The management should do something about this.  2. Bars and Restaurants are not open late night. We came back at around 2 AM after watching the IIFA awards and we could not find a place to eat. Restaurants in the casino are open till late but not for 24 hours. Very difficult to have a quick snack‚Ä¶",30
Congratulations to chief butler Delilah and her staff for making our stay so memorable and special. The rooms were fantastic and luxurious. The bed was so comfortable and the bathroom had first class amenities. All the little extras that the staff do to make the stay so intimate and comfortable is second to none. The pool area is lovely and relaxing. The Concierge team are friendly and welcoming.  There is nothing that went wrong on this first trip to Macau.,50
"I had a the opportunity to stay in this hotel during my business trip.  The service is excellent, the room is luxurious and comfortable.  There are so many amenities and activities in the hotel, you do not need to get out of the hotel.  Unfortunately, due to my business schedule, I stayed for only a night.  I am definitely bringing my family back for a longer stay.",50
"We stayed in Sheraton Macau for about 3 days between July 10 and 13 th , A great hotel by all means, Only  request is the smoking floor the floor 26 is smelling all over even outside., just need to correct that , The inter city connectivity  faciility is superb be it taxis buses, etc.,",40
"At the time of writing this review, after midnight, a pool side private party in the Sheraton still continue and the noisy music keep my family, staying on the 17th floor, awake including my eight months old baby.  so this is the behaviour of Sheraton which sacrifices the interest of its guest and could not offer them a good night sleep.",10
"Every bit what you expect from a luxury hotel - large rooms, great interiors, great facilities & room amenities. We love the bed. If we weren't in Macau, we'd probably stay in and oversleep.   For the rate we got the deluxe room (MOP 1800), i consider the package value for money considering you get 2 ferry tickets to HK (worth HK 160 each) and a choice of buffet breakfast or lunch daily. Unfortunately, you are forced to have your meals together as you're given just one voucher that is good for two. Since I hit the casino floor the first night and opted not to join my girlfriend for breakfast, I had to pay for lunch since they didn't honor the voucher anymore.  The front desk staff failed to explain the meal voucher's particulars when we checked and that peeved me. The front desk‚Ä¶",40
"An excellent location in Cotai, adjacent to the Conrad, various shopping malls, and even the Venetian is only 10-15 minutes walk, all inside. The Hard Rock is also very nearby. I stayed in a deluxe king room which was well appointed and large. It's a huge property with two towers of hotel rooms, but a great place to stay overall.",40
"Have stayed at this Sheraton three times since it opened and I must say that each experience is better than the last, especially if you have Platinum with starwood. All three stays have been upgraded to a suite. And for a property of this size, they do somehow keep note of your preferences and try to accommodate it.  An illustration, I stayed on a Wednesday night in a room facing the pool in the sky tower. Unbeknownst to me.. there was a ladies night every Wednesday and the loud thump of the music was keeping me up. All it took was a single call and without even having ask to move room, they offered to move me a much quieter room and it was all done in 10 minutes!  Fast forward 1 month later when I was staying here again, they took note of the previous noise incident and‚Ä¶",50

The bed is very comfortable, the room is very clean and spacious even there's three of us staying and got a great soundproofing. The bathroom is clean and well-arranged. The breakfast is great with lots of choices. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I enjoyed staying at this hotel. Good value for money. Compare to hotels at Cotai Central, Sheraton Macao is quite new, with the choices of various international brand shops. And just like other Macao hotels, they got free shuttle to some places.",50
"We were on a business trip in China and we only spend two days at the Sheraton Macao for relaxing. And this was really a pleasure. The hotel was very clean and the service was excellent. I like to mention two people in particular: Alexander Wessels (Front office Manager) and Nick (Director Food & Beverage).  We really can advise this hotel even it is not located in the old town. It is not even necessary to leave the hotel, because there are several restaurants, a casino as well as a big shopping center. We really enjoyed the pool area and the restaurants as well as a special event in the evening (wine tasting). The Sheraton Macao was the best during our trip in China.",50
"My wife and I had an excellent stay at the Sheraton Macao on July 4th.  As a ‚ÄúPlatinum for Life‚Äù SPG member, I have stayed at many Starwood hotels throughout the world and this trip was a pleasure.  Frankly, after staying many times at the Westin in Macau my expectations were low and I was anticipating an average Sheraton at best.  We were planning to check in and then leave for the Venetian and other hotel/casinos.  But we never did!  We never left the hotel.  Within minutes of our arrival to the hotel, my expectations were far exceeded.  It became immediately apparent that this is a hotel that appreciates and values its loyal customers.  The place was beautiful, the facilities were great and best of all, the service was outstanding.     I‚Äôd like to recognize two people in‚Ä¶",50

This hotel location is in the part of Cotal Central Complex and in the sand cotai central shopping mall. This hotel is connected to Venetian and four season, too. We can across the bridge to reach them. This hotel has shuttle bus to go to any place at Macau and ferry terminal, too.   I will stay there, when I visite Macau again.",40
"It was a choice between staying in the center of the old town or the newer brash casino district and although there was no desire to gamble, the range on offer in the new area won the day. Having made previous trips to Macau, I knew what to expect, however, this was my first visit to the new Sheraton and I was pleasantly surprised. Getting there from the airport, bus or ferry is simplicity itself; in fact getting around is wonderfully easy, as this and other hotels have an amazing network of buses to shuttle you about. Prepare to be overwhelmed by the scale of the hotel and the other two which make up the Cotai group (as well as all the other vast complex of hotels), and allow your self some time to get orientated (a compass is useful here).

It's part of the new complex ""Cotai Central"", connected to the Venetian and Four Seasons, altogether astonishingly huge.  You can check out videos of the grand opening, the hotels and shops and shows on Macau.com when you are searching.  Only one additional thing you have to do if you stay at the Sheraton: cross the street!  You have to go outside across the street to the next big independent resort, City of Dreams, where they stage the fabulous ""House of Dancing Water"" show.  We never would have known if we didn't notice it first when browsing around the Macau.com site: the Sheraton itself would prefer you never leave‚Ä¶",50

We had two complimentary bday cakes on husband and brother in law's bday which was delicious.   We booked a 90mins signature massage at Shina Spa. It was so relax after a long hot day.

I felt that everyone knew it was my birthday and received such nice attentions, felt very special, loved it!!! The room was super comfy, it was like home sweet home, even better I should say.... Living in Hong Kong it was just a 1 hour journey but what a fantastic way to have a good break, relax by the pool and escape from the routine, definitely going to renew this experiene more often. I dont know whom I shall thank as litteraly all the staff were so friendly and professional.",50
"Lovely hotel in Macau - very pleased we stayed here.  They offered a free bus shuttle from the Ferry Terminal, and the staff were very friendly and helpful.  My main issues are:   - We had to request turn-down service, if we wanted on.  I have stayed in hotels where turn-down is opt out, rather than opt-in, and I have always had a small chocolate or something left in the room.  No such fun here.  - The hotel had three pools, one was adults only and the other two were for all.  Only one of the pools was open and no reason seemed to be given.  We had asked for directions to one of the pools, which we found closed when we arrived.  Annoying, because the person who gave us directions could have told us it was closed.  - There were no free movies on the in-room TV system.  many‚Ä¶",40

Upon arrival, we were greeted at the Club Lounge and shortly after escorted to our suite.  Make sure to upgrade to a Sheraton Club Room, which is worth it - modern urban design and very spacious!

Definitely a hotel we would return to when staying at Macao.",50

Executive Room superb only to be initially let down by noisy air conditioning that was resolved very quikly by the hotel's maintenance team.

Club Lounge resembled a large canteen area on the one side and the other side offered a more relaxed environment with large sofas and two electronic foot massage devices.  4 internet stations at end of the room. Evening cocktails offered a choice of bottled beers, red, white and sparkling wine between 5.30 -7.30pm.

The hotel is absolutely huge!! Across my travels I think the experience at the Sheraton Macao has been one of the most marked ones. The pool area was fantastic and the staff very friendly and courteous. The rooms could not have been better. I am really surprised at the way the hotel manages to keep everything to the best of its shape. We are SPG members and we were given preferred treatment and a high floor room. Breakfast spread was keeping in mind preferences of all. All the major Casinos are walking distance away. Absolutely delighted!,50
"Stayed two nights with my kid for a short holiday in this hotel.  The room, even though it is a standard one, is spacious for a family; giant flat panel TV with lots of channels. Bed and pillows are so comfortable for excellent sleep. The room facilities are of standard 5 stars.  It would have been excellent if there were free wired or wifi provided inside the room though wifi is free in common lobby area.

The staff were fantastic and could not have been more helpful, checking in and out was a breeze. The rooms were ideal, especially the family suite which has the most fantastic childrens room with bunk beds, children's furniture, toys, computer games etc. The highlight of our stay, despite the shopping, was the babysitting service supplied by the hotel.

The first time I went there with my family (husband and 2 kids) there was a party for around 60 persons so everything was ok. Food was good and the quantity was reasonable.

My husband and I stayed at the Sheraton Macao for 2 nights in June and we had a nice stay. We arrived by TurboJet from Hong Kong and took the free shuttle from the Ferry Terminal which took about 20 minutes.   The first impression of the hotel was unfortunately not good. When we arrived the bus did not park by the main entrance so there was no one outside to take the luggage. When we came into the hotel there was only a small reception however we had been informed by the hotel to proceed to the 4th floor in the Skytower to check in at the Club Lounge as we had booked an executive suite. This meant that we had to schlep all our suitcases through the mall for about 10 minutes and take the elevator up and then walk somewhat further to the club lounge. Once we arrived at the club‚Ä¶,40

I particularly liked the simple rooms but with all the modern conveniences of the best hotels. the pools were pretty cool as well as the bars but what ruined it for me were all the chinese guests that were so damn noisy and rude it made staying there an efffort. the spa staff were courteous and efficient and extremely professional in their services rendered. the business center for me was insanely far from the hotel it was actually an inconvenience to get there.  shopping wise, the stores were very limited and offered nothing like what the area of the venetian right across.‚Ä¶",40

They remembered the toasted ham and cheese sandwich and the variety of macaroons and sweets. My wife recalled the sparkling, white and red. The happy hour in the club lounge offered the roasted sirloin steak on the buffet table, which is the most popular food.

This last trip when I checked in early and my room wasn't ready yet, they tracked me down elsewhere on the property instead of waiting for me to check on the room.  They also called me to ask if I needed help get ferry tickets back to Hong Kong.  And the rooms are magnificent.  Anyone who travels to Hong Kong knows how space is at a premium.  The rooms at the Sheraton are large and spacious with tons of amenities.  And as a‚Ä¶",50
"Hotel is very nice and is located on the other side of the Island. If you are with family then this side of Macao is better, but if with friends then the other side. Hotel is very clean and has huge rooms. Very thing in the room was upto the mark, Sheraton lived to its expectation. Hotel has a huge casino where you can play any time of the day. Water is free in the entire hotel and casino.  Over all Hotel is Huge and great. There is staff everywhere for your assistance. Language is not a problem since all of them speaks in English.",50
"My first time stayed there.  Hotel is new just open last Sept.  It is huge but have indication signs you will not lost.    Hotel is more holiday feel than business.  Lobby is really crowded as it linked up to a shopping mall, lucky guest room floor is completely quiet.  The bed and pillow are super comfortable. Good soundproof as hardly hear any noise from next room.  I love their swimming pools.  Hotel has a casino which is a must have item in any Macau hotel.",50
"Upon check in: We stayed at this hotel due to Venetian was fully book during my travelling period. As my business conference was at Venetian, i decided to book this hotel room from their website since it was located just opposite Venetian. Upon check in, i was referred to their normal check in counter to wait for my turn even i was SPG member. (the staff told me ""it was the same""). For your information, the Starwood Preferred Guest check-in counter has nice sofa and complimentary drink for our partner or family to sit down comfortably while waiting for check in procedure to complete. This is absolutely difference from standing blindly waiting along the queue for check in ya. The first impression for Sheraton Macau Cotai is not good already.

"It is one of the most beautiful hotel i have been to. I stayed there for 2 Nights with my wife. I am a SPG member and even though i booked the hotel from the travel agent, i was allowed check in at SPG counter and given a free WIFI at room. The room was splendid and the service was top notch. Breakfast and lunch at the Feast was very  very good and. Highly recommended hotel at Macau",50
"This was by far better than expected! I have stayed in a few Sheraton hotels and was overwhelmed about the excellent service, the quality of rooms and food. Thanks to Alexander Wessels (Director of Front Office) and his colleague Stefan Renziehausen (Guest Services Manager) we had the best organized stay and stag do I could imagine! Not only in the hotel but also other things they organized for us were off the chart! Thanks guys for looking after us! The hotel should be proud to have you on board. I hope to see you soon in the hotel! Cheers, JP",50
Very quick check in with excellent service.  Greeted with wine and food buffet on arrival which was nice after a long ferry ride from Hong Kong. Room was spacious and clean. Hotel situated in complex with good restaurants and facilities. Highly recommended.,50
Good: -Quick check in. -Room was spacious. -Furnishings inside was luxurious! -Nice view from the room of the pool. -5 steps from the lift lobby to the casino.  Bad: -Crowded hotel cause there are many rooms. -Good service provided throughout my 2 night stay.,50
"Sheraton Macau is a sober version of the other hotels and resorts in Macau, be it the Venetian right across or Wynn on the other island. The rooms are luxurious not to mention huge, the views I got were not all that great. The location is a bit boring as there is nothing to do around the hotel other than visit other hotels around. The fact that there was no pub in such a big hotel was a shocker to me, so not loud music, dancing through the week but for Wed & Sat. We had the last room from the elevator, I good 500 mts walk one way, it gets a bit diff after a full day of sight seeing/walking around. The breakfast is surely a 'don't miss' worth every penny one pays for it. Also since the options of eating out are limited or nil (depending on where you are sight seeing), the‚Ä¶",40
"I stayed last weekend at the Sheraton Macau to celebrate my birthday & weeding anniversary.  That's  amazing experience and it was enjoyable stayed !!!!!  The Guest Service team & SPG front desk staffs are helpful & let me feel comfortable when I first met  Sheratron Macao. The room is fantastic!!  Its is so large, comfortable and clean that we have ever stayed.  The only negative  would  be about the housekeeper forgot to refill the toilet paper.  And the swimming pool is small. Apart from this , everything was excellent  in the Sheraton.",50
We spent a weekend in Macau to celebrate the birthday. It was a wonderful holiday in Sheraton that she really upgraded our room. And the most amazing was that cake was delivered exactly at the time when we came back at midnight. Although I don't know how her team can do. Surly it's a very nice experience and we will come back again.,50
"I stayed recently at the SHeraton Macau. The hotel is huge and is part of a large complex of malls and casinos. It is located across the street from the Venetian and next to City of Dreams. Check in was quick and efficient and since I am a Starwood Platinum member, I was upgraded to a De Luxe suite. The suite is very well appointed, the bed is extremely   comfortable and it is made up of a large living room and dining room, a bedroom with a king size bed and an entertainment room, which is a nice TV room with a large screen TV and comfortable ""karaoke"" style sofa I had breakfast at the Club Lounge which is the largest I have ever been. Food selection was basic but good. It included an egg station, waffles, a variety of breads, cold cuts, cheese, cereals etc. My latte was‚Ä¶",40

Breakfast is included in the package, but we did not eat in, so could not comment on in.",30
"The Sheraton may not be the Venetian, but it was still a great experience! This was my first trip to Macau and the hotel was really gorgeous inside..even though I wasn't old enough to visit the gambling area ): The room was really nice, especially the bathroom, and everything was well kept and cleaned. One word of advice though, if you are travelling to Macau during the summer, even though the weather may be hot and humid, be sure to bring an extra pair of long pants/sweater because almost all of the indoor areas in Macau are air-conditioned...to the MAX. I was freezing my butt off in just my shorts. Also, the service is really nice! They had a reception area where the staff spoke really good english so it was helpful to get some tips like where the free airport bus was/ how to‚Ä¶",50
"Family of two adults and two young kids stayed for one night. Big hotel in cotai area close to other hotels and casinos.   Seems that Sheraton pools were all closed except for one small pool. Not good. Kids wanted to swim but it was just too crowded which takes away from the enjoyment.   For a weeknight we paid quite a bit. Could have gotten room at larger Venetian.  Rooms clean, ok size.  but no wifi. A bit strange for new 5 star hotel.   Unless prices come down, we will stay at other places in cotai next time. ",30
"Stayed at the Sheraton , Macau for almost a month on and off-  Opened in September so in truth you would expect everything to be as tip top as possible . Services facilities were ! What stood out was the staff - really great effort from all concerned : So because we negotiated a club access deal ( ¬£108) a night all in , I can say for Macau it was a great deal : Would I return - yes simply because of the attitude of the staff!  The Cotai strip is :, Well I am not quite sure - shopping , shows , and gambling with a bit of China glitzy style - I guess",50
"Sheraton Macao is the largest hotel in Macau, very gorgeous and good location. It is worth mentioning that the room decoration is very luxurious and view is very good. This hotel is always my first choice in MAcau.",50
"Remarkably warm and personal service in the club lounge and at the Jaya pool. Have already booked a follow-up stay. However, ""~4,000 rooms"" shouldn't be a selling point when the amenities such as the fitness center were presumably planned and built for a smaller number of guests.   Pros: ---Club lounge staff is overwhelmingly helpful and friendly. They really go above and beyond.  ---Great food selection at both breakfast and dinner at the club lounge  ---Family suite is terrific for a large family - could comfortably accommodate two adults, three kids, plus a baby, if necessary. Unique room ... and very appropriate for a family with kids. Complimentary in-room Wii.  ---Good location - footbridge to the Venetian is convenient, although it is a long walk to the grand canal‚Ä¶",50
"I have been to Macau many times and I have to say I'm really pleased with Sheraton. Will definitely recommend it to my friends.   We booked a two single room. At the front desk we were asked to pay MOP 500 more to get upgraded to the executive floor. The upgrade entailed buffet breakfast and evening cocktail with complimentary alcohol snacks.   We were given a room on 35/F. The view was fantastic! The lovely pond with lotus flowers was not far from us. The room is clean. Beds are comfortable and we both had a good night's sleep.   The buffet breakfast served was great with a wide range of food to choose from. The omelette was our favourite.   To our surprise, the all day snacks provided turned out to be a ""mini-buffet"". We did not have to dine outside.   One minus is the‚Ä¶",40
"First time to Macao so wasn't really sure what to expect. Chose the Sheraton as the deals they were offering at the time made them around 30% cheaper than any of the other hotels. Situated on the Cotai side, it's still only a 15 minute ride by taxi over to where the Wynn, etc are all located, but being on the Cotai side it's 5 min from Macau Airport and the Tapai Ferry terminals as well as Caesars Golf Club. It's also connected by a walk bridge over to the Venetian.  Living in Singapore, so used to Marina Bay Sands and also having done Vegas a few times, the Sheraton is like a mini cut down version of any of the big hotels on the Vegas strip. First things first, it's not overly busy so check in and check out is nice and easy and you avoid the usual 'Vegas-esque' queues.‚Ä¶",30
"Even though its a huge hotel, the staff are very well connected and unlike other large properties you dont feel like your lost in this one.  The staff keep you on track around the place and the new high technology there also assists greatly!!!  the pools and gym is excellent, the food fantastic in the restaurants I have tried bene and feast.  I have stayed here many times and it keeps improving, it used to be hard to get taxis but now even  if there is a queue your only waiting max 10 minutes, but i find more and more now there are taxis waiting all the time, except for change of shift where the wait might be 10 minutes.",40
"I've stayed at this hotel twice in the past 3 months.  It's truly a great get-away hotel.  It's less than 1 year old and the rooms are top notch.  As a platinum member, I especially love the Elite check-in on the 4th floor lounge.  The service is impeccable and in my mind, there is no other hotel that I'd rather stay at when I travel to Macau.  1. Check-in process - best experience ever with the Elite check-in 2. Rooms - had 2 different suites on the 2 times I went.  Both rooms were incredibly furnished and the amenities are second to none.  I wish my home is like this! 3. Swimming pools - a big fan of both pools on the 4th floor 4. Workout facility - love the space and variety...no complaints here! 5. Lounge - wow...biggest lounge I've ever seen.

Visited the premises on a business trip. My hosts booked me into this one since it was the closest to the Venetian which was our daily meeting point. Walked into the room where to my horror the wall that separates the bed from the bathroom was covered in spit. The rest of the room was quite dirty but the bathroom looked fresh. I immediately informed them and they came to clean it. For my 4 day stay they changed the towels but never really cleaned again. NO WIFI in rooms and even if you want to pay its only available on LAN. Ridiculous if your on business just with a smartphone. The lobby offers free wifi but with the casino attracting hundreds of people at all times you have no internet and your phone bill will kill you. Breakfast seems to be an issue for everyone on business as‚Ä¶,30
"This is my second time at this hotel.  This time my husband wanted to go for his birthday.  Our room was immaculate and had no problems.  This was our first time booking a room with Club Lounge Access.  We stayed for 4 nights.  The Club Lounge was well worth it.  Full breakfast in the mornings, snacks in the afternoon and a full dinner in the evenings surpassed our expectations and our experience at numerous other hotels.  We checked in and checked out in the club.  Upon checkin we were greeted by the manager and she had us relax on a nice comfortable couch during this process.  We were offered a delicious welcome drink and stayed to enjoy some snacks and soft drinks even after our room was ready.

I make every morning some exercises and yoga and doing that I have to lay down at the floor. Being in that position I looked around and saw the chair in front of the desk. And I saw the dust from the last weeks or even months! The chair was so dirty that I got a very bad impression about the cleanliness of this hotel. Talking to my chinese friends they told me that this is just normal in China but for a me used to the eurpean standard this is not acceptable.

"I have to be honest, I was not that impressed with the Sheraton Macau. Service was a bit slow....I requested a non smoking room, and the room REAKED of Cigar smoke. I called to complain from the lobby because even the phone was unhooked in the room. So they sent someone up 20 minutes later who also agreed that the rooms smelled like smoke. It was really nasty that they even put anyone in that room. Other than that, the rooms are typical Sheraton rooms, dont expect fast room service, the hotel is so large that it takes them forever just to bring ice. Location is pretty good since its right across the Venetian which I stayed at the month prior....I think if you can spend the money, go for the venetian, their smallest room is 75 sqm.

"Travelled in June 13 and stayed here for 3D/2nights. It is located on the Cotai Strip area where u find many new properties huddled together - Sheraton, Holiday Inn, Conrad and Venetian are all connected via Overbridges. Crown, Hard Rock & Hyatt are also just 100-300 mtrs away. This property has a mall area connected with plenty of shops,a kids play area on level 2, huge stores for kids stuff, an excellent food court on level 3 -- with an INDIAN OUTLET called ARUNA's Kitchen (Don't think many other properties can boast of that). Since these were our 5th and 6th nights away from home, our Son was already craving for some Indian food, so it was a blessing!

"We just got back last week - early June. My parents and I stayed at Sheraton Macao for three and a half nights (due to late flight). We highly impressed since our first step into the hotel. Staff were overly friendly. We dined in due to this is a casino resort so it's difficult to go out and grab food.  We took the airport limo (MOP150). According to the check-in (SPG) lady, the rate was decent since Macao's cabbies tend to rip you off for no reason e.g. not giving you changes and etc. And we experienced that on the way from hotel to the airport. The meter showed MOP43, I intended to give MOP50. He said 'MOP60' so I gave the guy with the hope that he would help unload our suitcases. He did nothing and drove away with new passenger, he didn't even get out from his driving seat.‚Ä¶",50
"I stayed at the Sheraton for one night. We took the shuttle from the China border. This was a bit confusing as we had to stop at the Sands and then transfer to another bus. The bus driver did not speak English but with a little searching, we were able to find signs for a shuttle to the Sheraton. All in all worth it because it was free. We paid for a three person room but there was only one bed. They offered to move us but because we were only in Macao for one night, we said no thank you, just bring us enough towels and pillows for the night. The pool was beautiful and the hotel is in a great location with free transportation to the other part of Macao. All in all, I figured it would not be as nice as the other hotels in the area, but was pleasantly surprised. I would stay there‚Ä¶",40

"I managed to catch a very great offer online which is slightly above US$110 per night, room only, probably because they are running low 40-50% occupancy for a property of more than 3800 rooms. So, really a great deal for a property like Sheraton.   They have separate check-in area for SPG member and if you are not, they have at least more than 10 counters.   Booked and got a room with two beds, which was slightly bigger than a normal single but smaller than a queen size. Anyway, just enough for my two boys, wife and myself. But I doubt it will be comfortable if you are slightly bigger in size to share with another person.  - Wifi is not free, only if you are SPG member, but pretty fast enough to watch YouTube.  - Fantastic outdoor swimming pool with individual chalet/canopy.

The kids room come with games box, cable TV, artistic kids toiletries and well thought through design and decor. Much effort went into the design process. There were even kids size bath robes, room slippers, picture frames, lamp, kids size table and chairs  etc! And the rooms came decorated with balloons too!!!

Regarding the guest room, the room is well maintained and also surprisingly the delux suite room has theater room! The iPod dock is available in this theater room, you can relax with listening your favorite music and glass of wine.  I fully satisfied here however if you have specified destinations at Cotai strip, it is recommended to search the destinations on map before starting.",50

The pool was enough to entertain our kids (3 and 1 years old) but I heard they also have a great kids' program.       Great location - Almost in a perfect location, as it is located next to Venetian and Four Seasons.  You can enjoy a little walk outside the hotel and get to the big shopping mall.

"The Sheraton itself is a largely anonymous hotel that shares a casino and shopping mall with the adjoining Conrad and Holiday Inn on the newly developed Cotai Strip...supposedly the Macao Vegas.

As you can gather this review is as much coloured by the Macao strip as anything else. Where as Vegas has a unique character to it, Macao is soulless.

"Good:- Very nice room, big and everything is new. Nice selection of restaurant. The staff are friendly and as a SPG you get an separate area for check-in/out. It's near all the Cotai Strip area, so it's walking distance to Venetian, Galaxy and City of Dreams.   Bad:- Nothing that Sheraton can do, but the crowd should be better behave. I saw cigarette butt on the lift lobby. Half eaten apple thrown on the floor.   Not so good:- Breakfast is suppose to be served at Feast, but was redirected to Xin in day 1. I check if we can continue to visit Xin on the next day and was told that this is possible. But next day, Xin is close and we've to walked all the way back to Feast for breakfast. This was not communicated well.",40
"This was my first and probably the last time staying at the new Sheraton. I travelled with my friend for a girls weekend away and booked the Club Floor deal so we could get some peace and quiet. Sadly, this did not happen for us.   We were escorted to the Sky Tower Club Lounge..it was quiet a walk from the shuttle bus lobby...It is huge and looks like a restaurant bar more than a business lounge. One end is the dining area for bfast and cocktails and the other is a large relaxing space. In the middle is a smaller bar area where afternoon tea is served. We got checked in quickly by a friendly staff and our room was ready.   Our room was on a high floor but nothing special, it was just their standard room type. It was small compared to the Venetian and we were rather disappointed‚Ä¶",30
"We chose to stay at the new Sheraton, because of the excellent deal we got. Simple fact that drove us into what Sheraton calls its largest hotel in the world.. And I have to agree with that statement after my stay! The ground staff, and other housekeeping staff I encountered throughout the hotel were simply excellent. I could not believe the friendly service we received over our 2-night stay. I've been to a lot of 5-star chains around the world, but I have to say that the service and friendliness of the staff here are simply remarkable.  My FULL review -  Booking -  There was a great deal going on at the website of the hotel, as well as some online travel websites. I booked on hotelclub/ visa and got the standard room for HK$ 991 including all taxes!! Great offer, no breakfast‚Ä¶",50
This is my 3rd stay in this hotel and the stay experience is very good so far. The front desk staff is very efficiency and the room is clean. The hotel has a very good location and they have snack counters for kid. My friends and kids have a very enjoyable vacation.,40
"This is the second time I stay at this hotel, check in waiting time improve a lot and the staff are more effecient comparing to my first stay. But the breakfast buffet was not as good as first time, little bit disappointed. Rest are average.",40
"This hotel is good for general purposes but not friendly to wheelchair-bound travelers. The rooms are actually very comfortable. We liked the food court shops and the one swimming pool that was open. The gym is nice. It was however very difficult to navigate our elderly relative in the wheelchair from floor to floor. The elevators for the wheelchair-bound are the service elevators located far away from shops and services. We had to wheel her through very long and lonely corridors to get to them and back to civilization again. Thus although she was in a handicap-accessible room, getting around was difficult. We ended up manipulating the wheelchair on the escalators, but that was only possible because we had manpower (big family group). Since this is a Sheraton, one would have‚Ä¶",40
"The shuttle bus from Macau Ferry Terminal dropped me off at the east wing instead of the main lobby of Sheraton. When I walked in, I saw the big sign of SPG from the left hand side of general check-in counter. As there were a lot of non-SPG members, I asked the staff if there was any available staff dedicated to SPG customers. The staff told me that I would have to walk all the way to the main lobby.   When I walked towards to the main lobby, I found another SPG counter. Again there were no staff. I asked another hotel staff for help and he told me that the counter was closed as it was lunch time. But I had never seen any staff at that SPG counter during my stay. The same thing happened to another SPG counter near to the Earth Tower. The only available SPG counter was in the‚Ä¶",30
"It our first visit to Sheraton Macao it was a wonderful experience for my 5th wedding anniversary. My husband and I received warm welcome once we step into the hotel and the check-in staff attending to us was professional and could communicate very well in English. After stepping into the room, we were surprise by the anniversary arrangement made for us ( red wine and chocolate) accompany with a handwritten greeting card. Everything in the room was great. On our 2nd day, we visited the concierge to enquire on places of interest we could visit, we were glad that we were being attended by the Chief Concierge Aris Azhar whom is a Singaporean too, being Singaporean ourself we immediate felt the warm and closeness. He refer us some local places that tourists might not know and was‚Ä¶",50
"I am a Starwood fan but this was clearly ""City of dreams/Sands"" The staff were great but the exec club was so far below mainland China or Starwood managed it was laughable!  It was Super 8 or 168 in the Club level.  Why so cheap?",30
"Good Hotel, Sheraton Standards, Good Restaurants specially recommended Dynasty ( Chinese Food fine dining ). Facilities are great too like the gym and swimming pools.   The only thing I didn't like was the swimming pool service. The guys are not really proactive to ask to customers what they would like to drink or eat. menus not available. Many people was waiting for ordering for that reason.   Breakfast area also can improve as is too small for so many people. Very full and long queues. However the products there were nice like Cheese and eggs station.",40
"This is my 2nd stay of this hotel. Glad to see the improvement of the hotel overall. Room is clean & tidy. The staff are helpful & friendly. I checked-in on the SPG counter, the staff are very experience and most of my request were taken good care of. Even much better compare to the check-in in the 5/F Club Floor on last visit. I would like to say thanks for the check-in lady (Kasumi). The hotel should provide more transport to different places in Macau to make the client more convenient like what the City of Dreams & Galaxy Macau do.  If there is an indoor pool, that will be more perfect.",40
"Arrived late the staff was super polite. Had one issue that was upon checkin there were no non smoking rooms. So they gave us a Upgraded smoking room. This is usually a problem for me as, i can't stand the smell of the smoke but they asked us to check it out so we did and it was an amazing room with a very faint smell so we decided to keep it. Hotel had every store you can think of, its basically a hotel on top of a mall and casino. The weather was not great so we didn't go into the pool but the pool looked amazing. Really had no problems with this hotel at all and the staff was so nice. For the price we got $ 140 usd / night  Best deal on my trip!",40
"I've been to a number of SPG properties globally, this, by far, is the best Starwood property I have been too.   The platinum recognition is unparalleled, a lounge check in is available. We were upgraded to an amazing suite, the happy hour service is basically diner and drinks from 530 to 730.   We were travelling with my daughter she really appreciated the candy in the lounge (well, I did too).   Initially, Macau was a one time visit for us, however, after visiting this resort, we will definitely be back. ",50
"staying in the sheraton macao is such a unique experience. the staff are very friendly and accomodating with kids. it's very rare that you would find a hotel especially in a casino area that caters to the needs of the entire family, including the young ones. my daughter has declared it her most favorite hotel! would stay here again :)",50
"I was traveling with a family of 5 and first reserved the Deluxe Room with two twin beds. Upon check in, we were assisted by a lovely gentleman name Sunny Chin, Guest Service Manager. He was able to accommodate an upgrade to the Family Suite as he notice us with 2 small children. It was a very generous offer and we were quite pleased and delighted. I did hear that this hotel get sold out during high seasons, so we were lucky enough to get the upgrade. We had assistance when we first entered the hotel, so it was not a surprise when they helped us with our luggage from our car to the hotel room.   The Family Suite was spectacular and would recommend any family traveling with children to reserve this room. They had two separate bedrooms, one for adults and the other for the‚Ä¶",50
We spent one night in the executive floor with club lounge facilities.  The hotel room was not too big and the decoration was just average.  The white paint on the washroom door fell off and made the room looked dated even though it should be quite a new hotel. We went to the lounge that had very dim light and it looked like a bar rather than a business lounge!   Both the cocktails and breakfast offered large varieties of food but the environment in the lounge was noisy and looked like a buffet restaurant!  The swimming pool was not big and was crowded with people!,30
"Despite the size of the hotel, we had experienced a truly personalized treatment throughout our entire stay. The birthday dinner that had been arranged for us at Bene, was so exceptional that it brought my mother to tears. A big thank you to the entire team there. Amenities and Service is exactly as you would expect from a 5 star property. At no moment you realize that you are staying in a 4000 room hotel.",50
"This is not the first time I stayed in Sheraton Macao.  The reason for me to stay in this hotel not only because the facilities, cleanliness & location of this hotel are excellent but also the service provided by them (i.e. efficient & attentive).  I would like to specially thank Alessandro and the Guest Relations Team.   I highly recommend my friends to stay in this hotel. Definitely, I would come back!",50
"I waited a few weeks to write this review because I wanted to see if my disappointment with this hotel decreased.  However, after all this time, I am still regretting my decision to stay at the Sheraton Macau.   We chose this hotel over the Holiday Inn because as SPG members we have always been impressed with the high quality service from the Sheraton brand.   However, if I ever go back to Macau then I would definitely choose the Galaxy or the Holiday Inn over the Sheraton.     After prepaying our room in advance, we were informed by our airline that our flight had been cancelled so we would need to fly home a day earlier.  After many painful discussions with the Sheraton they were unwilling to refund our additional night. We weren‚Äôt happy but ok with this especially since we‚Ä¶",20
"This is an interesting property for a variety of the reasons. It's the biggest Sheraton in the world, with literally thousands of rooms on the sprawling property, and they're not small. As a Platinum SPG member, I was upgraded from my standard room to a Deluxe Suite that approached 1000 feet, with a media room, full living room, and enormous bathroom. Suite upgrades, from what I can tell, are far from uncommon, and the materials in these rooms are literally shiny and new. Everything is glossy and modern. These are some of the best rooms you'll see within the Sheraton system. The club lounge is enormous and almost comically overstaffed; every time I visited the lounge, I was greeted by no fewer than five employees.   The lows, though, make it clear how this is still a young‚Ä¶",30

The price was very competitive for similar hotels in the Cotai Strip.  Accommodation: Large spacious room and bathroom.  Double beds could sleep 4 pax easily.  Usual Sheraton amenities.  Housekeeping was prompt and room was clean and made everyday.    Some of the previous reviewers commented about the size of the hotel.  It is very large with different towers so be prepared for a short walk from the lift lobby up to your room to the main lobby where the concierge and reception is.

We have enjpyed the club floor at pther hotels during our travels but we both felt that it was not worth the extra money at the Sheraton. Both times we went to the club lounge we had to queue up for tables and the staff were rushing around trying to seat people. Tables were cluttered with dishes and they were under staffed, lining up beside the toilets was not pleasant. We did not enjoy the club lounge, it is dark and quite far away from the club floor rooms. There are no other benefits staying in a club room, you get breakfast included and the afternoon tea in the lounge. There is no‚Ä¶",30

We stayed in the Club room with access to the Sheraton Club for breakfast. The associates are very nice and always greeted me and my friend whenever we entered with smiles.   When we checked in on Friday, Front Desk informed us about SOCIAL HOUR in the lobby. UNBELIEVEABLE......US $15 for UNLIMITED wine (red & white) offers plus snacks (cheese, mii burgers, and ham, etc) per person. We got seated by the exclusive SPG area. MY GOD....we were PLEASED!!

"It was a short stay for 2 nights. Hotel is located in Sands Cotai central, can easily walk to Venetian, City of Dreams. Nice surprise on arrival as we receive an upgrade to suite with massive space, nice view over the Venetian. Easy to walk via many shopping mall, many dining options with also some nice food court with local choices. Free shuttle to the ferry terminal, also from city of dream you cab take free shuttle to central Macao or Galaxy Casino. Only disappointment: no free internet in the room (buth is free in the lobby) and breakfast (limited choices and so so quality)",40
"I stayed in Sheraton in April 11th to12th.  It was my mom's special occasion and hotel staff supported me to the  fullest in the aspect they could offer.   I would like to send my deepest appreciation to some of staff members.  Greg,Korean staff at the spg desk helped me with great consierations  and assist us further inqueries.So I'd like thank that.  For me I think it's a good idea to have staffs from different nations.  Think they can acconmodate guest's needs with ease in their language.  And l'd like to thank Ms. Mayden Starsfield at the spg desk too.  Since our flight leaves at mid night, we had to and wished to stay longer.  thankfully, Ms. Starsfield assisted me with great convienence.  thanks to her we could rest untill late night.",50
"We were thrilled that the guest relations team upgraded us to a family suite when we noted on our reservation that we will be celebrating our son's birthday. Check-in at the Club Lounge was a breeze.  The kids thoroughly enjoyed the kids amenities in the room (very cute kiddie bath robes!) and the pools.  There was a vast selection of food and beverage items at the evening cocktail at Club Lounge, so much that we didn't even need dinner.  The surprise birthday cake was a hit with the kids.  Staff were friendly and helpful.  Great lunch at Bene Italian restaurant the following day  -- must try their carbonara and calamari.   Overall, a wonderful stay and would definitely come back again!",50
"To those of you that arrive Macau by ferry, just want to let you know that there is a free shuttle provided from the hotel  at the Macau Ferry Terminal. Honestly, you won't see the sign like any other shuttle to other famous hotels, follow the sign for shuttle and just walk to the other side and you will see that Green Color bus, that's for Sheraton.   The hotel is actually at Cotai Strip, which you can find Venetian & Hard Rock hotel or Dream City is just near by and is also next to Holiday Inn Hotel, so everything seems just like walking distance which is nice.

"Sheraton is not normally the hotel brand of choice, nor is a hotel of this size (4,000 rooms I think) however, our stay surpassed our expectations. The brand new rooms were lovely, large and very clean. We grabbed a deluxe room for our family of four where we could put the little ones in a separate room/area. Booking two weeks earlier than our arrival got us a great discount on the room rate. Pools were fab - wish the weather was on the days we stayed! Have to agree with many other reviewers - the staff were exceptional. Great location easily accessible to all the hotels and entertainment areas on the Cotai Strip. The complimentary coaches that travelling between each venue make it very easy to get around. Would definitely book again.",50
"We were very pleasantly surprised about the quality of this hotel for the price paid.  The rooms and beds are large and of very good quality - also basically brand new.  The hotel is connected internally and via a pedestrian overpass to several casinos and shopping centres (600 shops!), including those associated with the Venetian.  Regular free shuttles (the light green buses) from the ferry terminals, airport and to and from Macau, all within 10 minutes so the location is great.  The Cotai Strip didn't seem to be that busy when we were there, and we had no problems at all waiting for service anywhere we went - apparently it is the China holiday times when the place gets really busy.  Our favourite restaurant turned out to be Yum Cha - we had a meal there every day, but there‚Ä¶",50

"The Cotai strip in Macau just keeps on growing, and there's plenty to see and do there - but the advice on the ground of a true professional is priceless. When you see the ""Golden Keys"" on the lapels of the Chief Concierge at your hotel, you know you're in good hands. Aris is the man at the Sheraton Macau, and he somehow manages the concierge services of the world's largest Sheraton (4,000 rooms) and still finds time to offer individualised service to guests. He is a gem, and his advice on what to see and do made my stay memorable. Dining out in Macau offers plenty of choice, but the ""Bene"" Italian restaurant at the Sheraton is so good that I stayed in and ate there on three nights of a five night stay.

Foodcourt also very good as we are Vegetarians.... It had a Juice Bar and Indian Food restaurant also which served us yummy Indian Dishes.

The location is good if you want to visit the Venitian and Glaxay; it's less convenient if you want to go to the other parts of Macau and so we took taxis (though you could walk to the Glaxay, take a free shuttle bus to one of the other casinos or ports and go from there).  The room was large, modern with a view of the Cotai strip.  We had access to the club lounge, where the service and food quality was, again, very good.",50

Only complaint, we were on a non smoking floor but signs of smokers - cigarette butts in the lift and lift areas. Our room never smelt of cigarettes, the opposite. Food in the restaurant was top grade - advise all to go to the Italian one.The club area was of first class standard - only wine and champagne were offered, but food was of a high standard.

The best I can say is Sheraton Macau has an excellent guest service for the size of property  it is. Everyone from front desk to the staff assisting on elevators greeted with warm smile whenever we met them. Always willing to help and very professional. Almost all of them very well versed in English which may not be the case I am afraid with other reputed hotels in Macau.      The best thing is that property has lot of green plantations that keep the air fresh & you can feel that when you come from other hotel properties back in Sheraton.  One interesting thing is staying in properties in Cotai Central is that you can simply move to other properties without any fuss and enjoy the facilities offered by other properties as well while staying at your hotel.

Well, however when I check out in the next morning,  I was told I have had breakfast in earlier time, which I didn't. And I was told to wait so that they can check what happened, that's still fine for me.

Service really is unparalleled - we have stayed in many hotels around the world and have never been surrounded by as many people wanting to help . Definitely highly recommended ",50

All associates even though housekeeping are friendly enough and always greetings with smile. Guest service center is friendly enough. Lucy who make followed up call for my mother's memory foam. Nick and Myn who from club make the courtesy by asking us our stay experiences; really care enough which make our stay comfortable!!

I can't believe that my plan was got approved in a very short time.    2 days before of my propose, I went to Sheraton Macau to have a look of my propose location. It was amazing because I can't believe a manager- Myn has already planned everything for me. I have got a chance to reserve the whole pool area. Also, Myn promoted her plan to me.

Always makes ones happy, doesn't it?    The room was quite huge with a fantastic bathroom. Had some choclates and a personalised card from the manager lying in the room. Loved that.

The location of the hotel was strategic and getting around was made easy by the various shuttle service that was available at frequent intervals.  The staff were wonderful and most important was the great housekeeping of the room which made our stay a most comfortable and memorable one.   The rain kept us indoor in the afternoon but that made us appreciate the room more than ever.  We explored the various facilities in and out of the room. We will consider going again.",50
"Being biggest Sheraton in the world.  I was a bit worried about the level of service that I may receive at this hotel since they have a casino within property and typically, you do not receive the same service at the casino property vs regular hotels.  However, I was very impressed with the level of services that I received throughout the hotel.   From the moment that I walked in, I was directed to dedicated club lounge to check in.  Cindy at the club lounge assisted me with check in and answered all the questions that I have regards to Macao surrounding and hotel facilities.

Pretty much like living at home. Free wifi with suite.   Pros: Pool party at night, casino in lobby, easy checking, SPG members get respect, connected to all the shops, easy walk to everything, shuttle from airport and ferry terminal FREE. Free water bottles. Free welcome fruit. 3 LCD tv's  Cons: No two bedroom suites unless you go for the presidential suite (which is like 10x the price), Didn't get our welcome cocktails.  Tips: Get SPG membership so you can check in easier and faster and I think you get free wifi with SPG, you also get free breakfast. Go see the Dancing Water show, it is amazing.",50
"The hotel was full and initially check-in staff were unable to find us 2 rooms. After a little time we were upgraded to a presidential suite, which was incredible, with amazing facilities and spotlessly clean. There was a good variety of food at the buffet breakfast and the staff were friendly. The location is ideal for the casinos and House of Dancing Water. Easy coach transfer between Cotai ferry and the hotel.",50
"A great 5 star hotel, great service n convenient. I stayed in the family room, spacious bathroom and huge children room. Amenities were refilled everyday and free wii for my son to play.  The only thing which disappointed me was no free wifi. A 5 star hotel should provide free wifi instead of chargeable",40
"I stayed with my wife and kid in this relatively new hotel for a weekend in spring. The check-in process was very smooth and service was great. The reception offered free wi-fi access and it was a nice surprise. The spa was another good experience. The room was spacious, neat and clean. The hidden gem was the gym which was full of brand new equipment and the treadmills were great with integrated AV. Since many guests are going to the casinos for fun, it was definitely quiet in the gym for those that like some exercises during their stay. The only minor problem was getting taxis during evening dinner time. If you want to go to town, one tip is to walk across to City of Dream and they have free shuttle bus every 10-15 mins to go to MGM Hotel which is in downtown Macao.",40
"I stayed at the Executive Suites this time.  The living room, bedroom and bathroom were all very spacious and comfortable.  It's so cozy that I didn't even want to go down to the casinos.  The Guest Relations staff were super nice, friendly and helpful as always.  It's my second time staying at Sheraton Macao already and their hospitality made me feel like I want to go back again and again.",50

Location is nit the best but with a taxi you reach easily any other hot spot. Fast check in on SPG guest with a great smile. The Bedroom is large and very clean. Room service was fast and good. Many opportunities for restaurant. Quick check out. All good!!",50
I had a stay for one night in a Club Room which was well decorated and comfortable.  Great pools with lots of space for rest and taking photos.  The greatest benefits was to be able to use the Club Lounge where you can have all days snacks and drinks.   Will recomend this hotel to friends.,40
"Professional standard of services from their friendly staff and the satisfactory food quality made me staying at this hotel a most wonderful and comfortable trip that I ever had before!!   I am not a gambler, however, it was really convenient to get down to the casino which attracted me to visit few times during my stay.   Though it was a Easter holiday, lines in check-in/out, lobby area as well as the shopping mall were in good order.  Less time to do the check-in/out which limited visitors to wait at the open area.  The shuttle bus services almost covers all areas of Macau, wherever you go, it is always connected!!  I also enjoyed spending 3 hours in the spa too, the Thai massage made me relaxed and recharged against the tensed business life in Hong Kong",50
"Stayed with husband and  toddler for two days in early may. The decor, services, location all were great. A special mention about Mr jay leu who was very helpful , also gave us free access to wifi on request. Vegetarian food was easily available at the aruna kitchen at food court. The entire place was so huge that would often take time to find our way. Most of the hotel staff understood English so communication was not too difficult. Highly recommended stay.",40
"Sheraton, best hotel ever, staff great, facilities and location amazing, room very large and equipt with all thinkable facilities, great value for the price. Excellent in all areas, want to return there asap. Easy access to the Venetian and city of dreams all in walking distance. The show the dancing waters is very much recommendable, the casinos are amazing and very large, the hotel complex sands cotai center offers a lot of entertainment and it is that big, that you need a week to explore it all.",50
"As is the case with many of the hotels in Macau, the hotel is BIG, getting to the pool takes best part of 20 minutes and one needs to carefully follow the signs not to get lost.  The hotel is centred round the casino, and if you are the sort of person that want to grab something to eat after 10 or 11pm, the only options is the casino restaurant which is more of a fast food place.  The view from our room overlooked one of the many construction sites, but Macau is just one big construction site so this is intended to highlight the fact rather than as a criticism.   Staff in general were good, however on several ocassions the coffee making machine was not cleaned nor the cup and glasses, but this can be expected in what has been a very rapid development in a place that has limited‚Ä¶",40
"The lobby area is spacious but not too huge that you will feel like you need to walk a thousand miles to your room from any entrance.  All staff are friendly and helpful, the room is nicely decorated and we were given a room with connecting kids room, our baby loves it.  The mall connected to the hotel offers enough entertainment for me and my baby.  The lift lobbies are guarded and we feel much more secure as they check all the key even though it's not the highest security level but at least they care and try their best.  Check out was smooth and I am glad that they behave like a five star hotel and did not ask us to wait for them to check our mini bars.  One thing that need to pay attention to , is the shuttle service, we were there during the Easter Holiday and the hotel is‚Ä¶",40
"All the staff are really friendly, sincere and helpful from the momen we checked in to checked out.  The hotel is new and cozy, the room service is excellent.  After returning from dinner, our rooms are tidied up with new towels.  We stayed in a suite with a living room and a spacious bathroon. My 3 kids (age 1, 4, 4) all enjoyed playing inside the room and taking bath in the beautiful bathtub.  The location is convenient.  It's also easy to take taxi or shuttle bus to go to different tourist attractions.",50
"This hotel is huge with 2800 rooms but they manage it very well. Location is great with plenty of shops and places to eat below in the mall.  There was a macdonals at arrival next to the check in desk., This scared me at first but then I realised this is the land of gambling and it kind of fits in.. I was really impressed with the rooms. I'm a noise freak but this hotel has real thick walls and a heavy door. Had a good sleep..  Great for a night or too if u are brave enough to tackle Macau. ",50
"I believe this is Sheraton largest estate in the world and it is big! Many upper class stores and it is linked to the Conrad and the Holiday Inn.  Service was good, at the check in, Lilian helped us and explain the area as a SPG member we got free wifi which was really. Otherwise it cost you 240 MOP per 24h.   The room was large and clean, we really enjoyed our stay at the Sheraton, the service was perfect! Just to give a small example, one evening we wanted to take a taxi to Taipa for dinner, we only had the address in Portugese and the taxi drivers could understand that, the staff really takes the effort to find someone who could translate that to Chinese. It's the small things that can make a stay perfect! ",50
"What more can you say every hotel is a big casino hotel in Macau!  This is a hard review for me because I am a non smoker and I have never stayed in a more disgusting environment than a smoking allowed hotel!  This is normal for this part of the world but I'm warning you don't go to Macau if you don't smoke!  Okay so trying to put the smoking issue aside......this is a huge complex, however the staff were wonderful, reception was efficient and polite, concierge were helpful and nice, staff in Bueno Resturant were lovely, the hotel was very clean.  I had a non-smoking room and thank goodness for that!. The rooms are huge, modern and smartly furnished, great huge 'hotel' bathroom.  It was clean and comfortable.  I ate at the Italian resturant Bueno and it was very good. You can‚Ä¶",40
"I had a really wonderful and fantastic stay in this hotel.  I have stayed in several  5-star hotels in Macau and elsewhere but this one is really excellent, and I would recommend it to anyone who looks for modern, luxury and high professional hospitality!   I stayed in a deluxe suite at 33rd floor, the room was spacious and modern, with sitting room equiped with high class AV system and free wifi access. two separate toilets, a very large bathrooms, shower and a comfortable king size double bed.  Everything in the room is very clean and tidy.   I chose a package that included free breakfast or lunch.  I tried the buffet lunch and it was great.  All the staff I encountered was very nice and helpful.  Everything is excellent!",50
"what a great hotel !i want to express my appreciation for the Superior service i received during my and my friend stay. In particular ""Gabriella Leong "" and ""Joao Calado"" Who work your front desk, were very helpful and deserve a great deal of praise for their excellent customer service.  Kudos to you and your staff for making my stay a great one- i will definitely be staying with the sheraton hotel again.  Thanks Gabriella and Joao- You made our vocation great , really helpful.",50
"Our welcome started much before we actually checked in the hotel. The Sheraton team send across an email welcoming us, sending across weather forecast for that week. As a Starwood Preferred member, I was also mailed a map showing the location of Starwood Preferred Member Reception (open from 0700 to 2300 hours), which is conveniently located in the main lobby. The hotel wanted to confirm arrival time and any special requirement of ours, so as to keep the room ready-what a nice customer friendly touch. The taxi from the Macau ferry terminal took about 30 minutes to reach the hotel at 10pm. We were swiftly escorted into the hotel lobby, the luggage taken care of.       We were delighted to get 2 interconnected rooms, as requested earlier, to keep our family of four people together‚Ä¶",50
I have stayed in every 5 Star hotel in Macau and this is the best by far! Winnie in front desk was amazing she help us out so much! Sonny and Brian in the lounge where so helpful and just wanted your stay to be number 1! The hotel is very very clean and so much to do if you have to pick a hotel pick this one you wont be disappointed! 5 STAR all the way.....,50
"Spent a marvelous birthday night at Sheraton Macau! When we entered the room, we can hardly believe our eyes! It is far more than our expectation. Excellent room with stylish decoration! The room is very big and clean. Extremely love the huge bathroom with both bathtub and standing bath area. The bathroom is in modern decoration equipped with all necessary amenities. The bed is very comfortable. Staffs are very friendly and provide professional service, which is a bonus to the hotel! We would definitely choose to stay at this hotel in the future.",50

Sky and earth towers, swimming pools and shopping centre with lots of restaurants, just open the big kou fu food court a complete kind of food from allover this asia region.  As others macau hotels, this hotel named sands cotai hotels also provided free shuttle bus to many place starting at around 10 am to 11 pm  quiet place compare to venetian, even the shopping mall and the casinos too  Nice room w bathtub and shower too  ",40
I spent two nights here and certainly my Stay in this Hotel is Awesome. They satisfied my formula for a memorable experience. Great Hotel + Quality Treatment for SPG members + First Class amenities + Great Staff + Good Housekeeping = Overall memorable Stay,50
"I recently spent 2 nights at the Sheraton Macao which is located on the Taipa island side of Macau, and is part of the City of Dreams complex. The first thing that strikes you upon arriving at the hotel is the enormity of the complex. It is billed as the largest Sheraton in the world, and this is apparent as soon you enter the doors.   The check in process was quick and efficient, and i noticed quite a few check in desks available for busier periods. I was given a room in the earth tower, and although it was 4-star at best, the room had everything that was required and is extremely good value for the rate they are charging, which is amongst the cheapest in that category. The only problem i did experience with my room was i experienced an allergic reaction to the carpets in the‚Ä¶",40
The Sheraton property at Macau is a great new property on the Cotai strip just adjacent to the Venetian.  The interiors were great & the staff was superb.They upgraded us to an Executive Suite room on emailing them & mentioning it was my mother's 60th birthday and they even sent a cake as a special gesture to her room.Their guest relations personnel emailed me back the very next day saying we have been upgraded ( they upgraded 2 rooms !).  The only disappointment was the breakfast which has very limited options for vegetarians.  Also the swimming pools are extremely shallow (maximum 4 feet) and hence cannot be used to actually swim.  But overall is a fantastic new property and highly recommended.,40
"The strongest point is the quality/price relation, which compares quite favorably with other Cotai properties. The rooms are very well appointed, although not extremely large. The bathroom is in fact comparably larger than the room. Nice pools, too many good food outlets such as the Bene Italian restaurant. There are various shortcomings regarding tv channels. In fact, I had a triple hit: the local tv TDM Portuguese language channel (a serious absence for the many Portuguese-speaking visitors for whom this is their main connection with Macau news), the TDM sports channel (which broadcasts champions league football for free in Macau in HD), and the Bloomberg financial channel (I do not enjoy the shouting wackos of CNBC). It also happens that the tv is flat panel but no channel is‚Ä¶",40
Thank you their excellent services from my stay. Enjoy the Sheraton Club time eventhough just one night there. Warm welcome at the SPG counter.Very detail when i make my reservation though the phone. Sure i will go back to stay. Please keep it up.,50
"When I first contacted Sheraton about my special requests, I thought I have to wait for a few days until receiving any response, but instead I received an answer the next day from one of their guest relation team, who was very efficient and kind in responding my emails and making everything possible... especially when I pre-ordered my IRD food just a week before my arrival. I just checked out the restaurants menu on their website and send an email saying what I would like to have when I arrive and that it should be in the room, coz  some of the items on the IRD menu won't be served after 11PM, and also my friend recommended me to order from the Italian Restaurant - Bene. Even though the food that I pre-ordered was not in their IRD menu, but they still made an exception because‚Ä¶",50
"My hubby and I spent two days one night at the hotel on Sunday & Monday in April 2013.     (1) Room (5 stars) - Clean, tidy, furniture of high quality, no nasty smell (in non-smoking room), bed - Very comfortable, pillows, mattress of good quality...  Usually it took me around ten minutes to fall asleep, however  I fell asleep fast on that bed... SOUND asleep... It was not because I was very tired... but solely because of the bedding....    The temperature was comfortable.  The ventilation was excellent.   In general,   LIKE x 100  !!!  (2) Buffet lunch at FEAST (3.5 stars) - During our visit, Taiwanese food was being promoted.  The ""Sam Bui Chicken"" (Taiwanese Stewed Chicken) was NOT up to standard.  The herb flavor of Basil was no where to find...   The Chinese pancakes...‚Ä¶",40
"This was my first stay in Macau as I had some free time and it is located very close to Hong Kong. While I Macau did not meet my expectations compared to the glitz of Las Vegas, the Sheraton is located well and the hotel provides 5-star luxury accommodations.  The rooms are large, the hotel is walking distance to several other 5-star properties and close to the World of Dreams that has the Water Show.  Restaurants are available although not Las Vegas style in terms of the varied selection.  If I were to come back to Macau (which is doubtful), I would select the Sheraton again.",50
"We booked this hotel due to its location. It's bang opposite to the Venetian and walking distance to the City of Dreams. The hotel staff are polished, smart, efficient and helpful. Being an spg member, we were upgraded to a suite on arrival...that was awesome. We were given delicious macaroons as welcome gift. The hotel provides to and fro shuttle from the ferry. The hotel runs shuttle service to other hotels too, within its vicinity.",40
"It is my first time to choose Sheraton as my stay in visit and it does not make me down. Very convenient to travel from hotel to Macau scenic spots by its shettle buses or taxi and it is very close to the Hardrock Hotel, World of Dreams Hotel and the Venetian. So you will have a chance to visit several different places. It has its own casino and shopping mall, as well as restaurants. Staff are willing to help at any time and you will find almost no delay when check-in and check-out. It will be my first option in my next visit.",50
"My second time in this excellent Hotel, the first time It was 6 nights and in this time just one night with my 3 kids and my wife. We are living in Zhuhai just in the border from Macau. So we know all most the Hotel there and It is not better than the Sheraton Macao. Staff service, guest relations (Ivonne), room, food etc.is just excellent. My family and I we going to be in this Hotel every time. XIE XIE",50
"Did not expect this is a style of new furbished Sheraton. I expect more to the brand of Sheraon.  In terms of Location, it was great as connected to other hotels and casino.. however, too packed in the lobby and seems like a four-star hotel for guestroom corridor.. Room size was large, offer double-double rooms which I do expect.. Bathroom was not clean enough.. would rather choose to stay Conrad for next stay",30
"My Husband and I stayed in the Sheraton Macau for 2 nights in April 2013 as we had to leave Hong Kong in order to activate his visa. Following excellent reviews on trip advisor and recommendations from friends we picked the Sheraton, and I'm so pleased we did. I would not hesitate to recommend it to other travelers .  When we booked we joined the SPG scheme (which is free) - I recommend you do this, as you get access to a special check in & concierge area. We were checked in by a man named Legend - and he really was! I mentioned on the booking form that we had been recently married. To celebrate our little ""honeymoon,"" the hotel upgraded us to an executive suite (which I have to say was one of the best hotel rooms I have ever stayed in - luxuriously appointed, very comfortable,‚Ä¶",50
"The sort of place that you feel sorry when your leaving and want to come back as soon as you step outside. Would certainly recommend it. Has a feel of luxury where ever you go in it, casinos are excellent, food too. Didn't venture to the leisure facilities but maybe next time.",50
"My family came to Macao to attend my wedding and as always, they prefer to stay at hotels run by Starwood.  Even though my wedding was not held in Sheraton, the manager there (Nick) made special arrangements to upgrade our rooms to one of the Deluxe and Premium Suites, with breakfast and cocktails every day.  When I first entered the room, I was WOW'd by how big and nice it is.  The design of the room is clean and stylish.  It feels like a luxury apartment with a living and dining area, a media room, and a spacious bathroom.  There are TVs in the living room, media room, and the bedroom. Breakfast and cocktails were served with foods from the east and west.  Service wise, as my wife and I was busy running around getting ready for our wedding, concierge was always there to help‚Ä¶",50

"This is my first stay in Sheraton Macau and indeed I am impressed with the nice and responsive attention given. All my prior arrangements requested before room confirmation are met and the warm hospitality extended befits this Sheraton branding.Most of my views and experiences are pretty much the same as posted by MDixon333 and it makes you feel you wish you could go back and enjoy them again whenever you have the time for it. Keep up, Sheraton Macao! See you .....",40
"Our family stayed at the Sheraton Macao for 2 nights in April 2013. Our requests at the time of reservation were met and confirmed before our arrival. The best part of our stay was the exceptional service provided by staff, and the service was consistently good with every encounter, from check-in to check out. The staff at the hotel are friendly, eager to please and helpful. We were always acknowledged and greeted by all members of staff and offered help when we needed it.  The family suite was an absolute treat for my three children, we had a special kids welcome with ice cream and balloons and the children were utterly delighted. Throughout the stay, we were impressed by the ‚Äúextras‚Äù for the children. The children were given little gifts in the room, entertained by a lady‚Ä¶",50
"I have stayed at Sheraton Macau for 4 times in the past 2 months, coming along with groups in size of 100-300 pax, I have experienced the best concierge team in Macau. From the first step into the hotel lobby, they always welcome you with a warm smile from the heart regardless of early in the morning or very late at night, you can feel their initiative to assist and endeavor to satisfy your needs. As a hotel with more than 3000 rooms, the way they handle luggage is impressive and efficient. Compare to other hotels in Macau, they are the best. Not even the Grand Hyatt Macau or W Hotel Hong Kong can rival (not about the hotel size but the service provided)   Not comparing among the other Sheraton Hotels service standard, but I would have to say Sheraton Macao has given me the best‚Ä¶",50
"I'm a platinum SPG member and spend more than 60 days in hotels a year mainly sheraton because of value for the money. I've stayed in Sheraton from Salt Lake City to Los Angeles, Hong Kong to Taipei... In my opinion this is by far the newest and best equipped sheraton around.  Their check-in service was seamless, theres even a dedicated check in area for elite guests. Price is very reasonable for the quality you get. The only drawback is that its not very close to the ferry terminal (although theres a shuttle). Although its close to the airport. Was only here for one night, but I dont mind coming back specifically for this hotel.  Immediately after Sheraton Macau, I moved over to Sheraton Hong Kong and that hotel literally felt like a third world country for triple the price,‚Ä¶",50

Common free shuttle is available just out of the Ferry arrival hall ( across the road and onto the left side parking area ).  The drive is about 20 minutes to the hotel.  The Cotai Strip is infact a reclaimed land area with a cluster of hotels ( Sheraton, Conrad, Holiday Inn, Venetian, Hard Rock Cafe, Grand Hyatt, Galaxy, Banyan Tree, Four Seasons ).  All within walking distance and some are in-fact connected by bridges.  All the hotels have casinos and that is the big crowd puller.

Upon entering the room, there are a birthday card handwritten by the guest relations team and a note stating that there is a cake in the fridge compliments from the team. My family, especially my aunt who was the birthday girl was very thankful for the kind gesture.

"Went just before Good Friday and avoided the crowd, I personally have been to the Taipa side a couple of times recently and have stayed in different hotels for the weekend break. Compared to Westin Resort which was also under Starwoods, the class of service was really different... last time I was in Westin and people were pushing-in during check-in and check-out and they were under-staff so they could not control the situation, and not to mention I was forced to take a taxi because I was bumped-off from the free shuttle (you can refer to my other review)...

"Great stay in the family suite at Sheraton Macau.  From check-in to check-out we were welcomed and assisted by wonderful friendly staff.  The hotel is beautiful and the family suite was perfect for growing children.  Our kids had their own room with bunk beds (twin over full), video games, and bathroom.  The decor was a bit babyish, but my 8 & 10 year old didn't mind in the least.  They took full advantage of the kids club activities and pool.

"One of the many hotels situated in Cotai, this will definitely leave you with more good memories than you thought you would have. This is not only the largest Sheraton in the world, but also possibly the most grand in terms of ambience inside and of course the casino!   The hotel staff is extremely courteous and helpful. And, in a country where not many people know English, surprisingly, each one of them does! Breakfast spread is lavish.  Located right in the centre of Cotai, this offers you an amazing shopping experience if you are looking for the world's finest brands in the most swankiest of shopping plazas.",50
Very quick response and nice club members service.let the whole trip more comfortable. Let macao being more interesting. Spg members is valued.and will being first choice in macao.hope back soonest.

Only two + one (for disabled) shower cubicles in the fitness room!!  (Remember that there are over 6,000 rooms in this hotel!).",40
"It was my third time stay at Sheraton Macau. So far it's the best hotel in Macau because Sheraton offers the best in term of services, value, customer services and  food quality. I booked a King room for a good deal HKD 690+tax that's around USD 100 a night. Usually it costs about  USD 120 to 200+tax. During holiday season will cost more.  Once you arrive Macau ferry Terminal. You can catch the Sheraton/Conrad/Holiday Inn free shuttle bus directly to the hotel. Took about 10-15mins.  Check in at Level 4 Sheraton Club Lounge.

They are of different class, and of course some are better in terms of room size, facilities and views because they are higher class hotels and more expensive.  In all of them, Sheraton Macao remains my first choice in terms of value for money.  The check-in counter (no matter for general guest or SPG members) is fast and efficient, every staff is showing me a warm welcome, the room is clean and comfortable, and facililites inside the Cotai City are just right.",50

"When it comes down to finding an hotel in Macau, there are just too many options.. We've been there to various hotels on the Cotai strip and based on our experience that star rating or size don't always equate with friendly staff.

We arrived with 2 families and 4 kids, straight out of the ferry, we caught the free shuttle to make our way to the hotel within 10min. Right from the lobby SPG members are greeted.

"Overall very good. The strong point is that I can choose breakfast or lunch buffet. I chose lunch buffet which is very good and better value. The decoration there is very splendid. Room is very tidy with great bathroom. The spa massage is great with good environment. There is a jot jacuzzi at pool but is still not hot enough in cold winter. The Bene restaurant is great, with good environment and good food.",40
"I was planning trip for my family a couple of week ago. My mum and granny were with me. I always feel saver keeping my family close with me and I called the hotel asking for connecting rooms. I am sure you would agree that we all expect hotel staff to say, ""Yes, we have noted. If you are lucky, you will get one at check-in or the last hour before you check-out.""  No. Not for Sheraton Macao Hotel. The staff so delightfully tell me, ""Mr Chew, we so look forward to you and your family visit. Your connecting rooms are confirmed."" I didn't believe what i heard and i have to reconfirm few times. Alas, when i checked-in, my connecting rooms were waiting.  This was one of our best trip, ever.",50
"My husband and I  felt an immense gratitude to Sheraton Macao Hotel Guest service Manager Team.  Especial for Manager  Monica Zhang's thoughtful concern.  We stayed at this Hotel in March 27, 2013. When we reached, the front dest staff  were professional friendly, helpful, and was able to handle a guest's needs. the staff always had a smile on their faces.  On arrival, we were delighted to received Manager Monica personal hospitality with warm salutations.  The room which was comfortable and spotless cleaned with fantastic view. Great hotel, excellent staff, and great facilities. Everything perfect and excellent.  Service impeccable and very prompt. We were relaxed and enjoyed to stay.

"Brand new hotel, center of all action, comfy beds, friendly staff, nice pools.  Wanted to try something different to the Venetian and we were not disappointed!  Stayed in a deluxe twin.  At half the price, this is a good bet if you want a bit of luxury without breaking the bank. Only downside is that wifi is NOT free in the rooms (big disappointment in this day and age) so for those who do need it, be prepared to pay extra.",50
"I would like to share what a wonderful experience I had during my short stay back in December 2012. Admittedly I was worried when I first learned this was the largest Sheraton in the world, as I had stayed at the largest Marriott in Orlando and found that experience to be VERY poor.  However, this hotel is truly exceptional. The room was top notch and the staff was very accommodating. Walking around the hotel and adjoining areas was an experience in of itself as everything was super ornate and beautiful.",50
I have been stayed there 2 months ago..the hotel is average... the facilities seems not new even they just opening not longtime... But it is very rediculous that I havent get my accommodation deposit back yet since 2 month... they keep telling me just 5days..5days...and that is not their fault for this problem... i have to say the service is suck!!! how they treat their guest?  or they dont do breifing for work?,20
"This is currently the biggest and newest hotel in Macau.  The Sheraton is in the same sprawling complex as the Conrad and the Holiday Inn, interconnected by a huge mall, and connected via footbridge to the Venetian, so location-wise it is quite convenient.  When we arrived the hotel, we saw that there was a huge queue to check in as it was around  Easter holiday, however, they had a separate line for their SPG Elite guests, as well as the option to check in at the Club room on the 4th floor.  So we were able to avoid the long wait.  We had multiple rooms, and even though they were sold out that day, they still did their best to take very good care of us, and provided one of the rooms with a very nice upgrade.  Staff in the hotel was very friendly, and when we ask for directions,‚Ä¶",40
"My family and I just returned from 4 days in Macau, at the new Sheraton.  The hotel is beautifully designed, luxurious yet comfortable, with great health club/spa, and great happy hour/breakfast facility (we opted to buy the SPG Club option).  But what was the icing on the cake was the really good, warm, personal, attentive service of the Sheraton staff.  It rained the entire time we were there over Easter, but there is lots to do nearby - in the hotel, the adjoining malls and other hotels (Venetian, COD) - or the casino, if that is your interest.",50
"I must have stayed in almost all venues in Macau already. What I really liked is that this is a new property and not as 'used' as other properties on the Cotai Strip. Still, you have easy access to the adjoining properties and a nice 3 storey shopping area. The Hotel has over 3800 rooms now and sometimes checks in over 3000 people a day according to the front desk staff, but it is the second time I stayed and never noticed! There is staff to great you right away and everyone is most forthcoming. It feels like you are checking into a regular hotel and not such a massive behemoth.",50
"One of te Best Hotel to stay in Macau, step into the lobby, to queue for checkin, here the staff will waved you over the moment to any of their counters that are free. I was approached by one of the them and was asked if I'm a member of SPG (Starwood Preferred Guest) I replied I was, even though knowing that my SPG may expired in time history. Never the lss I was directed to the SPG checkin, this where the fun being, a Portuguese born Macau young beautiful receptionist check me in, giving her my passport and hotel booking, she finished my checkin in less and in comfortable time.

"Booked a 2 night stay at this hotel about a month in advance. Paid up front for a hell of a deal...just a bit over $100 CAD a night for their cheapest room. Upon arrival, we decided to grade to the Sheraton Club which included access to their club lounge (killer deal, includes breakfast, snacks and drinks all day plus 2 hours of all you can drink! from 5:30pm to 7:30pm) upgraded room on higher floor all for $500 HKD a night. We were travelling with a 3 year old so the convenience of breakfast in house and snacks all day is a major selling point. Walking distance to the Venetian and the City of Dreams. Very new hotel so everything in the room was in tip top shape, great bathroom, great house keeping, zero complaints other then that the staff is a little bit inexperienced but no‚Ä¶",50
"After having read all of the very positive reviews about the Sheraton Macau, I was really looking forward to our stay. However, I return home rather disasppointed by the who experience.   The hotel is new and as such it looks great. I have no complaints about the ""hardware"" (ok, I have one, which I will mention below). The hotel rooms are adequately sized, if not very large. The facilities are all very good. The bed is extremely comortable and I slept very well both nights we were there. The bathroom was large and had all of the essential facilties. The toilet itself was slow to fill after use and a little noisy, but no big deal. The only issue I have with the room is the soundproofing to the corridor. The door is very thin and basically you can hear everything that goes on in‚Ä¶",20
"After living in macau for six years prior to this visit we were tempted to stay at the lapa (old mandarin) or at city of dreams from previous experience. When we were searching by price we were surprised that the Sheraton popped up for such a reasonable rate so we quickly booked. Frankly, we weren't let down either. The front of house staff was probably the best I've ever seen and wanting to help with every need from the moment we showed up to the time we left. The room was very nice and clean but the view was not spectacular. The linen was suburb and the housecleaning was spot on every time. We played in the casino a bit too and seemed to be reasonably set with some popular games scattered through out the floor. If there was one complaint it would be the temperature set to‚Ä¶",50
Stayed for one night in a family suite which was sold as Romantic package and upon checking i was made aware of it. Te suite was great since it consisted of two rooms and one was completely redone for kids and my kids loved it. They enjoyed the entertainment program of the hotel and the pools. Nice place and good food avaiable. Great weekend trip,40
"Friends arranged an Easter weekend in Macau for a celebration and we stayed at the Sheraton. It was everyone's first time.  Caught the free shuttle at the airport for the hotel which was a short 10-min ride away.  We did expect a busy crowd for the holiday weekend but were pleasantly surprised to find the check-in desk queue fairly short.  We got rooms on the 13th floor and on the side facing the pool which looked to be on the 10th level or so.  Beware though of rooms 1333 upwards as the view is not directly of the pool but of the power generators etc on the roof top next to the pool.  Quite unslightly but some may not mind if they don't spend a lot of time in the room and look out the window.  The Deluxe room is pretty standard in terms of size, facilities etc.  Personally, I'd‚Ä¶",30
"For our family vacation in Macau, I booked Sheraton Macau Hotel for 2 nights which located at Taipa. When we arrived at Taipa Ferry terminal from Hong Kong at 3 pm, we take a free shuttle bus to Sheraton Hotel. Check-in process very quick, just 5 minutes and we get the room key. Deluxe room is big (42 sqm) with comfy beds, 42 inch LED TV and all looks luxurious. Bathroom also big with bathtub and shower separated. It's just look the same as the photograph at their website. Our room doesn't include breakfast so I can't give comment about the food. This hotel located in front of Venetian Resort and next to City of Dreams, so you can go there by foot. Check-out process also easy and hassle free. My family very enjoy our stay at Sheraton  Hotel. Very recommended.",50
"This is a great four-star hotel with 5-star service. When I arrived, the bellhops were very attentive and immediately took my baggage and awaited for me to check-in. I did not have to wait at all since I was directed to the priority check-in (mind you they did not know what status I was) since all the normal check-in desks were busy. After about 5 minutes I was on the way to the room. The bellhop gave me a quick tour of the room and proceeded to leave. The room was very clean and the decor tasteful. I opted for the strip view so I had a nice view of the Venetian across the street. During my stay I opted to have one meal as dine-in. The food was delicious and reasonably priced. Kudos to the the chefs.  The one knock I have against this place but which will hopefully improve as‚Ä¶",40
"For the second birthday of our daughter we have decided to spend 3 days in Macau.  From the moment we entered in the resort we felt that our little was treated like a little princess. We had a very nice and personal welcome from Wilrissa Lloren, a free family suite upgrade thanks to SPG membership and our daughter's birthday. The room was simply amazing (spacious, great view, big TV screen, Wii,...). Besides, we found all commodities from the hotel very nice but not very children oriented (no indoor children playground, very small child area outside), but the size of the children suite was compensating. Overall, fantastic service, most probably the best deal in Taipa.",50
I strongly recommended this hotel to anyone that looking for a leisure holiday. It was great services especially the front desk. Although the location is not closer to downtown but it is still a better choice for me. Will return again!,40
"My experience in Sheraton was a wonderful and lovely one. The staff and service was one of the highlights of the hotel. They were so accommodating and helpful. As soon as you enter the hotel, a member of the staff automatically goes to you to take your bags. In our case it was even the Executive Assistant Manager - Rooms, Alessandro Mortillaro, who helped us with our bags. He was very kind, courteous and polite. If you look lost or puzzled, it is the staff that approaches you and not the other way around. The suite we had was so big and luxurious. The decor and furniture were pretty. The bed, the pillows and comforter, were definitely a highlight! They were so soft and comfy. We had no trouble sleeping at all. It also had complete amenities. They did not skimp on anything.

Guest Relations Team provided the excellent services. The flower bouquet, fruit platter & balloons could be pre-ordered & well arranged. It gave my sister a birthday surprise.",40
"I usually take a day trip to Macau but decided to stay overnight at the Sheraton as they had an excellent weekend promotion.  From the ferry dock I took the Venetian shuttle and then walked over to the Sheraton.  The Sheraton Hotel is new and beautifully decorated.  The front desk personnel were very pleasant, professional and welcoming.  Check in and check out was fast and easy.  My room was perfect!  The bed was very comfortable.  The bathroom was great, with nice hot water and good water pressure.  Lots of fluffy white towels and toiletries.  Had lots of fun at the casino (even though I lost).  Will definitely stay at the Sheraton again on my next trip.",50
Overall it's a very new and nice hotel. The room is great and comfy. Hotel location is directly opposite Venetian and it is next to City of Dreams. Transportation is somewhat convenient with lots of buses and taxis around.,50
"Sheraton sent me a couple of emails before my arrival to ensure they could entertain my requests - very hospitable.  Got my Hi floor, non-smoking room in a quiet section as requested.  However, there is not much view as the opposite is either the Holiday Inn or Conrad and in the middle is a vast area with Air-Cons and facilities.  I can see that the swimming pool is comparatively small and is not meant to accommodate over 100 Guests.  You need to always have the outer laced curtain closed to preserve Privacy as the exterior window is not the reflective type.  The room was slightly smaller than the one at Galaxy and the ceiling was comparatively low.  Actually you will feel the low ceiling once you exit the lift.

The staff at the Club lounge were top class . Very knowledgeable , well groomed , friendly and courteous .

Thank you very much to the hotel employees and if I would have a choice I would choose this hotel again ;)",50
"Excellent hotel standards with spacious clean rooms and a large tub. The beds are firm, the rooms 100% quiet for a great rest. The Sheraton is centrally located on Cotai strip opposite the Venetian - you have access to all key Strip locations without being overwhelmed by (Chinese) tourist masses such as at the Venetian (Sheraton is less flashy and has a smaller casino). We celebrated an event at Sheraton and the reception desk (Mandy) and the concierge were extremely helpful. The pool and spa are good but nothing to write home about - open till 11pm, the sauna and stream room get switched off early.

The restaurants are great with plenty of choice for North American, East Asian and South Asian choices and the price is very very reasonable. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, will choose it again to stay and recommend to others the same. We are middle aged couple from Canada. Dr. Santosh Gupta Canada",50

Some on the early reviews of this hotel no longer apply, this hotel has ironed out all the early teething issues that come with a brand new hotel. The staff are so enthusiastic and even though this is the biggest Sheraton in the world you feel at home. Well done to Bensum and his fabulous team. Will recommend to friends and family.",50
"We've booked the rooms at a promotion price and it was well worth the money we paid for. The rooms are new and clean with comfortable beds and their staff are friendly and helpful. There are quite a number of eateries inside the hotel so there is no issues for food. Also there are shuttle buses to the various casinos and ferry which made it easy to get around. Only con is the service inside the Sands casino is really bad, especially the Sands Rewards Club staff, I would give them a miss. I would definitely stay here for my next trip in Macau.",50

Although the hotel is very crowded, check-in and out is fast.  They seem very organized and all staffs are very helpful. The room is clean and roomy.  The bed is comfortable. The hotel is connected to mall, so shopping and finding food is easy.  They also offer many shuttle bus to seaport and airport, so it is no problem in getting into the hotel. The only drawback is that wifi only available in hotel lobby.",50

The customer service supervisor had been very kind to upgrade us to a luxurious suite and we received a warm handwritten greetings card from her together with some complimentaries for the occasion. When nowadays everything's so commercial and superficial, we are especially touched with this kind of attentive from heart service.

Restaurants are all over - very much a resort type hotel like Vegas. The one breakfast place though I was amazed stopped serving before 11am on a Sunday. Which I thought was unusual. All the big hotels are easy walking distance apart - so no matter where you want to eat/drink or party everything is close.",40
"Its a new hotel in Macau and I was staying in a deluxe room. Thumbs up to the friendly and passionate staff from feast restaurant and front desk. The room is clean and the housekeeping did a good job.  The only set back was no one came to pick up the breakfast order card from our door knob. We waited for our room service breakfast and we were so disappointed when we open our door and found our breakfast order menu card still hanging at the door knob.  Overall, I did not experience a 5- star hotel ""wow"" factor. All staffs are approachable but they are not those whom will come up to you. Instead you have to approach them for what you need.",40

As my boyfriend being SPG (starwood preferred guest), the check-in process was such an ease and the front desk agent who assisted us was surprisingly eloquent. The room was spacious and so was the bathroom. The buffet breakfast in Feast was delicious, although we didn't eat much in the morning. (Try their buffet dinner however, it's quite good!) We also loved the Bene Italian restaurant (big portion of cheesy Lasagna) and Pink Grill restaurant. The casino by the way, is less congested than the others, probably because it's new.

However, we could tell that the staff was trying their best to handle the situation by offering water and entertainment to those waiting.  After our stay, we were invited to provide feedback and the exec assistant manager, Mr. Mortillaro personally followed up with our comments.

However, the rooms are new, modern and spacious, if the sheer size of this hotel doesn't deter you.  If possible go for the Club floors for somewhat of a refuge from the masses.  Close to a quarter of the rooms qualify for Club status, and the Club Lounge might certainly vie for the largest on the planet.  The offered breakfast buffet and evening ""snacks"" and cocktails are about the most comprehensive I've ever encountered -- and good.  But again, if you're not fond of crowds, beware.

The executive lounge is bigger than most hotels breakfast room but you still have to wait in line to get a breakfast table and it feels everything but 'exclusive'. We got upgraded to a great suite.  It was very comfortable but the decor was really tacky. Service was not bad, especially when you think of the sheer number of guests that they must have.

Even though I arrived on a busy Sat afternoon, I got checked in within 5 minutes (doesn't matter if you are a SPG member), and check out was just as quick with no queues. Book directly with Sheraton as they will ask for your preferences by email before you arrive - a nice touch.  I got upgraded to a Deluxe Room on the SPG floor on the 24th level in the Sky Tower, with an impressive view of the Cotai strip and Venetian Hotel.

Club lounge area is large and sometimes overcrowded, could be smaller and private, maybe each tower could have own lounge area to deal with about 380 club rooms. Cocktail selection in lounge is strange and served in small shot glasses called teasers. Normal size cocktails are served at extra cost.

"Stayed for a night on our family trip few days ago, everything was great from check-in through skip check-out. The room on SPG 23rd floor was clean, comfortable and well decoration. Well equipped swimming pool with jacuzzi. The location was great with easily access to nearby attractions and also Macau city. Best of all, the service-minded of staff is excellence where they are always able to help us.",50
"Stayed at the Sheraton Macao for 9 nights, and it was just excellent. Spent a little extra for Club floor with access to the Club lounge offering complementary breakfast (full flesh) and afternoon/evening buffet that could make it for a dinner - with drinks of your choise. It was realy value for money, and one of the best club lounges that we have been to with extremely friendly and service minded staff.",50
"Stayed in December 2012 for one night - booked the opening promotion with breakfast and one free ferry ride back to Hong Kong. The room was nice and big and clean, had a view of the strip. The breakfast wasn't good in terms of variety and service - it would have been better to use a coffee shop nearby. The mall next to the hotel is big but not many shops to browse. The shuttle service was good to go to Venetian and the city.",40
"check-in lobby is huge. around 20 counters. quite fast. got an enhanced room for SPG. luckily was assigned to the higher floor, as i saw some guests staying at lower floors could not get in the elevators - perhaps too many rooms here.   the room is quite clean. the twin beds are quite large. and the sheraton beds are really nice. the carpets look quite dirty although this hotel is quite new. many things like kettle, cups, bottled water, etc were kept inside the drawers oddly. good bathroom, the showel gel is quite bad though. the window is that so dirty that the view from room is very blurred, perhaps due to the construction sites nearby.  check-out took just less than 1 min at the express check-out counter.   lunch buffet @ feast: high ceiling. it was alright, but definitely‚Ä¶",40
"We stayed at Sheraton on our 7th anniversary, and it is wonderful. The room is clean and comfortable, excellent dining, and it is a great place to have fun, shop and relax. Overall, staffs are friendly, and the arrangement from the Guest Relations Manager Myn Lam was done beautifully, which made our stay a memorable one.",50
"Had a short weekend escape to Macau or Macao, oh well this place is only about casino in my opinion since that I didn‚Äôt have a lot of time to explore as it was a less than 48 hrs trip.   As a Starwood lover I choose the newly opened Sheraton and this is the largest Sheraton in the world.  located in the Cotai Strip area where Vegas Sands is trying to rebuild a mini Vegas.  This Sheraton has two towers: Sky and Earth.  offering 570 guestrooms with a casino and 7 restaurants and cafes.  As for SPG Platinum member got upgraded to the Deluxe suite and check-in at the executive lounge.  For this stay I checked in around 11:45am and had my late check out till 5:00pm which made the longest extension that I ever get from Starwood.  I choose starpoints for my welcome gift since that I‚Ä¶",40
"Sometimes when you travel, you arrive disorganized even distressed.  The last thing you want is a hassle with check in.  I had misplaced a critical business document and was not myself when I arrived at the Sheraton.  While I must have looked and sounded anxious and confused at the front desk, the service staff member who served me was patient, understanding and reassuring.  Even with a number of other guests ready to check in, he saw to a seamless check in for me, patiently reconfirming information he had already told me.  I found the document (phew!) and reflected on the easy, professional manner and efficiency of the staff member, whose name, I believe was Silence.  We need calm, effective operators, especially in times of crisis.  Well done!",50
Never had high hopes for casino hotels but the Sheraton Macao is the best casino hotel I've ever stayed. The club staff is super and the quality of food and drink offer in the club is very good. Excellent free shuttle bus service and good sized rooms too!,50
"Impromptu overnight trip to Macau on Friday - booked the room in the morning on line . Absolutely terrific. At check in they immediately suggested a free upgrade to a family suite where the kids got a great room and more importantly a wii! The staff were only too pleased to help with bags , with directions, with restaurant choices.  Whilst I am aware in Macau hotels, pools are not uppermost in their priorities, the pool area with a variety of pools and seating areas , was first class. As was the breakfast which was included in the room price.  Only criticism, it is so vast , apparently 10,000 staff , it takes a while to get anywhere within the hotel.  Would highly reccomend it and will most definitely return.  ",50
"The hotel is new. However the service is so poor. There are many staff here, but nobody can better serve you. Chech in need to wait for a long time. The room is not really clean, so much dirt in the furniture. The check out time also takes so long. The hotel really need to train the staff to be polite. ",30
i'm satisfied! i went together my wife. i used fitness center in the morning. And i'm very comfortabled. i'd like to visit again the following. Spent a very pleasant and happy time. Kindness while staying in a hotel for people who will appreciate.,50
"Great hotel and facilities and very child friendly, so good I have been back several times since opening and each time it has got better.  Originally a couples trip but when we arrived we were blown away by the spacious executive rooms (suites) and the pictures we posted of Facebook tempted my brother and family over, bringing my young nephew. The hotel has a clown with balloons and a candy station for the kids, which kept him very happy.  For the adults the comfy rooms and friendly service from the staff made it stand out from the other hotels in Macau that I have been to in the same area and on the main island. Would definitely recommend friends to go.",50
"I chose to stay in this hotel for its family suite. Period.  I find it hard to pinpoint what to rave about this hotel... i mean, the children's room had bunks and computer games, but for the price i paid... it didn't feel like value for money. I guess i was looking for the finer things that a parent would appreciate in a family room - like little stools for children in the bathroom for brushing teeth, or little toiletries like mini bathrobes and slippers would have given this a real Sheraton oomph!  When we first checked in, they only gave us one set of keycards for 2 rooms - it didn't make sense at all and it took some ding-dong-ing before it was finally settled. As a parent, i pointed out the potential of the children locking themselves in as the adjoining doors had locks on‚Ä¶",40
"I stayed in Family Suite at Sheraton Macau Contai from 22 to 23 Feb, 2013. I booked the room via Agoda.com, the rate was included breakfast. When I checked in, I was told by the reception staff that the rate was not included breakfast. I asked her to check as I was sure my booking did include breakfast.  I showed her my hotel voucher. The staff also said the hotel has not charged my credit card, so I needed to settle the bill when check out. I was a bit confused as when I did the booking with Agoda, I remembered that my card had been charged.  Then a staff left a message to me that my booking was without breakfast. I called the front desk again at about 6. The lady replied that my booking was room only. She asked if I could go to the front desk and showed my voucher.  I was a‚Ä¶",40
"I don't have a whole lot of experience with casino hotels, and my taste tends to run to historic and locally run hotels. But that being said, this is one impressive hotel. Big room, ultra-comfortable bed (while suffering serious jet-lag), everything worked (once we figured out the main switch). Room service was prompt, shoes shined in a flash, and you just have to check out the night-lights.",50
"don't get me wrong, this is a beautiful looking hotel.  The buffet is to die for.  I've stayed at pretty awful hotels in the past but the service was sooo good that they made the hotel ""look"" good.  I'm afraid that I've had better service EVERYWHERE else in macau, and I travel here often.  1 hour to check in. long lines. Poorly trained staff.  So the ""shine"" on this new hotel is quite dull.  My advice: for the money try any other hotel in Macau.  4 stars for hotel but 1 star for service.  Express checked out as the line was so long I wasn't going to wait another hour.  Then, thankyou so much for the extra charges added on my card that I did not authorise. bad.",30
Stayed here with hubby and 3 kids when newly opened back in Oct '12.  Everything about the hotel was great and fantastic service from the manager Nick Lam. Cannot wait to return in a couple of weeks ( without the kids this time):)  ,50
"We went there to spend the weekend and we are impressed by this brand new hotel. Amazing environment, excellent staff. We got a upgrade to family suite and the rooms are gorgerous! My little girl like ""her room"" so much with little kids furniture and a WII to play with! Great thanks to the Sheraton's staff, Angelina and her team, with great serive and good suggestion on dinning place for us! We will certainly go there again in Summer this year and can't wait for that! One suggestion - if there's free Wifi inside the room it would be perfect!",50
"bland feeling,staff not particularly warm nor readily conversant in english. new complex is ok i guess fren summed it up nicely, 'I think they are a 4 and a half star establishment?' For comparable rates, I'd probably go to other competitors  Cons  Bathtub too small even for asians. Towels though brand new are not luxuriant, has that spongy material feel. Toiletries again, look like something to be found in an SJM establishment not an international chain For a big complex they need to have been directions, especially for breakfast dining  Cordless phone base station keeps flashing green to signal that its on, very distracting when all the lights are off and you're trying to sleep  Pros One out of 3 pool areas was open and it was quite nice, though couldn't really do much given‚Ä¶",30
I was amazed at the hotel's facility and room. We checked in and pampered as we are the SPG member. Having a surprise compliment from the hotel is an add on and delighted our trip. I will choose to come back to Sheraton hotel again if i were to visit Macau in the near future,50
"We used our SPG points for a nights stay with 3 other couples, and unfortunately on arrival realized we had not processed the room correctly over the internet.  The staff we're overly accommodating to express their apologies for OUR mistake and confirmed an upgraded room for me and my guest on the spot.  We all got together for a champagne toast before going out that evening and the great service didn't stop... the in room  food service as well as the buffet were great.  If you get a chance to stay in the joining rooms for kids/family do so.  They are great rooms and my kids during our last stay loved it...can't wait to take them back.     This is our go to hotel in Macau and my guest loved it.  We'll be back in April and already made my reservation.",50
"Stayed for 3 nights as a Gold Spg member. Was upgraded to an executive Suite with connecting twin deluxe rooms on the club floor, rooms and bathrooms exceeded expectations.. My Family loved the experience. Staff was very helpful and paid special detail attention to our dietary requirements. Club Lounge experience was great. The hotel is just opposite the Venetian and is accessible through a sky bridge on the 2nd floor of the exquisite shopping center, next to the main Lobby of Sheraton Macao hotel. We will definitely return to this hotel for our next visit to Macau.",50
"It is a nice hotel for stay in Macao,  we spent a relax time there with the nice rooms, service. The Q Cube is very good place for my daughter of 10-years old. And she almost went there every day, and loved it much. But the only regret is there are less shops in the hotel.  When the guyers are happy in the casino, we donot have lot of place for the shopping.  so waiting for more shops open.",40
"I decided to spend just the first day of Chinese New Year in Macau as I had family visiting me. A lot of my friends warned me about the crowds that throng Macau from the mainland. As I walked into the hotel lobby, I was ushered into the check in are for the SPG guests and within twenty minutes we were up in our rooms. The service was impeccable and we stayed at the Earth Tower .  This was the same when we checked out. The room was spotlessly clean and the room service was excellent. I would highly recommend this hotel for fun filled vacation with family and it is close a lot of the other hotels such as Galaxy Macau and Venetian if you dont mind walking!!",50
I spent two nights in Sheraton Macao.  Staff are very friendly and helpful.   The room is clean and tidy.  The pillows are soft and clean.  Very comfy duvet.  Excellent washroom.  It is a lovely hotel we would surely to recommend to friends! The hotel is wonderful!,50
"Stayed only the one night, as an SPG member was given priority check-in in a very comfortable lounge and a complimentary room upgrade.  Staff were very friendly.  Room was a great size, very clean and excellent furnishings.  Bed and pillows were very comfortable. No noise was noticed from joining rooms.  Internet was fast, and free for our stay, but non-SPG members would have to pay for this. We ordered the in room breakfast and it was one of the best in room dining experiences we have had.  Food was of excellent quality and presented beautifully.  Definitely recommend this hotel.",50
"I would appreciate Sheraton Cotai Central's wonderful hospitality with warm salutations. Sheraton Macao Hotel provides excellent service even from all porters and friendly counter staffs will be my happy memory.  I  am really very satisfaction pertain to amenities that help me to relax even more. I realize the quality management is the manager position must be maintained a relaxed and calm atmosphere. And to interact with guests.  I am deeply impressed with The Guest Service Manger, especially for the first contacted me that manager Miss Monica Zhang.

The focus of Macau is gambling rather than general tourism.

The property is very impressive and the rooms are mind-blowing. Bottom line is this hotel is highly recommended.,50

The bathroom was equally as spectacular especially with all the toiletries offered to compliment the bathroom facilities. The room service breakfast was certainly a feast! We recommend having it in your room. We ate at Bene in the evening, which again surpassed our expectations and was a lovely experience. The staff were very polite and efficient.

The location of the Hotel is well linked to most shopping malls and there is a sheltered pathway all the way to the Venetian and Four Seasons. Food varieties available is wide and good. There are fast food outlets as well as classy restaurants within the Hotel vicinity. Most importantly, the hotel provides excellent service and the staff is super friendly and helpful.",50

What makes me really upset is when I speak in English, agents reply in Cantonese or mandarin? Agents did not make my trip any easier when I enquire about site seeing and restaurants . Poor product knowledge. Most importantly is manager on duty kept talking to agents in mandarin in front of me upon check out. I might not know how to speak Cantonese or mandarin, but I can understand. I'm sure the manager on duty and agent said I'm ""troublesome guest"" in mandarin! What a 5 star hotel!

I will definitely come back because of the well trained staffs!",40
We really enjoyed my stay at the new Sheraton Hotel in Macao. The staff was most helpful and the room service was excellent. The room was large and clean with beautiful interior; however the view was not so great. We visited the gym every day and I must compliment Sheraton for the great gym with new equipment and with such friendly professional staff....we have never experienced this before. I would recommend the Sheraton to my friends visiting Macau.,50

Overall it was a pleasant expirience so we have decided to repeat this during Chineese NY.

Fourth floor club lounge offers attractive happy hour buffet from 5-7p.m. Our son liked the self service toasted egg and cheese sandwiches and macaroon. We liked the free pouring champagne, white and red wine. Breakfast here is great too. Gym and pool are fantastic. Our family had a memorable stay in here.",50

Now that the operations had been going on for a good few months, everything seems to have gelled together.  Check in was in a breeze, staff were wearing a smile on their faces and everyone looks sincerely happy working in a tropical environment! My room was clean, fresh and felt like a home away from home. Room service was amazing, had the laksa and steak and it was very good. Bed was comfortable and staff could not do enough for you.

Upgrading to the Club floor, facilities and lounge was particularly great value, with a wonderful buffet at breakfast and happy hour. Will definitely be back soon.",50

This hotel is big very big. Was drawn here by the sheer size of the place but disappointed by the mob mentality of the place. Check in is disorganized chaos if you can even reach the check in area. Finally found someone who understood that we are Platinum members and sent us on a small marathon to the club lounge check in. Finally arrived at the room after walking forever.  The room is big but poorly fitted out. The bathroom door doesn't lock and there is no bubble bath for the huge bath. After venturing out please remember your room key as security is tighter than Fort Knox.

"I went to Macao for business tirp. Hotel is near by the airport, very convenient by shuttle bus. It's easy for shopping and eating out, because hotel is combine with the shopping center. The first floor is a huge gambling house for your trial. I stayed here for 5 days and got free upgrade to club suite, that it's a big suprise for me. Warm service and great staffs I met. The seafood is very fresh in Xin restaurant, great taste. I definately will stay here again.",50
"I was there with whole family (4 units) over Chinese New Year as a family gathering.  Before the trip I was reading a lot of reviews on TA.com and was worry the hotel will be too big like Caesar's Palace in Vegas.  But 1st morning when I went down to Sheraton club for breakfast, I was greeted by name and that was very impressive.  With a hotel nearly 4000 rooms andI guess there were hundreds of guests with access to Sheraton Club, they managed this... I don't know how.  I understand having breakfast in a big ballroom was very abnormal, but again we had a family of 10 at a roundtable and plenty of food option around us in the ballroom.  Which turned out to be a great place to gather in the morning.  They even dressed the tables with teapots and golden chocolate coins to made it‚Ä¶",50
"I stayed in this hotel last October. The room is spacious and the bed is big and comfortable. I especially like the wifi everywhere and even at the swimming pool the connection is good. I could enjoy the nice temperature at the pool, with some drinks, and surfing with my wifi, what an enjoyment. The pool also provides free beach towels.  The room has bathrobe available that you could wear it to go to the swimming pool. Though it's funny to say hello to other fellow guests in the lift when I was weaing a bathrobe.  The receptionists are polite and friendly and speak fair English. Just give you a tip about transport, there is free shuttle bus take you to and from hotel and pier. The service is frequent.

"It is a very big hotel with 2 towers, named as sky tower and earth tower. The hotel shuttle bus took us from ferry terminal to hotel but we did not know which tower it stopped. Right behind where the bus stopped, we found the check-in counter and after our 2 days stay, I think there were at least 3 check-in areas. The check-in staff was very nice, his mother tongue is mandarin but he tried very best to communicate with us in English. Check-in was also quick and efficient, but we needed to walk a long way to our room which was at the Sky tower. When we arrived the Sky Tower just opposite the Chow Tai Fook jewelry shop (with a prominent sign in front), we found the doors closed but not locked. We then opened the doors and found the lifts lobby inside. Suddenly, a security guard‚Ä¶",30
"Visiting Macau is a very worthwhile add on to a Hong Kong trip, or an alternative to staying in Hong Kong for a 1 day airport layover. The old Portuguese island is quite interesting with lots of character both from Portugal and from China compared to the more business focused Hong Kong. Just wander around starting at the central square area. There is an excellent tourist center there with a free audio guide you can take in your walk.  The island with all of the new casinos is much less interesting, and far more sterile than Vegas;  but a main attractions is staying at the Sheraton.   I stayed here on a stopover in Hong Kong in February 2013 on a trip to Asia. At cash and points for SPG members it was great value.

The check-in procedures at Club Lounge were smooth, and staff were friendly explaining the benfits. The room itself is new, spacious and clean. The decor is rather simple. There are 3 meal options belonging to hotel, but don't bother to go there, because there are loads of restaurants in the adherant shopping malls. Now come to the negative experience. First, I don't like the breakfast set-up, due to high occupancy it was set in a ballroom, which made me feel no privacy at all. I was warned the breakfast time might be busy, so I came at 7am. The food choice was quite limited, and not up to 5 star standard. Second, as one of the club floor benefits, welcome fruit and‚Ä¶",30

"First impression was awesome. The check in was a breeze though it was fully booked for the CNY period from 9 to 12 Feb 2013.  The staff was efficient, helpful and most important courteous. The rooms was very spacious and comfortable. Hotel signs were clear and well displayed.  Breakfast spread was superb and even the top management staff were down to serve us as the number of people queuing up for the food was never ending.  Overall, we were very impressed with the setup and the pleasant hospitality shown by the staff from the very top to the bell boys.  The hotel is a must for those who wants to enjoy the full works of MACAU.",50

I'm a SPG elite member and have stayed in many properties under the SPG and other brands in the US and Asia.  Overall - solid but massively let down my te details. It may be the case that I'm particularly picky and that I am a sucker for service and minute details, so please consider the comments below with a pinch of salt if you are less picky.  Checkin - marvelous and friendly staff. Option of lounge checkin and SPG reception on lobby level. I choose the lobby checkin - friendly, courteous and made me feel welcomed.

I appreciated the free shuttle to/from the airport, the greeting when i stepped off the bus, the SPG reception area, being escorted by two staff members to my room, the gym/sauna and the proximity to everything.  What i appreciated less was the outrageous price of food and the ""security guy"" that too often stared at me in the gym changing!",50
"The hotel is very big and it's located on Cotai strip, in front of the Venetian. I had a very good room, actually a suite with a nice view. Service is fast and efficient, very american style. The lounge could be very noisy and it's not what I expected. I suggest the hotel to split the lounge in business and leisure so that people who need a quiet spot could have it. Good and free transportation to everywhere.",50
"When you choose to stay in Macau, most would stay in the Cotai Strip. This is where all the action is happening since most hotels such as the Venetian, Conrad, Grand Hyatt, Holiday Inn, Four  seasons and the Sheraton has marked its place. The Cotai strip is also famous because it is where all the new family orientated casinos are and also home to the exhibitions and performances like the house of dancing water. In this strip, you will find mega malls, casinos and restaurants of all sorts to meet your earthly cravings. To me , although the Sheraton was located at the end of the Cotai Strip, its price compared to other hotels are competitive and the fact that all malls are within walking distance makes Sheraton a good stay.

"Stayed at Sheraton Hotel for a work conference.  Like the other hotels in Cotai they have direct buses from the ferry to the hotel.  Group check in and out were both quite efficient.  Room was still new and spacious.  Food (had dinner breakfast and lunch here) was decent but not high end.  Ie breakfast fruits were limited to only pineapples, watermelon, honeydew and cantaloupes.   Our company made us share rooms to save costs, so for those of us that preferred our own rooms we had to pay an extra hkd859, to me, at usd220 per nite with no free wifi, no points accumulation for my starwood membership (due to group rate) I would not consider this hotel to be a great deal.  In sum, it was not a bad experience and worth trying once but I would try another hotel next time I'm in Macau.‚Ä¶",40
"Me and my boyfriend spent a weekend in the Sheraton hotel for his birthday celebration. Upon arrival, I emailed the staff about my boyfriend's birthday to see if they have any special arrangement. The staff responsed promptly however they couldnt confirm me what kind of special arrangement it is.  When we arrived the hotel, we though the lobby was very well decorated and the check in was gone through very efficiently. We stayed in a Deluxe King and the room was fine and clean but pretty standard. The location is good, easy access to other hotels and malls. When we returned to the hotel at night, we found a chocolate cake in the fridge and a birthday card addressed to my boyfriend, which was very sweet.

And services was great too, staff called me before the cake send to our room.  And asked if we need birthday song and candles.  We also received a birthday card from the hotel.   Really very impressed.  Would certainly our first choice to stay in Macau.",50

We really appreciated this after a long day shopping and taking the ferry from mainland china.   THE ROOM: exceptionally clean, spacious and we were grateful to have air conditioning that worked!

Location is great as you can just take the overhead escalator bridge to Venetian giving you more choice of shopping and photo opportunities. I found the service especially the Concierge and the front desk to be the best I've experienced in Macao considering I stayed at Venetian a few years back plus other lower star hotels like Holiday Inn, Sintra, Metropole all downtown. I love the bed and the pillow the most in my room and the shower was great too with powerful and hot enough water supply.

The rooms was quite spacious even with an extra bed in it. The beds were comfortable, amenities in the room were good. If I were to compare the room with Sofitel Ponte16 which we stayed last year, I would say the Sofitel room's interior and bathroom were better. But the location and bus shuttles of Sheraton's were very much better. This is the only hotel we've experienced, whenever you request for coffees, water or whatever you need they would ask you how many you need unlike some other hotels. We enjoyed our stay here and will be back again. Highly recommended to stay in this hotel.",50
"I work in Macao now and my relatives and friends often visit me year round.

(  Since when I chatted with them in Cantonese or English, they don't get my point at all....... , trust me, you have this comments over in Macao hotel often. :-)))) )  Sheraton provided the best service I ever seen.  The staff always takes care of guest. For example, for my first visit of it, I went with my parents with age over 70's.   We have a room located faraway from elevator serivce.

Service there is prompt and efficient, aside from the initial arrival luggage delivery which took over an hour to arrive. Breakfast is full-service and so is cocktails and canapes in the evenings.

Indeed, it was kind of confusing upon arrival at the hotel. We didnt know which reception area we are supposed to check in. There were a lot of guests in the lobby and at the same time, hotel staff guiding first time guests. It was not a breeze during check in time. And it was a relief when we were done with the check in...there was no waiting area for family's who wait to be checked in. So we just stood in one corner while we wait for one member of the family to check us all in.

Another good thing is there is a skybridge connecting Sheraton and The Venetian and Four Seasons. Beware of shuttle bus stops.  Unlike Galaxy or The Venetian that has a shuttle terminal, Sheraton has three bus pick-up points to different locations.  Remember to ask hotel staff to prevent from walking a long and wrong way. Shortcomings: no convenient stores.  Elevators to the rooms are not easy to find, and a distant to the lobby (w/ beggage room) and front desk and in that order.  Unreasonable design??

I can confidently tell you that all three hotel buildings were built by the same developer with very similar layout, perhaps a slightly different design and interior color scheme, so my tip is, check all three of them (Sheraton, Holiday Inn, and Conrad) and see which one gives you the best deal.

My 3rd time in Macau and this time we chose Sheraton as we found a offer where we only pay for 2 out of the 3 nights we stayed. The rate of HKD1388 per room per night (for double occupancy) and HKD1663 (triple occupancy) was reasonable for a Sheraton as the 3rd night was free.   Sheraton is located in Sands Cotai which houses 2 other hotels - Conrad and Holiday Inn. The shuttle stops at each hotel though so no worries about having to walk alot.   CHECKING IN - we arrived at 1030am via the airport shuttle and were directed to another check in counter after identifying ourselves as SPG members. We were told that our request for connecting rooms can only granted but the rooms will only be ready at 2pm. So we opted to do without the connecting rooms as the staff said they have ready‚Ä¶,40

Really nice bathroom with large, deep bath perfect for a soak after all the walking.My only complaint was that we had booked a deal that included breakfast,shows and a free ferry ride but we were told none of this at checkin so missed out on all that! However we got a late check out (3pm) at no extra charge. Staff very helpful and friendly, all in all a good stay. I didn't eat at the hotel, if you want a really good meal in Macau take a cab to Fernando's...outstanding!",40
"This is indeed a huge Sheraton and many of the previous reviewers had the numbers wrong. The hotel does have 4000 rooms when it runs on full capacity, which will be around march or april 2013. For now they only run on less then 50% of the capacity. So if you think it's crowded now, wait a couple of months. I am sure this is an issue the hotel management takes into consideration.  My stay: Well in advance of arriving at the hotel, I had some email conversations with the hotel on how to arrive from Hong Kong International Airport. We used the Cotaijet service from the airport to Cotai, where a shuttle bus was waiting to take us to the hotel.   I booked 3 nights of which 2 were free nights on SPG points. We were escorted from the lobby to the Club Lounge where we checked in‚Ä¶",50
My guests and I booked 2 spacious rooms fronted in pool view. Nice location! The hotel has its owned unique pool. Restaurants and shoppes are very convenient. No need to spend much time for walk especially going to the signature brands at Four Seasons and Grand Canal Shoppes at Venetian. Comfortable to stay.,40
"The staff were fast and prompt in checking us in despite the bustling holiday crowd. Location is in Taipa and is within walking distance from Venetian, City of Dreams and Hard Rock Cafe. Sheraton itself is connected to Holiday Inn and Conrad.   Room was large with 2 double queen beds and a spacious bathroom. A platter of fruits greeted our entrance on the study table.Beds were comfy and nice to sleep in. Shuttle buses are readily available outside the hotel to take you to the jetty and airport. Fantastic choices of food from the food court to the fine dining restaurants.  If you are checked into their Club Room, you will gain access to the Sheraon Club Lounge where you can enjoy beverages such as coffee, tea and fruit juices (there are 3 fixed timings). This place offers a‚Ä¶",40
"What a start! This hotel has only been fully open for a few month, but still everything is already running beyond the excellence I'm used to at Starwood hotels. No Line at Check-In , I was in the room in less than 10 minutes. Luggage being brought just 5 minutes later. The room has an fine ambiance, nice view and modern furniture. Restaurant Bene at the ground floor serves perfect food for adequate prices. Free welcome drinks and appetizer bread-oil-snack included. The Sheraton is situated in a well chosen location, with bars such as the Hard-Rock-Caf√© Bar just few minutes away by foot. The same with the Venetian (don't stay there, too crowded, just visit). The ferry terminal and airport are easy to reach by free shuttle transport or taxi in just 5-10 minutes. Breakfast in the‚Ä¶",50
"Macau's developing Cotai strip is home to many new hotels/casinos, of which the Sheraton is one. The hotel still has the sparkly new feel to it. We had a lovely suite which was spacious, stylishly decorated, and did not yet show signs of wear and tear. It included a powder room, comfortable living & sleeping spaces, as well as an enormous bathroom -- all in all making this a great home-base for our short visit.   Transportation between the Macau ferry terminal and hotel is convenient, as well as stress- and cost-free -- exit the terminal and cross the road to find the shuttle. Complexes within walking distance include The Four Seasons, The Venetian, and the City of Dreams. The House of Dancing Water show is just ""next door"" at City of Dreams. Unless you're planning to spend all‚Ä¶",40
"We booked 2 rooms to stay over the recent weekend before NYE.  On arrival at the ferry we looked out for the free shuttle service to the hotel. Very convenient as it is only 10 mins from the hotel. Likewise on return , very convenient to board the shuttle bus back to Cotai ferry terminal.  This hotel is massive!!!! like 4000 rooms. Check in was fast and very pleasant. We got upgraded to a deluxe and executive suite. VERY nice surprise. The suites and furnishing were very tastefully decorated.  The deluxe suite was massive, would be a size of a 3 bedroom apartment in Sydney It had a separate powder room on entry. The living room and dining area was very spacious. A large flat screen TV was in living room, another TV room with fold out sofa and main bedroom with king size bed and‚Ä¶",30
Maintain the top quality of the Sheraton brand name. Easy transportation around the city with free shuttle or public bus. Offers tasteful inexpensive food courts to fine dining in elegant restaurants inside the hotel premises. Casinos and entertainment venues just within walking distances (say those inside the Venetians or City of Dreams).,50
"We enjoyed a well appointed Executive Suite - great space, comfy bed, fantastic view. For such a large hotel, the staff are well briefed on the hotels amenities + extremely polite & helpful. These are the highlights - the Club experience is the low point of the Sheraton. Having traveled extensively  and experienced many club floors the Sheraton needs to re-think how this is achieved in a 4000 room hotel. Space is odd - feels like a cafeteria, little natural light & uncomfortable furnishings - due to over crowding a ball room was pressed into service - food sub-par - staff overwhelmed with the hordes of guests. I have never had to queue behind 150+ people to get entry into a lounge - requested breakfast vouchers for the main restaurant Feast on both days - food is better here -‚Ä¶",20
"We used a platinum upgrade to check out Macau on a weekend trip in the executive suite.  Took the very convenient free shuttle from the ferry station and checked in at the convenient and less crowded lobby side check in area next to the bus (not the main lobby check in).  When we checked in as a family of 4, we chatted with a front desk manager nearby, and he very nicely suggested that we have a family suite rather than the executive suite.  It's people like him that make us so loyal to Starwood.  The family suite was perfect for us, so much so that the kids did not want to leave the hotel and just wanted to hang out in their room the whole weekend, equipped with a large screen TV, Wii, bunkbeds (single on top and full size on the bottom), a stepstool and protective corners in‚Ä¶",40
"We booked an Executive Suite with Club Floor privileges.  The suite was very nice and well appointed, but that is where our happiness ended.   This hotel has 4,000 rooms so we thought a Club Floor would provide a more personal service and less crowds - we were soooo wrong.  The whole Sheraton Macao club experience was a disappointment.  The club lounge looks like a converted ball room, the food and  beverage service feels like a slightly upscale cafeteria. It was noisy not enough chairs, no service, and uncontrolled children running  around the lounge.  We couldn't even get into the lounge for breakfast, day 1 as it had a queue of 200 people (I am not exaggerating I counted them) waiting to be seated for breakfast... !   Day 2 was the same so we queued in the shorter queue in‚Ä¶",30

Breakfast and afternoon  tea  are good, especially one of the chinese dim sum at breakfast, taste excellent.   However, the cleaning of the room is up to standard, first when we becked to our  room at 3pm, the room still not beeen made up, we have to call the house keeping. More, after the room been cleaned, our coffee mugs which we used the nights before still there not taken away.   On the whole , the staffs are well trained and very friendly and helpful.",40

Located in the center of the shopping, dining and entertainment strip, there is nothing I can really fault about this hotel.  The rooms and the view of the several pools was amazing, the Club experience which included free wifi throughout the hotel and free cocktails & breakfast was very handy.  I had a couple of treatments at the Shine Spa which was unbelievable.  The hotel is extremely well maintained and clean...but the most impressive aspect of our stay was just how friendly and helpful the staff were.  This type of service is something you don't experience often and in all my travels I'd have to say is one of the best experiences I've had.  Can't wait to stay‚Ä¶",50

Very comfortable king size bed and a wonderfully big living room. It had all the works, two 40+ Led screens, huge bathrooms with a really nice bathtub. Complimentary Wifi service along with buffet breakfast and evening cocktails. Although we never got to enjoy the cocktails as we were always out around that time. I was a bit disappointed with the quality and the spread of the breakfast though, firstly it wasn't in a restaurant and it looked like what i thought was a banquet hall and secondly it wasn't as great a spread as you would find in other SPG hotels. Besides that minor hiccup, the stay was wonderful, the staff is very helpful and best‚Ä¶",50

"My wife and I stayed at this property December 30-Jan 1. Upon arrival we were escorted to the 4th floor Executive Lounge for check-in, where we were invited to sit and have a coffee or tea while the check-in process took its course.    As Starwood Platinum for life, we were upgraded to an 'executive suite' (3226) that was a full 2-room suite with 1.5 bathrooms, with the main bath including a footed tub and separate shower. Great view, too. Very nice.   In general, the service was top-notch. The Executive Lounge Director, Alexander, introduced himself to us and made it clear that he was at our service.

It comes with free breakfast buffet, afternoon tea, and dinner buffet. Mind you, the food is great and they even serve wine for dinner. Also, the hotel has free shuttle buses going to different areas in Macau, thus making traveling so much easier. Also, the hotel has a shopping center and is connected to Conrad, Sands, and Holiday Inn, also Venetian. The staff is very accommodating, they even gave me another room key card free of charge (I lost my card). The room cleaning staff is also admirable, however, my room had no bidet in the restroom. .

It is a new hotel and they still have a bit of training to do, but they all went out of their way to assist.  The room was large and had all of the expected amenities.  Our catered food for breakfast, break and lunches was amazing.  Since we had people from lots of different countries they made sure to cater to everyones taste while still having Macao specialties on the menu.",50

In the fridge was a piece of cake but not to us as it was half eaten (the rest of the room spotless) so my wife phoned to mention it. A nice manager from Portugal then arrived to talk to us. He was very apologetic and offered an upgrade to say sorry. He then took my us to see the other rooms if we want to book them next time.

The 99 roses bouquet was not from the hotel florist but Sheraton guest relation team did not mind to take extra effort to order it for me in another shop. In additional, the team also sent me a bottle of campagne to celebrate the success of my proposal plan.

And most importantly, a room was available immediately.  We accepted the offer and went to the room which was located on the 29th floor.  The room was nice, spacious, but not particularly luxurious.

The theme of the hotel was not unified with the entrance and shopping mall decorated in a Polynesian style while some Chinese and Christmas decors were spotted in between.

We were given the wrong direction several times by the casino staff, and finally made it when we found a hotel employee that pointed the way.   Great spacious room with awesome bed, beddings, plush robes, slippers, spacious bathroom and a deep soaker tub. I recommend staying in the Club room as it comes with evening cocktails and snacks, and breakfast.   The hotel's definition of evening snacks is a buffet of different varieties of food and drinks - soda, beers, wines, salads, cold cuts, cheese, make you own paninis, crepes, BBQ ribs, and a whole tableful of desserts. ‚Ä¶",50

You have the usual shuttle transport from/to Taipa Ferry and airport, also the Galaxy, but no direct transport to the Macau city, although one can take the shuttle to Galaxy and then from there another shuttle to downtown.  You can expect all the modern and clean facilities as in any Sheraton, including the convenience of the 24 hr casino just downstairs.  But as most of the other similar hotel clusters in Taipa, you won't find peace and quietness.  You can easily spent lots of money quickly as there are heaps of brand name shope downstairs and around- like the Venetian Canal and the Four Seasons shopping areas just opposite the main road.

For weekend getaways or short holidays, Macau will always be on our first list. I can say that we have tried the different hotels from 3 to 5 stars. I always consider the cleanliness, value, location and the service. Last December 6, I booked for a 3 night stay at Sheraton Hotel. Few days before that, the manager has been sending me emails, asking for any assistance or special needs, which they provided on my arrival at the hotel. We arrived at 1030pm, we were greeted by the bellboy, helped us with our heavy luggage and guided us to the front desk. All the staff were friendly and accommodating. The room was‚Ä¶",50
"Sheraton Macau was recently opened for business, rooms were no doubt clean. The rooms were comfy with 2 double beds.  However, I find the location of the hotel a little too far from all other activities and attractions. Furthermore, there is no free wifi in the room, you have to pay for it. We were told their free shuttle service to Macau island starts about 11am, which is too late by my standard, would be better if it can be slightly early. Obviously from the above, their main aim is to try and make you stay in the casino and gamble the whole day. If gaming is not your aim, I suggest you get another hotel. I also found their pricing a little steep, at the price we paid, we probably could have gotten a better deal nearby.",30
"Really have nothing negative to say about this hotel .. the room, service, facilities are well expected from the high end Sheraton chain. When to Venetian and Galaxy .. the atmosphere is different. Will recommend this  hotel for business and leisure. The best thing I like about the hotel, I recovered all the losses in Venetian, Galaxy and City of Dreams .. cheers.",40
"I booked 2 rooms at this hotel for me and my colleagues. However I came across a few questions and would like a respond from the actual hotel itself rather than the central res (1800 number) or Agoda (which is where I booked through).  My first attempt was to call the hotel's number +853 2880 2000. The phone keeps ringing and ringing, not even the promo message or what-so-ever. Totally not within the industry standard of ""answer within 3 rings"".  My second attempt was to call the central reservation 1800 073 535. I was assisted by a young lady, I asked her why is it impossible to get in contact with the hotel directly, which the lady laughs and said ""maybe they were too busy"". I asked whether free wifi comes with my booking, she told me Wifi is free only for certain room types,‚Ä¶",20
"Just stayed at sheraton for 4 nights - would not have commented at all about my negative impression - until finding out that I have been double charged for the stay (pre- paid, then charged the entire amount again in error after departure without my permission or signature or even invoice).  A few specific gripes: The service was mediocre - many staff did not speak English (including the waiter whom brought room service - but did not understand instructions when I was half dressed after a shower and needing some privacy. )  Wifi not included in room fee - had to be bought hourly/daily.  Even budget cafes have wifi - why can't this so called luxury hotel.  Full of non hotel staff soliciting and approaching you to sell services and accommodation at other hotels! - somewhat a‚Ä¶",20
"service from the staff on all levels was excellent. Rooms were very nice and great value for money. Not the same extravagence of the venetian but was half the price. The casino was ordinary and lacked atmosphere, but accommodation wise highly recommended. Is an easy walk to Venetian, City of Dreams too.",50
"Excellent service with a high level of professionalism unmatched at any other Macau hotel I've stayed at.  Large, comfortable rooms, terrific  food and  great value overall. My new hotel of choice in Macau.",50
"I was excited to try the new SPG property as Westin is just so old and so far away from everything. Spent one night over a weekend. Overall I would say it's quite standard - rooms, amenities, etc. Nothing wow as a brand new property.  Several things that bothered me:  1) Hotel is huge but the sign is not clear. 2) Sound proof - people and kids walking around. it was quite noisy inside the room. 3) Checkin line - waited for a while even as an elite member. Staffs need more training.  Good points:  1) SPG points 2) breakfast at SPG Club is good (but super crowded)  I think Holiday Inn nearby is for better value and Conrad might be more luxury - which makes Sheraton's position a bit awkward.",30
"this is one of the best hotels i have ever stayed in by far.even the venetian accross the road does not comapre to this hotel.  Club room very spacious and clean with the food in FEAST being the most tastyi have ever experienced.  staff were always on hand asking how my stay was and would do almost anything to help you out.  istayed on the club floor whichwas simply amazing and the lounge altho being quite full in themorning for breakfast we were given vouchers for another restaurant which i foundto be good.the only problem i had waswhen i wanted to check out at 6 am,the club staff were notavailable and had to use normal checkout and i think the girl was still training and so took her time checking us out but other than that it was just simply the best full stop.i lost about‚Ä¶",50
"We (family with 2 small kids) stayed just one night. The room (Suite) was amazing and of course brand new. The hotel staff is everywhere and friendly. At the time we stayed they offered at 18:30 a movie night for kids at the pool area which was really cool. In general there are not too many options for kids to play. There is an outside play area, but too small. The breakfast was great with a hugh selection. But around 9AM the Feast was full and the people lined-up to get a free table.  If you're traveling with small kids and you're not planning to gamble the Westin might be the better choice. If you there to gamble and living in a brand new hotel then it's your place.",40
"Just spent one night there over a weekend.  It is one of the new hotels at Cotai Sands.  The room condition is fine as it is new.  Size is just right for a couple.  The view is limited as it is facing another hotel building.  The included breakfast was good with a good combination of east and west.  I liked the cupcakes.  Service was good  considering the size of the restaurant and the number of people it was serving.  They are building a bridge to the Venetian across the road, which I think has a better mall and casino.",40
The family suite consists of two adjoining rooms. One of which was a kids themed room. My kids absolutely love the kids theme room with children friendly furniture - kids chairs and tables.The Wii machine in the room was good fun too. Staff gave complimentary cookies and jelly sweets in the room.  Service in this hotel is excellent! Friendly staff gave good suggestions on where to eat and directions.  Breakfast was at the club lounge and the spread was good and not too crowded.   Will return.,50
"We stayed for 3 nights on the 29th nov - 02 Dec.   The reason I said it was a bad start to our stay was because I booked via Hotelclub.com.  When we checked in I asked them just to make sure I was on the 75th anniversary package which in included daily breakfast/lunch, ferry tickets back to Hong Kong and sheratons anniversary gift but I was told no I was on a room only tariff.  I def booked the anniversary package and was told by mouth by a representative that I was on the anniversary package.  Also because I was staying for more than 2 nights that I should hAve got a free upgrade to the clubroom.  I was told by the reception that I wasn't the only guest who had this problem that they had a few guests who thought they had booked the same as me but it wasn't showing on their‚Ä¶",40
"The Sheraton Macau did a fantastic job with this stay. This Sheraton (the world's biggest) is in the centre of the Cotai Strip and is on the Sands casino. It's just over from the Venetian and next to City of Dreams. From the ferry, get on the light green bus with the Sheraton logo on the side- it couldn't be any easier.  It's a massive hotel with just short of 4,000 rooms (once Earth Tower is complete in early 2013). The check-in ropes looked like the wait for check-in could be long which is where Sheraton Club really came into it's own- quick, easy, friendly and painless.   The room was spacious, brand new and quite luxurious. There were also plenty of Sheraton amenities. There was no do not disturb sign which was either by design or forgotten. The TV wasn't working but I‚Ä¶",50
"Some friends and I stayed here for the Macau Grand Prix. We didn't have high expectations but we were very impressed - and we travel a lot (both for business and pleasure) so it takes a lot to impress us. We had 2 club rooms and 1 ""normal"" room. We were checked in at the club lounge and our concierge was amazing. Great service and a great sense of humour. It was a busy weekend in Macau and we were impressed that he remembered all our names and nothing was too much trouble.  The rooms were large and had everything we wanted. Our our small grumble was that noise from the nightclub downstairs by the pool - it was overpowering even though we were on a high floor. However, perhaps we were just in an unlucky location as the noise wasn't heard by our friends in other rooms.  What‚Ä¶",50
The amazing new and swanky Sheraton Macao hotel on the Cotai is everything one can dream about. From the entry into the hotel via the buzzing lobby to the frezied activity in the casino to the amazing selection of the classy restaurants.. it simply brilliant.,50
"We spent just one night at the Hotel. We are Platinum member and we had a upgrade to a fantastic suite. My daughter in law ordered two cakes from H√§gen Dasz and they took such a good care that everything went well.  The lounge for the Tower guest are not yet ready. Therefore we had breakfast at one  of the restaurant. This was a bit crowdy.The staff, especially one of the Manager Alexander, was every where and did a fantastic job. The transportation to Macao City has to be improved.There was no Taxi and the Shuttle bus is going to Galaxi and you have to change to a shuttle from the Galaxi Hotel. This is not convenient and timing.",50
"What a huge property. When I arrived there were people everywhere to help direct you. I didn't find the hotel layout intuitive and getting about was confusing. Room was comfortable and the bed great, as always.   Breakfast was not nice. It was an excellent selection but I just didn't think the quality was there.   Overall a very nice property and great for visiting the city of dreams. ",40
"Excellent hotel, very good customer service & they went the extra mile when I told them it was our honeymoon on arrival, they delivered a lovely cake & card to our room later on that evening. Pleasant surprise, the staff have been trained well & the decor was lovely. Good choice at breakfast the following morning too.",50
"The Sheraton provided us with a fantastic stay from the moment we entered. We are SPG members and were immediately channelled through the check in procedure. We were immediately upgraded to club status room etc with free breakfast.  Check in staff were extremely professional & pleasant in everyway, they could not be faulted. The room - extremely comfortable, everything you would expect & and a view from the 30th floor. Breakfast - Excellant, attending staff/mangement  were the same. Gym - great - new clean equipment with a personal trainer ! There are totally no negatives about this propery or staff at all !",50
"I was shepherded around from my arrival through the Lobby Hawaiian Welcome, just catching the last half hour of the Evening drinks and food in the Club Lounge. Superb, but some greedy guests. Breakfast outside next morning was calmer - the staff perhaps less helpful. Executive Suite luxurious, attractive, spacious and restful. Not much of a view outside, but must look at the Galaxy next time. It looked over the top. The Venetian was an earlier curiousity stop.",40
"I stayed at this hotel when it was just nearly opened. Generally, it was good. There was free shuttle buses to the harbor and also to other Sands properties. At the lobby, there's a casino. Kinda small, but enough as I am not a big gambling fan.  If there were 2 things that I have to be critical about, they would be 1) the long corridors does not give an air of luxury. Perhaps, they are trying to differentiate it from the to be opened St Regis, and 2) swimming pool was not open when I stayed there. From my room, I could see Conrad guests enjoying themselves in the pool while could only admire them instead.",40
"I stayed at this hotel recently with my son during our visit to Macau. In my opinion, this is an excellent hotel and best value for money. Friendly service, large comfortable rooms, spacious and clean lobby, well equipped gym, lively casino and excellent breakfast buffet. All we want and ask for. Thank you and well done.",50
"We got a great price on a room for 2 nights as part of the opening deals. There were 10 of us in total in 6 rooms. Check-in at the club floor was very friendly if a little slow (apparently a computer system issue). We were given the open of switching a small suite and a club room for a 2 bedroom suite, which we happily accepted.  The room is a great size, has a very nice Jacuzzi in the master bedroom and the bed is very comfy. The decoration is very nouveau riche Chinese, with plastic crystal light fittings, but that is to be expected in Macau. We had the group over for a quick drink to before we went to out for dinner, but were very disappointed by the mini bar only having 2 beers as the alcohol selection. We didn't have time to order drinks up so just ended up sharing them! ‚Ä¶",40
"I checked in early evening after taking the Cotai jet from Hong Kong Macau Ferry Terminal.  I was quickly greeted by the staff who directed me straight to the check in counter.  The reception desk staff spoke excellent English, which is a bit rare to find in Macau these days.  The room itself is very spacious and in great conditions, compared to other luxury hotels in Macau which show wear and tear quickly after being trashed by some tourists.  Definitely would stay here again!",50
"Booked two rooms for 4 nights in Oct, both upgraded to suites. Rooms are nicer comparing to normal Sheraton. Club lounge provides good variety of food for both breakfast and dinner. Service at lounge is excellent. Hotel is huge with quite good dinning and shopping options. Casino is right downstairs made convenient for people who like the games. We took the hotel opening offer so far the best value I've got in Macau.  Special thanks to front office manager Mr. Wessels and his staff at lounge who made my family stay very enjoyable.",50
"I went back and forth on a five or a four for this property.  In the end, it's about answering the question ""what kind of hotel do you want?""  If you want a personal and cozy experience, this hotel is not going to be a five in your mind.  If you want an outrageously big hotel with all of the bells and whistles, with beautiful, clean rooms, and just about everything else you can imagine, it's probably a five.  This is not to say the experience is impersonal - the club lounge did a great job remembering our names and catering to our every need.  Still, the place is so big that not everything can be that way.  Overall, it's a great new hotel in Macau at a reasonable price.",50
"I read reviews of the hotel and there were many negative reviews. My wife and I nevertheless booked this hotel for a vacation and found that the service, especially the club room, was very good. There was quick and very courteous service. I would say the problems the hotel had with the opening was overcomed. Club Lounge cocktail was very good, with a very good spread of food that we did not have to go to dinner, and breakfast was excellent. Even though we paid for the upgrade, we felt that it was worth the money. Recommend that you use this hotel.",40
"4 days of complete, total satisfaction. Not just the worlds biggest Sheraton but biggest in all aspects, service, presentation, room, bed, facilities, shops, location. Was actually the default hotel, with only 2 days notice, as The Venetian across the road was unable to offer 4 nights, so we stayed here. Hey, was so good, we promptly joined the SPG, preferred guest club. Hope to be back real soon.",50
"Is beautifull almost where ever in the world you're located.  This brand new hotel has tried a jungle theme which is mostly appealing to the children. Eventhough it is a nice sound from the tropical surroundings within the hotel. I argue that some people might find the whole theme a bit over the top.  Balloon guys, alive statues and other ""human"" animals. The different staff members does not communicate well between each other and it is clear that you are in a china..",40
"We stayed here for 3 nights on our honeymoon in a Club Room. It's hard to know where to start, there are so many good things to say. Rooms were grand, beautiful & well serviced. All staff were very friendly and polite. Pool was lovely & well attended too. Gym is the best hotel gym I've ever seen (book ahead if you want to participate in a class as they fill up quick).  The Club Room blew our expectations out if the water. When we booked it said something like, evening snacks available. Well they aren't just snacks, it's a whole buffet!! With Chefs carving meat.

From a soft features perspective (i.e., service, attention to detail, client attentiveness, other intantibles), I believe it can get there over time.    To clarify my 5-star ranking first, I think this hotel definitely deserves a top-10 ranking in Macau  There's no reason it should be ranked where it is ranked now (low 30s).  For anybody considering a ""nice"" hotel in Macau, the Sheraton should be on the shortlist, especially when evaluating value.      Tripadvisor aside, this hotel is a very solid 4-star property (which I think it what it is targeting anyway).  It is not a 5-star such as a Four Seasons, Mandarin, Ritz or event SPG's own St. Regis.

If you have Gold tier you'll wait some minutes. I do have Platinum tier with SPG so normally I would be entitled to check in at the Club Lounge. Sadly they told me this when I already went through the line at Gold tier check-in (even I told them that I do have Platinum status).  Okay, up to the lounge.

They were kindly to offer a wheelchair to my aged father and also a fast track for check-in purpose.  Still the check-in procedure required nearly half an hour and the two keys were found unable to open the doors. I hope after some time their service could be enhanced without the little chores we faced.   The hotel is built up with various little swimming pools, but it is adquate for my family alone to have one to swim with.",40
"This was my first time to Macau...and WOW! It's amazing on so many levels.  It's always lovely to stay at Sheraton Hotels and this trip really confirmed it to us.   We caught the courtesy bus from the ferry terminal and were shown to the huge lobby for checkin at the SPG desk. There we were told we had been upgraded to the Sky Tower, which put us on a floor high up. Unfortunately not a view of the Cotai strip.  Staff were professional, efficient and helpful as always.  It was a very long walk to the room, down a corridor we called the ""Green Mile.""(color of the decor/carpets) . We barely saw another person on our floor the whole time of our stay.

I have to say for a huge resort like this the staff is very attentive and friendly, but compared to other large resorts e.g. in Las Vegas there is also just a fraction of guests around.   Clearly Macau is a day destination and many tourists, specially mainland Chinese, come over for just 1 day of sightseeing and gambling and leave in the evening. At 10 a.m. around 100 persons where already lined up for the players club card registration to open.   I naturally came for the same things, doing a little sightseeing and gambling.

The Sheraton only opened on 20th September 2012, one month earlier, so there were still people working on the fixtures, although this did not interrupt our stay at all.  The hotel was so large it was easy to get lost, but there are staff members everywhere to help you and point you in the right direction.

Combine this with a very nice crew who offered a high level of service (despite being a newly opened hotel) and you have what you need for a perfect family stay. We will be back!,50
"Obviously i was expecting the hotel to be immaculate, after all it is the largest new hotel opened by the Sheraton chain in quite a while. However what surprised me was just how amazingly attentive the staff were. We were taken to the new gold and platinum check in desk, given a welcome drink, and made to feel at home. The staff introduced themselves, and went about checking us in. what was really nice, was that during the stay the folks that checked us came over knew us by name and seemed to truly care that we were having a good stay, both in and out of the hotel.

An ominous lane control system was evident. Fortunately we arrived just before midnight so the queue was minimal. Check-in was quick. However we were merely pointed in the direction of our room. The hotel is huge and we had not a clue until we asked for an escort. After that everything went smoothly. The room was well appointed, spacious and comfortable.

I had to wait an hour in the queue to check in then 20 minutes to get my bag at the concierge because they have lost it. When I finally get to my room the keycard was not working. The room was Ok, swimming pool was small and without any charm. Another issue, I had to pay for the breakfast which was included. I had to negotiate another 15 minutes to remove it from my bill (by the way the checkout took me 20 more minutes). It cost me 400.- USD for one night. Even a nice Palace is not that expensive.

The lounge breakfast is extensive and comparable to a full buffet breakfast. The evening canapes offers a wide variety of food and drink which could serve as a light dinner. The staff is also generally very nice. However, the pools are designed to be ""fragmented"" into several small pools and the club room is of average size only.",40

When we stepped in, dancers in Haiwaiian(?) costumes were performing.  Behind them was the casino.  The room is a standard one, yes, a very standard one.  All elements of a hotel room you would expect from a Sheraton group are all included, no surprise at all.  What bothered me was the lighting control.  Like many other hotel rooms, one cannot control all the lights from the bedside.  Service is good, the hardware is new at least.  Not very easy to get a cab, it takes time.

In the one that was open the pool(s) surrounds a central dome and is broken into several pools giving an opportunity to get your own 'private' pool if quiet enough. There are also open air deck chairs and undercover cabanas which were very luxurious. Great place for the kids with a brilliant BBQ on Sundays and outdoor movies on bean bags.

"Stayed in a 31/F Club room. Somehow the contemporary furnishing and fixtures doesn't convey luxury. Signage at lobby level rather inadequate. Although linked to Conrad and Holiday Inn, housing 3 floors of shops, the Sands Cotai complex lacks the vibes and magnetism to hold you (and your wallet) within the building..  Club rooms are on the higher floors but Lounge is located on Level 4, carved out from the convention space. Not your usual cozy sized Club Floor. Operates and looks like a buffet eatery.  Oh, bring your bath, shampoo and lotion; the toiletries provided are local made generics.",40
"Let's be clear from the outset - this is not a small, romantic getaway, or a quaint B&B.   It's a monolith on a gargantuan scale, currently the largest Sheraton property in the world.  It has literally thousands of rooms, a casino in the foyer (shielded from view as you enter, but inescapably there), multiple towers, and long hallways of identical rooms (like the nightmare where you never seem to reach the end).  However - seemingly understanding that most people will walk in the front doors and be just overwhelmed by the size of the place, the management has very wisely set large numbers of greeting staff throughout to help unravel the complexity of it all.  You're met at the doors, directed to check-in, directed again to the elevators...  everywhere you need to find, there is‚Ä¶",40

Generally it is similar to most of the other 5 star hotels in Macau (Galaxy, Okura etc). Location is better than Galaxy complex as it is closer to the main Cotai strip and you can walk to most other hotels. Pool area is a collection of small pools which is ok for lounging but not great if you want a proper swim. Overall a reliable hotel.",40
"Stayed here for 4 nights in a Club room as an SPG member. Enjoyed and made full use of the free cocktail hours and lounge. A few teething problems, as would be expected, only one pool open right now but this was never crowded. Everybody was very pleasant and helpful and spoke good English. For a big hotel it still had some nice personal touches like the delivery of a birthday card and cake to the room for my husband. Shuttle buses to the rest of the island are a great way to get around and staff were able to advise on this. Hope to return! Thank you!",40
"During the last weekend, I stayed at Sheraton Macao to celebrate my friend‚Äôs birthday. We were pleasantly surprised that they presented us with a birthday card and cake.  I did enjoy their kind hospitality, high level of service and hotel quality.  Express check-in for spg member, comfortable and luxurious rooms with beautiful view, 7 dinning options with a wide variety of foods (fresh seafood at Xin & Italian cuisine at Bene).  The offers provided to Sheraton Club guests are very good ie complimentary wifi, breakfast, afternoon tea.  In addition, the fitness centre is the best that I have ever seen, trainer is professional and the fitness equipment are excellent! The steam room & sauna are also good.

"It was a good experience to become a SPG member and stayed in Sheraton Macau hotel. I have booked a 2 nights standard room to celebrate with my birthday. Unfortunity I felt not very well and I cannot cancel with the pre-paid booking one day before that. Just have a try to contact with the online staff requesting to postpone my booking, the staffs were very nice and tried her/his best to contact with the hotel and let me postpone the booking one week later. The check-in staff was very helpful and upgrade my room to club room with a reasonable price to have complimentary wifi, breakfast, afternoon tea and cocktail.",50
"Had a couple of days exploring the new Sheraton Macau, can hotels get any bigger?  This place has got it all!  The service was very friendly, professional and especially for a place this size.  I thought staff service was indicative of the Sheraton Brand and its continued commitment to maintaining continuity for its guests internationally while having its own Macau style about it.  The check in experience was more streamlined than I have come across, all done in about 3 minutes.  The executive suite was a great size and makes it induces one to want to stay on (as I did)  The food was also great and looking forward to trying more of their restaurants in the future   Looking forward to going back!",50
"Stayed one night on an SPG points and cash award. The hotel was nice but the service was problematic beginning with a door key that wouldn't open and ending with a 20 minute ""normal"" checkout. Also my wifi amenity didn't work and after 20 minutes trying to rectify it I gave up. In the 12 hours I spent in the hotel, I spent over an hour dealing with service related issues. Although I don't expect  service agents in another country to speak perfect English, the agents English skills were challenged anytime something went off script and made solving simple problems an ordeal. I trust these problems will iron themselves out over time but for now I give the hotel 3 stars for room quality but 1 star for service. Incidentally, I talked to a female manager about my service related‚Ä¶",30

This is one of the hottest locations for ladies! I need to go there to check it out in person!  Other facilities  1) no staff standby in the changing room next to the fitness centre / swimming pools.

"I have been a member of the SPG since 2007 and I stayed at this hotel to celebrate my own birthday with my friends and this stay with this hotel is the worse stay that I have ever experienced since 2007 with the following reasons:-  1.		when I checked in, the staff at front desk me that I need to check out the deluxe room on and then check-in again for the club room.  After complaining to a member of a staff at the front desk, I save the hustle of checking out and checking in for changing from deluxe room to club room.  However, when a member of the staff brought me to the club room, the staff put me into a twins bed club room rather than thr originally booked double bed room.

"After two days staying in the Sheraton Hotel, I could say the staff here is amazingly good and helpful.  Being a SP member with no points left, I still enjoyed the privileges and and experienced the hospitality of the SP staff.  If it was possible, I really owed a thankful note to the lady who helped me to complete the check in procedure.  She was wonderfully understanding and initiated to upgrade one night so that we could afford to stay in the same room.   The executive suite is so well decorated and spacious with gorgeous views of the Venetician and the nearby scencery.  The bed is so comfortable that I slept well in a strange bed immediately.

"I stayed at Sheraton Macao Hotel for 4 nights to attend a workshop there. I was amazed by the hospitality from each and every staff there. Even though most of the staffs speak Cantonese only, but they were trying their best to provide the best care to every guest. The hotel itself is huge, you can even get lost if you did not pay attention to the sign. The restaurants were amazing, I tried Feast for buffet breakfast, Bene for lunch, and Xin for another lunch. Both are great restaurants with perfect ambience and friendly staffs. The room is big enough with beautiful layout as well as luxurious bathroom. I would also reccommend this hotel to hold some meetings/workshop/seminar. The meeting rooms are spacious and they provide various coffee break menus. The location of the hotel is‚Ä¶",50
"We had a great stay at this hotel.. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. The only draw-back is language but that is something we faced most places in Macao... We travelled with kids although Macao is not necessarily a kid-centric place. However, they had a great time with the kidcare programme the hotel runs. And they offer baby sitting too..",40
"This is a brand new hotel. Excellent room with first class facility. We love the room.  My only negative is in the level of details in the ""Feasts"" restaurant. The waiters were not attentive enough. Plates should be cleared quickly during buffet dining. As for food ... Cheeses should not be served on its own. Where are the biscuits or grapes? Nasi lemak should be served with fried  peanuts and ikan bilis. Not a great place for dim sum by a long shot.   My suggestion is to go out and try the many excellent local Macanese restaurants such as ""Fernando"" (9 Praia de Hac Sa).",40
"We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights and have checked into a Suite on the 39F which included Lounge service. Unfortunately we arrived after 9pm and there was no more food service, not even drinks, we got bottled water, better than nothing... The lounge closed at 11pm, doors closed with no more access. We would expect that the room would stay open for guests to sit around or use the internet, but I suppose you should all be going to the casino? The buffet breakfast looked good but there were flies in the seating area outside while the inside AC was freezing cold. When we returned to our floor, there were cigarette butts sitting on the trash can and a bag of leftover takeout food sitting next to it. These items remained there all day and thru the night, still there when we checked‚Ä¶",30

Had felt the front desk staff are kinda SQUARE to handle late check out request, as a over 3,000 rooms international branded hotel, a guest like me to celebrate their grand opening with my trail stay...a little request for late checkout which was rejected 3 times by the same receptionist that made me really despair.   I love the lobby lounge, Palm. Great band, good singers 'n nice saxophone player!!  The waitress, Nana is pretty friendly 'n full of smiling. The manager, Park is helpful 'n nice. Whole thing made me feel enjoyable under a marvelous sentiments. ",30
"I was expecting this to be of a higher tier than the Holiday Inn at Cotai Sands however I was so wrong.Check in lobby was HUGE with flocks of people. Then after checking in, no one to show where to catch the lift to room (spent a little time to find), then literally from lift to room took 2 minutes to walk to. Room was dusty and dimly lit (even when lights were all  on), no view from window (looks at a piece of construction land), toilet was basic and plastic bags were hard to open (for tooth paste and shower cap etc). Bathing amenities felt cheap. Slippers were also paper thin.  I found it particularly bad value with Sheraton's brand. Disappointed.",20
"What a beautiful hotel. Service is top notch, very friendly staff. SPG recognition is fabulous. Club lounge: WOW!!!!! I can go on and on and on...We were there last week. We are still talking about it. The Manager Alexander Wessels IS  what a manager should be, courteous, attentive, ""on the ball"". Every detail is noticed by him....at the end .... the little things well done are really what counts  and makes you want to come back. Sunny was a great host as well always smiling, showing us around, making sure we have all the comforts that we need and more. Congratulations to all!!!! you should be proud of your accomplishments and I am confident you will maintain this same level of service. I know you will not settle for less.   Kudos!!!!",50
"Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Where should I start with the accolades for this brand new hotel. Stayed at this wonderful hotel on Sept. 25 for one night only. I really regret that I didn't stay here another day or two. It was truly a enjoyable and pleasurable experience.  As soon as the bell staff saw us they were tripping over each other to help us with our luggage. There was a long line (about 25 people) for check-in but it was cleared up very quickly. The check-in staff was very courteous and helpful and spoke very good English.The check-in staff is very attentive to your needs and tries their best to satisfy your requests. It costs nothing to ask politely! Maybe a little generosity wouldn't hurt if your request is fulfilled.  I always feel that if you treat a person nicely, they‚Ä¶",50
"Check in.  There was a long line up at check in time. As a SPG member, there is a special check in counter that can avoid long line up. The hotel was open one month ago.  It takes sometimes for the staff to check me in. But that wasn't a big issues   Check out.  There was no express check out in room TV.  The check out time is 11:00 am that I thought is a bit early. When I asked the staff at check in if it could be extend.  I was told the hotel was full on the next day.  But it wasn't public holiday and the hotel emphaize that is the largest Sheraton in the world.   I doubt the hotel was full.

"We just came back from a wonderful trip to Macao.  We wanted to go somewhere to spend our wedding anniversary and chanced upon the Sheraton as it just recently opened.  The hotel itself is nice, simple, though not as flashy as other hotels on the strip.  The rooms (got the club upgrade with the 75th anniversary special) are not big, but the important thing is that they're clean and relaxing.  Bed was super comfy.  The kids enjoyed a lot at the pool (thanks, Dennis!) but could be better if they had a kiddie pool.  We ordered in-room dining and the food was tasty!  We also got to use the Club Lounge (always go for it), the breakfast and even the dinner had a nice spread.  The casino is small which is fine, there are other hotels on the strip that you can go to as well.  We had a‚Ä¶",40
"Despite the more prestigious hotel brand name, this is fundamentally just a slightly nicer version of the Sands and Venetian hotels. Same fundamental approach. Ie Big, noisy, cookie cutter service. Rooms are bland and basic (we were already in the more expensive suits), amenties basic, no sense of real luxury. Strongly targeted for the mainland crowd. It wasn't that full and even then the SPG Lounge was not able to cater for us at Breakfast. The Spa was the only brighter spot, despite facilities not being finished, the treatment was quite good.",30
"We just returned from an amazing holiday at the new Sheraton in Macau. The service here was top notch, noticeable from the moment we arrived at the Ferry terminal and were personally escorted to the complimentary shuttle.   We booked a club double room. This was a great choice, much to my surprise. With club access, I was anticipating breakfast, and maybe some juices, coffee, and tea, and possibly a few snacks (bread, cookies) throughout the day in a nearby room. Instead, the club services made us feel like VIP guests, which included free internet, breakfast buffet, midday snacks, and evening cocktails with ""appetizers"" (the buffet spreads were fabulous, and eating space nice with high chairs for kids, and outdoor seating).

"Me and my husband took my parents to Macau @ last week of September, 2012.  We had a fabulous expericence in this new opened Hotel.  As a SPG Platatium Member, we were arranged chcked in at 4th floor and there is a very professtional staff take care of my family.  His name is ""Al win"" with his native language.  The Deluxy Suite on 35th floor brought us a memorible trip in Macau.  The experience in Excetutive club was wonderful.  The breakfast has lots of choice and the happy hour is, not only for happy hour, but also a dinner buffet.  Do not miss the first floor's restaurent-Feast, the Pork Chop Bun even better than the tranditional popular restaurent in downtown.  The Rocket Salad is awsome.

"There are so many hotels in Macau and it is very hard to be the best one.  Sheraton said this is the biggest hotel in the world.  I am not sure about this.  There are 2 towers (one is not open yet) but it doesn't seem like THAT big.  We've stayed at the executive suite for a night. We checked in at the club lounge.  Service is good but I think it takes a bit longer than I thought. The room itself is spacious.  The decor is very modern. Our room is facing the other tower but there's nothing much to see.  When you look down, you see the swimming pools plus a lot of big machines.  I don't really understand why they don't cover up those big machines at the podium level (same level as swimming pool).  50% of the room is looking at that and it doesn't seems like the best thing to see.‚Ä¶",30
"When we stay there, Sheraton just opened a week.  They really need to think about to improve to meet 5-star standard. Room - Nothing special, room space like other Macau hotel.  Working table is stainlesssteel one like using at office....weird! Swimming Pool - just open 1 floor (they should have another floor?).  Pool area divided several small pool, you will not like it if you really want to swim! Club Lounge - Breakfast & happy hour at night is okay.  However, afternoon tea is really disappointed!!  Only prawn / fish / rice crackers & marsmallow everyday...no hot items nor petit cake!  They should consider to provide finger sandwiches / toasts! Casino - very small and not connected with Holiday Inn/Conrad one Food - only tried noodle in the food court.  It is okay but not much‚Ä¶",30
"I arrived on 2 days after the official opening, so was slightly apprehensive as to the readiness of the hotel. Only stayed 1 night, so cannot really evaluate it completely. All in all I was satisified, I enjoyed the perks of being a Platinum SPG member such as the upgrade to a suite on the club level, as well as use of the club lounge. Everything about the hotel is huge, from what I hear its the largest Sheraton, and they have plas to double it with a new tower. I just hope they will be able to manage correctly. As far as the rooms go, they are nice, but not in a luxurious way. Being in Asia, Sheratons are usually much better, but this one resembled alot the US Sheratons. Fairly spartan, all business. The spread in the club lounge for breakfast was very good, catering to all‚Ä¶",40
"Bottom Line: Would only recommend staying at this hotel if you get a very cheap packaged deal. Otherwise, it's definitely not 5 star quality yet, and still lacking in service. Besides the kind greetings in the lobby, ""hi and welcome"" the staff are not experienced enough in english, making it a very frustrating experience. Try asking anyone where the food court is, or how express checkout works, where the shuttle bus is, etc..  and you'll see a bunch of blank faces.   Cons:  - HORRIBLE view, despite being a SPG member. Got a view of the back of the hotel facing all the ventilation systems, pipes, you know what I mean etc.. That's what happens when you book a cheap promotional package. They give you the worst rooms. - Swimming pools are not all opened. The one that is open is‚Ä¶",20

Love the kids club activities for my daughter, we found the staff very friendly. Unlike all the other hotels in Macau which mainly cater for adults. This hotel is great for the whole family.",50
"This brand new hotel opened within the last ten days so we weren't sure what to expect given staff and amenities would be put to the test with China's National Day long weekend festivities! We requested an upgrade to the Sheraton Club at an additional $50A per night. This gave us breakfast for two, snacks and coffee/tea during the day and dinner and alcohol at night in their club lounge! Amazing value!! Ask for Alex Wessel, Sheraton Club Manager...he is an articulate English speaking guy who quietly and efficiently manages his large staff whilst attending to the needs of club patrons. This hotel is at capacity at the moment but service is not diminished given the volume of patrons! Well done Sheraton!",40
"Checked in on 29/9/12 and stayed for one night in the club floor. I am still in the room as I am writing this review. It's such a big disappointment with such an ordinary room. Not luxurious and 5 star at all. It makes it a lot worse when I had paid $2861 HKD, equivalent to $366 USD, for it.. WiFI is unstable, on and off every 10-20 seconds. It was really frustrating! When I booked, the hotel was not opened yet, so no review was available. As Sheraton was a brand name and never stayed at one, I gave it a go believing it could not go too wrong with a five-star hotel. How wrong I was as the room was so ORDINARY! It definitely had turned me off the Sheraton brand forever.",10
"We stayed at the Sheraton Macau on the 2nd day of its opening. The hotel was nice and clean and the view from our room was good. It has fairly good shuttle bus connections to other hotels as well as to the Macau peninsula, ferry terminals and airport.  I would recommend this hotel for visitors who are not there for the sole purpose of gambling as its casino is on a much smaller scale than the other casinos. It was also a good deal as we only paid about USD140 per room per night.",40
"I got a good deal at HKD $1251 all-in for last weekend which I found it was even cheaper than a 3-star hotel in Macau. Agree with other guests that the hotel and the rooms are not a WOW, but it is simply very comfy and clean. As long as I didn't expect a luxury one at this price, I think the hotel and room are just good. Will come again when there's good deal again.  Con: No in-room complimentary Wi-Fi might be common among hotels in Macau, I spent MOB 120 for a 24-hr pass as I had to get in touch with my clients. I'd suggest the hotel to review the policy.",40
"This hotel is whole new, so not everything is in service yet, but for us no problem. There was not so many guest so it was very nice. Good shuttle service from airport, also when you want to go to ferry terminal for HKG. Breakfast was different like other 5 Star hotel, as here  there was not a lot but special food like smoked salmon smoked marlin etc. we like the set up with earth, sky with tree in ground floor. It gives a better feeling then Venetian, and also not so 'fake' world.",50
"Spent 1 night at the deluxe suite just after the opening.  The suite is just average, nothing makes you WOW when u get inside. I asked for a room facing the macau tower, as there was a firework competition that night. Which was taken care of by the professional staff at check in.  The living room is okay. The bed is rather small considering it is a deluxe suite.  The bathroom is great with a hugh tub.  The pool which is good for chill but not exactly ideal for swimming with the design. Pool staff is friendly too and the lounge is right next door so its perfect.  The restaurant - Feast, is nicely decorated.

All Cotai shopping and dining attractions surrounding the hotel indeed! Surprisingly, its overall atmosphere is still truly restful, despite a big casino on the hotel's ground floor.

Waited for 1/2 hour and very frustrating our special request were not noted down in the system with the staff accusing us of making it up until we showed her email which confirmed our request. Still unable to fulfill a simple request and unapologetic. Very impersonal service and staff seemed frustrated. Other staff encountered was ok, best customer service were the greeters at the lifts.

Therefore there is nothing special at this Sheraton. the Hotel does have two towers (sky- and earth tower) on top of the new Sands Casino below it.   Standard rooms at sky tower are nice, but not as big as Venetian's Suites. The bath only have a short tube - the pillows are not with feathers and somehow bulky the sheets were nice an cosy. The rest of the room was standard - nothing special and the view is just to the next building from the sky tower either on the right to Conrad and or on the left side to the earth tower of this hotel. Somehow special I found the low sealing and the special decoration of the gateways to the rooms. Also the elevators are confusing since they do have‚Ä¶",40

I paid almost double of the promotion price launched by the hotel for a regular twin room so that I can have 3 guests sharing and requested for an extra bed, but the hotel staff said the increased payment was only a deal between myself and Hotel.com, and I would need to pay additional fees for the extra bed.
