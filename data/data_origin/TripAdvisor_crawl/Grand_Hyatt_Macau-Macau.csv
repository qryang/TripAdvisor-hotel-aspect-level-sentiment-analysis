Staff is friendly and helpful. The hotel room is clean and grand. I would also like to make particular thanks to the frontline staff Jack for the excellent service; your warm welcome makes me have a pleasant stay. Thank you for your accompany us.,50
"Hotel room is very spacious and clean. More importantly, the staff are also very accommodating to family with baby and helped us to settle a few request which include loaning us swimming floats. Location wise, the Light rail transit station is just outside Hyatt and thus it is very convenient. I will highly recommend family with kids to stay! ",50
"In my third time to stay here in hotel ( Grand Hyatt) this is one of the most memorable experience all the staff are hospitable and friendly specially MS. SHARON in front office she really give us example of true hospitable staff and 5 star service even though we’re in room already, she called us and ask how’s the room and the view she really amazing. I would like to thank her for the cake and the fruits for my birthday gift that she presented to me as well as Grand hyatt staff. She also remind some of the staff to give us a bid farewell upon our check out because she’s not working today.. IT’S A REALLY BIG THANKS TO MS. SHARON. Hope to see you soon to our next staycation in GRAND HYATT.   Ps. Thanks to Jack as well for assistance during our check out.",50
"This hotel was such a pleasant surprise! The room was bigger than I expected and service was just on point. The outdoor pool is very sunny and nice (they could only add more green to the place).   We got a really good tariff because it was the Hyatt 11th anniversary and they gave us access to the “Grand Club”, which made a huge difference on the comfort of our stay. Besides the breakfast there, we were entitled to the afternoon tea and the evening cocktail, with lots of food, natural juices, cheese, beverages... and the space is just great, modern with really cool details.   I will definitely come back, this hotel has a great price-quality ratio and the staff is truly nice and competent. Also, the music selection was surprisingly good. ",50
"I had a pleasant stay with my friend. It was my first time staying in this hotel. Thank you Jack for escorting us to the room, giving us a brief introduction, and arranging a late checkout for me. I've also tried Mezza 9, superb service, one of the buffet hosts (who takes the orders) can remember my table No. when I go back to the buffet line, it was impressive!",50
"One night... just get away from the doldrums of COVID-19. Check in - excellent, speedy, efficient  Customer Service- top notch, impressive  Room - size, quality, amenities all great. Pool - those who say it’s a little ’small’  I recommend an eye test, with the exception of Galaxy Macau and Studio City, it’s probably the biggest on the strip.  Breakfast - extremely disappointed.... but let’s notch that one up to COVID-19 👎🏻👍🏻",40
"This time I booked total 4 rooms staying with another 3 families. The check in reception looks sharpe and the check in staff is very nice and helpful.  Luckily all rooms are ready at around noon time and all have been upgraded to suite rooms which we love it. However my room has a burning smell which the staff claimed it is coming from the air conditioner. The staff didn’t offer me to switch to another room, my whole family has suffered the bad smell for 3 hours until the smell gone. I suggest the hotel to offer a room move immediately.  The pool is okay, a little smaller than I expected. I love the sunshine. We ordered some food and drink from the poolside bar yet the food took some time to prepare. I suggest to put more chairs and cabanas at the pool as we have to wait for…",20
"Customer service is one of the key factors for us to decide which hotel to stay at, and Grand Hyatt Macau has it all. We spent a night at the hotel on 10 August. We really enjoyed it because of the excellent customer service of the hotel. All the staff (super friendly and helpful) treated us with the greatest courtesy. We received a complimentary fruit basket and two plush toys upon arrival. We were ungraded to a suite with a magnificent view of the water fountain. The room is comfy and roomy. Everything in the room was clean, neat and well-arranged. The hotel offers exceptional facilities - a rectangular outdoor pool lined with palm trees on both sides, three outdoor jacuzzi pools and a gym room on the third floor. We had a relaxing afternoon tea at the lobby lounge. The cakes…",50
"We checked in Grand Hyatt Macau on 18Jun and stayed for one night. Upon checking in, Diana warmly greeted us and explain our staycation booking clearly. We were lucky been upgraded to an one bed room suite. We can see Wynn palace’s fountain show clearly and the weather was extremely good. After a small break we went to swimming pool, view was spectacular! We ordered some young coconuts and spent our whole afternoon there. When dinner time, we went to Beijing kitchen. We order the set menu and every dish was perfect especially the Beijing Style Duck. The next day we checked out around 1300hrs. Alice was adorable and helpful. Due to some unhappy issue happed so l gave some feedback through their survey. Although we got their reply late but Manager-Sabrini was kind and sweet, she…",40
Jack at reception was most pleasant and helpful. Beautiful and spacious suite! Staff members at the Lounge and Beijing Kitchen were courteous and professional. Breakfast served in the executive lounge on the 37th year was delightful. ,40
"Tired their pool access with lunch set at mop 288 only, pool is huge and clean, lunch portion is not big but enough, price is acceptable with 6 hrs free parking.   And you can see the view of their partner hotels.  ",50
"We would like to thank all the staff especially  Ms. Stella, Ms Ann and Mr Adam from front office Ms. Happy from B&F Ms. Vilin and Mr.Jack from cabana pool side who were very friendly and efficient in their work.",50
"The receptionist in Grand Hyatt Macau, Ann, helped me to have an excellent checkin experience on 25/06/2020. She arranged the best for with great manner. The experience is like talking to friend and joyful.  Thanks a lot",50
I don't give many 5 stars but this hotel impressed me. Bus from the ferry terminal like all hotels in Macau. Staff are very friendly. Rooms are modern and to a very high standard. Good spa and gym. Would recommend the Duck at the Beijing Kitchen followed by the House of Dancing Water show. The hotel is not cheaper but I would recommend.,50
"It was our first time staying at the Grand Hyatt Macau but our third visit to Macau. Front the moment we set foot on property, we were treated so well and made to feel so welcome. Sharon at reception checked us in, and she was so friendly and kind - it felt like I was talking to a good friend. She introduced us to Tina (the butler), and Tina escorted us to our beautiful room. She gave us a tour of the room and gave us her card should we need anything. Tina as well was super friendly and welcoming.  The room was absolutely gorgeous! We had a perfect view of Wynn Palace and its nightly fountain shows. Our room had a separate living room and bedroom. The bathroom was large and spacious. Everything was clean and felt very comfortable.  We had access to the Club Lounge which had a…",50
I stay at the hotel during 5/1/2020 to 1/6/2020. This is my first time to visit Grand Hyatt Macau which is a memorable trip for me and my friend. We stay at the hotel for one night for my friend's birthday! Tina welcome me at door and she helped me to do check in with Echo. The process of check-in and check-out is fast and effective. I also benefit from my membership. Tina and Echo prepare the birthday surprise for my friend and my friend was touched! Tina and Echo really make our stay become more memorable and they are nice and passionate to the guests. They help us to design the itineraries in Macau and they focus on what we need and give us a quick response. I really give a big thumb to them and this made me to leave give good comment to hotel immediately. I still think I…,50
I love this hotel mainly because its very convenient and its also very quiet. Staff are very sincere and really helpful when you need them. The room view is superb and spacious bathroom. The room have some wear and tear but acceptable!,50
"최근 상황이 안 좋음에도 불구하고 Assistant manager, Danielle Zhou, 그리고 모든 스태프들이 미소를 잃지 않고 친절하게 응수했습니다. 특히 Danielle Zhou는 제가 도착하기 전에 했던 모든 요청을 들어주었고, 늦은 체크아웃을 도와주었습니다. 그녀 덕분에 이 호텔의 첫인상부터 마지막까지 모든 것이 기쁨과 고마운 시간으로 가득 차 있었습니다. 그녀 덕분에 하얏트 호텔에 대한 기대가 상승했고, 다음에도 하얏트 호텔을 이용할 것입니다. 호텔의 전반적인 청결함이 최고였고, 친절하고 배려하는 반응이 인상적이었습니다.  Despite the recent bad situation, Assistant manager, Danielle Zhou, and all the staff members responded kindly without losing their smiles. Danielle Zhou, in particular, listened to all the requests I had made before I arrived, and gave me a late check-out.

Thanks to her, expectations for the Hyatt Hotel have been raised, and I will definitely stay at the…",50
"Modern hotel in Macau that is always kept tidy with the most stunning beautiful arrangements. Unlike other hotels in Macau, you will forget you're in the city of casinos as the hotel is without any cigarette smells or rowdy crowds. The bar/restaurant at the lobby hosts phenomenal band/singer during the evening which adds to the atmosphere of the hotel. Rooms are clean and modern with tech. Excellent service, especially by Randy.",50
"Wow. This hotel was beautiful! From the first steps you take into the lobby, to the room itself, it was fantastic. The room was clean and spacious. The hotel was also conveniently located and we walked numerous times to The Venetian and other casinos. After staying at this Hyatt hotel and how amazing it was, I'm looking into becoming a Hyatt member! Excellent service.",50
"we had a superb stay here.  my wife and I and our 3 children.  we took on Grand Deluxe Suite King for us and a Grand Suite Twin for the kids.  rooms were just opposite each other.  checkin was seamless in the lounge.  CINDY SHI and PEGGY assisted us and looked after us so well all three days.  our butler RANDY WONG was also eager to help and proactively offered lunch and dinner suggestions and then made all bookings for us.  the rooms are spectacular.  the whole hotel is gorgeous.  plenty of entertainment in the lobby for everyone, everyday.  the lounge is superb and huge.  offering 5 star fare for breakfast and dinner everyday.  we cannot wait to return.  we booked directly through the hotel and JENNY CHAN was extremely accommodating every step of they way :)",50
"I was staying at Grand Hyatt Macau for two nights with my family for a vacation. We arrived a bit early, before the check-in time but one of the staff from the concierge, Mr. Sigit, was very quick to help taking care of our luggage and recommended us to return after 3 pm for the check-in process. The excellent service didn't stop there as he gave us lots of recommendation about place to visit and food to try, and also very detailed transport option around Macau and for going back to Hong Kong airport. He took the initiative to arrange some take-away breakfast for us as we had to take the earliest ferry back to Hong Kong on our last day.  We were also impressed by Mr. Reven who were very helpful and quick to arrange our transport option back to the ferry terminal first thing in…",50
I really enjoyed the meal! expensive but it's worth it. egg tart is really good.  I think Hyatt is better than Lord Stowes. (It's private judgement!)  croissant is also good. Jamon & melon .. wow..  The view is really good cuz I could enjoy the amazing water shows.(Wynn palace),50
"Friendly and professional staff, very clean and quiet room. Really like the availability of Bluetooth speaker to play my music in the room. Good way to relax after a day of meeting. Generally, a very nice place to stay for biz trip",50

"We were here during the 66th Macau Grand Prix races. So, the city was very crowded. We stayed at a corner suite overlooking Wynn Palace. We could watch the fountain show every hour. Our room was big and clean.  The hotel had lots of taxi waiting in front of the hotel. The taxi fare was inexpensive. We visited so many magnificent landmarks and amazing historical sites by taxi. I could not think of any negative experience while we were staying in this hotel.",40
"Stayed there for couple days during x'mas eve.  Angel at Member check-in desk was fantastic. Suggested us to purchase breakfast buffet. Asked if we needed any help on dinner reservations.  Got upgrade to the suite as well.  For sure, the breakfast buffet was awesome. Ton of quality choices without the mad rush of people like at Sheraton.    Tried the Signature massage at the Spa. It was good and worth the money.   Only down side was check out.  Due to multiple credit holds (i signed my Spa charges to the room), i had three separate credit card bills (three signatures).  Not sure why but this is first time i experienced anything like that...",40
"There are couple things not working well in the premier suite that I stayed at.  First, the curtain blind in the premier suite bedroom malfunction from the first day. I requested for technician checkup, they said it’s mechanical failure and cannot be fixed unless taking the whole blind off and will take quite a long time to fix.  Given I have another room reserved that’s connected to this premier suite, I was told there’s no availability on other floor during peak season,  and thus not able to change rooms.   I basically had the curtain blinds closed and unable to open it up manually, which basically I lost the bedroom view during the whole duration of the stay. Second, the TV in the living room of the premier suite is not functioning properly either, the sensor was pulled out…",10
It was first time to travel Macau with my 79 years old pretty mom I met very nice staff in Grand Hyatt hotel in Macau.  Her name was TINA. She gave us many good information about travel Macau.  We also  take a good care of my mom. I really appreciate it.  Thank you so much TINA :) 엄마의 79살 생신축하 가족여행으로 상해를 거쳐 마카오 여행을하게되었다. 마카오는 가족들이 처음방문하는곳이라 조금 낮설기도했지만 그랜드하얏트에서 만난 TINA 스텝 덕분에 즐거운 추억들을 많이 만들수있었다 호텔동선부터 날씨에맞는 옷차림까지 세심한 배려가 우리가족을 감동시켰다 다음에 또 마카오여행을  기대해본다^^,50
"Clean room, kind staff. and good foods. I cannot think about any negative experience while we were staying this hotel. We stayed at corner suites overlooking Wynn Palace. We could watch fountain show every hour. Get a room with Club Access. Evening food selections at club lounge was worth every penny.",50
"We have been lucky to get upgraded to two suite rooms, which was normally our choice, but this time we went with our kids and thought maybe interconnecting deluxe rooms would be easier with the kids. However, the kids love the suite room, as the room is huge with separate living room and dining table. The hotel is nicely decorated, but it does slowly show its age now, and I think maybe worthwhile looking at the drainage, and the water is draining away very slowly in the basin, and the toilet also has the same issue, but it is not a big big problem, it's still within my tolerance level. Other than that, everything is just perfect.  Friendly staff, especially Echo, she was so attentive to everything, there was nothing for us to worry about, she made checking in and checking out so…",50
"The hotel has very friendly staff and is well maintained. We had reserved a club suite and were very impressed with the check in on the executive floor and the snacks and drinks provided during the day and evening. We did not eat out as there was more than sufficient food provided. Our suite was a good size, clean and we had a roll out bed was provided for my daughter.  There was a slight delay at check in but they added 2 hours to our check out time compensate. Was very well handled. The hotel is about 20 minutes walk from the Venetian & Cotai shopping strips - mostly undercover, so well located if you want to do be by the casinos.",50
"In comparing with other branches and leading competitors, it was boring and exhausted !! For the same price I got better options . Extra cost to Club was not justified. However staff was helpful. Expecially Randy.",20
"Stayed during the Christmas festive.  Room size is generous. First impression of lobby is positive, however the sight of barricaded queue system for check in makes it look very cold and unfriendly/ lack of hospitality feel. Understand the high traffic but since Hyatt offers mobile check in for their members, a dedicated counter should be allocated for these guests who took advantage of mobile check in, instead of having to queue up with all the guests.   Breakfast was rather disappointing with mostly “generic” menu and food.. we can’t even find strawberry in the buffet line. Only 3 types of cut fruits ( watermelon, pineapple, honeydew/rock melon).   Perfect location if you are taking the recently operational light rail transit, which stops right in front of the hotel ( exit…",40
"This is my second time staying here. It was what you’d expect from a grand Hyatt. Not much has changed. Since I first stayed, I’d say that the cleanliness isn’t as up to par but wasn’t bad. I liked the nespresso machines with the refilled cups every day.",40
Hospitality at grand Hyatt was exceptional and we had a great Christmas at grand Hyatt. Nice home away from home! Food at grand club was massive and delicious. The chefs are professional and taste better than anywhere outside.,50
"Almost every year, I will visit Macau hut this is the first time that I'm staying at Grand Hyatt Macau.   There are mixing feelings for the hotel.  The pros: - very comfortable bed and feels clean, when changed - attentive housekeeping, in general, to the number of guests and prepares amenities according to the number - nice room, good size, even without upgrade - new LRT is just outside the hotel  The cons: - guest operations service needs improvement and training. The operator sounded annoyed at times. It makes guests feel that they are not welcomed.  - bathroom is big but can be flooded easily - mirrors are missing in the room. They can only be found in the bathroom. - requested for bed linens to be changed but found that it was not done - toiletries given are used ones -…",40

"I like everything about the Hotel. The room was very clean and perfectly comfortable. the views from the 21st floor quite thrilling. Swimming pool was huge and enjoyable, as well as the multiple jacuzzi  pools. The one drawback is the high breakfast price.  ",50
"This was hands down the best Hyatt property I’ve stayed at. The Club Lounge was amazing with a delicious spread for breakfast and cocktail hour. The pool was actually warm (Hyatt is usually very stingy about heating their pools). Above all, the customer service went above and beyond. We had stayed at 3 very mediocre Hyatt’s in Tokyo before we got to Macau and were given the VIP treatment. Big shout out to Tina. Thank you for the upgrade and making our stay so memorable. ",50
"There are so many nice hotels in cotai area.  If you really want to experience with personalized services with reasonable price, this is your place.  Their club longe staffs provides top level services. Danielle, Randy, Lucia, and the korean staff at the club. You guys made my stay a memorable one. WELL DONE TEAM!! ",50
Highly recommended hotel. Nice huge spacious and clean room. Convenient to travel and shuttle bus provided to various location. Staff is friendly helpful and approachable especially at Feast restaurant.,40

"This Grand Hyatt is not the same standard as other Hyatt’s that I’ve stayed in. The check in process requires standing in a line for close to 30mins. No assistance was offered to help carry my two bags. The room whilst large was dated and showing wear. Nice bathroom products (Aromatherapy Associates). Here is why I’m upset with my experience. On my last night I arrived in from work at 3am and went to the front desk to ask a second time to arrange a late check out. I was given two excuses why this is not possible. The first being it was a Saturday (check out time is 11am, check in time is 3pm regardless of weekday or weekend) so I asked if they could make an exception. I requested 1:30pm and was told no. I was not even offered the option of paying to extend. The second excuse was…",10

And the view was really nice which is facing to founrain. I was proud of the whole team of the preparation for our experience. We are highly recommend to stay in this hotel.,50
"Its a number of years since I last stayed at the Grand Hyatt, Macau. It was nice to see that the hotel is still in very good shape. We spent 2 nights at the hotel staying in the Grand Club Tower. Check-in was smooth and staff were helpful upon arrival. The room was very comfortable and sizable at a little over 50 sqm. It had a large king size bed and a comfortable lounge area with a large L-shaped sofa. The bathroom was also large with a bath and rain shower and separate toilet. The Nespresso machine was an added bonus. The hotel is situlated at one of the stops along the newly opened LRT line - sky train. So getting around the Cotai strip and to theTaipa village has just gotten easier.  I also used the gym which is well equipped and a decent size. Also, upon arriving back at…",40

First the hotel is in great location, very easy to get access to anywhere in the city with free shuttle buses and also airport/Taipa ferry via its new 'mono rail', oveall service is what you'd expect a a Grand Hyatt. Each staff were very helpful and took care of all my request without any delays. Grand Club was very easy to get acess and had everything that I expected. Great food, drinks avaialble in the morning and the evening. Bejing Kitchen food/service were just 'breathtaking' I would def. want to recommend this place to all the guests who's coming to this hotel (you will not regret) Last but not least, each staffs I encounered were very professional and caring, felt each one was ready to…",50

"First time to Grand Hyatt to celebrate my birthday, but the entire experience doesn't match my expectation.  Good things to mention: -A male staff/porter at lobby is very proactive, he direct us to the elevator when we were confused about direction. -Room is big enough for 2 person with a dining table and sofa.  -We are coming for birthday celebration, the staffs arrange a small birthday cake during turn-down.  Few things I also want to mention: -No one escort to room and no introduction to any facilities. We have to find out by ourselves which is not convenience at all and takes times. -When I ask the schedule about house of dancing water show at concierge, a lady in concierge just want to pass me to the counter of the show center without patient. -I booked 2 days book the key…",30
"For the past years, my husband and I have often come to Macau Grand Hyatt to celebrate our birthdays and wedding anniversaries with our local friends or those old friends returning to Hong Kong from overseas. Nearly all of these stays are extremely enjoyable and pleasant with lots of happy memories. I must say the cause of these happy memories are results of the warmth and hospitality of their staff who render excellent, helpful and courteous services to their customers, be they first-time comes or frequent customers. Among other things, the hotel offers a better room rate and extra courtesy to frequent callers which attract them to come back again and again!",50
The checkin and welcome staff was extremely friendly and did everything to make us feel welcome to the hotel.  The hotel is very tastefully designed and decorated.  Very different from most of the hotels/casinos in Macau.  Our room was well prepared and well laid out.  There was nothing more we could ask for.  An excellent hotel!,50
"Checkin date 8/12/2019  Poor experience since checkin: When we booked the hotel thru online agent, as the booking system didn’t allow us to confirm the bed type, which we expected to have a king size bed, hotel was unable to provide the king size bed room unless we pay more (around MOP 2xx) to have deluxe room. We accepted the offer at all.  When I used the hotel key card to open the door lock, it was failure. We requested the housekeeper assist us to open the room to download our luggages before we went to front desk counter to fix the card. Of course, housekeeper didn’t open the door until she verified our personal information with front desk counter.  Finally the hotel fixed the door lock issue after changing the key cards for 4 TIMES, we were frustrated that why the front…",10
It was a very impressive stay. The dinner and check in process were arranged perfectly by GS Jack. Such a VIP service! The room was full of sweet atmosphere. Thanks for the balloons and lovely cake. We enjoyed the stay very much. FO Sharon was cheerful and helpful too.,50
"Concierge staff are very friendly and provide very useful information.  The buffet breakfast is good especially the bread section; tasty croissant, Portuguese custard tart, waffle etc.  Also, the big sign on the top showing different food in the sections are good directory to the customers.  Two basin in the toilet provides convenience to the guests too.  24-hour gym room also be considerate for guests who wake up early so they can do some exercise before take the breakfast.",50
Excellent quality of standard both hotel fascilities and overall staff members. In particular Ms. Tina Yu who from start to end accomodated us very well. Will definitely come back to this hotel. Location is excellent too. ,50
Beautiful hotel and good customer services except lobby staff . However check in experience was terrible particularly I was with my elderly mother . Waited for more than 40 mins for check in and no seating area for her to rest while she was waiting .,40
"We stayed in the suite room because of the baby. We wanted separate space from the baby once the baby falls asleep early in the evening. Grand Hyatt offered the room exactly what we wanted. The room can be perfectly separated from the bathroom and the living room with the door. Also, they have upgraded our room to the fountain view! The room condition was excellent except that I found the rusty shower hose in the bathroom.  The location couldn't be better. It's right in front of the Wynn hotel and Venetian.  The food was good, too.  Whenever I asked something through the phone, they kindly replied and granted the requests.",50
"I visited Macau with my husband last weekend and stayed at Grand Hyatt for 1 night. We booked a single bedroom but it was upgraded to a suite when we checked-in. I was glad that our room was upgraded. My husband sat in the bed to play the mobile phone game and I unpacked our luggage after we got in the room. Then we went out for dinner and listened to a concert. My husband discovered his hand was bitten by flea when we left the hotel room. After the concert, we had some dessert at their cafe in the lobby.  I ordered a stewed pear but I waited for 45 minutes after I made the order. I was disappointed as it was too sweet and the pear was not soft. Then we went to our room and slept after shower. My right underarm was itchy and I woke up in the midnight. I found that I was bitten…",10
Checkin’ In the hotel is hassle free. Ample counters to assist. Hotel people around are courteous and helpful. The location is good. Guests definetely feels the 5-star treatment. The Suite rooms are a must. ,50
"The room we booked came with 2 twin beds. Just right for the family. The bathroom and  amenities were superb. For those used to sharing the bathroom while someone is showering or having a bath be prepared to use the bathroom alone since the all glass design limits privacy. Privacy is achieved by pull down blinds from the bedroom. The shuttle service brings you from the airport , the Parisian and even to the Macau peninsula which is fantastic. The hotel staff gave excellent room service.  Will be back definitely...",50
"Convenient location with shuttle bus service. It is very near to the airport. The cable car is opposite of the hotel.   Breakfast and dinner are available at level 3.  Staff have provided some surprises for my birthday as well.  Joyful trip, will come again.",50
"I heard the Mezza9 buffet is famous in Macau, and my friends highly recommend, therefore I made a reservation before 5 months. A little bit early arrive and queue in front of the restaurant. After arranging the seats, we directly order the fresh lobsters and tried 6 types of cooking methods. We thought steamed with garlic and baked with cheese lobsters was extremely tasty. Highly recommend!!! We would like to thank you, Tina, provide good service and introduce Mezza9 to us clearly after she knows we are the first time visit.",50
Really is a high cost performance.I buy the package in Hyatt Macau website. The price including the breakfast and dinner buffet already. And the room direct can watching the  Fountain View of the Show. i must will come to book Hyatt Macau again.,50
"Earlier this year, I visited this hotel and stayed at a suite to celebrate my wife's birthday. The hotel has a modern and luxurious vibe, which I liked a lot! The location is also very good and easy to get to many attractions in the area. The best part of this hotel is a club lounge area where I can get great breakfast and enjoy the cocktail hours!  I also feel that I was valued as a Hyatt Globalist member. I'll definitely come back again when I visit Macau again in the near future!",50
The Macau provide good transportation.  It is all free.  The hyatt macau would make me back again.  Restaurants  in side and out side the hotel are good.  The air in the hotel is fresh makes you stay longer.,10
"They overcharged me upon check out.  With a final folio showing 10,400 Macau dollars for five nights - what they posted as a final charge to American Express was 13,000 Macau dollars.  Unbelievable and unacceptable.  Their accounting people are utterly careless and incompetent.  I am not talking about the authorized hold - I am talking about what ended up on my Amex account as ""posted"" charge.",30
"It was great pleasure to enjoy our 12th anniversary in Macau Grand Hyatt with my wife, not only the greeting presentation but also the food and whole crew, especially Tina Yu and Angle Choi who are two true lovely angle. Took care of us in every details.",50
Overall our stay was nice as the hotel is nice and the location great. We were just very disappointed about the pool bar as they got just 4 or 5 very basic cocktails and it takes ages until you get them. We understand that plastic glasses at the pool are a must but ours were full with lipstick and smelled like fish. We got the answer that the glasses will be replaced next year... otherwise the staff is very friendly and we enjoyed our stay. ,40
"Echo is awesome 😊 She attended us from checking in, to giving me birthday cake, to checking out, and securing our luggages while we roam before heading to the airport 😊 rooms are big with a nice view 😊",50
Expecting more from this hotel but it just fell a little short of my expectations. Check in and check out was a sweep thou. Room was basic and smaller compared to other hotels that i stayed in Macau. Breakfast has wide variety of choices. Staff were friendly and attentive.,40
"I stayed here after flying into Macau for business in the Dongguan area.  The hotel was immaculately clean, modern, and comfortable.  Service was excellent and the views grand.  I'm happy to recommend this hotel.",50
"Almost all the international hotels are in Macau, and Grand Hyatt is definitely not the newest one. However, I like their layout best. It’s user-friendly, sensible and spacious. Will definitely return. We stayed at the King Deluxe 52 sq m room in the Grand Club Tower .  I believe the room layout in this tower is better than the rooms at the other building, the Grand Tower.",50
"The facilities in the hotel are so good that it is worth it to spend a whole day enjoying all the various spa, swim, etc. The food court on the 2nd level provides ample choice for all tastes. Walking distance to all the major outlets and stores around. Enjoyed this vacation very much. Highly recommended",50
"The entire experience was fine. However, I’m just a bit disappointed to the HSKP here. I was in rush to take a shower before departure and I just figured out that there was no Bath Gel in my room. Instead, I got TWO body lotions (one in the shower and the other next to the sink).   Anw, if you are reading this, please check ur bath gel when u get into the room!! ",30
"Absolutely first class hotel with a luxurious room, attentive yet friendly staff, and beautiful surroundings. Amazingly, it was not as expensive as other hotels around the world. We fully plan to return to Macao and will definitely stay at the Grand Hyatt.",50
"Tina made the experience 10 times better then expected! Room given had perfect view of the ocean, casinos and sunset. She was kind enough to lead me up to the room, introduce and explain all features.",50
"Hyatt is a traditional and luxury hotel in consumers’ view but this one is something special. In addition to aforesaid profile of Hyatt, it adopts the resort design that Macau’s hotel generally apply. I really love its pool side area. It offers me a relax atmosphere and I feel relief during the stay in pool side. I also wonder Hyatt Macau come with a Tennis Court. Not much hotel can offer this facility. The room is also worth a mention. It is not decorated in high profile but will absolutely make you feel like home. I just love this design. The only drawback is there is no office desk in my room. I was assigned in a Kid’s featured suite. The room comes with toys and a tent. Unfortunately I got a conference meeting on that day and need a desk to work. I wish the front desk can…",50
"When I travel to Macau for leisure, Grand Hyatt is always my top choice. Price is reasonable compared to other hotels in Cotai area. The hotel is maintenance is always kept with high standard. We always got a warm welcome back from the hotel staff.  This trip was a celebration of our Anniversary. We got many nice free treats from the hotel like lovely plush, Macau traditional snacks, fruit, afternoon tea, cake, late check out, etc. and we sincerely thank for all the stuff we got.  More importantly, it is always the nice smile and services from the hotel staff that encourages me to be a repeat guest :)",50
We have stayed for 1 night with the room upgraded to suite.  This is a spacious room. The bed is comfortable.   Check-in procedure is quick and service is good.  Easy access to the hotel by the shuttle bus at pier.,50
"The check in staff Angel provided us with a first-class service, where provided us beverages when we are waiting the check-in procedures; Also, she noticed that it was my 5th anniversary with my girlfriend, she then gifted us a little cake and assisted us to take photos after escorting us to our room. It was one of the best check-in experience I have ever had in a hotel; I would definitely recommend my friends and relatives to the Grand Hyatt Macau, rather than other hotels nearby.",50
"I stayed at Grand Hyatt Macau for 1 day with my parents to celebrate my father's birthday and I wanted our stay at Grand Hyatt Macau to be perfect for my parents. My expectation was quite high but the staff's service was outstanding and beyond my expectation.   Especially, Jack(Jack Wu) was very considerate and helpful during our stay, I would like to express my thanks and appreciation for his welcoming service and care we received.  He exactly understood I wanted our stay to be special and memorable for my parents, he did his best to make our stay comfortable and pleasant.  He expressed his warmest welcome to us with smile, double checked the tidiness of our room before we enter the room and arranged a surprising event by decorating our room with lovely balloons for my father's…",50
"We stayed in a grand deluxe king room for 4 nights. Room was perfectly quiet, had all the necesarry amenities and the bed was very comfortable. The only minor points was that the aircontioner blower was still quite forcefull and noisy at minumum level. Hotel facilities were also great only the wait for the elevator could be quite long at times. Looking at the prices of the rooms of the surrounding hotels, I'd definitely go for the Hyatt again.",50
This is a first class hotel with everything you can expect.  Book the Grand club - service and food beverage are fantastic.  The suite were equipped with biggest bathroom ever - including a full shower room of at least 6 sqm.  Try it - you will never regret. We were lucky to get a sunning view to the fountain show.at Wynn.  Just fantastic!,50
"Great experience at Grand Hyatt. Clean room, good location!  Special thanks to Echo Chen, she give us a perfect customer service experience!  I can recommend this hotel to everybody who want explore Macao! ",50
Arrived early so obviously had to wait for room. Then had to wait in another queue to get key. Nowhere to sit in the hotel unless you went to first floor.Restaurants were very limited but eventually walked towards City of Dreams and found a fantastic TAPAS PLACE. GREAT SERICE AND FOOD OF A HIGH STANDARD AND INEXPENSIVE. Bedroom very modern and comfortable but noise from surrounding area was appalling. Able to get 1 coffee per person in the room. Lovely pool area with plenty of shade. If you only want to shop ( ‘till you drop!) this area is the place to stay,40
"The hotel looks superb, fast check in process, and they even gave us an upgrade to our rooms. Very clean, comfortable, and conveniently located to everywhere we wanted to visit.  The dinner buffet and breakfast buffet is a must! Highly recommend to anyone who's looking for a stay.",50
"Fantastic stay, great service and amenities. Lovely view and close to the main strip and sights. Our room was lovely and comfortable ~ so much so, that even staying in during the morning was a nice chilled experience. ",50
All staff was very friendly and polite.  We had an especially great time for a short trip staying in this Hotel.  Very good luxury hotel in Macau!   Love their professional and definitely highly recommended.  Two thumbs up!!!  :),50
"Food is great. Room was spacious and clean. Room amenities were exceptional   Staff are friendly and helpful, pleasant and polite especially the staff members in the Grand club lounges  Food at the club lounge were also great taste and choices were sufficient  Wines and champagne top brand, fantastic  ",50
"Our first experience with Grand Hyatt and will never forget about it!  Our room is huge and extremely clean.  Mezza Buffet is beyond our expectation and staff are friendly, welcoming, helpful, efficient and professional e.g. Rashal and Sandy.  We would love to go back and have a marvellous holiday there.",50
"I am absolutely disappointed by this hotel. First, everyone can log onto the Internet leading to terrible Internet connection in the evening. I I am coming to Macau for a business trip and the hotel screws me up badly. Second, customers in the lounge speak loud and no one stops them! Third, don’t even wanna mention about it...",10
"Starting from the check-in process followed by the dinner and breakfast at Mezza 9, it was such a perfect experience overall. Grand Hyatt Macau has set a high benchmark among the other hotels. I would definitely stay with Grand Hyatt Macau again.",50
"My wife and I stayed at the Grand Hyatt Macau for the first time ever on our 33rd Wedding Anniversary and we had a wonderful time there. The staff, hotel and all amenities were amazing and we would particularly like to thank all the staff up on level 37 at the Club Lounge for their incredible friendliness, service and assistance during our stay.   Randy, Danielle, Peggy, Jun and all the team were top class and we would highly recommend all of them plus the food, cocktails and canapes were also brilliant..   We stayed in a corner suite on level 11 looking over the spectacular fountains of the Wynn Palace hotel. The room and view were breathtaking.  Thank you again Grand Hyatt.",50
Accomodation was first class.  We found the staff were very helpful. We would recommend staying here. We upgraded to the executive package and it was well worth it.  Package included 2 hour drink and food package.,50
"This is a top notch hotel and our favorite place to stay in hotel. We stayed in an executive room with access to the executive floor / restaurant. Our room was clean and well appointed with all the features you would expect to find in a 5 star hotel. The hotel has a fantastic gym and a good sized swimming pool. The best feature of this hotel is the staff who are genuinely friendly and helpful, from the concierge who took our luggage from the bus, to the staff on the check-in desk to the wait staff on the executive floor. The hotel is well located in the ""city of dreams"" with access to many of the other resort / casinos on the Cotai strip.",50
"We are repeated customers to the hotel for 6 years. Rooms are spacious and well maintained. We enjoyed the staff's services, food and drinks at the grand club. Reasonable prices with excellent services. ",50
We stayed this week. Excellent price for a great hotel. Rooms were palatial. Highly recommended. We enjoyed the pool. Shuttle service was good. We did not have meals at the hotel. Rooms were very quite. Would stay here again.,50
"we purchased the package with buffet dinner and breakfast at the Mezza9, the food was amazing. Unlimited supply of fresh lobsters (as well as other seafood and meat) cook to order in different styles. The room was great, amazing views. The staffs are very friendly and professional.Well worth the price tag",50
"I've stayed in eight Hyatt’s around the world. All very good but the Grand Hyatt Macau is the best, its outstanding. Just a beautiful hotel with excellent friendly service. Pool and spa are the best. Food was brilliant.",50
"I would like to express my thanks and appreciation for the service and care I received at Grand Hyatt, my birthday vacation went off without a hitch.  Your Guest Experience Team, Echo, Renee and Jack, were able to arrange a gorgeous room at the last minute which was a real bonus for our vacation. They also arranged a surprise room tour, which we thoroughly enjoyed. Staying in Grand Hyatt actually enhanced our vacation experience.  Renee was particularly helpful and attentive. She shared a lot of idea on her dining experience. We really enjoyed the restaurant she suggested.  I have recommended Grand Hyatt to all of my colleagues, friends and family. Thank you again for contributing to our cherished memories.",50
"Grand Hyatt Macau is one of the best hotels I have visited. It has a great location, fantasic view and excelent customer service. It provided convenient shuttle service to/from ferry terminals and other destinations, large rooms, and many amenities. The front office staff were very helpful and welcoming, so were the concieger staff. The breakfast buffet had more food and drink choices than we could ever eat. If you visit Macau, check Grand Hyatt Macau out, you would enjoy it.",50
"I am super picky on hotel rooms and brand as my family has skin allergy.  We cant stay in anywhere that is dusty or noisy...  When I checked in at noon,  I was greeted by Jack,  the guest experience team.  He was super nice to explain our room was still in cleaning since we had skin allergy,  they were performing a deep clean and placing air purifier.  I went out for lunch and Jack spotted our return.  He immediately brought us to another counter and expedite the progress as there were a queue.  He prepared us a cold welcome juice amd lovely piggy for my son,  showed us all the way to our room.  He is super professional and seems grand hyatt did a hard work on improving the services...no matter housekeeping,  security,  swimming pool or room services,  they will give my son a…",50
"I am writing to thank you for the amazing service for my stay at the Grand Hyatt Macau.  I have to say that all the arrangements were done perfectly to me and my husband!  Every staff member of your hotel with whom we came in contact was attentive, kind and professional.  I particularly thanks to Ms Jing Joh, Manager of the Guest Contact Center; Ms Sabrini Foo, Manager of the Front Office;  Ms Tina Yu, Echo, Ken of the Guest Experience Team and also Adam at Check-in Service Counter.    They all made us feel welcome and comfortable on the first day of my visit!   It was my birthday celebration and we finally upgraded to a grand suite with compliments of lovely birthday cake, beautiful card, gifts of piggy and an instant photo of me with my husband was really wonderful!  The room…",50
I am glad to stay at Grand Hyatt again during my birthday celebration. Tina and Jack provided professional and warmest services to us.....deeply from their hearts. Made me have a memorial birthday celebration. When I planed to have short trip at Macau .... I think I must choose Grand Hyatt again .... no others hotel can be replaced. ,50
"No warm welcome. Check-in was slow. Despite the multiple counter tables, there's only one in operation with three or four check-in staff working. Each receptionist took their own sweet time handling the guests, without noticing the line that was building up.   After a while, we realized there's a separate counter for World of Hyatt. We stood behind the counter for quite a while, it was not manned, nobody came and approach us for assistance. We were attended only when we told one of the staff that we are a member. The treatment suddenly changed drastically from being rather ignorant to super attentive.  Though the guest room need serious upgrading work, it was in clean good condition and bed was comfortable.  F&B service needs serious improvement. Table given to us during…",30
"Very friendly and clean hotel. This hotel is located within the City of Dreams building, so it is very convenient for those who want to experience the famed Mezza9 Seafood Dinner Buffet as well as the amazing The House of Dancing Water show. It is also within walking distance to the Venetian where it has a lot of shops and a good food court. It is also where Conrad, Sheraton, and Holiday Inn Cotai are located.   As an Explorist member, I felt very welcomed by Yan from the Grand Club Lounge. I may not have received a complimentary upgrade, but the deluxe room was still very spacious and beautiful. I also appreciated that she was able to give us the complimentary late checkout of two pm. I think that this hotel treat its guests well especially their VIPs. I am sure Globalists or…",50
Front desk staff and customer relation staff are very nice and passionate. Room is very spacious and surprisingly quiet even my room is directly opposite to the Macau International Airport. I've been staying in five different hotels in the last 12 months and Grand Hyatt Macau is the only hotel will put a glass and a bottle of water on the bedtable at night time (originally they were inside the bathroom). Definitely will recommend to my friends.,50
"호캉스하기 좋은 마카오에서 여러군데를 다녀보았지만 그랜드 하얏트는 그중에서도 조용하면서도 친절한 서비스를 제공하는 호텔입니다! 객실도 넓고 화장실에 세면대도 두개라 편리하구요. 1월달에 방문했을때 개인적으로 중국에서 택배를 받을 일이 있었는데 문제가 생겨 다른곳으로 택배가 발송되어 못받게 됬을수도 있었는데, 컨시어지 팀 멤버들이 너무나도 성심성의껏 도와주어서 택배도 찾고 너무나도 큰 감동을 받았습니다. 너무나도 좋은 기억으로 남아 9월 가족여행때 재방문 하였는데, 부모님 방에 문제가 있어 호텔측에 얘기를 하였더니 Manager Connie님이 바로 내려와 깔끔하게 문제를 해결해주시고는 다른 방을 준비하는동안 라운지에서 아침을 먹으라며 준비해주셔서 덕분에 맛있는 아침을 먹었습니다! 결혼기념일이라 케이크도 준비해주시고 방도 스위트룸으로 옮겨주셔서 5일동안 편안하게 지내다 왔습니다. 매일매일 과일도 새로 챙겨주고  마지막 체크아웃날에는 매니저 코니님이 내려와 불편한점은 없었는지 세심하게 확인해 주시는 모습에 큰 감동을 받았습니다. 매번 방문할때마다 좋은 기억만 남겨주는 하얏트, 특히 직원분들에 뛰어난 배려심과 친절함이 돋보이는 곳입니다!  매니저 Connie 님께 다시한번 감사의 말씀 드립니다 :)  I would like to show my gratitude to manager Connie for helping out with my parent's room problem. Her dedication genuinely exceed much more than my expectation, i was…",50
"The hotel is at a strategic location.  The front desk, Echo Chen offers us a very good services.  She is patient and gentle in explaining things to us.  Besides, given us some ideas to visit to the city.  We like the services and this would be one of the key reason to stay in the hotel when we visit Macao again.  Room view is good, especially we can view the great fountain lighting show just sitting on the sofa.   Great Hotel, Great Room, Great Staff.",50
"Great location, excellent service.  Staff spoke English and were more than happy to assist/help.  Facilities were top notch particularly the pool and gym area. Excellent breakfast buffet at comparable prices.  Free shuttle to popular places.",50
The hotel is at the far end of COD but still quite convenient moving around by foot. We had a suite and the room is big and spacious. All basic facilities are there but the hotel is a bit aged lacking some updated basics such as USB plugs and air con in our room was very noisy.  But all in all it good value for money and upkeeping with the service you expect from a Grand Hyatt. ,30
"My wife and I stayed for 3 nights in Macau after spending four nights in Hong Kong. After the quick trip across the water we had a seamless checkin with a free upgrade which was a great start to our stay. The room was large fantastic view over the fountains at the Wynn. The buffet breakfast was great with varied options. The pool area was very quiet and relaxing although poorly staffed if you wanted anything.  The casino was ok, we preferred others in the area but only one part of the hotel. We would stay again if we ever return to Macau.",40
"Chose this Hotel as they had a fabulous Accom package that inc breakfast & tickets to the Dancing Water Show. And what a good decision. The show was amazing & the hotel supberb. Room was huge,clean,and good air conditioner. Breakfast was great. ",50
"We visited Grand Hyatt as a last minute holiday.  We booked a Grand suite with club access and couldn’t have been more impressed.  Our room was a bit ‘no frills’ but very clean and the huge corner sofa and tv were so welcoming. The view over the fountain was absolutely stunning at night. If you haven’t done ‘club access’ before... you must!!! It’s worth every penny. Afternoon tea, dinner with unlimited drinks, and a lavish breakfast.  The team in the grand club were fantastic. Professional, helpful, great food from the chefs. A huge thank you to Randy Wong who made our trip that extra bit special with his exceptional service and great conversation.  The pool and jacuzzi area outside were a dream, having our own little area with sofa and jacuzzi to ourselves all week was such a…",50
"We recently stayed at the Grand Hyatt on our trip to Macau while visiting Hong Kong.  Although we cut our trip short for another hotel (once in a life time opportunity to stay in the most expensively built hotel in the world), our experience at the Grand Hyatt was wonderful!   We stayed in the Grand Suite and were able to get access to the club lounge by redeeming a club access award.  They have two towers, one with the club and a separate tower, which our room was in.  Our room faced the Wynn, and we could watch the water show from our room!  The suite itself was very nice and easily accommodated three people.   The grand club lounge was amazing.  We were fortunate to meet one of the managers of the lounge, Randy, who was extremely hospitable and not only personally walked us…",50
"Overall everything was amazing. Love the outdoor, swimming pool area. Great gym, amazing dinner + drinks selection.  Special shoutout to Randy. He and his team were amazing hosts who effectively made the whole experience for us. Had an amazing time there and will definitely visit again.",50
Great Hotel and Great Service. Special thanks to Echo Chen for providing excellent service. Hotel is nice and elegant. Love the lounge that you can listen to live music. Room is clean and comfortable. ,50
"I have just experienced possibly one of the best Hotel stays after many years of travel. The staff, accomodation and amenities were exceptional at all levels. From the moment of pick from the Macau Ferry Terminal, I was treated with the highest of regard and respect. I was made to feel an important member and guest of the Grand Hyatt Family. I certainly recomend the Grand Hyatt Macau to anyone who wishes to have a similar experience. ",50
I don't understand why some hotels don't provide adequate seating in the reception area of their hotel and you are left standing when you need to wait. Especially at a 5 star hotel. This is my one top criticism of this hotel-or is it just Hong Kong in general?! The check in line was long but they had a lot of receptionists and I didn't have to wait that long. The hotel staff needs improvement in the English department and the concierge too - it was more they hired concierge that could speak mandarin instead.,40
"第一次入住這間酒店，因女友生日所以在網上預訂酒店時要求生日surprise 同late check-out，當到櫃位check-in 時，Renee同Echo很熱情和細心去招待我們，並送上welcome drink，還upgrade 房間給我們，最驚喜是兩位顧客體驗團隊人員Shirley和Echo特別送了一個小蛋糕和小禮物給女友，Echo亦非常用心幫我們book晚上在mezza9用膳。之後晚上回房間的時候，她們還送上一個大蛋糕和送了一張之前幫我們影的相片給我們作紀念，真的很多謝她們的親切接待，特此要感謝Echo, Renee同Shirley ，下次一定會再入住。 ",50
I booked this hotel for 3 nights and checked out after the first night  Rooms are comfortable and clean however the hotel had zero class many staff cannot understand English .  The quality of the room service was atrocious mistakes resulted i nwaiting one hour for food.  Breakfast also very basic poor coffee and poor service the quality of staff is so far below the wynn Palace opposite .  No reason to stay in this hotel as Macau has far better hotels .,20
This was our second time staying at the Grand Hyatt Macau and we have always been amazed by the level of service provided at both the hotel and at Mezza9 restaurant. My wife and I would especially like to commend Anthony Leung at Mezza9 who went above and beyond his duties to make sure we had a memorable night to celebrate our anniversary. He was very friendly and attentive to our needs. He also overheard how we were trying to figure out the best way to head to Hong Kong the next day and he explained the best methods to travel and also left us with his email so we could contact him if we ran into any issues. The service at Grand Hyatt Macau is second to none and we would not hesitate to stay here again and also eat at Mezza9 again just for the service alone.,50
We booked this hotel for birthday celebration.We enjoyed the stay at this hotel.The room was very spacious and clean.The buffet was great and with lots of choices. Special thanks to Mr Wu jack at the front desk.He is very nice and helpful at always which made our stay becoming memorable and pleasurable.,50
"The staff are extremely helpful and friendly. From the moment that I check in, I felt very welcome and the lady who work in the concierge to help me buying the boat ticket to Hong Kong airport is very efficient and helpful. Even the security guard in the lobby was nice and try to make conversation with my guests. The restaurants in 3rd floor providing variety of food. The swimming pool and hot tube are clean and nice. The location of the hotel is in a quieter area which not too crowded. I stay the corner suite so I can watch the fountain performance from Wynn Palace, it is another bonus!!",50
"I stayed for 5 nights here from 9-14 August.  I've stayed at various Grand Hyatt hotels previously, so had hope for similar quality service.  How wrong i was.  On the second day after i'd checked in, i'd returned to my room in the late afternoon at about 5pm and the room was still not made up.  Bear in mind i did not leave any ""do not disturb"" sign at the door.     So i dialled ""0"" on the phone and reached the front desk.  Imagine my shock when i was informed that my room was not made up for ""environmental"" reason.  I asked if that was the case, why was there not even a signage in the room saying that.  Or is the hotel using ""climate change/environmental"" reason as a convenient excuse not to  make up the room.  Come on, i can understand perfectly the importance of saving the…",20
"Our family stayed at 3 Grand suites. Rooms were very fresh looking, large and modern. It was more than comfortable for our family.  Lobby was very clean and usually quiet with not too much noisy tourists like other hotels in Macau. A very cozy, elegant and understated hotel.  The only downside was the housekeeping service where they forgot to wash the teapot I used for 2 days in a row.  Concierge service was a bit slow to pick up our luggages inside our suites so we have to bring down the luggages on our own. However, they made it up by assisting us with our luggages to the underground bus shuttle area. For the buffet breakfast, it was good but we would have preferred more dimsum choices. The Dancing in the water show was just a few minutes walk away inside the City of dreams…",50
"My fiancé planned a birthday 2 days trip for me in Grand Hyatt Macau. It was absolutely amazing!!!  The hotel is new and modern. Staff are friendly and helpful (gave me a big birthday surprise hahaha!!)  I tried the gym. It is new and clean with towels and bottle water provided.   We had buffet dinner that night.  I was shocked by the food the served. Unlimited lobsters and seafood, cooked in the way you chosen. Besides the desserts and breakfast on next morning were great too.   I loved this experience so much and I will definitely come back again with my family and friends for those lobsters hahaha!!",50
"My recent stay at the Grand Hyatt in Macau was great. Check-in was smooth and quick. The staff was very kind and accommodating. My family loved the room it was very spacious with two rooms. The bathroom was big, as well. They also have a live band in the lobby, and the singer sings beautifully. I will stay at the Grand Hyatt again in the near future.",50
"the room is magnificent. size, modern & best of all the service of the concierge - mr. sigit, with mr. davehuang   if travelling for big group. organise big bus by emailing the hotel   all his tips were wonderful and their enthusiasm highlights our trip.   clean room twice. morning and evening.",40
"Booked the Grand Suite room.   Big room with a living room and a separate bed room. So in terms of size it is very comfortable.   Too is clean and with all the Amendities.   Check in is efficient with service staff providing good information. Service has been great. Ask and they will provide the necessary information with a good attitude.   There are good restaurants around the hotel, which is connected to the City of Dreams.   Not very much into casino but the casinos is in city of dreams, which is within the building. Stakes are a little too high for me as I am not into casinos.   Overall experience is good. Room is very comfortable and service is really good. ",40
"It’s my big guy’s 30th birthday, and it’s his last birthday for being single. I must plan something big for him.   As a foodie, he loves to try different cuisine and seafood is his favourite. I know near us, Macau got a famous buffet that you need to book in advance at least 3 months, and it’s what my fiancé told me, so I wanted to bring this surprise for his birthday.   We stayed in this hotel with the grand offer, and I sent the hotel a note that it is my fiancé’s birthday. We first received a warm welcome when we checked in, and they offered my fiancé a happy birthday surprise with a delicious cake.They were so sweet that they even wrote him a hand written birthday card.   The hotel room is spacious and clean. It was so hot in Macau, so we didn’t go out for long and enjoyed…",50
"I stayed here recently following a stay at one of the ‘theme’ hotels in Cotai strip and the difference in experience was great. The intense hustle and crowds are not as present here and the entire atmosphere is more relaxed and welcoming. Check-in is smooth in the grand lobby. Rooms are exquisite with all expected amenities and useful extras such as a much needed umbrella! Room service is quick, reasonably priced and tasty (even in the middle of the night). The hotel is connected to the City of Dreams resort, boutique mall and casino area. Piano lounge with superb musical trio played each night of my stay creating a relaxing environment to return to after the day. Having stayed at numerous properties throughout Macau over the years, this will surely be my first choice moving…",50
"Loved everything about our stay here, such helpful friendly staff and beautiful spacious rooms. The pool area is DEVINE!!! I only have 2 negatives...pool service staff don't come around often enough. I found I had to go chase them up if I wanted a drink or food and the poolside food wasn't the best. The baby squid was well overcooked & dry and cold by the time I got it and the lobster buns were stale...they just crumbled into crumbs ..and were inedible. So for the prices they are charging poolside I feel there is alot of room for improvement here. However in the lobby bar we had excellent food and service! Christine and Hallin always greeted us and made us feel so welcome. We really enjoyed the music in the lobby bar too by the trio of musicians but it was far too loud! You…",50
Last May we stayed in the Grand Hyatt Macau.  The hotel met our expectations and we had a very comfortable stay. The room was clean and modern and a bit larger than many in its catagory. There were good resturants and a nice bar.  The service was very good and the price was quite reasonable.  All and all we were quite pleased. ,50
"Stayed for 3 nights. 1. The room paid and occupied by 3pax, unfortunately the amenities only for 2pax. 2. Complaint that shower room water won't drain, maintenance checked but can't resolve & the housekeeping just use the squeegee to remove the water.  3. The interesting part was the housekeeping tidy the entire room except the bathroom. The reason gave by the maid was need to rush the check-out room due to high demand by front office, so they left behind in-house guest room. 4. No turndown service.",20
"I was very impressed with the Grand Hyatt Macau. It was my first time to stay at a Grand Hyatt and after our 3 days here I can tell you we will certainly not be our last. Everything was great. The room, a grand king suite, was really good. The check-in and check-out process was great. (Thank you Cindy) The staff on concierge, especially Carmen, Kent & Sigit, were fantastic. The pool and pool area is spacious and very comfortable. We had room service twice and the quality of the food was excellent. I couldn't fault our experience, I'm looking forward to my next stay at the Grand Hyatt Macau. ",50
"A lovely birthday trip to Macau where we stayed in an upgraded Suite at the Grand Hyatt in the Cotai area of Macau. The hotel saw that it was my birthday that day and gave us a lovely CheckIn experience with fresh fruit juice, and then we were even more pleasantly surprised to have two lovely customer service staff Echo and Jack come up to the room and sing me Happy Birthday with a handwritten card and lovely cake! It was a great experience and I would visit again. Especially as the hotel is well connected with shopping directly linked to the hotel and the Water Show was 1 minute away. The Cotai area was a quick taxi ride from the hotel with nice restaurants and souvenir shopping.",50
"If you look for classic business hotel like decor instead of grand hotel rooms, Grand Hyatt is the a good choice. Room was big and clean but not equipped with USB ports. Location is convenient with great access to shopping malls.  Service was great. ",40
"Beautiful hotel & super clean Grand suite. The hotel is located at a very convenience location, good for foods, restaurants and shopping. Breakfast is very good with lot of varieties. Staffs are friendly and  helpful with great customer service skill. ",50
"Grand Hyatts are the best of of the Hyatt hotels and the GH Macau is no exception. An absolutely stunning structure, the hotel is located in the City of Dreams area and is very close to both the airport and the ferry terminals. Macau itself is rather small and all the hotels are well connected. There's a free City of Dreams shuttle coming to the hotel every 15 mins or so.  I had visited the hotel for a conference and the hotel has sufficient infrastructure to cater to even large business meetings. There's 1 full floor with large ballrooms, meeting and conference rooms.  There are basically 2 towers - Grand and Grand Club - and I got a room in the Grand Club. The room was spacious with 2 large twin beds, a more than sufficient closet area and a well-equipped and spacious…",40
"Grand Hyatt Macau, standing at the Cotai strip for about 10 years already is definitely an impressive and well maintained hotel when compared with all the newer competitors. Coupled by a team of fantastic service staffs, this is definitely a place to be at when you visited Macau. ",50
"Excellent convention trip. Stayed 7 nights. Great room, good gym, wonderful staff. Room service much better than many hotels. Front of house remember guests by name. Lots of shops directly attached to hotel.   ",50
"Exquisite hotel with huge rooms, amazing swimming pool, nice views, and great ambiance.  It is part of the COD complex, and you can pretty much find everything you need here. Right in the center, with easy transportation to everywhere. ",50
One of the best hotel services that I have experienced. The approachable and helpful staff had made our stay delightful; not mentioning the clean and spacious room. We would definitely want to stay here again. ,50
"I had my honeymoon trip with my wife in Grand Hyatt Macau about a month ago.   Our room has been upgraded for our honeymoon. The room was very spacious. The view was so excellent that the fountain show on Wynn Palace was just opposite to us.  The swimming pool was good. No fancy design but the pool was so large that I and my wife could swim here freely.  The breakfast buffet was very nice. There were a variety of food to be chosen. What’s more? It was very amazing to have Egg Benedict, which would be cooked instantly once ordered.  Thanks for Grand Hyatt Macau to giving us a very nice accommodation in our trip. Also, special thanks to Tina, who was a very passionate lady. Her services were really professional.",50
"My family stayed at the hotel for one night.  Though it was the first time we stayed at the hotel, we were upgraded to a Grand Suite Fountain View Twin.  The suite was spacious and it faced the fountain at which light shows were held at night.  The room looked like it was newly renovated. There are some jacuzzis and tvs near the pool.  You can enjoy watching TV while you are enjoying the Jacuzzi.",50
"It ticks all the boxes of a 5-star property. But that is it. The staff are professional. Will answer all your queries. But no warmth. A note to housekeeping to make up the room in the afternoon was not followed up with. A return to the hotel at 3:30pm to find the room still not made up. A call to reception to just replenish water and shower gel was was obliged verbally. But after a 30-min wait, there’s still no water and shower gel.   Went to the lobby to buy a piece of chocolate. However, the lady attended to us seemed to hate her job. every question was met with a long face. I had to tell her how much it cost after tax, rather than the other way round.   However, we dined at the beijing kitchen. Peking duck was one of the best and Vicki, the restaurant manager was perfect in…",30
"Grand Hyatt Macau reception, Echo Chen , was probably the best customer service staff we've encountered in recent years.  She was caring and courteous and attended to details.  She had made this stay particularly unforgettable.",50
"My girlfriend and I had a 1-night stay at Grand Hyatt. We reserved the stay on their website, through a package with dinner buffet at Mezza9.  We were greeted by Renee, who was sweet and upgraded our room to a suite. We felt very welcomed by her hospitality. Even I was having trouble looking for my credit card, she remained calm and professional. Later on she ran into me at the dinner buffet. She recognized me, and made sure everything was fine with our room and the food. I was truly amazed by her caring services and professionalism.  Mezza9 was honestly one of the best buffet I have ever had. If you are a seafood fanatic, you must try it out. They serve clam, fish, shrimp, crab, abalone, and lobster. You can decide how it's cooked (steamed, stir fried, deep fried...) The food…",50
"this stayed is for celebrating the aniversary and we booked the special package which including dinner and breakfast. one of the staff Renee has upgraded us to a suite room and giving us lots of suggestion for our short trip. besides, the dinner in mezza9 was amazing especially the seafood. I would definitely stay here again. Thanks for Renee's all the arrangement and the warm greetings -)",50
"This hotel is beautiful. The rooms have great views, very clean rooms, well design and comfortable. The location and service was perfect. Short walk to all the big casinos nearby. There is live performance in the evenings at the bar in the lobby.  ",50
"Weirdly enough, I wrote a review back in January and it has mysteriously disappeared so this is a re-write.  Check in was very slow, the staff checking us in also spoke quietly on his radio when reporting the condition of the room I would be staying in, this was suspicious and later when arriving in the room I connected the dots. The air conditioning didn't work and the room was like a sauna. It was evident that the reception staff knew this was the case, hence why he spoke quietly on the walkie-talkie to the cleaning staff, but decided to place us in the room anyway. Naturally I requested a room change due to the unacceptable sauna-like conditions of the room - only for the staff to come up to the room 45 minutes later to fulfil the request. We were then moved to a fountain…",20

"I give five stars to the hotel as the rooms are extremely comfortable, staff is friendly and cooperative! Unlike other big hotels in macau, checkin was very quick and we got rooms as per choice.   Room service is good as best part is that at one end it’s connected to the mall where shops are open until late and at one of the entrances, u can walk right towards other great properties!  Also, water show and one of the best pubs in town is right here! So it’s a complete package staying here! Pool too is great!   Overall, stay here to stay in budget and enjoy the whole of macau!",50
"You expect great service from Hyatt properties.  I stay with Hyatt often on business and am a high end loyalist member used to upgrades and attention.  Grand Hyatt Macau made this personal vacation visit (award stay) even better.  The upgrades and personal attention were extraordinary.  The hotel, located at the City of Dreams is a great location.  Don't miss the House of Dancing Waters while you are there.  It is an amazing show!",50
"The Grand Hyatt Macau is still our favourite hotel in the Taipa Cotai area. We had another excellent stay from 9-18 Jun. As always, staff service was outstanding. Check-in was a breeze and we got our room keys in a jiffy while we enjoyed tea and scones at the Grand Club. Thank you Lucia and Renee for the very warm welcome. We also enjoyed a very nice suite upgrade, complete with a welcome fruit basket and daily treats of chocolates and desserts from the hotel's patisserie. The highlight of our stay was the Grand Club and the excellent service we experienced from the dedicated and hardworking team led by Judy and Randy.  Thank you Sophie, Diana, Karl, Anita, Yan, Cherie, Chloe, Peggy, Jing and Sarah for your hospitality and making us feel like VIPs. We also love the Grand Club's…",50
"Returned to stay at the City of Dreams GRand Hyatt with wife and kid last week. Service and impression of the hotel certainly lived up to our expectation and was as exceptional this time around as it was for us some 5 years back. Staff were very attentive right from the check in to our check out. Ms Echo Chen from the Guest Service Team was at the reception to assist us with our check in and was personal and professional. She acceded to our requests and went to the extent of handing kid a welcome pack which made his stay all the more enjoyable. Throughout our stay, all staff members we encountered were professional and attentive. We definitely recommend this property to anyone travelling to Macau.",50
Excellent location and it’s close to all main casinos and malls. Hotel room is cozy and room is big. The room that I stayed could see the fountain view and the suite has a big living room area. Highly recommended and will definitely come back again.,50
"Stayed on the 18th floor for 2 nights at The Grand Suite. Room was spacious with view of the Wynn Palace fountain.  Good selection of food (dim sum, cakes, fruits, hot food) at the Club Lounge, serving breakfast, afternoon refreshments and evening cocktails. Favourite food was the madeleine cake. ",40
"While many would not consider Hyatt at Macau due to the fame of the Venetian and Parisian, this Hyatt is a true gem.       From the entrance to the lobby, the design is all very modern and chic, boasting a wow factor, not due to the lavishness but the pure atmosphere. Check-in staff was friendly, and the service was excellent. The suite I stayed in was up to expectation, open with great views of both the Wynn palace fountain and Macau airport. The bathroom was big, with double sinks, a large bathtub beside the window and a stand-up shower as well as a roof mount shower head. The third-floor recreational area was great also, including a spa, restaurant, a very decent sized gym, a kid’s playhouse, and an outdoor area to match. The swimming pool is beautiful, as well there is a…",50
This hotel is link together with the city of dreams hotel.  It will be grreat fro those who plan to watch the house of dancing water.  The shuttle bus is convenient to go around in the macau city.  They are variety of local breakfast in taipa area.  And the hospitality is superb as well.,50
"This is my first time staying with Grand Hyatt Macau. The level of hospitality is superb. Much better than I expected. Almost the same level as in Japan or even better.  Staff is very friendly and attentive to all my question. Prior to my arrival to the hotel.

Upon arrival, I am attendedShirley and Echo, both are extremely helpful for the process on checking in. Checkin process is flawless.

"Grand hotel with excellent service. The room is spacious and clean. Surprised by the ‘little play house with many balls’ set in the room. My kids were super happy.  My dad was Feeling dizzy and one of the staff (lady, I can’t remember the name ) helped us find the blood pressure monitor. She was really helpful and caring Overall, 5-star hotel , 5 star service!! We will definitely be back again:) ",50
"Terrible experience , old rooms , service poor , price high compare to quality  The only good things is the Club Lounge Manager which is very good , all the rest forget it   The Taxi waiting time at the Hotel is over 30 min sometimes and they are not organized at all .  Overall i won't suggest !!!!",20
"The first impression that Grand Hyatt Macau gave me was ""Service comes first"". I was extremely impressed by the standard of service given. My luggage was damaged when I reached Macau. The porter noticed it, offered his help and even gave us a small token to brighten up our mood. After delivering the luggage to our room, he even introduced us the amenities of the room, as well as recommending us places to visit. All of these were such sweet gestures which I appreciate.  We booked the grand king deluxe fountain view room, and the view of the water show in front of Wynn was amazing. The room was big, with a long sofa and table plus two chairs. The bed was large and comfortable. There were also two basins and a vanity table.  The hotel is at City of Dreams and next to the house of…",50
"The highlight was that location and service are top notch! I received a free upgrade to a Suite since it's my first time staying in Hyatt Macau. The room was facing Wynn with its dancing fountain. Amazing view!  Hyatt is also connected to the Dancing Water show so it took just 1 min to reach the show.   There is also a free shuttle to airport, attractions, and other hotels in Macau so I paid nothing for transport the whole time I was in Macau.   There are affordable restaurants in the second floor so food was also no issue.  I travelled with old people. They were fully impressed and were very comfortable/pampered the whole time we were there.  Thanks, Hyatt!!",50

I want to express my gratitude for the cleaning lady who clean my room and the check in counter lady who did a fast and great service during my check-in. Also to concierge name Kent, he did an amazing job, he must get the promotion because he helped me and other's who need directions or call for cab with service straight from the heart.

We travelled Macau many times but this is the first time we got such considerate service, the room is upgraded and well decorated with colourful balloons, the guest experience team sent us a surprise cake and helped us take a family photo.

If you are coming yo cerebrate birthday or anniversary, you will not regret to choose this hotel.",50
"I chose to stay at the Grand Hyatt primarily based on the reviews regarding the club lounge and it did not disappoint.   If there’s one thing that would stand out about this property, it would be the guest services staff (Housekeeping, Concierge, and Club Lounge in particular).  They were top notch- very responsive, courteous, and accommodating.   As for the Club Lounge food, it’s good, but nothing to rave about.    Kudos to the main guy at the Club Lounge, Randy, for going above and beyond in drawing up an itinerary for our quick stay.  My kids and I were able to maximize the time exploring Macau the roughly 24-hours we were there.  He was able to deliver all my requests:  private transportation with driver, a visit to the Panda Sanctuary, a quick tour of the major landmarks,…",50

"We recently spent a weekend at the Grand Hyatt hotel on the Cotai Strip. This is a nice place at the City of Dreams complex, a good five star property that leans towards functional over luxury.   Our reservation was made through booking.com when Grand Hyatt was offering surprisingly low weekend rates. Email confirmation was received immediately. We were well received upon arrival, check-in took no more than 5 minutes.   The location of the hotel is very good. You are directly connected to the COD shopping area, restaurants and House of Dancing Water arena. The property is just across the street from Wynn Cotai and MGM Cotai on the east end. At the west end of COD you are nearby the St. Regis and Venetian Hotels.   There is free shuttle service provided by COD to the Grand Hyatt…",40

Although we purchasing the package via third party agent; their front desk staff still gave us a professional services.  I would like to specially give my highest appreciate the Assistant Front Office Manager name Cindy Shi & Tina. Both of them are the most friendliest and helpful employee I have ever come across who really know the true value of customer service. We won't need to be inform too much while they had settled the rest for us already. Hyatt should be proud for having them.  Our room was very elegant and spacious. It had a large king-size bed, refrigerator, stunning living room with a huge plasma television.  There were many services…",50
"Second stay here, but this time at the Club Tower side.  The room was much more spacious, and curiously we now have a narrow and elongated bathroom with the bathtub/shower unit against the glass window, and the bathtub is next to/and visible from the sofa.  Everything was fine during our short stay.",50
Lovely hotel.  Randy in the Club Lounge was so helpful and a true credit to the Grand Hyatt.  Great spacious rooms.  Though the hotel does have a problem with guest smoking on the non-smoking floors.  We had to change rooms because of the smell of smoke in our room.  The staff were very understanding and very helpful.  ,50
"The staff were very friendly and helpful. 24 hour Fitness Center is great however the steam room & Jacuzzi closes at 12 midnight as it is separate from the gym, operated by a Spa.

Excellent view and a very good experience. The room was very clean and the best part is the bathroom with the view of far mountains and all the big hotels nearby. Would recommend everyone to go for it,50
"It is located near Macau airport, so it is quite far from old Macau where most tourist attractions located. But hotel has easy access to  free shuttles so one can get to and from airport, ferry ports, train stations across border And old downtown. The hotel has very good food in the Hyatt club and it large swimming outdoor pool with several outdoor hot tub is good too, but the my room has some cigarette smell and some of the staff seems not want to give extra help to guest who are often poorly educated, bad behaving chinese.",50
"The breakfast buffet was very well served - I really liked prawn dumpling, wanton soup, beef noolle and egg tart. The desk service was good! If you are lucky enough, you can get a room with a view of the Wynn hotel's fountain show at night! ^^ - It's beautiful! The location of the hotel is excellent - easy access to nearby hotels like Venetian, Wynn, MGM, studiocity,Parisian! They are all walkable distance. I had a really pleasant and memorable stay at the Grand Hyatt Macau! Two thumbs up!!!",50
"We had 2 club rooms at the Grand Hyatt Macao. The room was big, well lighted and beds were very comfortable. The bathroom was great with a separate tub and shower.  The club lounge was comfortable and food & drinks  served are of high standard.  Both Diana Zheng and Randy Wong at the Club Lounge are so professional and their service are top notch.  Randy knows all the nice authentic restaurant that serve great food and he is so willing to share his knowledge with us.  Diana is such a charming lady that took good care of us during our stay.

It was an unremarkable stay but still nice. There were no expectations for our anniversary, so when we informed the staff prior to our stay that it was an anniversary, they offered a cake but nothing really came out of it, presumably because I asked for something Gluten Free.   We found our room to be fantastic. I loved the bathroom and even though we were by the lifts, it was very quiet. Our room was a smoking room, and what we loved was it hardly smelled of smoke! One thing we did note was that we did notice a burning smell by the electrics on the day we left and that worried us a lot. We informed the staff…",40

Our room is very spacious and modern with care taken over every detail it is also overlooking the huge fountains of the Wynn, with an amazing water show that goes on through the evening. I would definitely request that view if booking. My husband only eats international food and there is A tapas and Italian restaurant in the food court. My favourite meal in the hotel is the buffet breakfast, it is expensive but the choices are impressive selection of both Chinese and international stations to choose from. We also…",50

Great hotel! Best hotel in Macau. Want to give our thanks to our guest customer service Echo Chen. She takes great pride in her job and made us feel welcome since day 1. Breakfast buffet spread could be better though.,50
"This is the third time my family and I stayed at Grand Hyatt Macau. Grand Hyatt Macau has better maintenance and hygiene compared with other same level hotels in Cotai such as the Venetian Macao, Galaxy Macau,etc. The hotel has nice rooms, minibar and clean washrooms. To be honest, Grand Hyatt Macau still has nice outlook after 10 years operation. The view of the hotel is very nice too.  Our family experienced a very sincered and heart-filled service, very considerated and customer orientated. Their members from customer experience team are very sincere and helpful that they always traced we personal requests are settled or not.  The quality of Beijing Kitchen is still in a above-average level. Besides, this is the first time I have dinner buffet at Mezza9, both the service and…",40
"We had the presidential suite while we were in Macau. I haven’t been to Macau for at least 20 years.  We had the best view looking directly at the Wynn and the water night show.  We were very pleased with the service staff, cleanliness of the rooms, and the restaurants in the hotel.",50
"One of the warmest staff at this hotel is their front door manager Jayvee Lan who is always cheerful, considerate and helpful. He would be too happy to help us with bags, umbrella and directions. He is the only staff at the hotel who can greet returning guests by their last name and the only staff who will write to departed guests via email. Excellent service and hospitality. ",50
"The hotel is absolutely phenomenal! Location of the hotel is perfect, right on the strip, the staff are very friendly and the rooms were breathtaking. I was blown away but how big this hotel, it is connected to the City of Dreams, giving access to all the casinos have to offer. Again, an absolutely stunning hotel, stay here if you’d love the real casino Macau experience.",50
My girlfriend and I stayed in the Grand Hyatt for 2 nights with friends. Luckily we got an upgrade to a suite which offered an amazing view overlooking the Wynn Palace fountain show. The suite was amazing and offered a lot of space with separate living room and a very spacious bedroom. Overall the cleanliness was excellent and the service prompt after every request. Check in and check out were quick and efficient.  The hotel is conveniently located and offers complimentary shuttle bus service from the Port and throughout the city. Casinos are just as accessible as shops and restaurants. The Venetian is within 5 minutes walking distance reachable. If you want to spend time in a contemporary hotel with high quality service I surely recommend you the Grand Hyatt Macau. ,50

"Stayed for two nights. Paid extra Amount to upgrade the room and breakfast at club lounge. Club lounge was in another tower and has to change the lift at level 3. Got to level 3, staffs here do not know the direction unable to give us a proper guidance. A chef was asking Host at mezza 9 to assist, host replied ask the guest to come here and ask. Wow~... nice service. Room cutleries have stains, bath tub looks dirty with stains. Breakfast at lounge was disappointing. Little selection. A short hair wearing suit lady looks stern and rough when clearing our soiled on table. Chef at egg station was not approachable at all and reply was unwilling. Never again for the price I paid!",30
"To book the room via the Hyatt website and to have free upgrade to Suite.  This is the 1st time to stay in Suite, definitely good facilities, good view and we got very good experience.  I think this is the advantage of using the Hyatt website to book the room.",50
Beautiful and clean room. Has separated bath tub and shower.  Good access to shopping mall and restaurant. Friendly staff and the restaurant has delicious food. We had our best time staying in this hotel!,50
"Very disappointed with Grand Hyatt at this property.  the hardware was outdated, the room design was in 90s' style.  The room's setup, decor, and facility were not quite up to today's standard. example, there was not usb charging socket in room, and the hotel was nice enough to offer adapter for it, yet, when you plugged the usb charging cable in, it failed to fit into the socket on wall.  we needed to make it charging at one of the sockets near the ground for it.  failure! upgrade of wall sockets should not cost much but the enhancement offered convenient for guests.  check in experience was extremely bad, we reserved for a non-smoking single bed room but was told it was unavailable, we were forced to take either a smoking room or twin bed room.  Later we were told it was due…",20
"We picked this hotel because of its proximity to the Wynn Fountain and to the Water Show and weren’t disappointed in the hotel or its location!  We had a fountain view room which was beautiful, and we felt worth the extra money.  The hotel has a very nice lobby bar area that had live music later in the evening.  The staff in the hotel we extremely helpful.  Big thanks to Reven Luo who made such a difference to our stay.  In addition to helping us plot out how to maximize our sightseeing day, he even booked us our ferry tickets to Hong Kong saving us a lot of time and hassle. Macau is easy to get around with Casino shuttles going between the old and new areas.  If you have a chance to see the Water Show, do it.  It costs a lot but so does Cirque De Soleil and we thought this show…",40

"Reasonably priced hotel with a contemporary look, providing all the comfort one would expect from the chain without the tackiness of other hotels in the area that cater more to families.   It has direct access to dining, shops and casino in the City of Dream while the other casinos and ferry terminal can be easily accessed using a complimentary shuttle bus. ",40
"Grand Hyatt Macau is home away from home. It comprises two wave-inspired towers within City of Dreams—the much talked-about, aquatic-themed, integrated entertainment resort on Cotai. The hotel houses 791 rooms, most are suite-style with separate living spaces; and 15 individual function areas spanning almost 8,000 square meters, including a colossal 1,911-square-meter Grand Ballroom and Salão do Teatro, one of the first ballroom in Macau encompassing a theater-style show kitchen.  I walked in and was in complete awe. It was walking into another world where everything is grand and everyone’s at your service.   The suite was lavish, beds are absolutely comfortable. Whatever you’re in Macau to do, book a room that’ll give you access to the Club Lounge. You can thank me later!   The…",50
"The location is convenient for every age, swimming pool is perfect for young children. The room is big enough for a big family. Shops and Casino are not too crowded. Manager Connie was very kind and professional. 체크인때 불미스러운 일이 있었는데 매니저 코니가 정말 친절하게 모든 불만사항을 대신 사과하고 기분좋게 여행을 마칠 수 있게 도와주었습니다.",50
Attended my friend's wedding and was the MC so imagine how bad it would be if things didnt go well with venue. The room is excellent with a great view and the staff kind- most importantly- they are good and professional at making arrangements.,50
"Excellent.....just excellent....nothing else......beat place to stay, centrally located, courteous and helpful staff. I just checked in today after visiting Hongkong and as compared looking at the sizes of room, it was fabulous.  ",50
"Liked: Room was out of my expectations. Spacious, clean, modern, bright - other than maybe Banyan Tree, probably the best standard room i've seen in Macau for a little while. Bathroom has two sinks, a bathtub, a separate toilet, and a shower. Excellent space, a lot of glass. Suited for couples more to be honest, can be quite intimate but i had no issues with this and quite liked the design. Staff were excellent - was given a earlier check in and a late check out. Located right opposite the Wynn, above the Casino, and excellent transportation via shuttle bus to Macau.   Disliked: Location was decent, but far away from the Galaxy's and Broadway Hotel area if you need to go over there. Other than that, no complaints.",50
A true sample of excellent hospitality The rooms are all with a bathtub suitable for two .They are special. The beds are so soft they sell them. The dressing gowns are the same. The hotel has a nice bar and a pool on the roof. There are plenty of places to eat and drink nearby at a variety of prices.,50
We had a package to stay one night plus two dinner buffet and breakfast included.  Were there at three pm and they claimed rooms not ready and start to promote upgrade to suite with 300 dollars adder.  My wife accepted expecting high level good view and one living room.  It didn't let us down and the night fountain show at Wynn palace was awesome and woke up with sun rise sea view.  Good deal as she was happy.,40
"The hotel is as you would expect, the room they gave us in the Club Tower was very nice, spacious, was well maintained, bathroom was a great size. The location was good connected to the City of Dreams.  Beijing Kitchen, staff were a bit of a issue in understanding our needs, but the food was decent.  Overall a good property",40

The Grand Club is large comfortable with very friendly staff. Very good breakfast and and lots of evening treats and beverages. Champagne - Veuve Clicquot  on Friday & Saturday evenings. Highly recommended!",50
"Many hotels tend to overlook the check-in experience, but not the Grand Hyatt.  After a week of traveling between a couple of different cities with a 12-month old in tote, we were greeted by Ms. Echo Chen upon check-in.  To put it simply, she was just amazing. She gave us recommendations on what to do in Macau and even gave us a special rate on the hotel breakfast buffet. She went above and beyond when she assisted us to our with our luggage upon check in and then again on check out, she helped us have a fast and smooth check out.  On a separate note, the service and food at Mezze9 was also amazing.  Thank you Ms. Chen, Mezze9 and the Grand Hyatt for a short, but memorable time in Macau.",50
"Grand Hyatt Hotel in Macau. An Excellent hotel, professional Guest Experience Team service to make you feel like home, #1 Five star hotel in Macau, perfect hotel facilities, clean room, good service. Unforgettable experience:)",50
"Check in and out was super efficient, my 5 years old had no complaint for lining up. Nicely located with a good view. Indoor kids playground is just next door and all the major hotels are within walking distance!!",50
Was just a one night visit but was great.  Upgraded room and fantastic service from front desk and concierge (Johnson in particular was lovely).   View of Water Fountain was amazing.  Loved the JBL speaker next to the bed.   Room was sparkling clean.   Breakfast buffet was amazing.  ,50
"Definitely worth the stay. Thank you Tina for your friendly hospitality as well as the upgrade, it really took me by surprise. The suite looks so comfortable and it made you feel at home, and not in a hotel room. We didn't get to try the food but hopefully on my next visit. We enjoyed the bday cake though, and although the pool was  closed due to weather, the hot tub in the changing room was very nice. Thank you again for a great stay.",50
"We stayed 1 night in April. Check in was quick and efficient. The room was fantastic with great views of the wynn fountain. Breakfast was great in the club lounge as was evening drinks and snacks with a huge selection of food on offer. would definately recommend staying at grand hyatt, large clean rooms with great view f wynn fountains.",50
"Just got back from a family trip to Macau and Hong Kong and writing this review before I get caught  up with other things.  If you’re on this page, it means you’re considering your options to stay at a nice place in Macau. I was doing the same last week scouring through reviews trying to make up my mind and boy, am I glad I decided to stay at the Grand Hyatt. In a place where luxurious hotels vie for your attention and grandeur is a given, I guess it’s the people who make the difference. The Grand Hyatt has everything you can expect from a global brand in a place as glitzy as Macau...excellent location, superb amenities commendable restaurants (go with the breakfast in the hotel, you won’t regret). I had a very nice suite on the 17th floor with an excellent view, they were so…",50
"Grand Hyatt is one of my fave hotels in Macau.Tasteful decor, excellent service, fabulous view and very comfortable bed. We booked 2 King Rooms with Fountain view (of Wynn) and got an upgrade to Suite in the end.  Wonderful surprise. ",50
"Staff are well trained. The dinner and the breakfast was great. If you like seafood, you should try the buffet dinner there. I particularly like the way that you can order your food at buffet, this can help to save the food from wasting. The food choices are not as many as other buffet dinner, however, you just have the space to focus on the lobsters and seafood. We have had a great trip there. ",50
The Grand Hyatt is one of the great hotel to stay in Macau among the other hotels in the Cotai area.  Service staff are all capable and provide good service. Keep it up and be the best among the rest. Regards ,50
"It was my second time to visit Grand Hyatt Macau, we loved the club executive suite room in here. We enjoyed the wide and amazing view of Cotai airport to fountain of Wynn Hotel in room. The room was big and comfortable, excellent room! Thanks for your white wine and fruits for us. All of staffs are nice and kind in The Club Lounge, especially the GSO Ms Jin Chang, she was smart and helpful, thanks for her good arrangement.  The location was convenient and near the airport, We will visit here again in the future and recommend this hotel to our friends.",50
"There were plenty of goods things about this hotel, the staff, the breakfast and the quality of the accommodation, however over the course of a three day stay the basin, the shower and the toilet all backed up it was getting beyond a joke. I would stay here again but look elsewhere first because of the maintenance issues.",40
"Too many people praise, or complain about their hotel rooms without advising the actual Room category. We travelled as a couple for 5 nights, and stayed in the Grand Hyatt Macau ""Grand Suite Fountain View King Room"". I won't describe the room - refer to the website. However, it's exactly as advertised.  MAGNIFICENT. At 64sq.m it should be. You won't be disappointed, if you are willing to pay the price. We paid AUD1557, (not cheap at all). We had to pay an additional $45 per person, per day, for breakfast, (expensive).  I WILL NOT BE COMMENTING ON THE OTHER ROOM TYPES as I have no experience of them.   We stayed at the end of March 2019. Our room was 1818 - a Corner Suite.  We arrived at Cotai Ferry Terminal around 8PM, directly from the HKIA, on CotaiWaterJet. You are at their…",50
We stayed 2 nights in a fountain view room. Wow! Definitely worth it.  The whole room and particularly the bathroom was amazing. Something u would need to experience to believe it.  Breakfast and dinner - definitely a must at Mezza9. Just beautiful. ,50
The hotel is very nice with big rooms but the check in was very long and I still do not understand why they have to  keep my credit card deposit for 21 days after check in!!! Also regretfully after   Midnight no bar in the Hotel. ,40
"Modern, stylish and grand hotel. You can enjoy your stay, shopping, gambling, dinning, etc., all at one place. Check-in was not an issue at all, fast and easy. Staffs were nice. Room is spacious. Recommend it.",50
Excellent service and well trained staff. Very accommodating and helpful in every way that they can. Easy access to public transport and to other hotels. Well presented and clean. We highly recommend Grand Hyatt Macau,50
"My husband and I just spent our last weekend at Grand Hyatt Macau. This was a birthday trip to my husband.  What we experienced in this hotel was totally out of our expectations.    The room was spacious and the bed was comfortable.  There was a big bathtub in bathroom, I could enjoy a hot bath with my favourite bath salts after whole day activities. We had dinner buffet at Mezza9 which emphasize the concept of“the dining from the kitchen”- you could choose ingredients and cooking methods in your own way. This was the reason why we picked Grant Hyatt Macau for the celebration.  The food quality is incredible; all the ingredients, like lobster, abalone etc were fresh, chefs’ technique was excellent. We love that we don’t need to queue up for the food, like other buffets. We just…",50
"We stayed in Macau 7 years ago in the Venetian Hotel, it is one of our favourite hotels, but so much has changed, we wanted to try somewhere different. After a lot of research, we decided to stay at the Wynn Palace but by the time I got round to booking it the price had almost doubled! I'm kinda glad it did, as we opted for the Grand Hyatt. The room we booked was in the grand club tower (room 2165) We were blown away with the size, the bath overlooking the Wynn Palace, the attention to detail, the cleanliness, the comfort and most of all with the view overlooking the water show at the Wynn Palace! What an amazing experience, through the day and night there are different shows to music.  Yes it can be heard from the room, but it would not keep you awake and is only on for a few…",50
"There are so many 5 star hotels around the world, and I've been fortunate enough to experience so many and have experienced great customer service from staff. But the staff at the Grand Hyatt Macau went beyond my expectations and really made my stay pleasurable and efficient.   I had pre-requested an earlier check in and also a staff member to help me decorate a room for my friends bridal shower. Cindy Shih, FO Manager, had called me a few days in advance to confirm my early check in and requests. I had mentioned that I don't actually need help anymore, cause the materials were enough for 1 person to do, but I do hope that I could get early check in or at least somewhere I can sit and open the decorations. She had asked that I look for her upon arrival. When I arrived at the…",50
The stay in Grand Hyatt was incredible. The ambience was world class. We were given in 12 floor. And the view from the room was mind boggling. We could view the musical fountain which relaxed our minds. Everything was good.,50
"There was smoke smell in the room despite it being non smoking room.  There was also a large mosquito flying around in the room after we checked in.  We ordered room service dessert and waited almost an hour and it did not arrive.  When we called again, they did not apologize at all and in the end we cancelled it, as it was already past midnight at that point.  There was also ton of orange mold chunky substance on one of the boxes next to the sink which is disgusting.  Lastly, we arranged check out at 12, and they already called and rushed us at 1145.  Overall the service and room is not up to standard.",20
"It's my first time to write a review here. Unlike other hotels in Cotai, Grand Hyatt was not as crowded. It's suitable for travellers who like to get away from the crowd. We enjoyed the cosy room and especially the hot water bath very much.   Hotel service was excellent and impressive! I found out I left my mobile phone on the taxi right after I got off. The hotel staff immediately chased after the taxi, trying to stop the taxi. Though he failed, another staff at the reception offered his help patiently and professionally. He checked CCTV for me for the taxi number and helped me contact the taxi groups. He asked me to stay at the room and would call me if there's any update. My phone was found after 1.5 hours, losing a phone could have ruined my mood for the rest of my schedule.…",50
"Best choice to stay in Grand Hyatt, Macau for our Macau visit. They have made our visit very comfortable , enjoyable and fully satisfied with our shopping and entertainment plan. Very impressed with their personalised attentions on our needs especially from their staff Jayvee and Cindy to provide us with details on Macau’s main attractions and hotel’s services in particular transports schedules related to our stay. They also made necessary follow up to make sure our needs and expectations were fully met. Of course, the hotel also provide luxury & modern room and recreation facilities as well F&B services.  The choice of Grand Hyatt Macau made our Macau visit so perfect and special. Well done. Grand Hyatt, Macau and Thank you Jayvee & Cindy.   From Kim Lor",50
It was really good!! Room was very clean and big. I just  liked everything about this hotel. Hotel itself have very modern style which I liked.   Every service was just great! Hope to visit this hotel again :) ,50
"I had stay Grand Executive Fountain view suite with my baby. They shearing my request (upgrade to fountain viw room), then club lounge staff telling smartly upgrade information. We can see fountain very nice, fountain water sounds and fountain show music also we enjoyed from 31st floor our room. Club lounge also so nice quite and big room staff everytime kind and helpful. Food also good specially evening time. We didn't go , but swimming pool with Jacuzzi looks so nice. We want try next time. We has so fun stay in this hotel. 通常の1番お値打ちなお部屋から＋27,000円程でクラブラウンジアクセス付き、そこから20,000円程で向かいのウィンパレスホテルの噴水が見える部屋にアップグレードしました。 噴水はホテルから徒歩ですぐ見に行けるので通常の方であれば要らないかもしれませんが1歳の子供連れの私たちに噴水が見える部屋はとても良い選択でした。…",50
"I booked four premium delux rooms for seven of us under its Grand Offer in order to book a dinner at Messa9.  The property is vast, which connects with casino, shopping mall, and food court. However, the check-in was long and tidous. Even as a Hyatt rewards member, no upgrade was available, and the rooms were just standard.",40
"Excellent hotel! The staff are very helpful and nice! Thank you the Assistant Manager, Cindy, she provided excellent customer service and the staff, Chris, he is very helpful! Highly recommend this hotel !",50
very good experience by Hyatt Macau. Sarah and Max help a lot during my stay in Macau. Explaining the room and the city. Staff are helpful and friendly. Will come here next time visit Macau.  excellent job Grand Hyatt Macau,50

"Grand Hyatt is a fantastic property that provides good room, good food option and good meeting centre. This is well connected to all shopping & other place on the Strip. We found Indian chef Prashant to take care of our Vegetarian Diet. ",50
"Checked in 22/3. Easy going and a very pleasant experience despite the fact that there was a queue. The hotel check in staff were friendly  efficient and very personable. The room was spacious clean and very well maintained. The bathroom is huge and the rainfall shower is the best I’ve used-the water pressure is strong. The breakfast restaurant is one of the best I’ve eaten in both in terms of the restaurant ambience and the food on offer. The staff are efficient helpful and friendly. I do have to remind myself though that this is a Hyatt hotel so the standard of service, staff and everything else with the brand  just has to be top notch especially in competitive macau where there are just so many other top quality hotels offering the same product. Despite the competition in…",50
"The room was very well decorated with a modern look. The amenities were more than I expected.  Overall, well worth the price. They didn't have any restaurant or bistro for a western style breakfast. They are also located off the main attractions of the main hotels. A fair amount of walking is required if you are up to it.",50
"I was on a trip with my cousin's family to Macau during the new year of 2019. My cousin booked 3 non-smoking rooms with the Grand Club access for 5D4N. We were really excited and looking forward to a high standard of service and quality as it is a 5 star hotel with many good reviews.   However, it was a slightly disappointing experience with this hotel. The check in process was rather slow even though there weren’t many guests. Also, the receptionist failed to tell us to go up to the 37th floor to check in in the beginning. The lobby was elegant but it is a bit odd to find there was no seating area for guests to relax.   The major issue of this hotel is the cigarette smoke smell in their non-smoking rooms. My room reeked of cigarette smoke. We are sensitive to it and requested…",30
Had an awesome stay. Great service and well trained customer service. Especially the staff- team in the club lounge were very helpful and kind enough to assist me as my child was not well that time we’re having our tea break and cocktail on the 12th March. Kudos to the team that day! Thank you! And also thanks for the complementary cake for our anniversary and also the nice view if the Wynn Palace dancing fountain and the Macau Airport! It was a great and special moment and will be back there again in the future. Thank you!,50
"Room & Hotel cleanliness: Excellent Service: Excellent, from the check-in to the housekeeping to the plumber technician. Food: We tried the buffet breakfast, there was a wide variety of food with good quality. Location: Located within the City of Dreams shopping mall (in the Cotai area), with a wide choice of restaurants, & a convenience shop located at the basement, near the shuttle bus area, where we bought snacks & bananas for supper. There is free shuttle bus service to MGM, Wynn Palace, Galaxy Resorts, Venetian, Studio City & Sands Cotai Central. If you prefer to walk, the Sands Cotai Central shopping mall is just across the road, though there is no shelter from the rain or sun. From Sands Cotai Central, it is a short & sheltered walk to the Shoppes at Venetian, Shoppes at…",50
"Cam here for my first wedding anniversary for a quick break from Hong Kong after what seemed to be a decent deal for a night away ... bad idea.  Got to the hotel, they put us in a suite on the 15th that was non smoking but stank like smoke nonetheless...they told us to wait in the room for someone to redirect us.  We waited almost half an hour and almost missed our show in studio city.  I had to call them to remind them to help us!  Then they moved us to another room in the 12th floor same problem and it was a non smoking floor !!!!!!     Was too tired after the show to move again so I called the front desk and spoke to an assistant manager to simply let them know that this was unacceptable for a five star hotel; the manager offered to give me an air purifier (not sure how that…",10
"I visited 2nd time at this hotel. The room was very beautiful, clean and spacious. Pool and spa also very nice. Our first two nights are little noises from out side the window ( weather problems ) but they upgrade our rooms immediately. I’m sure coming next year in this hotel again. Also I’m recommend my all friends to stay here.",50
Great service and value for money in the Grand Club Tower. Would definitely stay here again All the staff were pleasant and the Club Lounge was spacious with great views . Randy and his team deserve credit for their hard work .,50
Excellent service and hospitality from  hotel staff. Facilities not only meet but exceed our expectations. Rooms were clean with good mattress for sound sleep. Buffet dinner and breakfast offered excellent food in such a variety that we could not taste them all. ,50
Beautiful and comfortable room with great sound proof. Smiling faces everywhere from every staff. Very helpful and advice especially Samdy at reception. Good food and atmosphere at Mezz9 and Manager Harsal with friendly attitude.,50
The staff at the hotel upheld the brand name by providing exceptional service. Location was further from where local cuisines are. So be prepared to either engage a driver or queue for taxis. Taxis  are difficult to get in Macau especially during peak hours ie 5pm-8pm,50
"Very nice hotel! Renee, Tina in Guest Service Team, Sandy at check in counter and the male manager in Mezza9 (sorry I did not get his name) are friendly, professional and gave my boyfriend and I very personalized service. The room was large, clean, bright and comfortable. Good food in Mezza9. We are enjoying the time here and thank you very much again for the birthday arrangement!",50
I stayed in this hotel for one night. The room is spacious and clean. The bed is comfortable. But the facilities start to be worn out.  I am also disappointed by the early checkout time. The checkout time is 11am which I don’t think it is a standard checkout time for 5* international hotel chain.  ,40
"I have been to several hotels in Macau but Grand hyatt is best of the best. Their service is impeccable. All staff actually read my mind and eagle to service us all the time.  The Executive lounge, ugh...h, the best ever!  I wont waste time looking for a hotel whenever I go to Macau anymore!  ",50
"Really enjoy staying in Grand Hyatt Macau.   Is a relaxing place for me to getaway. I feel peace when i m staying here. Not as crowd as other hotel in Macau.  All staff are very polite and helpful. The room is spacious, clean and make u feel like home.  Must stay again!",40

"It’s a good resort hotel. You can enjoy spa, spacious fitness Centre and a good swimming pool, 40m length and constant temperature at 23 degree. Besides, there are 2 jacuzzis with tv monitors. You can enjoy warm water massage and watch film at the same time. For the room, the faciliries of washroom are good, big bath tab enough space for 2 persons, 2 separate basins for teeth brushing. It’s comfortable to stay inside the room. Moreover, seldom hotel would offer different sizes of slippers, but grand Hyatt does.",40
"Like many of the modern luxury hotels in Macau, this Hyatt offers clean and spacious rooms. The toilet is huge and bath tub a plus. Service are on par with usual 5-star hotel standard. However, the Spa was horrible.",40
"Amazing spectacular stay in one of my favourite luxury property worldwide.  Room: We had a two nights paid stay in the basic Executive Room which comes with access to the wonderful Executive Lounge. The room is huge and wonderfully appointed. The sleep quality was so good: The bed was extremely comfortable and noise insulation is excellent. The level of housekeeping was excellent and the property has beautifully maintained the rooms, considering its age with its newer competitors.  Club Lounge: Top class executive lounge we have ever experienced worldwide. The luxurious club lounge occupied an entire floor of the club tower. It provided substantial meals for breakfast, afternoon tea and canapes. With a large kitchen, the evening canapes were of substantial value, e.g. Barbequed…",50

"Stayed here on a Saturday for a staycation. Very good location, within City of Dreams, walkable distance to anywhere along the strip. Short free shuttle service from the ferry station, which dropped us outside the hotel. Return shuttle is located at the basement of City of Dreams.   The hotel is also near the airport, although the sound proofing is very good and I did not hear any noise from the plane.   We were upgraded to the fountain view Suite, thanks so much, really appreciated it as it made the stay extra special. The view was spectacular and reminded me of Bellagio Las Vegas.   The room was specious and the bed was comfortable. The only downside is that the hair dryer would sometimes turn off on its own, perhaps the plug is lose but I could not locate it because it is…",50
"Eventhough the hotel is located in the City of Dreams complex, it feels really disconnected to the chaotic mess of being a casino hotel which is really good if you want a truly relaxing vacation or on business. The ambience of the hotel is luxurious and ideal for families.  We booked in a corner suite with really excellent views of the Cotai strip on one end and the Wynn fountain on the other. The room is very spacious and had really good furnishings. The bed was really comfortable. The only complaint is the shower floor is slippery and maybe dangerous.  The amazing service provided by the staff is a plus to the hotel and is something rarely found in Macau. Echo at the front desk provided assistance in arranging restaurant reservation et al which made our lives very easy as…",50
"We visited the hotel on 13 Feb to celebrate the Valentine's day. I already pre-ordered the flower to place at the room in advance.  Room is big and clean, view is amazing. However the use adapter for charging the phone is extremely slow... Overall it's great and I will come back to stay for sure.",40
Grand Hyatt Macau is the typical dream hotel for which 5 star properties are known for. The heated pool area with multiple jacuzzi is simply fantabulous. The lobby area is synchronized with other Grand Hyatt's of the world such as the Mumbai one which adds to the 'WOW' factor. The rooms were spacious with a luxurious bathing area...another novelty of 5 star hotels in Asia. Definitely coming to Macau again and staying here and here alone :),40
We are repeated guests at the hotel  enjoyed our every stay. The staff are very thoughtful and professional. Rooms are spacious and cozy. Food and beverages at the grand club and Mezza 9 are very good.,50
"can only rave about the hotel and amenities..absolutely beautiful hotel,clean and modern..real close to restaurants,bars and shopping...the check in was made by the best two people being Echo and Jayvee and saying thank you is still not enough. but a huge thank you to both off them...a real asset to the hotel and know how to make a guest feel special...",50
"Room was great, very comfortable and ideal for shopping in the City of Dreams shopping centre as well as the House of Dancing Water which is very impressive and worth seeing.  Downside was on checkout, staff tried to charge me extra for breakfast despite me not even having breakfast. After waiting for 15 minutes to speak to a manager that never showed up, they finally agreed to 'let it go this time' - I was never going to back down so felt this was a bit patronising.   The shuttle system was also an absolute sh** show. I queued for over an hour for a bus to get to the old town, no one was there organising people or telling people which bus to get on. They weren't at all regular so eventually I went to get a taxi which then took another 30 minutes to arrive - just an utter…",40

"Dear sir/madam,  I have been staying in different 5 star hotel in the world. Grand Hyatt is truly able to deliver a pleasant stay for us. Room is large and modern. Love the design a lot.   Unfortunately, I had discovered some problems.  First, we were quite disappointed about the dinner buffet in mezza 9 restaurant. It started running out of food at 9:00pm, but the buffet is officially closed at 11:00pm.  We thought it is unreasonable to run out of food before two hours. We have tried many buffet before and even a three star hotel would not run out of food so early. We were so disappointed.  Moreover, the room rules are quite misleading. As I had booked a total of three persons under the Grand Offer package, the room rules does not stated that there will be only two breakfasts…",40
"The room is decent with a nice view of the Wynn Palace fountain show (note you can hear the sound of the show every 20mins in the evening). We booked a non-smoking twin room with an extra bed for our family. However, they ran out of non-smoking rooms and decided to put us into a smoking room with double bed without informing us. It wasn’t until we called to complain that they admitted their mistake. There was no twin room left so we got put into a non-smoking double room, which still smelled of smoke. It was already late so we accepted it.  We tried to change the room again the next day but was informed that there was no room available.   It’s a bit disappointing to have the mistake and not be informed of the change. Traveling with children, we are particularly sensitive to the…",30

She is polite, detail oriented, and patient in helping us make plans and figure out transportation. She gave us a fantastic view room as we requested before and this time it was our first time to stay in Hyatt hotel after being a member.

stayed for 3 consecutive nights to celebrate our wedding anniversary. got upgraded to grand suite facing the dancing water show/lake. Grand Club experience was awesome.

When I arrive, they were super friendly and filled us in about every details of the room, the hotel and the transportation for me to travel around in Macau.

Hotel location is rather near to Taipai ferry terminal for those taking Cotai ferry to and fro HK island. Staffs are friendly and accommodating, room was spacious with high ceilings that one does not feel claustrophobic, apart from the given bottled water supplies, we requested for more and the hotel send it to us in due course (some hotels do charge for additional request but not this) The concierge staffs tried to make a point to address guests by their name/last name and will also pass you their business card in case you need any of their services. Oh yes, nice range of breakfast buffet spread at Mezza9 too!…",50
My stay with Grand Hyatt Macau was a very memorable one. Truly a dream vacation for me and my family. Everything's perfect. From check in to check out.

Sincere and honest too.  will definetely my choice of hotel when coming back to Macau.  Thank You! ,50
"Great Location, walking distance to coral strip, Venetian, and Wynn Palace. Attached to shopping mall and theatre for dancing water. Check in was slow, however we were upgraded to a corner suite as they had no non smoking rooms left, although we had booked non smoking. But not complaining the room was HUGE! Living/dining area, bedroom and bathroom, views of city of dreams and the airport! Breakfast was ok, have had better. Recommend visiting Wynn Palace it's crazy and to visit via the free cable car over the fountains. ",40
"Stayed with club lounge access on the 9th of Jan. Room was excellent. Service at club lounge was exceptional. Attention to detail, politeness and the food were outstanding. The lady who served cocktails at around 5pm was very nice and the next morning another staff by the name of Randy was very helpful. Ate dinner at Beijing Kitchen on the 9th night and food was very average and so was the service. Has to ask for water! Ate at A Lorcha in the city the next night and it was better than Beijing Kitchen which should not have been the case. Overall fantastic stay. Would go back but probably would not eat at Beijing Kitchen. ",50
"2 months has passed since our birthday trip but I’m still missing this place so much.  Sorry for my very late review Tina, Jack and Angela.   I’ve booked a suite room for 2 nights on 22 24 November 2018 for birthday celebration. What we’ve experienced in this hotel has totally surprised us and lighten up our stay. Room was really big and clean, we were upgraded to a room facing fountain view and the night view is gorgeous. We had dinner buffet in mezza9 and it is truly a highlight of our stay! It might be a bit exaggerated but I have to tell that this is the best buffet I’ve ever had. I love the idea of the buffet which you can choose ingredients and way to cook by yourself, dishes will be done by chefs personally and sending to our table shortly by staff with smile so we can…",50
No complain at all and was awesome stay in 2 days. Will stay again next time I come to Macau maybe next summer.Thanks to coincierge guy who helped us to book ferry ticket to HKIA. He was very helpful and attentive to us and you should be prooud of him,50
"We stayed here for couple of nights and upgraded our room to suite with access to the lounge and here is my experience: Room: excellent room layout with walk in robe and top notch furniture with great view over the fountain. Perfect bed and TV. Lounge: one of the best I have ever seen, great variety of food and drinks and a relaxing atmosphere. It’s really a whole package. The only negative was the heater didn’t work in our room and late in the evening we had to move to 11th floor from 30th, to a slightly smaller room, but we still loved our experience.",50
I love to stay in luxury brand hotels and try out different restaurants. So far GH MACAU provide the best!! Thankyou for all of the staff warm service and great hospitality!! I will definitely coming back soon.,50
"Tina, Jack and Renee made our stay extra memorable by providing the best service we ever had at any Hyatt hotels. The Grand Club staff members provided excellent service. We highly recommend this hotel to families everywhere.",50
"My husband and I stayed here for two nights on our recent holiday in Macau and we loved it! We are Hyatt members so had a room in the Club tower, and were upgraded to a nicer one than we'd originally booked. The room was gorgeous, absolutely huge with a giant king sized bed, an L-shaped sofa and an enormous bathroom with double sinks, a huge tub and a rain shower. There was also a large dressing area with a big wardrobe. The room was impeccably clean and very modern, the bed was super comfy with lovely linens, and the robes and slippers were good quality. The staff was friendly and helpful, especially the lovely woman who checked us in and gave us lots of helpful tips regarding sightseeing and how to get around on the hotel shuttles. The shuttles are convenient, though what…",50
"We enjoyed our visit to the Grand Hyatt Macau which is well located as part of the City of Dreams complex comprising of a mixed use integrated resort casino. Many restaurants, activities and a great show in their theatre with the Dancing Waters show. The pool deck was nice, quiet and relaxing. Haven't been to Macau in 20 years and it was nice to see how the destination has evolved from the small town to what it has become today attracting all the Chinese tourists. My choice would probably return to Vegas next time around as it has a much more international feel.",50
"Very spacious room and bathroom, very nice bath tube. Very nice outdoor space with jacuzzi and heated swimming pool. We came especially from Europe to enjoy dinner buffet at Mezza9, the hotel restaurant.",50
"Booked into this hotel last minute..  we didn’t know what to expect as there were many to choose from.  As we checked in, greeted with professional and friendly staff.  We were given upgraded rooms, much to our delight we were so impressed with the upgrade, the views were amazing. Big spacious, clean and modern design. Can not fault the room and very clean bathroom.  Overall very very satisfied with the experience and would definitely go back . ",50
"Miss Tina Yu , the Guest Experience Team manager together with her colleague Angel gave me an unforgettable birthday experience while staying in Grand Hyatt Macau..Tina was very kind, and active to serve us once we arrived at the lobby and sincere to give us welcoming drink and let us rest in the lobby lounge. Very soon, she led us to the room with spectacular beautiful fountain view. Tina and Angel also surprised me and my wife by giving a birthday cake and singing birthday song to me. This was my first time impressive birthday experience to stay in your hotel and I appreciate your hotel arrangement and deeply impressed with your excellent service by Tina. Thank you.  ",50
"A colleague and I stayed at the Grand Hyatt Macau for two nights on two separate non smoking floors. Both of these designated floors reeked of cigarette smoke. The smell was so strong in the bedroom of my suite, the unworn clothes I unpacked from my suitcase when I got home to Sydney, smelled of smoke.   Check in was ridiculously slow. Not sure what the check in agent was looking at on her screen but from the time we handed over the credit card,  it took a good 10 minutes to be given the key.   We asked the concierge, who was a Clef D’or member, for dining options but he really had difficulty following our requests. Not a language barrier, just disinterested in listening.   On the plus side, the position is excellent, the views of the Wynn fountains appealing and the staff are…",30
"I visit Macau once a year for a family holiday. Compared to my previous stays in JW Marriot, Venetian etc etc This is the worst hotel stay ever! Late check out was none and you can see there was no effort to even arrange it! We even received a call to rush us to check out at 11am even though they told us we can delayed to 12pm! Which shows that whatever said on the day of check in was not important. Regretted staying there as we had booked 3 rooms and was not possible to put us on the same level and this is the first time it has happened! Anyway lots to rant! will never be back here!",10
"Came to attend an event, and I needed to iron my shirt.  They don't have a dedicated line to housekeeping, so I called guest services to ask for one.  No sign of it.  Called 15 minutes later to chase, and still no sign of it for another 20-25 minutes.  I finally gave up and tried to hide my wrinkled shirt under my jacket.  When I returned to my room several hours later, I did find an iron and board in the room, but it was too late.  My friend also mentioned to me that it took them 1 hour to deliver an iron to his room.  Otherwise the room was fine.  The bathroom was done in an open style, but there are two large floor-to-ceiling wooden panels that could completely close off the bathroom.  The shower and bathtub came in one glass enclosure, which was not ideal.",30
"Stayed in the Macau Grand Hyatt on a Saturday night with family.  Check in service is efficient and welcoming.  Staff well trained to complete the service within expected short time.    Guest room deco well maintained, spacious bathroom with quality amenities.  Tap and shower work well no signs of tiredness.  Hotel has restaurants of buffet style, Chinese and cafe.  The grand lobby with the silvery fountain is an all time classic.    ",40
"Room is plain and comfortable as long as you don't mind the water fountain noise from Wynn.  Restaurant is a big issue, there is only one buffet and Chinese restaurant.  Buffett is always fully booked.  Breakfast only starts at 7:30.  My God...",30
"BEST and most RELIABLE hotel in Macau, no doubt!24 hour concierge team always available for you. Strong water pressure in shower. Wide selection of TV channels compared to other 5star hotels. You will be pampered by great service. ",50
"one of the high end hotel located at Cotai it was in the middle of City of Dream, so make sure you get off the shuttle bus in right station. a bit expensive for booking Grand suite but i got an upgrade room with better view which we can enjoy Wynn's fountain, so nice. Room is huge for ",50
"I stayed at many Macau hotels and the Grand Hyatt is, by far, my favorite.  It is convenient in every way and the service is excellent.  Access to the front entrance is less than a minute from the elevator.  I will stay here next time.",50
"I were celebrating my boyfriend’s birthday last week in Grand Hyatt Macau and i bought the accommodation with house of dancing water water package.  Not to be bloated, the major reason i choose Macau was because I had been longing to watch the water show since I was small and heard of much good review about it. While Grand Hyatt is a hotel brand I’d like to try and it’s also quite high rated in travel websites. However, the whole Hyatt hotel and entertainment experience from City of Dream were a total disappointment.  The check in area was lack of control. Im not sure if he was security of what,but he just stood still even when people queued whenever they like and cut in line. Check in process was relatively slow even after I had done the pre check in online which they sent…",30
"Stayed in this hotel for one night. Booked a deluxe room and got a free upgrade to a nice suit. The room was very clean and comfortable with a great view. The hotel is located near huge shopping center and casino.  The only complaint I have is the poor check in experience. The room supposed to be ready at 15:00, however apparently the cleaning was not completed and finally receive the room around 16:00. ",40
"First things I didn’t like it was on the check in. I red a lot of hotel’s reviews when receptionists offering upgrade the room for free, and in my experience in the past was many times the same . But this time it was not free , I pay extra just because it was little bit earlier check in time and offered suit was available. Another things which made the night of my staying hard it was  finished exactly in this days a medicine for headache which usually provide concierge service. On that moment my wife’s headache   was really strong. Concierge initially offered to me go to pharmacy by my self , but I didn’t, after arguing that it is their responsibility keep their stuff replenished 24 hours they send somebody for buying medicine. It took a time off course, but my wife continued…",10
"Close to the heart of the casinos area but without any gambling around the hotel! Beautiful hotel with a fantastic outdoor swimming pool, Olympic size and just amazing beautiful. Very clean and spacious suite as a free upgrade every time i came there as a Globalist member.",50
"High standard as expected. We were staying in the executive suites and good attention to detail. Breakfast is great - good range of eastern and western options. Gym and pools are spacious and well looked after.   Super well located. Opposite to the mini sky tram. Wonderful view.  While the hotel is right above the shopping malls and the casino Ike most Macau hotels these facilities are not as in your face as some others.   They are done with more taste if at all possible - at least to us as we came to Macau not for the casinos, but the new bridge from Hong Kong and the food.",40
"The Hotel Personnel, Specially Kar Fai, made the 3 days in Macau for my family a particularly enjoyable experience.the hotel staff made all the necessary accomodations to make us feel at home. The hotel rooms, location and activities also are part of the excellent experience we had",50
We stayed to celebrate my girlfriends birthday. The staff were really friendly and Angel made our experience extra special. The room was great and the facilities were great including the pool and spa which had amazing views. ,50
Concierge can be better. The shower room need a close door. The hotel is beatiful with good restaurant and store. I prefer private restaurant. The open restaurant do not has glamour. Need better concierge. Very bad concierge attendance girl.,50
"I booked this room for our 22 anniversary on Oct. 22nd. We got a room on the 7th floor with a water fountain view right across Wynn hotel. The show in the evening was amazing! The hotel room was definitely one of the best that we have experienced. We had a wonderful and memorable celebration in Macau, thanks to all the staff of Grand Hyatt Macau!",50
"Staying with family in Grand Hyatt was incredibly amazing and special thanks to the staff, Ean for the service!  The room was wonderful and the view from the room was interesting as well.  Room service food was valuable and fantastic!! I may come back just because of it! I absolutely loved it!! We enjoyed alot!",50
"This review is based on a one night stay in a King Deluxe Room.  The Grand Hyatt is part of the City of Dreams development featuring multiple hotels (including the impressive Morpheus designed by late Zaha Hadid) and a nicely designed luxury shopping mall, and is in walking distance to the Venetian (and the Cotai Arena).   We selected the hotel partly due to the fact that is not a thematic or overly plush hotel with outrageous interiors that are unfortunately common in Macau but rather features a contemporary decor. While well-maintained, the interior is somewhat bland, generic and in need of an update. It definitely does not do justice to it's official 5-star rating and is more reminiscent of a 4-star, upper mid-range hotel. There's simply nothing luxurious about the property. …",20
"Great Hotel, good location. Fantastic rooms and friendly and attentive service. We were there for a cencert and just to relax and enjoy Macau for a weekend. Defenately recommend this to anyone who enjoys luxuary at a good proce.",50
"Stayed there with my close friends for 2 nights.  The hotel is at a great location and accessibility to many interesting areas.  Hotel is very clean, beautiful and well maintained.  Ms. Chua Thin Thin was very kind in granting 2 of my members club access.  Mr. Randy Wong was extremely helpful in ensuring that our entire vacation was well organised.  He is such asset to the hotel.  The club floor staff are very helpful and smile readily even they are so busy.   Housekeeping staff here are one of the best in Asia.  Even better than Grand Hyatt HK.  They clean the room with great care.  They are meticulous and all small details are not spared.   The club floor Chef should smile a little more.",40
"Hotel staff are very nice service with a smile, most specially to Customer service officer, Jack Wu who check us in when there is a long queue. He was very Helpfuly and accommodating. He recommended the schedule and the way to enjoy all the facilities in the hotel. We will visit and stay in the Grand Hyatt Macau again in the future because of the excellent service provided by Jack.",50
"My wife and I chose to stay at the Grand Club and we were so happy we did. The staff went out of their way to ensure we were comfortable, taking care of our every request and need. The all day refreshments and finger food with evening cocktails were superb.  Our room was huge and we were rapt with the full size tub, although we had to ask for bath salts since they weren't provided.",50
"Received a free upgrade to a Grand King Suite, it's quite ""small"" comparing to a standard suite you will get in the Cotai area.  I traveled with 2 kids, so I am still very grateful anyway!  Enjoyed - the charging cables provided for guests, the little clock inside the bathroom sink area, the impressive room service (quite a diverse menu, 24-hr available), staff are very helpful, lovely view from both sitting room and bedroom.  Coffee machine & the chinese tea are impressive!    Fall short - front desk, I used the app to do a check in, by 17.55, there are no sign of my room being ready, though I did tell them I will arrive 19.30-ish.  Since there are quite some review saying the room is not ready at check-in, I fear it it would be my case too.  When I made reservation, I asked…",40
"Took a last minute weekend away from Hong Kong and stayed in the Hyatt. Got a reasonable deal on a suite and was upgraded to a nicer one. Room was large, light, bright and furnished nicely. Also was a corner room overlooking both the fountain and the pool so great all round.  Check in was fine, good service at the pool. Enjoyed the hot tubs whilst watching some motor racing, all very nice.   Location is obviously good, in the City of dreams and very close to the new MGM and Wynn Palace as well as the Sands strip.   Would be perfect and 5 stars if it wasn’t for breakfast. It was like turning up at a 3 star hotel of a sudden. The place is busy, having to queue, then finally getting a table with no table settings. Service poor, food offering poor, wait times high even inside when…",40
"Excellent service by Tina. My check in was greeted by Tina and escorted me to the room.  She introduced all room facilities to me  and assisted me to book Mezza 9 which I previous booked but on waiting list. Never disappointed my birthday trip. The room was great, not sure if  I got the upgrade. I enjoyed the long sofa, the bathtub with nice view, and especially the water pressure. We included the buffet breakfast in my room package. The quality is good, not plenty of variety but good enough for us. Their dinner buffet we have tried last time In few months ago however seemed more variety than this time, especially the vegetable counter, perhaps the seasonal reason... The last but not the least, thank you Tina and Angel to celebrate my birthday by sending the cake to my room. I…",50
"This time just stay for one night with my friend in a grand twin suite. First of all, I think the size of this suite a little bit smaller than other hotels' suite but overall this suite is well-decorated and well-cleaned. I wanna shout out of the staff from the guest experience team - Tina Yu. She was taking good care of my stay, she prepared a birthday cake and birthday card  for my friend's birthday. Moreover, she will message me  once the room ready to make sure I can get the room as soon possible. Lastly, she greeted me after check out to make sure everything of my stay are satisfied. Overall, a nice stay the Grand Hyatt Macau this time and very happy that Tina was taking care for my stay. Definitely, will come back next time when I visit Macau again.  ",50
I had a room with a view of the fountain which was fantastic. The highlight of the stay was the grand club lounge. The selection and quality of the food and drinks was fantastic from breakfast to afternoon tea to dinner cocktails.  However the X factor was the service level from the team members of the lounge. Special thanks to randy ，Karl and Yan.,50

The room was spacious, clean and modern with a stunning view! and love the Aromatherapy Associate brand amenities. Location is perfect and accessible.  Mezza9 staff are great as well.  After a long day, massage from Isala spa is heaven.  Hope to be back when we visit Macau.",50
"Everything about the atmosphere in Macau is electric beginning with my arrival to Grand Hyatt Macau. Received warmly by Mr Sigit who unloaded my luggage but my room was not ready. Mr Sigit did the most by safekeeping my luggage and later sent it to my room when it was ready. Thank you for your attention, Mr Sigit, I could not say more. The location of Grand Hyatt is mostly strategic as it was nestled in walking distances to most casinos, hotels, shopping areas and tourist destinations. Huge room, bigger bathroom! Highly comfortable bed and sound proof room (almost late for my meeting the next day). Great food served all around. Met Mr Sigit a few more times during the stay and without fail, he provided informational tips around Macau. Also managed to met Mr Randy who happens to…",50
"Hi,   Booked a twin bed room here for my brother and i to stay during the weekend, Hotel was nice enough to upgrade us to a suites - so guys and girls please dont be shy and just ask, you will never know what you will get.   This hotel has the Cubic club in so if your into clubbing location is great.   But casino wasnt good as it never paid me out. Also there are too many takeaways standing right in front of the casino but i guess this is normal, it was just annoying cause it was hard to tell who is approaching you :)",50
"My husband and I stayed at this hotel from 8th September -11 th September 2018,On arrival we were met by Mr Randy who was very welcoming and warm. We walked us to our room which was awesome and  facing the Hotel WYNN and the musical fountain which was breath taking at night. The hotel was tipped by a friend who did the booking that it was our wedding anniversary and so we had a surprise cake sent to the room .Mr Randy advised us on what to see in Macau and we watched the International Fireworks display at the lake by Macau Tower. and also The House of Dancing Water show in Hotel Hyatt which should not be missed., Ms Carmen at the Travel desk needs a mention    Regards Dr & Mrs  V .Thanalingam Malaysia",50

First trip to Macau and we all had a great time. Our rooms were gorgeous. Staff were amazing from the minute we got out of our taxi. Check-in easy and no issues. Buffet breakfasts were amazing. The pool is incredible. All staff so very helpful if we asked something or had to get somewhere. A great trip and lots of happy memories at this hotel. ,50
"We stayed at the Hyatt for 2 nights. Whilst our room was very spacious with a fountain view the atmosphere clinical and utilitarian. The service was general good, but always seemed a bit below what one would expect from a 5 start hotel. Breakfast was average both with regards to the food and service. The Western food selection was very limited and of inconsistent quality.",30
"We love our stay so much, we had a blast with the fountain view room, overall very satisfied about the whole stay at Grand Hyatt Macau. We were welcomed and got detailed information about all the benefits from Grand Hyatt and things we would need during our stay at the hotel and for the trip in Macau. Check in was fast, and the staff are all very friendly and resourceful. Lots of vacation tips they give for Macau first-time tourists. They also have express check out facility so that we can save time not having to queue for checking out.",50
"Stay 2 nights with two little kids in July, 2018. It was a rush trip but we had a great stay here. The staffs (front desk, house-mans) are very polite, friendly and helpful. They greeted us warmly. The room is very clean, modern and spacious. The management team are working efforts to surprise their guests. They surprised me with a warm welcome card and two baggies for kids which I’ve never expected. They extended their cares at the evening to have the turn down service in every room which is wows me. (To be honest, not too many hotels are still doing these things) these little things tells that the hotel do cares about their guests. Please keep them up. I will definitely revisit again. ",50
"Service at this hotel, is comparable to Grand Hyatt's at other regions.  Its very good.  From bellmen to front desk to housekeeping, restaurant (beijing kitchen)everyone made you felt welcome and were more then willing to make your stay memorable.  We were also greeted at check in by the butler, who was very helpful in giving info on the hotel, sights to see, history of the hotel and surrounding hotels, and personally escorted us to the room.  Facilities are well kept, rooms are comfortable and maintained well.  Only advice is that the bathrooms are fairly small (for suite), with bathtub/shower setup needing some improvement.  Small area to shower (next to tub) and with slippery marble type floor.  Grand Hyatt is connected to City of Dreams which I wasn't aware of.  Facilities…",30
"If you want to experience the casino city - that is the place to stay. Also directly connected to the arena of  the ""Dancing Water"" - also a must see!Although there a numerous restaurants around, the evening buffet (tons of live lobster) at the mezza9 in the hotel is unbelievable value for money. (if you can get a table booking...)",50
"We recently stayed at the Grand Hyatt in Macau for 2 days 1 night as a short family weekend getaway. Upon arrival, we were greeted by Tina Yu who not only handled our requests swiftly but reminded us that at this day & age, there is still excellent customer service. I’d say it has been a very long time since I was given such impeccable customer service from check in as well as made our stay very memorable. My mother, in particular was very impressed with her and said that next time we visited Macau, we’ll definitely stay at the Grand Hyatt again. We also visited the infamous buffet restaurant Mezza 9! Fresh selection of seafood where everything is made to order making it a unique experience albeit there’s a bit of a wait. While waiting, we tried other great dishes! The room was…",50
It's always the first priority to stay at the hotel whenever we go to Macau. The hotel is properly maintained and the guests rooms are well designed and equipped. We feel very relax and comfortable everytime we stay there. The quality of food and beverages at the club lounge is excellent. The services of all the staff we encountered are professional. That's why we keep going back for last five to six years.,50
"This is a seafood buffet. The food is very fresh. Guests can choose different kinds of cooking. Besides seafood, there are Japanese cuisine, desserts and so on.  Desserts are delicious too. Service is ok.",40
"We booked King Suite for one night.  I am a Hyatt member and this is the first time I decided to stay at the Grand Hyatt.  We normally stay at one of the Sands Macau hotels (Four Seasons, Parisienne, Conrad, Sheraton or Holiday Inn).  The check in experience at Grand Hyatt is the best we have had in recent years and I would rate better than Four Seasons, Macau.  Tina You, Guest Experience Manager, personally accompanied us to our suite with our welcome drinks and snacks.  The suite itself was spacious, modern and clean.  We will definitely be going back again soon.",50
Booked in for one night and the check in experience was amazing.  We were just there for one night and had Renee assisting us and she couldn't have been more helpful! She gave us a lot of suggestions and tips for a short stay and overall she was friendly! We also had access to the grand club and the spread of food and drinks were decent.  Just that one of the receptionist didn't seem quite friendly.  But overall it was a good stay.,40
"It was really out of my expectation for the average service of the hotel. It has provided sufficient service for me and my family. It was a really unforgettable memory. If i get a chance, i would like to stay in this hotel again.",50

"I would like to thank Renee Diep & Jack Wu for arranging a pleasurable and memorable birthday celebration for my daughter's birthday. My daughter felt so touched with birthday cake, song and the paper crown. We stayed here 2 times and the room is cozy and spacious. My room was facing Wynn Palace and the fountain show was great. Mezza 9 dinner buffet is very good with wide range of seafoods with different cooking method. The swimming pool and the fitness center are big and nice.  I will definitely recommend this hotel to others.",50
Spacious room with full amenities and excellent services! Should not miss the buffet dinner at Mezza 9. Staffs are friendly. Special thanks to concierge Sigit who is super nice and helpful! The hotel is located in City of Dream which is away from the busy Galaxy /Venetian which is fewer shops and restaurants. It's more quiet and relaxing. We had a wonderful time with 2 young kids! Can't wait to have at another holiday at Grand Hyatt again!,50

"Grand Hyatt Macau is one of the first few entrants to the luxury hotel scene in Macau. I have stayed with the Grand Hyatt Macau each time I am in the city. What sets it apart from the other current and new entrants to the 5* & luxury hotel scene is how well the hotel looks after its guests & what it does to give back to the community.  As a regular guest at the Grand Hyatt Macau, not only does the team remember my preferences well, they take every effort to look after my family’s needs. In particular, Marc Hong leads a very well trained and disciplined team as the director of rooms. Marc is exemplary as a leader and as a key member of the Grand Hyatt Macau management team.

The hotel is part of the City of Dreams complex which is connected to the casino, food court, shopping area, and other hotels.  It is also within walking distance to nearby hotels such as Venetian, Galaxy, and Paris.  Great experience and highly recommended!",50
"I trusted the Hyatt brand and have used Hyatt hotels in the past. I had been really pleased with their service in the past, hence I chose a Grand King Suite at this hotel for my friend's birthday trip in Macau.   Our experience here started with placing our baggage in storage before our check-in time. The staff at the luggage storage desk were helpful and swift. At 2:30pm we came back to check in, the process was slow. I mentioned this was for my friend's birthday so we just hoped to check in smoothly, especially as the swimming pool which we planned to visit was already closed due to a typhoon. The receptionist did not seem to acknowledge what I said, it felt strange as if she was just telling me everything she had to tell me, instead of having a two-way conversation.…",30
"It took a while to check in and even then we didn’t get the rooms ready until after 2pm. But the staff and especially Randy Wong made it less exhausting as we were a party of 12 with 5 kids and grandparents!  He helped us in whichever way he could do the 30mins wait didn’t feel too long. He even managed to get us a 7 seater taxi van where it’s impossible to call for one on the telephone. The overall experience was good as the brand stands for quality but I emphasis in service and team work. From the concierge to the Beijing restaurant, the staff are willing and able to attend to your needs. I can recommend Grand Hyatt Macao to my friends and family without hesitation. ",50

"I had a wonderful stay at the Grand Hyatt Macau. The hotel has a lovely swimming pool and there were also splash pools for the kids and plenty of hot tubs for the adults. One of my favourite things to do there was to sit in the hot tub in the late evening with a cool drink and just soak in the views.  I stayed in the Grand Suite and had Grand Club access, which I used a lot during my stay as I had to do some work during the day and they had really fast wifi, loads of things to nibble on and drink throughout the day. I tried both the hotel breakfast at Mezza 9 and the one served at the Grand Club. Mezza 9 had a great selection that changed daily, and the food was lovely.

We were given local sweets to enjoy while we were being registered. When we said we were at the hotel to celebrate an anniversary, we were offered sparkling wine to enjoy in the room. * Our room (1677 - at the end of a hall) was perfectly situated for amazing views:  towards Cotai Strip from the ""living room"" and bedroom and over the ferry and airport from the shower and bath room.   * The room - actually 2 rooms but not separated by doors - was huge.  The living room features a large wrap-around couch and a couple of chairs.  There's plenty of room for friends to visit if they're in different rooms.   * The bed was one of…",50
"I have booked a room with grand club access for this visit. I did not know in advance that there are two buildings for Grand Hyatt Macau and one is only for club members (including the VIP guests from casino). Club lounge is on the top floor of the club building on 37/F. It includes the dining area, meeting room and an outdoor zone. The view is great overlooking the Cotai hotels/Macau airport. The room I got is spacious.  I would like to compliment Phoenix and her team, especially Judy and Karl who provided excellent service. They could always recognize and address me with my surname. They came to me constantly to see if I needed any help.  The only problem with my stay was about ambience of the club lounge. I expected to have a quiet area to sit down and relax, but turned out…",40
"As usual, the service at Grand Hyatt was good. Check in was efficient and male staff was friendly. TV was not working well, technician went up quickly and had that fixed. Unfortunately, it happened again and again. Didnt really need the TV so that was fine for me. Check out was ok. Lobby lounge served nice drinks and snacks. Overall, no complaint GH experience but no surprise.",40
"We had a lovely stay at Grand Hyatt on their Grand Packge which includes a Dinner Buffet, Breakfast Buffet, and Minibar. The dinner buffet is a must-go item for seafood/lobster lover! The location provides good access to city of dream where the House of Dancing Water is showing. The room is spacious which is good for a family with 2 kids. The toiletries is aromatherapy which add extra delights to the stay! Thank you for Customer Experience Staff Angel who provided a pleasant check-in service to delight us! She had thoroughly introduced the facilities and the hotel which was very informative.",50
"Grand Hyatts around the world are best known for its elegant luxury but unfortunately the Grand Hyatt Macau is not one of them.  I took a Grand Deluxe Suite, which was the second suite I had taken at the GH within a month – the previous one being a Grand Suite King - so I would write this review based on the Grand Deluxe Suite.  The Grand Deluxe suite had a grand sounding name but at about 700 sq.ft. it was one of the smaller “suites” I have stayed in. I could accept that - the GH HK has suites of 650 sq.ft. as well. But in terms of amenities it certainly did not live up to the name “grand”.  Check in was disappointing. It was a large hotel - officially with 791 rooms & suites -  and in early July on a weekday before the school holidays I somehow find it difficult to believe…",20
"A trusted hotel brand indeed! Grand Hyatt Macau provided an awesome experience for me and my family. Staff were friendly, attentive, helpful, informative, alert and they take initiative to check on us during our stay. Hotel rooms we stayed in were spacious, clean and well-provided. Our toddler's needs were taken care of when we informed that we have a toddler with us prior to our arrival. My family members were definitely impressed by my choice in choosing this hotel. Well done and keep it up!",50
"We came to spend two nights in Grand Hyatt - Grand Club Tower, and watched The house of dancing water. I thought it was quite pricy at first but it well worth it. The theatre design is absolute Fab!   The room size is good, swimming pool is very good too.  The room service is good and quality food. Their bed turn down service also done in decent manner!   I got to mention Mr Sigti from Indonesia in concierge ( I hope I spell the name right), he gave top service and ensure we have hassle free afternoon after check out.  Great service overall.  Just this little details and friendly staff worth going back. ",50
"We enjoyed our stay at this Grand Hyatt. Top notch service and gorgeous facilities.   We appreciated the status recognition here. We were upgraded to a lovely suite and received a bottle of wine, macaroons, and a cake. The lounge in particular is stunning and the food selection was some of the best we’ve seen in a lounge in Asia (amongst Hyatt, SPG, Marriott).   Special shout out to Randy - he made us feel at home and gave us lots of useful info about Macau. We’d come back just to chat with him again! ",50
"I booked a suite with requested on non smoking floor area, the hotel arranged me the room i requested but somehow the smell from cigarette is there and it's everywhere even in the bed sheets and pillows and blanket. The smell got stronger overnight. not sure if it is because of the ventilation or something but if you build the non smoking floor with non smoking room.  you should have find the way to protect it from anywhere. ",30
"I booked the room for me and my 12 year old daughter with breakfast included, but at checking in I was informed that only one breakfast was included. I was surprised to hear that so I purchased another breakfast for my daughter for the next morning!   Later on I checked my reservation and very clearly said breakfast included per person. I said I will let them know at check out!   The next morning at breakfast, there was a sign at the entrance that said: “kids 6-12 years old pay 1/2 price. When we went to do the check out, I showed to your staff my reservation and details and she said: “you only listed one adult in the reservation, therefore only one breakfast is included”. I told the girl, what do you mean, it very clear that here in the confirmation of my reservation it said:…",30
I have stayed in this hotel at least five times. The service improve a lot compared with few years ago. Thanks for the front desk staff. They are always helpful and polite.(much better than few years ago),50
"I stayed with my wife and two kids in a twin room. The room was extremely nice with two special double beds (good enough for an adult and small child) and there was also a large sofa which could easily become a make shift bed as well for a child.   The bathroom is large with a bathtub and rain shower (sharing the same space).   This room is great for families but. It good for two friends thinking of sharing a room as although there is a blind you can put down between the bathtub and bedroom, there is still potential to see each other even without going into the bathroom section.   Overall the room is fantastic, well kept and modern with good amenities inside.   TV channels are lacking a bit on the English side with just a few discovery channel ones and English news. Surprisingly…",50
"Great stay in the grand Hyatt for 1 Night only unfortunatly. The hôtel is so Nice with the wonderful lobby, the room is spacious, clean, with exceptional view on the macau skyline and the bathroom is just magical with a rain shower and XL bath in front of the view.  We loved the big swimming pool very clean and quiet and the outdoor hot tubes to relax in private atmosphere.  Special thanks to Randy at reception who made everything to make our stay even better.  We will definitely come back",50
"The hotel reception and Housekeeping are very polite and helpful. The restaurant food are acceptable with the price range hotel charge. Overall I like this hotel, worth for money and highly recommend. Thanks. ",50
"Had a wonderful stay at the Grand Hyatt Macau, originally only booked 2 nights, but end up staying a 3rd night.  I want to acknowledge great check-in process by Sky.  A warm welcome and nice gesture (champagne and macaroons) from Randy Wong -the butler, for our special occasion. He even helped us expedite our extra day check in process which was smooth and wonderful.  Also, the housekeeping Rodi was also great.  Amenities replenished and the room looked new all the time.  Nevertheless want to acknowledge the great pool staff.  They were very nice and always attentive.  One of the better stays in Macau, felt like being at home. The room was very nice, clean, comfortable, modern.  I had a good relaxing time.  Thanks for the hospitality.",50

"If u’re gonna spent an awful lot of money after tracking in China, Grand Hyatt Macau might be the place. We booked two rooms in the Grand Club. This is the executive option with access to lounge with all the club-offers: free (and very, very good food), drinks and so on... Service up there is great. Really! And butler Randy stands out:-) But have to mention: Checkin was delayed with two hours, and thats absolutely not up to standard.  Otherwise: More than happy! Rooms are spacious, bathrooms impressive, service great.  Thanks for a great stay - might be back:-) ",50
A short trip with my girlfriend celebrating my birthday. Appreciation for the Reservation team who contacted us in advance re-confirming the booking details.

This time again stay at this hotel. But I feel so warm by guest experience team. I would like say thanks for Jack Wu hospitality. He made my so warm and care. This time, I travel with my wife. Jack saw my wife is pregnant. He gave us two bottle of water and some Portuguese egg tart for us. And he don’t want wait us waiting until 3 pm. He arranged the room immediately.

"An amazing hotel with excellent facilities. However, the shower area is very strange. A luxury bathtub and shower area in the same large enclosure about 9 sq m. For those that prefer taking a shower, the entire enclosed area, including the bathtub is wet😆My first experience, besides some hotels in India with this kind of set up.  The rest of the area, including the bedroom is really luxurious. ",50

I have stayed in JW Macau, Four Seasons Macau,  Banyan Tree macua, Ritz-Cartlon Macau and sevral times in Grand Hyatt Macau before, quite frankly, for this recent stay experience, I can feel Grand Hyatt Macau which is different from my previous stays and gave me wonderful impression in every aspect especially the intimate service from Tina and Randy. Now I can say Grand Hyatt Macau not only the best hotel in Macau but also the best hotel around the world in my mind. I are always impressed by the quality of sevices and staff of  Grand Hyatt Macau and it has never made me disappointed.   ",50
"Last time we stayed at Grand Hyatt Macau already 7 years ago.  We always wanted to stay in this hotel, but it was always very full so every time we had to choose another hotel to stay... Fortunately, we managed to book Grand Hyatt Macau during our visit last weekend and it was a wonderful stay!  Special thanks to the Guest Service Staff: Tina & Jack, they extended their great service and took great care of me and my family, from elderly to the kids, starting from the time we check in until we check out... It was the best hotel service we have ever had.    The location of the hotel is excellent, it is just next to the new hotel Wynn Palace and MGM Cotai, with just less than 3 minutes walk.    The Mezza 9 buffet dinner was excellent, with great selection of food and the taste was…",50

"Irene, Tina, and the entire team at the Grand Hyatt made our stay a very special one. Fantastic rooms, wonderful views, and incredibly helpful staff from the moment you step out of your taxi/shuttle bus. My dad tried the pool and loved it. We arrived back one evening to lovely sounds of traditional Chinese music being played in the lobby as well.  If you're going for the House of Dancing Water show, don't bother staying anywhere else. Even if you're not, the Grand Hyatt deserves your patronage!",50
"Grand Hyatt Hotel Macau is one of the best hotel to stay, The room and design luxurious, many great restaurant and store. They have a Attraction Show also . Access to go very easy and in the strategic location. ",50
"Stopped here for 1 night, hotel was really nice, the room was spacious with large widows which made for great views of Macau and a very relaxing stay. The whole city of dreams area was rather impressive. We did have an issue with regards to the cash deposit, as a friend who checked us in paid it, but did not stay so at checkout we was unable to get the $1,000HKD back. I understand the security of it but still a pain regardless and it then left us with $1,000 shortfall for the rest of our holiday in Hong Kong. I can’t write a review about the Grand Hyatt without talking and pointing out a Gem they have in a member of staff, I hope I have his name correctly but Randi a concierge is without a doubt the most friendly and helpful guy in Macau, he was speaking to my friends when I…",40
"I made the right choice again! The lobby design was very welcoming. The check-in and check-out process were very efficebt. The concierge was very helpful and nice, and great restaurant recommendations from them. My room was very big and with a great city view. Will definitely come back for more!",50
"This is the fourth time we visit Grand Hyatt Macau.  Their guest experience team gives the utmost care to the customer. All customer's habits will be saved in their database and they will help to arrange everything you want.  Highly recommend Mezza 9 (seafood buffet) but it needs to book as early as possible, or you may book their hotel package to enjoy the buffet dinner. The room service is also good.  The view of the room is great and you can see the fountain performance from Wynn.  I should say Grand Hyatt is the best hotel in Macau!  ",50
"room is bigger than expected with good condition.  Mezza 9 dinner buffet is very good, wide-range of seafood you can choose with different cooking method. all staff are provide excellent service and very helpful.

"Love everything about this hotel! Hospitality, flexibility and proactiveness of staff (which I haven't experienced for a long time), wonderful facilities to the finest details. Very customer oriented (but I just hope not many troublesome people take advantage of that). What more can I ask for? We will be back!",50
"I trust Hyatt brand and being and Hyatt member, I always tried to book on line directly via Hotel site in order to gain special welcome. We were warmly welcome by Hotel staff and the whole stay was seamless.",50
"I have been stay so many Hyatt brand in different city, Macau one was not the one I prefer, the stuff service was ok, but the room conditions was not that good. Like The aircon was very hot even though I make it very low temperature. I hope it can make it better and looking forward to you see next time .",20
"I would love to visit again for my next trip. The suit room is in good condition, and the staff are very helpful in introducing fhe toursit spot. Location is good, and my kid love the robot dancing very much. The seafood buffet is the best in the town.",50
"Stayed put at this hotel for 3 days, and was a wonderful experience, staff is extremely courteous, went for the breakfast on the 32nd floor on Day 1, and the staff walked us through the spread, considering that we were vegetarians, happily offered us stuff, a happy moment I must say.  A very well organised conference was complimented by exceptional service from the Hotel. The casino out here is far better than others that I saw, less crowded and more than eager staff to offer comfort.  The house keeping staff Mary on my floor which was 20th needs a special mention, an ever smiling lady doing her chores without any fuss.  Will return for sure. Thank you.",50
"Visited Macau on a business trip in April and stayed at the a grand Hyatt for 3 nights. This was my first visit to Macau, and must say the city is pretty organized. They have shuttle busses that run every 15 minutes from the airport or ferry terminal to the hotels. Grand Hyatt is located in the City of dreams and has one of the largest casinos housed below. Coming to the room, it was a suite with a large living room and a bed room. The food could have been better with some more western food options. The views from the rooms were fantastic - the dancing fountains and the Macau airport in sight. Great stay and hopefully will come back for more gambling! ",40
"Macau is famous for casinos and those hotels are really dramatic. GH Macau keeps everything as it should be, which I think it is good. It gives me some pure and light feeling. The room is big, comparing with the hotels in HK. The most amazing place is the lounge. It’s a must be place when you stay in this hotel. It is like a big living room of a modern apartment. Everything is exquisite and elegant. The Happy Hour is really well treated with very nice food and beverages. And the staff there are also very nice and warm. Like Judy, Diana and Chloe, they did give me a deep impression during my stay and make me wanna be back again!",50
"Like the room very much, exceptional services, and here would like to give a big thumb up to Renee Diep, she has made our stay all the way from check-in, during the stay and to departure very welcoming.",50
"Stayed at Grand Hyatt for a brief but very pleasant stay. The hotel is excellently maintained and the beds are superb.  Having stayed at many hotels in Macau , I can honestly say that this is the first Macau experience where the staff have been up to standards the way they are in Hong Kong or Singapore 5 star properties.  A special mention goes out to the concierge desk, and Carmen. Who were extremely helpful in assisting me with some business. Highly recommend for business travelers and couples. Excellent ",50
"Our family are very satisfied with the Hyatt service, especially Miss Renee Diep who treats us as her family, we had great conversation by many different languages, English, Cantonese, Mandarin and Vietnamese. She brought to us a feeling of comfortable. My parents will be back Grand Hyatt Macau as soon as possible for their holiday. cantonese Because of my Explorist membership, I received good benefits such as, large roon with great view which directly watch the dancing water in Wynn Place, check out late untill 3pm, special fruits and water bottles in room. Grand Hyatt Macau service is great. We will be back.",50
"This is the first time to stay in Grand Hyatt, it was great that I received the call from their staff and let me know the arrangement without further request.  When We arrived around 9:30am to this hotel, they try their best to arrange the room for us earlier.  They are very responsive when check in.  I would like to special thanks to the staffs at swimming pool, they try their best to help out and provide some hot water when my daughter was vomited. The best services and the room maintenance is very good.  Just one thing I felt not perfect enough is when I walked out the elevator at ground floor, I saw two to three tourist they walked in and smoking at the elevator. The cigarette almost hit my daughter face.  Otherwise it was a perfect trip to our family.  ",50

"As i am not for casino in macau, i merely enjoy hotel facilities and services. GH macau is in city of dreams where the centrally located next to Wynn palace, venetian, cotai sand and mgm cotai.   The hotel restaurant has been famous of the buffet offered. We tried and the food is really good. But staff is not attentive and sincere. The Filipino manager seems not helpful with collecting dishes while he is just walking around chatting with guest. And the chef in dessert counter is playing with mobile phone - not professional and not hyatt standard, i think.  The room is spacious with a large sleeping sofa. The overall environment is so homey that lacks the sense of luxury, on the other hand you may say they are subtle and down to earth. However, the bed is so hard that is the…",30

Since we arrived early and the room was not available, Angel was proactively helped us to book the restaurants for lunch and dinner and explained clearly to us about the transportation arrangement and sightseeing spots. She also help us to take a photo and gave us as souvenirs.  Not only Angel, All the staff at the front desk were helpful and cheerful.

"I always favour Hyatt as a Hotel brand but will definitely have a second thought after our poor experience with Grand Hyatt Macau.   I have stayed with the hotel for one night with my husband have a relaxing evening. However, this turned out to be a total disaster!   Everything was fine when we first arrived. The main issue was with the lobby reception - Instead of a warm welcome, I encountered a very bad attitude staff Danielle who was terribly rude. She could not find our room (or name) in their system and since, have dealt the issue with extreme bad manner! I have then asked to deal with his management and obviously it turned out to be a mistake from their end! Even then, I did not receive any apology from Danielle!  Next morning at the lobby was again disappointing. There…",10
"We totally loved our stay.  We booked  through the hotel website 'Grand Offer' -which includes a fountain view room, buffet for 2 at Mezza9 and breakfast for 2.  A very good deal.   The room is spacious, luxurious, tasteful and immaculately clean, with a huge luxurious bathroom- this low-key luxury is quite distinctive from all the casino hotels.    The fountain view is brilliant - I was quite surprised to find myself impressed with the fountain show, which is beautiful and vast in scale.  Service was oustanding from checkin to restaurant buffet. But the cooks behind the food counters were not so friendly.  The buffet was amazing in quality and choice.",50
"Extraordinary experience created by the Guest relation team.  During check in process, they are aware of my birthday celebration in Macau, staff from guest relation, Jack offered us juices upon arrival and a small souvenir. Then he took us to our room and gave us a detail intro to the room facilities. After that Angel came in and surprised us with a birthday cake! We also received a complimentary birthday cake from Room service as well (super rich and nice chocolate brownie!).  So good to know that the hotel offers free sauna for all guests. However I chose to stay in and enjoy the lovely bathtub with view. It's weird to find out they do not provide bath salt in the room, I have to call the room service to deliver it. We went down to mezza 9 for dinner. Jack was waiting for us…",50
Grand Hyatt is unusual for a Cotai Strip hotel as it has no casino no shopping area. Majestic entrance lobby with really high ceilings and tasteful interior decorations which are simple yet tasteful. A good 5 star hotel slightly away from the tourist crowds ,30
"Truly as one of the best hotel I ever visited, especially the excellent, sincere and warmhearted services from Ms Tina Yu and Ms Cindy Shi from the front desk, and also Ms Nicole from Mezz9.  Also, the buffet dinner in Mezz9 is excellent and very great too. ",50
"It was a great getaway at Grand Hyatt Macau, the room was great as I got a free upgrade, I was amazed by the dinning experience (mezza9 and room service breakfast) I would love to go again. I only encounter a minor problem with the shower, I didn't change my room as it was too late but I am sure they would get my room change if I did request",40
"The room was very clean and tidy and the staff were friendly and professional. I’m highly recommend you choose Grand Hyatt Macau if you want to enjoy the special hospitality for celebration. This time I requested a special hospitality for my birthday celebration trip . I appreciated they offered me a surprise cake and warming service for me. However, It was such a great accommodation experience!",50
"Excellent quality in term of location,property, amenities, and most of all, the attentive service of the personnel. The installation of the Guest Experience Team is a fantastic addition to the very good guest service package.",50
"This was my first visit to the grand Hyatt Macau and I am sure I will be back soon. As a Hyatt member I was happy my loyalty was recognized. Customer relation manager Tina Yu was well prepared for my visit and she briefly introduced Macau and the places to visit. She was very friendly and professional, will make you feel welcome. I wish all the Hyatt hotels in Asia has a service like this. Rooms are “grand” and modern, the only disadvantage I see is that the windows cannot be opened.",50
"Everything is excellent, from the call centre to check in and check out process. Even the restaurant personnel at mezza9 are so helpful and courteous. Definitely a pleasure trip. Thumbs up. Recommend to all.",50
"I have been to other Grand Hyatt overseas, and this Grand Hyatt Macau has far exceeded our expectation. The superb services & excellent hospitality of your hotel have made our trip exceedingly comfortable and enjoyable. We stayed in a suite for 2days, and had our dinner buffet at its well-known Mazza9 which I have no reservations to recommend anyone who is looking for high quality food and delicacies.   The staffs are helpful and caring. I would like to particularly commend the heartwarming hospitality and meticulous arrangements offered by Ms. Tina Yu, your Customer Service Ambassador.

"We visited in December and thoroughly enjoyed the hotel. Our room was wonderful! We also received some of the most outstanding service we have encountered in any of our travels. Unfortunately, we did not grab the names/business cards from everyone we encountered.

Wonderful suite with excellent service & food. Also offered was a discount on the dinner in the restaurant in the hotel; we had fantastic white & red wine with sensational filet mignon; just can recommend to stay there!,50
"The staffs are helpful and very kind. The food on mazza9 is very delicious and u can understand why mazza9 is famous and popular in Macau. We stayed in the suite with the fountain view which is amazing cause the View are gorgeous. The room we stayed is big and comfortable but we smell sth like burning faux paper in the morning. Overall, it is a nice hotel and u won’t regret it if u choose it to be your home in Macau ",40
"I used to stay at the Grand Hyatt Macau a lot when it was first opened, but with the opening of more and more luxury hotels in Macau in recent years, I have not returned for some time.  This time we purchased the Grand Offer package with room and dinner buffet.  I must say both the hotel and the buffet were up to our expectations.  A true 5-star experience.  The staff were responsive and helpful  right from the beginning, when I communicated with them via email.  Upon check in, they were very welcoming, especially Cindy the assistant manager who offered personal attention to guests.  Food at the dinner buffet was abundant with a large variety and high quality.  The  hotel was well kept and could stand up to the challenge of the new hotels. Very spacious rooms. ",50
"We were there for my husband’s birthday celebration from Jan12-13.   It was my second visit at the hotel and I had also experienced the same hotel chain in other countries.  However, this was my first time having a dedicated guest ambassador to introduce the overall hotel facilities.  We started off with a warm welcome by Angel and followed by a very comprehensive room tour.  Angel had been very polite and helpful during our stay.   We are impressed with her enthusiastic with positive attitude for her job. The overall guest experience is way beyond standard and all staff are friendly, cheerful and approachable from front staff to room service.  We had an enjoyable stay and truly feel like Home.",50

"Grand Hyatt will most definitely one of the reasons my stay in Macau will be memorable! From the time we got there - even before checking into the room, to the time we wen back to collect the luggage (after check out) we felt like the staff went out of their way to make us feel like we were super important to them. The food was excellent - spoilt for choice in the best possible way! Chef in the Club Lounge (Thai lady - forgot her name- sorry!) is the sweetest person ever and delivered customised meals to our table every time we showed up! Tina and Renee in particular were extremely pleasant and helpful! Thank you you guys :)  The location is perfect - next to the City Of Dreams (=the House Of Dancing Water is easily accessible!) right opposite the amazing fountain show at Wynn…",50

"I did not visit Macau for 5 years since I attended the Grand Prix weekend in 2012, now I come here for the Grand Prix again. This time I decided to stay in Grand Hyatt because of many positive reviews from different channels.   What is more, they are offering a ""Grand Package"" which includes a lot of things: free breakfast, 4 items for laundry per day, free minibar (except liquor) and a reserved place for the famous Mezza 9 buffet dinner. For my convenience, I decided to book a suite at club level which I can enjoy their Grand Club facilities.  The check-in is arranged in the hotel room,the hostess are very kind and friendly, they set up a direct line to their concierge that I can call for information and assistance in a convenient way. The breakfast at Grand Club is good but…",50
"Overall speaking, the standard of the bedroom and the quality of food in the hotel restaurant were far above standard. It had made my wedding anniversary an unforgettable experience and I would definitely visit this hotel again in my next trip to Macau",50
"Stayed here a few times, rooms are very nice and spacious.  Excellent caring staffs and great customer service. A very special thanks to Ms Sabrini Foo at Front office, taking special care of our need and request.  Will definitely recommend this place for anyone travel to Macau.",50
"I can't remember how many times I have stayed in this property, the past experiences were pretty good. For this time, I was coming over to Macau for a day to attend a conference and the venue was set in City of Dreams. I decided not to rush myself to travel Macau in same day return, therefore I booked my room at Grand Hyatt Macau for one night to chill for a night before hectic day.   When I arrived hotel at around 5:15pm, I queued at check-in desk for about 15mins, the front desk staff was helpful and nice, the check-in procedure was smooth.   I have booked myself the room with fountain view. My room was located on 21 Floor at the Grand Club Tower and my room was facing to Wynn Palace. The fountain view was great however, it was bit noisy when they had the fountain show, I can…",50
"Selected the hotel because their package with The water show and easy access to it. Booked mid November . One day before arrival end of November we were informed Of cancellation of water show and we would get ticket refund there. At refund we were told the show does not work since typhoon 10 over 1 month earlier, as then major damage to machinery happened. My question is why Hyatt still sells this packet knowing one part is not working? Overall the hotel stay was ok, big rooms and good location. Checkin however was very slow and clumsy and we had to go and collect the refund. All in all was ok we got a reasonable priced room but the whole process forces you to do several things and disappointing your expectations which should not happen.",40
"For the first time in Grand Hyatt Macau hotel. Because I had to stay in Macau for an extra night, I booked this hotel in a very urgent situation. The price compared to other business hotel, this hotel cheaper price.   Room design feel good, living room and bathroom are also large glass floor, bathroom glass and just next to the bathtub, you can enjoy the outside while bathing. Although the room was then assigned to just live on the MGM hotel.  However, because the floor is relatively high, see the scenery is still not bad.   There is a night light, and the light can be turned on under the bedside cabinet, even if the toilet is remembered at night, it will not fall down due to the dark environment. And it will not hinder the quality of sleep. Air conditioner temperature setting…",40
" The only thing within walking distance from the hotel is the Venetian. There's not as much to do in Taipa as compared to Macau.  Arrival experince was luckwarm, staff dont make eye contact, and are always busy in giving the reason why things cant be done rather than giving option... its sad.... room was non-smoking but often a strong smoke smell would come into our room. When I walked into the hallway there wasn't any smoke smell. I dont think i will ever visit again ..",10
"Stayed at the Grand Hyatt for one night last week. The location is the middle of the Cotai strip- which is still a half-finished construction zone (obviously this is not the fault of the hotel, but just be aware that the view for the next year or two maybe of cranes and trucks). The hotel has a lux but dated feel- the colours, carpets and furnishings have an expensive feel, but look like it was designed in the 1990s.   The service was generally very good- thanks in particular to Carmen at the concierge desk who was very helpful with restaurant and sight-seeing tips. Although the guy who was at the taxi stand was very frustrating- we waited long times for taxis on multiple occasions, and he always seemed more interested in talking to his friends then in getting taxis- we gave up…",40
"This was the first time we stayed at Grand Hyatt Macau.  It is located at the City of Dreams, where we could easily access by complimentary shuttle bus.  It is around a 10 minutes' walk to the Venetian and the Parisian, where there are more affordable shops.   We requested for connecting rooms by email.  The guest service team answered us that this could not been entertained due to ""the hotel infrastructure design and room configuration"".  Nevertheless, the guest experience team did manage to arrange such room type for us and we were really happy with that.    Since I let Grand Hyatt knew that we were celebrating my parents' birthday, they provided us with surprises which exceeded our expectation.  Angel from the guest experience team was extremely helpful and friendly.  The…",50
"Since my first visit about 9 years ago, Grand Hyatt Macau always keep their standard, very friendly and attentive staff. The hotel lobby is clean and not so crowded with guests, give you a relax atmosphere. The hotel rooms are clean.  The Fitness Centre and swimming pool is in professional standard.  Specail thanks to their Guest Service Officer - Chris, very considerate and warm arrangement for us to celebrate my friend’s birthday during our memorable stay. Overall, the hotel always at their Outstanding Standard.",50
"Upon check in I discovered booking wrong date for my stay, Tina from Guest Experience team proactively provided help and given me great sense of comfort. Troy was very helpful during the check in process as well. Furthermore, the hotel room is very tidy and well furnished. The overall experience made me feel Grant Hyatt Macau home away from home.",50
"I will definitely recommend to friends, family and business associates if they go to Macau to consider staying at the Grand Hyatt for them to enjoy the awesome service and facilities the hotel has to offer.  It is by far the BEST HYATT HOTEL I have ever stayed.",50
"It's our first time to stay at Grand Hyatt Macau. A few days before our stay I received phone calls from reservation team as well as the guest experience manager and all our needs and concerns were well arranged by them~~ At the time of check-in, the guest experience manager welcomed us in person and even prepared some gifts for my kids! What a great surprise for us! The room was spacious, clean and modern with stunning view! We also enjoy the dinner buffet very much, various food choice, comfortable environment~~~ We will definitely visit again next year!",50
"The hotel staff are truly exceptional. Not only are they genuinely friendly and attentive, they go all out to ensure you have the most pleasant stay and have everything taken care of. My experience with the guest service team is indeed memorable. Ms Irene at the front desk was extremely helpful in allowing us a much earlier check-in, we were really tired from the early morning flight. We were given a corner room on the 22nd floor, which had a fantastic view of the lighted musical fountains and cable cars of Wynn Palace hotel right opposite. Ms Angel then took us to our room and went over the map with us, recommending sights and patiently explaining how and where to get on the shuttle buses. We took the shuttle bus to most of places, it is really quite convenient. I then had a…",50
"1.calm and easy to access other spots. 2.water dancing should be watchig(in side of hyatt hotel) 3.when u stay,please find black color staffs,they will help u professinaly ,The gray staff is really poor to help",50
"Came here for a 1night stay in Macau away from Hong Kong and this trip was the highlight of my holiday. The staff were so attentive and polite and gave us all the information we needed, the suite was just perfect and clean and very spacious. We also got a cake upon arrival and I got a red rose on arrival which made the finishing touches to the trip.  Thank you for a wonderful stay. ",50
"I stayed on 14-15 Oct to watch the dancing water (which by the way is an amazing show).   Unfortunately typhoon CAT 8 hit. I must say the hotel managed the disaster extremely well.  I have to mention the service by concierge staffs were beyond excellent. Particularly Ms Carmen Lau and Ms Edith. Despite the chaos caused by typhoon, they were extremely calm, organized and attended to my request in great detail.  I was due to fly off on 15th evening but all transport were halted due to typhoon. Edith called up my room a few times just to update me the status (i am sure there were many guests she had to deal with at the same time). Ms Carmen even went on to call up the airlines for me to check my flight status and updated me promptly.   I am just so very amazed by how organized and…",50
"Services of the hotel are great from checkin staff to its club lounge. Food in club lounge is wonderful, better than most restaurants in Macau. Be aware this is the hotel mainly serve for the visitors to its Casino rather than a business Hotel. However, club lounge staff are very knowledgeable about the city and is able to make all kind of reservations on your behalf. I enjoyed my many stays in Hyatt and a gentalmen named Randy from Malaysia is most proactive to support all you need in Macau. Hotel is easy to access from airport and ferry station by Hotel transportations since Macau taxi is the worst in Asia (hard to find and over charge if you are not a local, plus services is on their mercy altitudes). Hotel transportation is a much better choices. ",40
"We had a wonderful vacation in Grand Hyatt Macau. Best location, Spacious and comfortable rooms, very clean, we had a fountain view which is amazing.  The staff are nice and very kind,  highly recommend on Grand Hyatt Macau.",50
"Ms. Tina Yu welcomed us with great hospitality!!!!  Bar none the best in the world!!!  Ms. Tina welcome us with flowers and cake as we are celebrating our birthdays and anniversary!  Then, she made sure that we are taken cared of at the restaurant we booked in the hotel!  She is just everywhere where we were.... Unbelievable service!",50
"We were here for celebration. Every staffs was so helpful. Receptionist Sharon was very friendly assisting us to do the check in, early check in and upgrade was arranged. Thanks to the room service team for sending us the cake and flowers. We loved it. Angel from the reception was so nice making sure our stay was great and walked us to the taxi stand when we were leaving.   The only thing disappointed us was the meal we had in the Peking Restaurant on the lobby floor. The staffs there was so different from the ones work in the hotel. They talk impolitely, also they talk loudly to each other. The food was not as good as before. The restaurant is playing some canton pop music which did not match the atmosphere at all. I just felt like I entered a random local chinese restaurant.",50
Had a suite on a corner which was fantastic and the amazing view wrapped around the whole area.     Very well situated hotel within walking distance of all the other amazing hotels and casinos and not too far from the airport.,50
"Being a frequent guest with Grand Hayaat, Shatin, Hong Kong, it came as a shocking disappointment when I decided to stay with Grand Hayaat macau. The reception area is unimpressive and the check in was as pleasant as checking in the railway station. The room was drab, ill equipped, with the worst view that macau can offer. The in room dining took the cake for being the worst I had the pleasure of experiencing in many years.   I simply don't understand why or how Hayaat group decided to have one of their worst establishments of all places in Macau, a place full of wonderful world class hotels. Oh.by the way the only restaurant that is available through out the day is a lobby lounge restaurant. Simply pathetic.  Sorry to be so blunt . Go to Macau please stay away from Hayaat.",10
"First time here but been treated with VVIP services. Seamless arrangement in e-notifications for early check-in and a surprise bday cake for my husband upon arrival.  All staff are well trained to provide professional and hearty service - in particular Selina and Tina. We felt being spoiled.   The buffet dinner in Mezz 9 is superb - seafood is fresh and wonderfully cooked. A big applause to all chefs. Feel the extraordinary logistics arrangement- despite food are made to order, the preparation time is fast with great quality. What exceeds expectation is the vegetable, it's a miss if you don't try any. The staff in the restaurant are also well trained to give you helpful advice on cooking options.   Almost forgot to mention - the buffet breakfast is superb. Hardly had one with…",50
If you have to go to Macau and don’t want to be bombarded by the casino nightlife then this is the perfect location. The hotel is immaculate and the Grand Club on the 37th floor is exceptional. The view over the airport is great and the breakfast and evening snacks provided are enough to see you through the day. I will definitely be back.,50
"This is my second time to stay in Grand Hyatt Hotel, The Hotel itself is very clean and the room are very spacious especially the bed is very comfortable for anyone to sleep, my wife loved a lot and we didn't regret on choosing Grand Hyatt, we will definitely come back again.",50
"The level of service, both friendly and efficient,  the large, well equiped rooms makes this an excellent hotel. The only weakness is finding somewhere to sit and have a good coffee, a latte tends to be American strength. But if that is the only thing I can criticise- then that says what a great luxury hotel this is!",50
"I cant say anything negative even if i tried hard. This hotel is simply the best. From amazing service to luxurious and spacious rooms. The highlight is by far the food court, the choice and quality they offered was unparalleled!!! Highly recommended",50
All staff of Grand Hyatt Macau are very polite and helpful. Their hospitality are very nice and out of expectation. You will feel warm and comfortable living in this hotel. Room is also large and very comfortable,50
"What a wonderful experience with Grand Hyatt Macau. Short walk to Venetians and free chair lift to Wynn Palace.   We received an upgrade to a King suite. Our room package come with complimentary bar and snacks plus free laundry service (4 garments).   Mezza 9 is a must try!  It's really beyond expectations with the food quality,  varieties and taste.   Hotel staff are very friendly and efficient  too.   It was really a memorable stay at this hotel. ",50
From the Building to the serving everything is Grand! Its sticks to the brand! Mezza9 offers lots of comfort food that I am familiar with and being a person who is always out of the country will need a comfort in some ways and they did not just deliver it they exceeded my expectations. ,50
"It was really a wonderful stay and we all have a great time with our family altogether.   All Hotel staff are helpful, especially Sammy at Concierge Desk who always show initiative to take care all of our requests. Celina & Renee from GR team, much appreciated for their effort in preparing the room decoration with all nice amenities for our special occasion ~ birthday & graduation. Nick with his team has provided us smooth check-in & check-out and  Front Desk staff was very helpful and efficient.  The dinner buffet at Mezz9 was really outstanding and Man & Deepak were both helpful and thank you so much for their kind arrangement and set up the nice table for us. The food quality is really good and we all enjoy the food and the service there. The birthday cakes were delicious…",50
"I came to Macau for the meeting on AUG 22 and 23, and the strong typhoon 10 hit Macau this morning.  I booked Grand Hyatt on 23 and planed to leave on 24.  Electricity was out and hotel guests were panic.  I was able to reach the reception around 2 pm and the crew was very calm and settled me and other guests in the waiting area with hot noodles and drinks.    When the electricity was back after two hours, the long queue of guests rushed to the front desk.  The crew again showed great patience in managing the queue.  To be honest, managing queue in China takes both IQ and EQ, or even AQ.  Much credits went to a lady who controlled the traffic very well.    All in all, I could get my room one hour after the power was resumed.  Speedy service, great patience, and smiles under…",50
"We stayed in Grand suite rooms at  Grand Hyatt Macau for 2 nights. My first impression for a room is in much bigger than I thought.There is separated living room and bed room that awesome. In the living room, they provided Nespresso coffee machine and capsules and 4 bottles of water (hotel average is 2 bottles per day). The hotel is connected to shopping mall and have free shuttle bus to go to other hotels and airport and ferry. Over of the hotel is excellent except the smoke smell in the room (we booked non-smoking room).",40
"Fantastic hotel with attentive staff and a wonderful pool area that no one in Macau seems to know about. Jacuzzis, large swimming pool, day beds with televisions and a very nice spa that is always quiet compared to other hotels in Macau.",50
"This is my second visit to Grand Hyatt Macau and I was there to celebrate my cousin's birthday. Ms. Eva Gao knew our visit and prepared herself to welcome us at the arrival and check-in, we felt warm and privileged! Eva took extremely good care of my family during the stay, she has arranged a selected birthday cake with my cousin name on it and we received it during our dinner at Mezza 9! I was able to contact her whenever in needs... I believe her great hospitality truly represents the value of Hyatt spirit.  I always amazed by the incredible service provided by everyone in Mezza 9, we were being well treated by the Manager as well as all staffs, everyone was smiling and so energetic! I specially remember the waiter named Cary, he served our table at the breakfast and he…",50
"I spent a weekend at Grand Hyatt to celebrate the birthday of a good friend of mine and the overall experience was great! Although the hotel is part of the City of Dreams casino complex, the lobby is not too crowded which we appreciated. The room was spacious and featured the well known understated design for which Grand Hyatt Hotels are known for. The service was also friendly and welcoming at all times.",40
"Tried the ""Grand Offer"" package in Grand Hyatt Macau Hotel.  It included :-- • One-night accommodation in a Standard Room • Breakfast for two persons • Complimentary minibar  • Complimentary regular laundry and pressing services for up to four pieces • “Dining from the Kitchen at mezza9 Macau” dinner buffet for two persons  It worths more than what I've paid! Especially the dinner buffet @ Mezza9 is amazing! Heard from the staff, the dinner buffet booking is fully booked till Jan of 2018!!!  Glad that I have also recommended this package to my friends!  I will definitely visit this hotel again whenever I go to Macau! ",40
"We stay one night to celebrate my wife's Birthday.  Our room is very clean with nice view, and we can see the beautiful sun rise at the room next morning.  All staffs are very cheerful and helpful.  Thanks for the Birthday cake and Birthday song from the customer experience team !  We really enjoy the time and will come back next time.  ",40
"A very good place to stay in order to ""experience how the other half lives"". Our room seemed enormous, especially coming from space-challenged Hong Kong. The Reception Desk service was very good as well and the Concierge Desk really specialised in uncannily prescient recommendations for nearby restaurants.",50
"The reviews are accurate and the hotel is amazing. I felt like a king in this castle. Each room is a suite with a living room, master bedroom, and beautifully designed bathrooms. The amenities were terrific, i love the large towels, and free bottles of water. Additionally breakfast is served everything morning and is very good. Staff on hand are very nice, helpful, and knowledgeable. Some speak limited English, but there is always someone on hand to help.   Would highly recommend to stay here for anyone looking for a good place to stay in Macau, even if it can be a little pricey, it's worth it! ",50
"We spent one night here for a weekend getaway. Check-in was very smooth and easy - special thanks to Renee who helped us a lot and get an extra anniversary cake Our room was spacious and clean. There were a few stains in a bath tub, we didn't use it after all so it wasn't a big deal.  Outdoor pool on the 3rd floor is highly recommended. We were the only people there, we could really enjoy our time in jacuzzi.  We had a room service the next morning, they added extra ingredients without letting us know, we had to request again and they did an excellent job! Do try their cheese omelette, simply divine.",40
Stayed here in last July to celebrate my friend's birthday and our anniversary. We were staying at floor 16 and room is spacious with nice view. We enjoyed the cake and fruits. The cake is delicious. I also decorated the room for my friend :)   Reception staff and concierge are helpful as well. Good recommendation for dinner buffet.,40
Didn't realize the king deluxe rooms are bigger than a Hong Kong city apartment. Family of four got two of these through a House of Dancing Water show ticket package. Didn't know what to do with all the space. Amazing service; would definitely come back.,50
"We visited Grand Hyatt Macau in June 17, the hotel is party of city of dreams  and actually it is city of dreams... beautifully located on right of yours you have Hard rock and Venetian on left Wynn palace...

"I am very satisfied with my experience with the hotel. I stayed in a Grand Suite on 16/6.  Pior to arriving at the hotel, I received an email and a call from the management team asking what were my preferences. As it was my wife's birthday, I asked them if they could help me decorate the room. They were also aware that my 5 year-old daughter was coming along with us.   When we arrived at the hotel ❨via free shuttle from the Cotai ferry pier), we were impressed with the grand setting in the lobby, the beautiful flowers were elegant yet simple. The check-in was efficient.  When we arrived at our room, we were quite surprised at the size of it, since I had not paid that much for it. For a regular price of a 5 star hotel, we got a suite and the living room was HUGE! The staff had…",50
"Of the 3 hotel brands located in City of Dreams Macau, I must admit that Grand Hyatt Macau is the best of the lot. Very professional and friendly staffs, ready to serve your whims and fancies and pamper you to the max. The Chinese restaurant here is a gem and this property has shown to me how a proper 5 star hotel should operate. Kudos to them!",50
"My pleasure experience started from the time I checked in.  While I was checking in at the front desk, my family was greeted by a concierge.  She is really friendly and provided us with so much information on Macau (too bad that I forgot her name).  The dinner buffet there is also should not be missed.  It is not the usual type of buffet, you could let the chef how how you want your seafood be prepared, both Asian and western style.  I was staying in a suite with a nice view of the fountain facing the opposite hotel.  Amenities are all the top notch quality.  I am looking forward to going back to Hyatt again. ",50
"Overall stay was excellent , extremely nice five star hotel ! We have to special thank one Front office staff Sky , he is very professional and helpful , which make us a wonderful stay , definitely we will come back again ! ",50
All the Hyatt staff are marvellous and courteous. We were so impressed of their customer-first attitude. They arranged an unforgettable experience and memorable celebration for our 20th anniversary. Everything was perfect and we definitely will come and stay again. ,50
"After the amazing show of House of dancing waters, we stayed at the hotel. Amazing view on the buildings around and the huge pool. We enjoyed the pool and spa in the morning. A very amazing beginning for our stay in Macao",50
We recently stayed only one night at the grand Hyatt. Room was very large and within the City of Dreams complex. The Club floor cocktails and food were excellent. Staff great. Large pool and gym. Did not use the spa. Not suer about all the gambling!!! old city area very nice.,50
"I celebrate my birthday on the Grand Hyatt hotel. People in the front desk realise it is my birthday and they provide birthday cake for me. They also introduce the room for us which make us feel as home. One thing must be mentioned is the room is fabulous and cozy while the birthday cake is very tasty. Especially thank you Renee Diep from the Guest Experience Team, Chris Chew Alice Liau from Guest Service Officer. They arrange all the things we need before we arrive. They all provide high standard hospitality. I would recommend this hotel to other.",50
"The staff is super inviting. This place definitely lives up to the Grand Hyatt standards. Great value, great room, great location! I always stay here when in Macau and I hav yet to be let down by Grand Hyatt Macau. ",50
Grand Hyatt has big rooms and bathroom. The bathtub is the more expensive one compared to other hotels of the same priced ranged and location. The only draw back is the lack of welcoming attitute of the staff and of the entire hotel in general. I dont know if being snobbish is part of their culture or hotel appeal. That is to become reserved and classy.,40
"My partner and I chose to stay at the Grand Hyatt to celebrate an anniversary. We were warmly welcomed by Judy at the front desk who notified us that we were upgraded to a suite. Judy was very friendly and helpful as she explained to us about our House of Dancing Water package deal and guided us to our hotel room. Hotel was nicely furnished and had everything we needed, including a Nespresso machine with complimentary Nespresso capsules, complimentary Tie Guan Yin and Dragon Well tea leaves, multiple water bottles, and lots of other necessities. There was a bathtub that just fit 2 people. The toilet is separate from the shower and tub. There are dual sinks. We wanted to explore the main part of Macau after our check-out and we were able to leave our stuff with the hotel at no…",50
"The room is spacious, very comfortable and the view from my room was great. Outstanding service given by Carol at the Grand Club and Samira at the reception. Great breakfast option at the executive lounge. They serve local food on the buffet. The location of the hotel is very strategic. It is connected to the City of Dreams shopping mall and a walking distance to The Venetian and The Parisian. There are also free shuttle buses to the other hotels and casinos, and also to the other Macau island.",50
This is very good hotel!!!  They offer very comfort & releax envoirment for your enjoy the holiday.    And my mother and me really have a good time by twice (last year & this year).  We're recommend you enjoy at Grand Hyatt Macau.  Thank you!!!,50
"My wife and I arrived in Macau around 11am. We took the free City of Dreams shuttle from the airport to the hotel. We were able to check in early at the Grand Club. During this process, we got a chance to sit down, have some water, and refresh from the 20+ hours of airplanes and airports we had just finished. We also met the first of many wonderful staff members, Dora Ieong, the Club Manager.  Our room was wonderful, with views overlooking the Hard Rock hotel and the Venetian. From the shower room (which contained the tub), you could watch the apron of the airport. I threatened my wife that I may just soak in the tub all day and watch the planes.  We dined on breakfast and dinner most days in the Club. The service was fantastic and the food was varied and excellent. We never…",50
Recently stayed for 2 nights in a grand king suite. The suite was enormous and extremely comfortable. Every amenity was available and I loved having a Nespresso machine for a morning coffee. Housekeeping was very impressive. I found all the staff to be extremely friendly and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble. The pool area is fantastic and luxurious. It would be very easy to spend all your time by the pool and miss out on the sights Macau has to offer. Overall an exceptional hotel which I would highly recommend. ,50
"The City of Dreams complex, which this hotel is part of, is now a bit dated compared to the other large and newer complexes in Macau.  The Grand Hyatt is the same.  The rooms need updating.  Service was fine, but not outstanding.  One cannot compare this to the other Grand Hyatts in the world.",30
"Having been in many luxury hotels, Grand Hyatt was definitely among the top three. Starting from the reservation process, where Alice Liau responded to every request and already blew me away with her patience and kindness, to the warm welcoming at the reception by Renee (GR) and her colleagues - everything felt like coming home.  We even got an upgrade to celebrate the special occasion we have been to Macau for! Having arrived in our room we read the welcome card and saw the  fruit basket, which has been arranged to greet us. Shortly after moving into the room the team knocked at our door with two cakes, singing Happy Birthday - it has been a total surprise! Whenever we entered the lobby Adrian (Concierge), Renee, or another colleague have been waiting for us and eagerly started…",50
We had a problem during check-in and took like 45 minutes to fix it. It had nothing to do with the hotel but the travel agent though.  Other than the wait we had a great stay in Grand Hyatt.  Got upgraded to a suite and warm service from the front desk staff who offered small treats to a 3 years old kid from our family.   Will definitely go back.,50
"I am staying at the Grand Hyatt Macau till probably next week. Currently I have to say this is an ideal hotel which is over my expectation, such as, the food, the service and the people who working at here. Especially Carrie Leung - one associate I've met at Spa, she is so attentive, sincere and polite. I never expected that she greeting me with my name, as this is my first time to stay here. It's a lovely hotel and I love it.",50
"We had a great stay, this was our first stay at Grand Hyatt in Macau.  The place is very relaxing. All Staffs are very warm and friendly.  Upon check in, we were pleasantly surprised with upgraded to Fountain view Grand Suite. The suite was spacious with great view of the airport and wonderful fountain, that we enjoy the dancing water show at night from Wynn Palace. Also thank you for the Brownie Mousse birthday cake, so delicious!! Would definitely visit again. Thanks a lot!",50
"Our recent stay at the Grand Hyatt Macau was like a homecoming visit.  We received a very warm ""welcome back"" from the staff, many of whom we have come to know through our frequent visits in the past.  On arrival, we were immediately helped with our bags by the friendly bellmen who ushered us into the lobby for our check-in.  We breezed through the busy lobby and skipped the queues thanks to AFOM Sabrini and GET's Renee for our VIP check-in at the Grand Club.  As we were pretty tired from our flight and ferry ride getting to Macau, the expedited check-in process was a boon and we enjoyed refreshments at the Club while we waited. Our room was prepared in advance with all of our requests met.  We are grateful to AM Kurt Lei and his housekeeping team for their effort in making our…",50

Ms. Eva Gao - the team leader of Grand Club greeted us passionately at the lobby. She took care of us considerately during our stay, room upgraded to the amazing fountain view, birthday cake arrangement at the Mezza 9 restaurant, Eva & the team even surprised me by singing birthday song while presenting the cake... it was so warm and touching! Eva is so pretty, humble yet professional (speaks Mandarin, Cantones & English fluently), how lucky Grand Hyatt Macau to have Eva to serve guests from everywhere :-)  Actually all staffs are very well trained and passionate!

Our children especially appreciated the thoughtfulness when they found children's toothbrushes, toothpaste, slippers and robes! Staff were friendly, helpful and very responsive. And the House of Dancing Water theatre is literally downstairs. Food we had during breakfast was great. We had a lovely time. ",50
I had stayed in many international hotels in Macau. Had been stayed at Grand Hyatt Macau last week. Room didn't impress us as compare to Parisian and Galaxy we stayed before. But I have to say Grand Hyatt is the best in terms of customer service. From the moment we stepped in the hotel we were greeted by a female staff who offered to help for my belonging even I was only carrying ONE shopping bag. The room was not ready and the front desk staff (male) was nice enough to help keeping our luggages. Everyone we encountered during our stay were attentive and always with a smile. Especially thanks to the Concierge (Bennington? Not sure his name. He worked at evening on 25Mar) who was professional in showing us direction and even reminded us to bundle up as the weather was turning…,50
Was enroute to the House of Dancing Water at City of Dreams when I came across Grand Hyatt. It does not have a casino so the clientele seem quieter and more business than tourists. The lobby decor is interesting and many was snapping shots of the silver ball right in the middle. ,40
"Very grand hotel at a quieter side of Cotai area. Was lucky to get a free upgrade to a suite, probably it was a Monday with lesser crowd.  The room was huge , facing the Hotel Rock Hotel and the pantry area is great with Nespresso coffee and various kind of tea. Definitely will be back soon.",50
I arrived at the hotel past 1030PM.  I was upgraded to Grand Club Tower however my first room was accross an on going construction(MGM Hotel) which you can hear the loud banging.  Requested for a room transfer but they are full.  Transfer was facilitated the following day.  I love the Nespresso machine with lots of choice capsules(I prefer Decaf though).  My next room was a corner junior suite which directly facing the Wynn Palace Fountain that showcase a spectacular show every 30 minutes.  The roon is huge and and bathroom is very nice,50
"Stay at the Grand Hyatt Macau for one night last week. The package included an upgrade fountain view room, free mini bar, free buffet dinner at the well-known mezza9, free in-room breakfast with your own choice, free standard laundry service, two round trip ferry transfer to and from Hong Kong. Cost only HKD2,496!approx USD321) for two persons. The Grand Hyatt was located nest to the City of Dreams Hotel and the Crown Hotel. Hyatt was very quiet comparatively. The service was superb good. The receptionists all were very nice and helpful.  The upgraded room was good, the size is not as big as the Wynn Palace, but still it had a sitting area, dining area, and even there was a sliding door between the sitting room and the bedroom.  The mezza9 was not as good as expected. Seafood…",50
"Great hotel, with excellent staff. Stayed on executive club floor, club staff very helpful and friendly. Always happy to organise bookings, offer information, advice re: restaurants, things to do. Breakfast and evening cocktails & canapés were excellent. Afternoon tea was very underwhelming in comparison. Overall a great break, would definitely go back and recommend.",50
I went there with my boyfriend to celebrate his birthday. The staff was nice to prepared a cake to deliver at evening turndown time. The room is spacious with a very comfy bed. I like the hotel some much because it's quiet without the crowd yet convenient enough with the shuttle bus service. Overall an excellent stay. ,50
"Very good size room, new and modern, got upgraded to the tower, superb front office personnel, a casino hotel without the usual hustle bustle of a casino hotel, great oasis in Macau, fantastic Restaurant for Macanese food, the Mezza9, ate everyday there.",50
"First guided by well manners staff for the smooth check in. Stayed a night in king suite, it was super spacious both room & living area, clean, things are well maintained.... Hotel location was great to access C.O.D shopping area & restaurants.",40
"The buffet @ mezza9 is famous and I really like the food, especially the lobster and dessert.  Regarding the hotel room, the condition is satisfactory though it's not new at all.  The service is good as well.  Overall speaking, it's worth to stay.",40
"We have stayed at the hotels for several times. It's really our first priority when considering which hotel to stay. The rooms are spacious, cozy and modern. The hotel staff are really professional and thoughtful. They remember our staying preference and always welcoming us on different ways. Most of the time we stayed at the grand club tower where we can have access to the club lounge. The food and beverages provided there are outstanding. The restaurant located at third floor worth to try, too.",50
First impression was good. Staff pleasant but food wise could be better in terms of breakfast and lunch as we were stuck there for 4 days eating the same food. My room was noisy could be because of the air conditioning ,30
"We stayed here from Sunday to Wednesday and enjoyed the experience.  Our room on the 29th floor was huge and well appointed.  The bathroom had a bathtub too, and there were His and Hers sink areas.  The king-sized bed was very comfortable, as was the sofa set in the corner.  There was a nexpresso machine, as well as Chinese tea leaves provided.  Breakfast was located next to the spa and was a few minutes' walk from the Club tower as it was on the other side of the compound.  The food was okay, though service was a little mixed up.  I was led to a table and I placed a full glass of fresh orange juice on it while I went to get some food. When I returned, however, the glass was gone and the table was reset with cultery etc.  Within the same complex, there is the Soho area of…",40
"We booked an executive long room with club lounge access. Great large room,amazing bathroom, lovely extra amenities, even provide hair straightener, hair spray, deodorant on request.   Execeptional service, specifically manager  Dora. Also generous high quality  food and alcohol offered  at the club lounge. Totally  worth the extra cost of staying at club level",50
"Warm water outdoor swimming pool, I can swim all the time even in autumn period. Heated outdoor jacuzzi area just nearby the pool and indoor jacuzzi provided at lady changing room. Comfortable room with large bathroom & living room. Full of room amenties especially variety chargers . Modern design.",50
"I love this hotel and will stay there, even some new hotels are coming up. The services is very professional and up to high standard. The best staff are Celina Kam, Nick Feng and Sara Tang (Grand Hyatt Macau team). Thank you so much.",50
"We had a very nice room over looking the fountain.  The check in at the club lounge was fast and easy.  The concierge (Randy) really took care of things, including my dinner reservations, show seats and ferry tickets. The restaurants onsite were fabulous.  We had the best Peking Duck ever there.  The breakfast buffet was quite nice.  Happy hour at the lounge was nice.  The house keeper did a great job for us during our stay. The room had some trouble with the climate control which maintenance was unable to figure out.  A cold breeze continued to blow, finally I took thermostat face off and it shut the fan down.",50
"We had a very nice stay in Grand Hyatt Macao. The hotel generously offered complimentary breakfast for us. And arranged a side-bed for our children. The suite we stayed was very spacious and the gym room was well-equipped. However, the hotel shuttle bus was relatively small and the frequency was low so that we needed to wait for a few to get on. Overall, the hotel's environment was very impressive and tranquil. It's highly recommended.",50
Stayed here for one night and had access to the grand club. Great experience for the evening cocktail and great services from the hotel . Staffs are nice and helpful. It's my mother's birthday and birthday cake and birthday bun were served . Thanks to Celina and Renee arrangement. ,50
"Our family stayed in this Grand Hyatt Macao hotel quite a few times through out many years. For the last few years, we have nothing but good review for this establishment. Excellent customer service, clean and orderly room, good food .  It's worth while to pay a bit more to stay on club floor. Both service and food are great. ",50
"Now you can enjoy the nice fountain view from the Wyen Palce even if you stay at Hyatt. Hyatt still keep the excellent standard of the foods and service all the time. It's the only hotel which can serve the congee during the Happy Hour, I love it so much.",50
"I was staying this hotel for the business purpose. All the staffs and even bell boys were so dedicated and worked so sincerely. It was very truely touched and I can tell this hotel is the one of the best hotel in the world. Even I paid little much but I've never thouhgt this was expensive. Please when you choose the hotel, please do choose. You are not going to be sorry. I am strongly recommend this hotel.",50
"It was an excellent and impeccable stay. The Grand Hyatt Macau is elegant and tastefully laid out. The room is spacious comfortable and the view is amazing ~      I was deeply impressed the newspaper service-""scan QR code"". WOW! That's a GREAT Idea:) Thank you for saving the world, save paper save environment save the earth 🍀🌎",50
"A typical Hyatt welcome, the moment you walk through the doors, the bellboys are ready to escort you. Checking in on The Ambassador Club floor with a welcome drink then escorted to our room, which had amazing views from every window. The real surprise was in the evening w hen the light show started we just sat on our lounge & looked out the window, it was awesome! The welcome from the beautiful girls in the club lounge was very heart warming as they had prepared a cake & flowers to celebrate my birthday, very thoughtful & much appreciated. Everything was perfect the chefs preparing the food were very obliging. A wonderful experience.",50
"We just celebrated CNY holiday in Grand Hyatt for 2 nights. It was also because of Grand Hyatt we enjoyed Macau so much! My last trip in Macau was 5 yrs ago, it has changed a lot! Our room had the water fountain view from Wynn Palace, the every 20min fountain show was stunning. Service service service was excellent!! Location was perfect, 1 min walk to the Dancing Water show. Many shuttle buses to wherever you want.   But...breakfast was NOT 5 star. Our package included breakfast so we don't feel too bad. But if you have to pay MOP258+ for it, i suppose you can find better options elsewhere. They offer breakfast until 12pm which was great, but food choice was limited, mostly Chinese food. I love Chinese food, but once the more popular dishes got consumed away they wouldn't…",40
Grand Hyatt provides the best hospitality and paying attention to every details during my stay! The staff gave their best effort to ensure my stay was like home. They were informative and provides the best recommendation for restaurants and shopping area other than their own outlets.,50
"Getting from Hong Kong airport to Macau was not easy but we finally got to our hotel, the staff really tried to make it a pleasant stay. We were upgraded to a suite which was spacious and comfortable. I was a bit worried about ordering gluten and dairy free breakfast but the room service was excellent and my breakfast just what I needed. Service was excellent.",40
"We took the entire family to Macau over Christmas and decided to try the Grand Hyatt Macau. Frankly, we have stayed at other hotels in the past and nothing compares to the overall experience at GH in Macau in terms of room size, service, overall ambience and food quality. They truly make every single guest feel like they are a VIP!    To start, as you walk into the hotel, the lobby feels spacious and comfortable without being cavernous. During the festive season, the hotel decorates its Christmas trees using recycled materials, which was quite creative while being environmentally conscious. As you walk into the room, you can't help but appreciate how large even the standard rooms are. They are well-maintained, luxuriously decorated, and the housekeeping staff does an excellent…",50
"I frequently stay at The Grand Hyatt Macau (I'm there every 3 months) and it's always a good time. The staff always makes sure my stay is relaxed, comfortable, stress & hassle free - which is really important when I'm away.",50
"We stayed at a Grand Deluxe Suite on 10/F, the view is sucks, we are just right above all pumps/pipes of the opposite building. The condition of the room is unacceptable. Carpet in living room has large stains, it looks unpleasant and uncomfortable. The four leather chairs are all rough and cracked. These are the first time I experienced in such a 5-star hotel. Apart from the room itself, I checked in at 1pm and the counter staff expressed that my room will be available at around 3pm and asked if I want my luggage to be put at Concierge or sent to my room, I then answered ""my room please"". I then checked in with my family right before 4pm, however our luggage was not in the room. I need to call and ask the hotel to send me my luggage as soon as possible as my babies need to…",20
The purpose of this trip is to show 'House of the dancing water' to my family and this hotel is located just beside the show venue. It takes 2 minutes by walk from the hotel lobby. Wynn Palace hotel which was opened in last Sep. located just accross the street so you can enjoy the fountain show and gondola of Wynn Palaces ,50
"I have been stayed in this hotel for 2 times! The room was very spacious. The room service was excellent! Just that one time we got a high floor room and experienced noises from the ceiling/air-con. It was like a huge ""bang"" sound and loud enough to wake us up a few time while we were sleeping. But it was mid-night and we only stayed for one night, so we didn't bother to report to the front desk. ",30
"Staff was very nice, rooms spacious and well designed. Convenient location right in the middle of the strip.  Our room was a corner one that overlooked Wynn and the fountains.  Hotel is also adjacent to the house of dancing water show which was also excellent. ",50
"Check-in - The reception is nicely decorated for Christmas with a low-key elegance.  - As we booked directly with the hotel, the whole process could have been done online without us having to queue up and to wait for the front line staff to complete the tedious formalities.  Room - Despite it being one of the suites, the decoration and furnishings left much to be desired. There was no personal touch, no welcome fruit plate/basket, no little greetings from the management ......  - Tea cups were only good for Chinese tea, and no proper ones for the Nespresso machine or English tea; - The electricity sockets were situated next to the sofa, poorly placed for charging of laptop computer; - There was no writing desk, and the only tables available in this suite were a coffee table and…",40
"stayed here one night, on a casino trip. as a hyatt diamond member was upgraded to a suite....which was one of the largest suite i have ever been out of all the hyatts i have stayed.  service was really good, location perfect. didnt had a chance to try the F&B and facilities. but have stayed at st regis, crown, conrad , and sheraton grand whicb are walking distance to hyatt and i can promise that grand hyatt is the best out of them all.  ",50
"Great rooms, great Mezza 9 restaurant and a quality exec lounge!  Gym superb, pool not used much, but great when weather allows!  Not much that can be faulted at this property, the only issue is really weekend availability and some very ''dynamic'' pricing making the diamond room guarantee akin to blackmail.. Still one of the best in Macau",40
Grand Hyatt Macau is located at city of drrams Macau .. Here we can watch House of dancing water performance .. staff is good room is excellence . Swimming pool also superv.  One of my favourite hotel in Macau . Shuttle bus to ferry terminal is frequent . The only thing need improvement is shuttle bus to sintra .. need more bus and frequency especially during peak season,50
"for relaxing trip, Grand Hyatt offer a great great room with twin bed, you can separate the ""fun"" and ""sleeping"" region. With a large couch next to the window, great washroom. Fantastic. With only around HKD1,000. Exceptional!",50
"Stayed at the GH Macau with family for a just a night but will be sure to extend my stay next time I am in Macau and enjoy the fantastic facilities offered . The staff was most welcoming , well trained and friendly adding to a most wonderful time .",50
"Thank so much for your kind arrangement during my stay in Grant Hyatt, my family had a wonderful stay and my son spent a great birthday in your hotel. :) Please accept my deep thankfulness for you and your team especially to Ms. Celina, I am very impressed with the fine service all you provided. I will look forward to next stay in Grand Hyatt soon. :)",50
"Stayed here a few times over the years and have to say it's very hard to fault. This time around was in a club room and had access to the club lounge which is definitely worth the extra - breakfast included, afternoon snacks plus drinks and ""canapes"" which could reaplce dinner later in the day!  Special thank you to Peggy Yu and your Indian chef in the Club Lounge who were a delight to deal with. They were so friendly and helpful!",50
We booked a Grand suite at a very reasonable price and the size and quality of the suite and hotel exceeded our expectations. Very good value considering that we just came from HK where we paid more than double for an equivalent suite.,40
Have. Reviewed many 5 stars hotels as a rated Senior Reviewer but this one has one of the best ratings I can give all round. Beat most of the Grand Hyatt's I have stayed in terms of design and functionality of the Fountain view Suite I stayed in. Black out curtains worked perfectly   Lightings well designed and provided great ambience. Bathroom was exceptional. Review by Giamdoc ,50
"I stayed at Grand Hyatt Macau for a total of two nights and it was one of the best experiences ever. Friendly staff, clean rooms, and amazing quality of food in the Lobby Lounge and the Beijing Kitchen. If I have to visit Macau again, I will definitely stay at Hyatt again.",50
"For me your hotel is very good except for some minor things that must be addressed because of the wear and tear on the things oftenly used by your customers.  The SPEAKERS inside your Comfort Room must be checked regularly and make sure that your technicians put WD40 to the knobs to ensure that their will be no noise coming out of the speakers when turning the knobs to louder voice.  Secondly, the most common problems is the bed cushion which has a deep dent on each side of the bed and which is not comfortable to sleep on it and if someone has back problem, it will be very hard for him/her to sleep on your bed.  One advice if you are going to change your bed cushions is to buy the HARD CUSHION which will last longer and will make us customers sleep well.  Thank you for your kind…",40
"Great hotel with lots of facilities around. Very spacious room and nice temperature & great & comfortable beddings. Location was convenient and really happening venue. It's so easy to get around because shuttle buses easily available. Hotel do provide free shuttle from hotel basement to Zhuhai. It's really convenient.  Staff was really friendly, ready to answer to all questions. Staff makes you feel so comfortable with your stay and hospitality was perfect.",50
"Wow.  It was our anniversary, and when we arrived, Celina had a flower ready for my wife, and cake sent up.  She spent over half an hour giving us recommendations, a tour, and making reservations to events and restaurants on our behalf.  She was really friendly and helpful and was by far the most amazing hotel welcome ever.  The rooms here are great, they provide great views of the strip and of the skyline, and are extremely clean, modern, comfortable.  This is an amazingly classy hotel for a very affordable price.  The location is great, it is part of the City of Dreams trio, so it is super fun just to walk around the casinos and shops and restaurants downstairs.  There are lots of cute, interactive exhibits there too, like the virtual puzzle wall where you make poses to make…",50
"Early evening, we arrived at the Grand Hyatt Macau, welcomed by the sumptuous setting of the lobby and greeted by smiles on amiable staffs. We came to try out the delicate cakes at their patisserie after a long day. Sitting in any table you could have a view of the hotel’s industrial design. The seal brown armed sofa and its distance between the low tables were comfortable. The eclectic menu includes Cha Chaan Teng comfort dishes, western preferences and variety of drinks. We ordered gateaux and fresh fruit yogurt blends. We were satisfied with the richness of taste of the refreshments. I truly appreciated how the servers silent refilled my glass of hot water. Not to mention, having DJ spinning relaxing vibes was definitely the icing on the cake.",40
"Very nice room, spacious and comfortable. Bath room is huge and funtionable, love the oval bath tub. The mattress is very firm and comfy, linens are extremely comfortable, we had a very good sleep. Nespresso machine and Chinese tea leaves are a plus! ",50
"First I want to say I've lived in and been all over mainland China. From small villages to mega cities. I understand the culture and appreciate its diversity.  However, when it comes to my stays at 5 star western branded hotels I tend to pick them to get away from the social graces or lack there of most mainlanders.   As a Diamond Hyatt member I have had the privilege to stay at many Hyatt's across China and the world.   The entry to this property is ASTOUNDING. HUGE entryway greets you at the center of City of Dreams.  As Christmas was just around the corner the hotel had decorated the property with very unique and ornate Christmas trees.  Awesome touch.   I checked in on the 37th floor. Where I was warmly greeted. The staff was friendly and extremely attentive.   The Club…",40
"The service at the grand club was great. The staff was attentive  and they did everything to try and make my stay as personable and warm as possible.   I asked for a macau sim and they had one for me immediately. At first it wasn't getting data and the club concierge did everything to fix it by calling ctm customer service and getting everything sorted out. This for me is going the extra step that will keep me coming back. I wish I could remember the staffs' names who helped me, but really everyone was great! Thank you Grand Hyatt!",50
"We planned to stay one night at Grand Hyatt Macau, but do to the typhoon Haima we had to stay one more night as we couldn't go back to Hong Kong. The hotel manager did a really great job helping us with the reservation change with our hotel booked in Hong Kong, and not only her but all staff were very kind and helpful.This hotel is really beautiful, we loved the lobby with the gorgeous flowers arrangement and we also loved the relaxing swimming pool area. The hotel is conveniently located next to the House of Dancing Water theatre and close to other casinos.The room we had was a standard one but it was very spacious - compared to Hong Kong - and well appointed, we really enjoy its big bathroom. During our stay we tried two restaurants, Mezza 9 which was a surprisingly good…",50
"We stayed 2 nights.  Room was excellent & great views.  Service at check-in was excellent & the Concierge was the most helpful I had experienced, thank you Maggie.  Breakfast was excellent & service from Randy & Peggy was fabulous.  I could not fault this Hotel.  My son checked out the Gym & was very impressed with the facilities & used them each morning.  Our room was cleaned and blinds closed when we returned at the end of each day.  We booked in advance to watch the show ""House of Dancing Water"" and it was well worth seeing & is located at the Hyatt.  After the show we had dinner at Jin Ying, the food was great, but I can't say the same about the service.  We were served by Fanny & found her to be rude.  We noticed she set the tables for Asian customers but ignored Europeans.…",50
"An excellent 5 star restaurant for the price... Love it... Staffs are generally friendly... There is good number of restaurants within the complex... I especially like the bar at night which play a mix of Chinese Orchestra instrument, piano and violin into a mix of Chinese pop songs and western classical music...",40
"My usual experience of the Grand Hyatt chain is excellent. In this case the location and service are both great, with lots of attentive staff. The rest however was mediocre compared with that which one should expect from the Grand Hyatt. Room was ok, food a bit disappointing. Had a lovely morning jog around Cotai though.",30
"I highly recommend Grand Hyatt Macau for anyone holding business meetings.  The guest room is clean, big and nice.  Service staff is friendly and helpful. Function room is very ideal for meetings and quality of food is excellent.",50
"I booked a room there to celebrate my anniversary with my wife, and as i contacted the hotel to assist in certain arrangementa, their response was quick, and their service was superb, highly recommend",50
"Awesome location. Awesome property ... Amenities and rooms fantastic, modern and very clean. Restaurant buffet cook to order is very unique, GM was very accommodating, and food was fantastic.... Even for a buffet. Everyone was extremely helpful, courteous and knowlegable.",50
"We stayed at Grand Hyatt for 3 nights. There were 3 of us, I requested for a roll away bed quite last minute but there were no problems and the bed was set up for our arrival. I have nothing bad to say about this hotel to be honest.  -Our room was super spacious and clean. The staff were lovely and helpful. I think this is the hotel where we have never been disturbed at all. Usually, in the middle of the day there would be a knock on the door for house keeping but nope.. Our room was always cleaned when we came back though.  -The hotel itself is huge!! It's connected to Hard rock and City of dreams, so combined.. There's so many restaurants to choose from!  -We had in room dining and the food was delicious.  -The pool area was always quiet which is a bonus. There's 4 individual…",50
"During the last years Grand Hyatt Macau is one of my favorite places to stay when visiting the region. This time I had  a two nighter in Macau.  Booked via hyatt.com. Club room.  Checkin and out: At club level (37th). Very friendly welcome. I'm always surprised how family like the club team act. All easy going, quick, perfect.  Room: Excellent rooms, lot of space, clean, quiet, nice view, huge bath room, perfect bed.  Location: Easy to access by coach. Close to Taipa harbour terminal  Club lounge: Very nice selection of food and beverages. But the team is outstanding. It is like being with family and friends. For me a place to relax, work, meet business partners, and just to have a good time.  Gym and pool: Gym is ok, never crowded. Pool is perfect for a work out, but also for…",50

"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt for a girls long weekend and had a corner suite on 23rd floor.  The view was magnificent and the room was beautiful, nice and roomy for three girls.   We had a separate lounge area and the bathroom was huge.  Beautiful freestanding bath with a view, double sinks, complimentary use of bathrobes, slippers etc.  Service was excellent and staff were extremely helpful and always smiling.  Lounge on 37th floor is nice and quite for a drink and something to eat.   While we were here we didn't pay for anything, we had the free drinks and canapes and then an included breakfast in the morning.  Couldn't recommend this hotel enough, and would love to come back.  Special mention to Randy for advising us on where to go and visit.",50
"Stayed as a Diamond Hyatt member and received exceptional treatment. Room was a Corner Suite.  All staff were attentive, friendly and more than happy to assist with every request. Special mention to Florence Lou who proactively greeted us in the main foyer, escorted us to the club lounge for check-in, referred to us by name the entire time and was able to assist with all queries and questions throughout the process. Because of her exceptional service on arrival, we knew we were in for a great stay.  The club lounge is certainly the best I've every enjoyed. The food and drink selection was great, the view fantastic and the staff excellent.  One chef (who was very enthusiastic to discuss the Indian cricket team with us) took particular care to help with food allergies of one our…",50
"We were redeeming hotel loyalty points and with the aim of touring Taipa (the big name casino resorts and local Portuguese restaurants) and watching ""Thriller Live"" (playing for a limited duration at the Parisian nearby). As such there was no time to try or comment on the general facilities (gym, pool and breakfast). Anyways, here it goes:  Likes: - Excellent service (from the doormen greeting you with a smile as you come out of the taxi to the general security staff to the check-in team). - The location (in the City of Dreams area, opposite the new Wynn Palace, and walkable to the attractions at the Venetian and Parisian but also away from the circus frenzy of day trippers and tourists). Given this was a 48 hour weekend trip from HK, we wanted to avoid staying at the hustle and…",50
"Grand Hyatt is always my first choice when going to Macau because I want to stay in a hotel with less crowd.  Aside the Club Lounge is really good in terms of view, comfortability, service and food.  I travelled with different group of friends and stayed there several times and their comments were good.    Except one thing, room assignment was inconsistent, as a repeated guest and a member of loyalty program, I would expect they could understand my preference better but during the last two trips it was not so measure up to my expectation.  I would recommend others to book the room at Grand Club Tower so that you can use the Grand Club which is the best one amongst all Hyatt properties I stayed before.  Comparing to other resort compound, it has less facilities for kids.  If you…",50
Went there after the grand opening and got the bye one get one room ...swimming pool at the roofop area is almost look like connected to the sea!its soo great to  feel that way!  breakfast was excellent!,50
"this was our 1st stay at Grand Hyatt in Macau and it turned out to be a great decision. it is an excellent property, amazing staff. we made the reservation directly with the Hyatt hotline and 2 people handled our reservation - Sarah and Ally. both displayed amazing attitude, very attentive and responsive to our requests. upon check in, we were pleasantly surprised with upgrade to suite on high floor (31st) without asking. it is huge by any standards with great view of the airport and wynn palace with wonderful music/ dancing fountain at night. Hyatt is known for its well trained staff and this place scores very highly. we had issues with aircon on the 2nd day but it was attended to very promptly. Carmen at the concierge/ guest relations is very prompt and professional in her…",50
"Front Desk Agent was extremely helpful and service-minded. Lobby was a bit dark but comfortable. The decoration of flowers are impressive. Visited Beijing Kitchen for dinner and it was excellent. Room was simple but spacious. Easy access to other properties in Cotai. Except for long taxi queue, everything is excellent !",40
Having stayed at the Grand Hyatt in Macau on several occassions the service has always been good however it seems they have stepped it up to a new level since the renovations last year. Upgrading to the Club Tower room was a good idea and offered a relaxing area on the 37th floor with drinks and food in the afternoon plus a good choice of options for breakfast. Unlike many lounges breakfast is available until 11am weekdays and noon on weekends so there is no rush after a late night out.,50
You can get Excellent and Professional services here!!!  Check-in services are top notch!!  Don't be surprised if u get free upgrade of your room.  Swimming pools are in good shape.  Definitely a superb hotel in the area.  My family enjoy a lot and will definitely come back.,50
"This hotel takes guest service to a new level - You have to experience it to believe it - especially in the Grand Club Lounge!  The rooms are very spacious - exceptionally well laid out with a large bathroom, wonderful rain shower (do request non smoking specifically if needed as it was for us).  Location is very convenient to other properties on the Cotai Strip - and right next door to the dancing fountains.",50
Grand Hyatt Macau offers an unique relaxing holiday opportunity amid the noisy and busy environment of casino gambling.  A touch of business approach value add to the overall atmosphere. The Club Lounge located on top floor  with both indoor and outdoor sections is absolutely outstanding;   the serving team is courteous and efficient! The Olympic size outdoor heated pool is must to try.,50
Overall satisfied  with the service and the stay and will come again and also will recommend my other friends and colleagues to visit and stay in the hotel. Amazing fun and experience staying in Grand Hyatt macao,50
This is our fifth stay at this very well designed and spacious hotel. It is not a hotel with great views but that doesn't matter it's interiors make up for it. You are not far away from the shopping and casinos and the brilliant House of Dancing Water show is just next door .  Lately we have chosen to stay in the club level rooms which even for just one night give you the feeling you have escaped for a relaxing break.  The food and wine throughout our stay was excellent.  The staff are very responsive offering a drink on our arrival at check in and no request is too much trouble.  I particularly enjoyed the pool which at 40 meters long is ideal for lap swimming.   I have also on previous visits eaten at their in house restaurant Made in Beijing and Mezza - they are both…,50
"I used to travel to Beijing and there's this lady butler, Yolanda who was very attentive, polite and more importantly warm. I was sooo happy to see her at the Front Desk here and instantly she recognised me and offered her undivided attention & services to me.",50
We stayed in the Grand Suite and it was an unforgettable experience. It was a huge space with excellent views. The lounge area was an excellent addition. The plush robes were so nice after a long bath. A decadent experience.,50
"There is absolutely nothing negative to say about Grand Hyatt Macau If/when we'll be back in Macau, we'll choose Grand Hyatt Macau again. I'd recommend to consider you to upgrade to a ""Club"" room. This grants access to the lounge, where pampering is second to none in that price range. Loved it!!!",50
My family enjoy the time for staying at this hotel. The staff is very friendly. We met one Taiwanese staff during the checking time. It made me more warmer. My baby like their swimming pool. we had a great time there,40
"Had a really nice stay, beautiful suite, and beautiful view from my room that I could enjoy the dancing water from Wynn Palace. Also thanks for the birthday cake, so yummy :) definitely will stay here again, two thumbs up !",50
Chose the Grand Hyatt in Macau for my first stay in Macau. After touring the other hotels I was glad I chose this hotel. The level of personal attention and service was second to none. It is in a great location.  Randy in the club lounge deserves a special mention as he was extremely helpful and always stopped for a chat and made great recommendations such as visiting Lord Stow's Bakery in Coloane Village.  The complimentary bottle of red was well received and enjoyed whilst watching the awesome fountains on display right outside the window.  The rooms are beautifully appointed and the attention to detail is first rate.  All the staff are great and will always help.  Highly recommend this hotel for a stay in Macau.  ,50
"This was the first time I stayed at Grand Hyatt Macau. The purpose of this trip was to celebrate my dad's birthday. I booked the Grand Offer package which includes one-night accommodation in a Grand Deluxe Room, daily breakfast for two, complimentary designated minibar items, laundry services and dinner buffet. Before our arrival, I sent an email to the hotel and inform them about the purpose of my trip. Ms. Ally Ng, the team leader of guest contact centre, replied my email and said that they would prepare a small birthday cake to give a surprise to my dad. Ms. Ng even booked a table for the buffet dinner before I asked her to arrange it. Very proactive! I would also like to take this opportunity to express my most sincere thanks to Mr. Marc Hong to arrange an upgrade of our…",50
"Very friendly Grand Club staff who assisted for a brief check-in/out, good conversationalists in the lift and gave useful travel advice before departure. In-room Entertainment system offers a huge number of options, and the amenities were everything I needed and more. Definitely feel more than welcome to stay again!",50
Stayed in this hotel for 3 days. I can say service here is up to standard of most hyatt hotels. Everyone seemed very helpful. I remember a few of their staffs that made my stay pleasant. I definitely recommend this hotel! Thank you hyatt for the experience.   ,30
"We stayed here in an attractive suite that protruded from the main part of the building so as to offer a 270 degree view of the surroundings, which are partly casino hotels and partly construction wasteland.  Unlike any Hyatt I've previously encountered, there was no desk to place a laptop and work from.  The coffee table became my desk, and   laptops were charged bedside while resting on chairs.  This property is overwhelmingly utilized by mainland Chinese tourists.  We saw only one other Westerner during our four night stay and westerners are a rarity in the rest of Macau also.  I was accordingly surprised at the western food offerings at the Grand Club.  They aren't outstanding overall, as I've enjoyed in more cosmopolitan Asian Grand Hyatts, but they're very good given the…",50
"Nice and comfortable room. Easy access to downtown by the shuttle service offered by the City of Dreams. We were greeted by a friendly staff. She was really nice and tell us all the information we need. Concierge too, very professional.",50
"Here for two nites for conference and team building. Upgraded to a big suite. Spacious. Comfy bed. Good toiletries. But irritating smell in the living room. I suspect there were people who smoked in the room before and the hotel tried to clear it up...anyway, strong chemical smell. Luckily it was not in the bedroom.   Breakfast average. Given the things you can do in macau hotels, grand hyatt seems below par. Shopping areas big but all the big brands and no customers.   Maintenance and customer service needs to be strengthened. Staff who checked me out did not look at me, did not say thank you but just 'he yi' -- ""ok"" in putonghua!!  Frequent customer to grand hyatt. Have to say i am surprised by the service. ",30
"i have been at grand hyatt last month for a couple of days nice room warm and friendly welcoming but crowded of chinese people coming from mainland  I stay at grand club privilege and the breakfast room was full of chinese coming from the mainland who shamelessly ate as if they were at home, sucking food loudly and sometimes spitting in the pot big family with a lot of child making noise never seen such a thing in the Hyatt hotel category I was  last year at  conrad macau but guests were very polite I asked for an explanation of such behavior and they said: what you want this is  a casino resort strongly not recommended for european and western",40
"We really enjoyed the two nights we spent at the Grand Hyatt Macau. Our suite was large, clean, very relaxing and the service is great. There are lots of great restaurants and shopping in the adjacent complex. We were psyched to find a branch of the Din Tai Fung dumpling restaurant there and highly recommend it. We also loved the House of Dancing Water show at the nearby City of Dreams - we had no idea what to expect but it was a dazzling spectacle unlike anything we've ever seen. Worth the price of admission! The Grand Hyatt Macau is a great home base to explore it all.",50
"Grand Hyatt Macau has all of it was satisfactory. The room was too nice all the facilities condition and prospects, customer service, amenities, location and a pool. Lounge Check-in and check-out service and happy hour gave me comfort. To be able to take advantage of the free shuttle bus, you can go anywhere in Macau.",50
"It's the first time for us to stay there for a short leisure family break lured by an unbeatable offer of a summer package including MOP800 meal credit per booking.  This hotel is undoubtedly with a sleek and gorgeous Grand Hyatt DNA.  The impressive experience started from the detailed service above other busy crowded Macau casino hotels in the same business arena.  The staff from Front Desk were so helpful, once again, unlike other busy Casino hotels focusing on quantity.  I must give a 'LIKE' to the thoughtful fish-bone layout design giving a structured flow and privacy plus convenience for guests waiting for attentive service and check-in.  We eventually took a staff member's recommendation to use the MOP800 dining credit as dinner for two at mezza9 (c.f. regular price at…",40
"My wife and I booked two nights at the Grand Hyatt Macau to celebrate my wife's birthday.  We stayed in a Grand Suite in the Grand Tower, and our stay is what we have come to expect from Hyatt -- quiet, refined, and comfortable.  The Grand Suite is large -- we had a nicely appointed living room, a large bedroom with a king-sized bed, and a large bathroom (separate shower and bathtub, two sinks, great amenities).  The room was very quiet, which is important to us, and the bed was super comfortable.  The air conditioning in the room was easy to control and it worked flawlessly.  Given that the outside temperatures were 34 to 36 degrees, we wanted cool, dry air the minute we stepped in the room -- exactly what we got.  Our room came with complementary WiFi, and like everything else…",50
"Modern hotel, nice rooms, attentive staff. My wife and I came here for a relaxing extended weekend from HK. We loved the club lounge with very welcoming and attentive staff. The view is great and the food is even better. The selection is varied and fresh. We would definitely come back again. Oh yeah.... The pool is awesome!",50
"It's been years and this is the only hotel in Macau I'd stay with. Best services, friendly and welcoming hotel staffs and definitely always doing their best at the interest of their guest. Very clean and beautiful modern hotel.   Special thanks to Yolanda and the Chief Concierge for being such warm hosts for my last visit.   Never fail to impress me.  Keep it up!",50
I recently stayed at this property for two nights and it was great. This is my second time staying here. I booked a Grand Club Room. It is definitely worth using extra points or a little bit more money to get the club access. They have breakfast and a almost a full meal of dinner. The property is beautiful with great amenities. The spa is really nice and also the swimming pool and the hot tubs are to die for. Especially a night time swim. The hotel is very close to The Venetian and connected toThe City Of Dreams complex. There are free shuttle buses to everywhere in Macau. I do have to highly recognize for two employees for going way above and beyond for making my stay great.Sabrini who is a front desk supervisor went way above and beyond to rectify a situation at check in and…,50
"I travel with 2 kids, 5 & 3 years old. I always look for better hotel to stay. 1st consider location which Grand Hyatt is good, connect with lots of different restaurants. So that easy for parents to choose food for child. 2nd is entertainment, here has a playroom for child which suits they needs. I like to highlight our dinner last night. We had buffet at Mezza9. It's always full house but I tried to walked in, I noticed it's really full. The manager offer a table for us, he considered I have 2 kids & he didn't like to decline hotel guest. Very helpful staff & attentive. Food is fresh & lots of seafood, dessert are nice too. We had a happy meal. ",40
"It was a super nice I would like to say didnt expect it would be my best stay in hotel ever in my life me and my wife enjoy everything about the hotel so much they got everything u need nice and clean room, friendly staffs, casino, food, transportation free wifi every corner everything u need and want they have",50
My all time favorite in Macau!!! Fantastic service and very good clean room. Beijing restaurant just at the lobby is also the best especially the Peking duck. Breakfast is fair but service make it all up. Very comfortable bed. Everything that I need from this hotel has not disappoint me before. ,50
We got the magic show room package.  The room overlooking the airport was large and fun to be in.  The hotel is very cold and apart from some flowers in the lobby feels very cold.  No attention to detail in the room or the service and some frontline staff rather impolite.    Large pool and friendly pool staff an oasis of calm.  T  he breakfast is extensive and cappuccino a pleasure.  Great place to take your mother in law; big enough to get lost and unfriendly enough to discourage her from meeting up with you soon.,30
Huge and well appointed room in this quality hotel.  Complimentary New York Times paper or digital edition also provided.  The hotel mostly seems to cater to Chinese gamblers coming from the mainland and it is a bit lacking in character. The hotel is some distance from the major historic attractions but are only a taxi ride away.  ,50
Upgraded to a nice corner room. Large bathroom and sofa seating area. Good walk in closet and storage area. Bathroom has double sinks and separate toilet and huge bath/shower room with views (all glass divided). Very comfy and worth booking the larger room if you can afford it. Hotel is connected to the City of Dreams casino and shopping mall. The Hard Rock Soho food court and bar area worth a visit.,50
"Been awhile since I’ve been in Macau and there’s been an explosion of international brand hotels here.  The Grand Hyatt lives up to its reputation with excellent service and beautiful décor.  It is unfortunate that I was only able to stay for 1 night in the grand suite king room.    The room was large with a living and dinette area.    Received good service from the staff all around, from the bell desk, concierge to the front desk.  The front desk staff were exceptional and always a pleasure to deal with; they accommodated my requests for a room with good views, late check out etc.   The hotel shopping area is undergoing some renovation, so at times you could hear pounding & hacking noises in the room.  But no noise during morning or night.    To me, City of Dreams seem to be…",50
"it is a birthday trip with my lover. The concierges are very nice and friendly who remind us on the special-themed buffet held in the hotel and arrange the birthday cake and breakfast for us. The view of our room in grand club tower is amazing because we can watch the landing off and taking off of  planes as well as the beautiful view of Pearl River. The service in Mezza9 restaurant is very good especially Mr Hudson who gives an detailed explanation on the theme of ' DINING FROM THE KITCHEN' at the restaurant . Although the grilled fish is a little bit raw which is a rare mistake found in famous restaurant like MEZZA9  , they helped us to grill more time after we express our opinion and the overall service can outweigh the unhappiness caused by the fish.All in all, the stay is…",50
"We visited Macau for the first time and enjoyed The House Dancing Water. Extraordinary!!! Fabulous!!  We stayed at the Club suite with access to the club lounge. It was worth the extra money as we had access to cocktails in the afternoon, exclusive breakfast area on the top floor and comfortable suite facing the huge swimming pool with wonderful jacuzzis. The room was spotless clean and the support from the reception. Very sophisticated.  Breakfast area was up on the 37th floor with nice views and sofas were we could comfortably have a well prepared food! At the evening time, we enjoyed casino in the hotel. Very safety, so just female group can enjoy black jack.  I strongly recommend the hotel for leisure.",50
"I lived in 17/F which is a smoking floor, with a good and beautiful view. The facilities inside the room is excellent, especially for the decoration. It is modern design with clean and elegant atmospheric feel.The whole hotel crew is very polite, professional and performing very good services. The only thing disappointed me is still the drinks and snacks provided in the mini bar are not free and very expensive.",40
"We visited Macau for the third time and decided to finally go to the famous The House Dancing Water. Extraordinary!!! Fabulous!! Definitely worth the pricey tickets on A zone..  A weekend at The Grand Hyatt Hotel was a birthday gift for my wife (and ourselves, of course...).  We stayed at the Club suite with access to the club lounge. It was worth the extra money as we had access to cocktails in the afternoon, exclusive breakfast area on the top floor and a very very comfortable suite facing the huge swimming pool and Hard Rock Cafe Building. The room was spotless clean and the support from the reception guys were very personal. After the check-in he accompanied us to our room to make sure we had everything we needed. Breakfast area was up on the 37th floor with nice views and…",50
"We had a very satisfactory stay in Grand Hyatt Macau.  We received warm welcome and service by the front desk staff.   Every staff is friendly indeed.  Even the lady at the swimming pool is very helpful and friendly.  Special thanks to Ms. Sara Tang for arranging the birthday cake, fruits.. for my dad.  We sang birthday song and enjoyed our small celebration in the room which added more sweet memories for our trip. The deluxe suite is very spacious, clean and well maintained. The bathroom with the big bath tub and strong hot water flow is great.  The Nespresso machine is a real plus!!    The hotel is located right at the circle of all the famous hotels and is so convenient to travel around by the free shuttle buses.  We will certainly recommend to our friends to stay here.",50
"Overall the food is nice here, but this experience reminded me why I seldom come to have afternoon tea. SERVICE!!! While we raising up our hands for more than 10s, i thought the server saw us already, but actually they are still talking with other. When we have finished our dishes and drinks, they just collected the empty plates while leaving the empty cups on the table, didn't ask if we still need any food or drinks or even just need water or not. They waiting till we asking them for water. Later, I raising up my hands for the menu again, they keep on talking to each, I'm really wondering why need so much talking in order to just give me a menu??? then I knew that they are wondering we want the bill or menu, isn't it more efficient to approach the guest for what they really…",10
"Great location, wonderful friendly staff.  Nice clean room. I was lucky to get a upgrade to a fantastic suite which was gratefully accepted. Nice and clean and with all the facilities you need and expect. Lovely fresh linen and a very comfortable bed!",50
"We booked for one night to take our children to see House of Dancing Water (which they loved - despite them both being under 4 yrs old). Following day we let them loose in Kids City which is adjacent to the swimming pool (unfortunately not well-signposted but we found it eventually!).  We stayed on a Club floor (as part of the hotel show package) which gave us Lounge access - and I have to say it is the most child-friendly club lounge I have experienced.  The staff went out of their way to indulge the children during a long breakfast sitting! In fact, the staff throughout the hotel - and especially in the lobby - made our short stay memorable for the children and for us.  We will definitely be back for another family getaway.",50
"spent two evenings at the hyatt as we are long term clients  of all the hyatts worldwide we have never had a more enjoyable stay staff were amazing, anticipating all of our needs and fulfilling every part of their job way beyond expectations special thanks to revel,phoenix, and angel who were typical of the entire staff we met cannot speak  highly enough of the whole establishment",50
"Excellent hotel with a luxurious feel. Spacious room and bathroom. Macao is a paradise with a load of 4 and 5 star hotels, so it can be hard to make a choice. I think Grand Hyatt has a geat price quality rate for the area.",50
"Outdoor Jacuzzi is very good, I love coming to the pool in the summer, because it is great for swimming, the pool staff very friendly, very attentive, thank them for their service. Next time will come again.",50
"I am a little tardy with this review so my apologies for that. The Grand Hyatt Macau is located within the City of Dreams in Taipa, Macau. Most visitors will arrive in Macau at one of the ferry terminals. We took the ferry from HKIA directly to Taipa and had about a 10 minute ride to the Grand Hyatt. This is a beautiful hotel located in the City of Dreams. When you first enter the hotel, the lobby is stunning with a big open ceiling, fountains, and giant staircases. The front desk staff were friendly, professional and incredibly helpful. After a very smooth check in we were escorted to our room, which had been upgraded to a Grand Executive Suite, I think the room was bigger than the first home i ever owned. The Grand Club was amazing for both breakfast and happy hour, and had…",50
"I've been a fan of the Hyatt for the longest time and its one of the top choices where ever I travel. The Macau's grand Hyatt is no exception and if anything it raises the bar even more.   We had stayed in the Grand Deluze and the one thing that gets to you immediately is how large the room is. Its not often I'm surprised on the size of the hotel room but this was a very very (yes I had to say it twice) comfortable sized room.   The amenities in the room we're spot and it'd have been easier for them to chuck in a couple of coffee sachets but the Nespresso machine was a very nice touch. Its these attention to the finer detail which make the Hyatt such a great hotel to stay in.   We arrived in Macau via Ferry from HK and it was a few minutes by cab to the hotel, I believe if…",50
"This is Grand Hyatt, so needless to say that the staff is superb, facilities are topnotch and food is scrumptious. The location is great. I loved the pool and jacuzzi area.. And if you want to gamble a little carry ID proof with you (if you look young like me 😀)   I recommend it. ",50
"My mother and I stayed at this hotel in the beginning of May for the holidays. It was the first time to visit Macau for my mother and she was quite satisfied with our stay at Grand Hyatt Macau.   The hotel is loacted in the Taipa area which is near the Macau international airport. It takes about 10 mins from the airport to hotel by car and there is a free shuttle bus every 10 mins, 24 hrs. So, it is quite convenient to move to the hotel from the airport  and any other area like Cotai or Coloan village. I guess it will be more easier after the LRT, Light Rail Transit, start running in 2019.  Reception and the lobby is in the 1st floor and it is quite huge and spacious with the lounge and there is a Chiness and Western fusion band performing every night and I just loved their…",40
"I have stayed Four Seasons, Ritz Calton, Marriott, and other five star hotels in Macau. I dare to say that Grand Hyatt Macau is the best choice for your money. Professional Concierge, Devotional EFL Staffs. It would be tough for you to find out any flaws on your future stay.",50
"If you are traveling for business purpose, Grand Hyatt Macau is absolutely THE one for you. If you are for show purpose, the famous ""dancing water"" show is just in the hotel, which is super convenient if you want to dress-up and go there or return your room quickly. Some famous shows are near-by. The hotel also provides FREE shuttle buses to almost every attractions and all casinos. We didn't spend money on transportation during our 3-days trip! I've stayed in several Hyatts, no doubt their gyms are always the best equipped amount the rest in their city. If you want to keep on your regular work-out schedule, Hyatt is again the reason you should choose. Front desk receptionists and guest care officers are very attentive, they approached to us spontaneously if we had any …",40
"The shuttle Bus which I took from the border with China does not unload the passengers by the main door of the hotel. The hotel is part of a complex of buildings. and for some reason I found myself in the lobby of another building, where no porters or helpers to be found. I asked the bus driver to take us to the main entrance but he refused and could not change the rules. So i Had to carry my own luggage for about 500 feet to the main reception. This would have been very annoying if I had more luggage, and very disturbing for  an old or disabled person. At the reception I was treated with a lot of care and consideration and was upgraded to a suite. All the staff are well trained and very courteous. The Buffet at the highest floor is very Chinese, does not provide  a good choice…",30
Wonderful big rooms and excellent attentive service. We Loved outside spa baths. Cocktails could be more consistent. Range of restaurants impressive. Close to all entertainment. We would like to thank Richard for his assistance.,50
"The hotel is easy to reach as they provide a complimentary shuttle to the ferry port. At the reception we received a warm welcome. Check-in was fast, everybody smiles and explains everything in detail. They are happy to provide help, whenever needed. All the employees are friendly and very well trained and their guest are clearly in their focus. Even we had a reservation by a travel agency with a very good price, we were upgraded to a suite. Room very big in size and equipped with everything required. Bathroom modern and stylish, with tub and rain-forrest shower. Amenities of good quality. Everything was spotless clean. The bed was very comfy. All-in-all a real 5-star hotel, not the one that you wonder where those stars are coming from. The only bad point is the location remote…",50
"We've got a very nice spacious room with a big and cool bathroom, but not so cool view (construction building process) Great Hotel, friendly staff, a lot of shops, casino, restaurants and night club. all thought",50
A beautiful room with an amazing bathroom.  Ask for a view overlooking the airport otherwise you will be looking over construction work.  Worth staying in the Executive level as the evening drinks and food is very special.,50
"Nothing much has changed since the last time I was in Macau nearly 10 years ago. The Venetian rocks. Forget the other casinos, go with the Venetian. If you play poker the Venetian has around 8-10 tables and waiting lists. They could fill 30 tables easily if they wanted to. Not sure why they don't but it's annoying to have to wait up to an hour to get a seat. Had a peek at the Grand Hyatt poker room and I think there was one table... The good thing about the Grand Hyatt is that it is short walking distance to the Venetian where ended up spending my time till the early hours.",40
"Large room on the 29th floor, well appointed, quiet, spotlessly clean. View of construction, but that could not be helped since construction was all around.   Club lounge staff was outstanding, particularly Dora. Evening cocktail hour was the high point of the day. Food was outstanding, variety and quality. Indian chef (sorry, I forgot his name) was very helpful.   The hotel location is not ideal, as it is far from anything except construction and a few other casinos. Need to decide whether you prefer the sanctuary of this fine establishment or the hustle and bustle of busy peninsular Macao. There's no right or wrong decision; personal choice.   Dave Huang, concierge, helped me sort out an airplane ticket problem. Intelligent and helpful guy.",50
"Staff members were always professional in their communication and behaviour. They made an effort to be personal towards us while doing their jobs. Staff members were especially good at listening to guests and responding appropriately. Rooms are generous and the Club Lounge is a very welcome retreat from the busy, noisy and crowded atmosphere outside.",50
"The Grand Hyatt in Macau is perfect for a relaxing break away from anywhere. The staff are very low key and extremely helpful and welcoming. The food and accommodation is first class. The Dancing With Water performance was outstanding. If you are on a business trip to nearby Hong Kong and need some time out from the frenetic activity there try Macau. The casino income allows the best staff to be employed, the best food to be prepared and luxury suites available at relatively inexpensive prices. There is no pressure to use the casinos and the whole place is very laid back. Perfect in a word",50
"As a frequent guest at Hyatt hotels around the world, I have high expectations which are always met by the Hyatt brands.  So when we stayed at the Grand Hyatt Macau I had the same high expectations.  What I didn’t expect was for them to be exceeded by my wildest expectations.  This was mainly due to the entire staff we encounter, from personalised check-in, through to the concierge, porters and the entire Grand Club staff. This first class service started well before we arrived, thanks to the highly efficient and helpful service from the e-concierge.  They arranged tickets for shows, tours and advice on what to see and do before we got there.  They answered all my queries so promptly which was very impressive and greatly appreciated.  Meeting the team when we arrived was also…",50
"My husband and I stay for 1 night to celebrate my birthday few days ago. The hotel noticed my stay is for celebration of my birthday so they offered a complimentary cake and upgrade of my room. We had a very pleasant time and comfortable stay and will highly recommend to others. Room - Clean and spacious, huge bathroom, comfortable bed Service - Excellent, staff are very friendly and attentive. Everything delivered on time like laundry, breakfast and the birthday cake, All the arrangements are monitored and they will make sure nothing has been missed. Hotel facilities - Since we are going on the weekdays so the hotel is not busy and we can totally enjoy the facilities like the gym room, swimming pool and outdoor jacuzzi. The outdoor jacuzzi is so impressive and the swimming pool…",50
"The second room like this and really pleasant to use. Last time I liked the view is tremendous good to see the night view view of the construction site because this time it did a lot of inconvenient. The main shopping areas of ... positions Xi'an Bell also walk for 5 minutes, and if arrive. The Venetian village next to the Galaxy and that what humans anyway ... not bad because everyone is a major tourist routes within walking distance. Shuttle also here there ganikka love. I stayed in a spacious suite twin I recommend ... It is expected to come even after use.",40
Consistent level of great service and wonderful accommodations throughout ALL Grand Hyatts - Macau was no exception. Our suite had a stellar bath tub and shower room! The Grand Club in Macau is one of the best we've been to from any Hyatt (only beat by the Grand Hyatt Singapore in our experience),50
Went here for my honeymoon it was a top notch resort! Five star service! My wife and I had an excellent time! The hotel is centrally located near all of the major/good hotels called the city of dreams. The spa was incredible and nothing I've ever experienced in my life. One of th vest spas I've ever been to! ,50
"This hotel is rather big like so many hotels in Macau and maybe therefore are lacking a bit the Grand Hyatt charm like other sister hotels. However, rooms are nice, with the usual great Hyatt amenities. Unfortunately some major construction next door which can affect ur stay in room or at the pool at certain times of the day.   Club lounge is excellent and the staff is very attentive and friendly, and I have to say one of the nicest designed club lounges I have seen so far.   Asked for a coffee at the pool but instead of a nice fresh coffee a brewed coffee in a thermos came via room service after waiting for 20 minutes - a bit strange.   Housekeeping would not clean the table in the room nor remove the used wine glasses from the day before - a bit strange for a hotel of this…",40
"A very typical Grand Hyatt Experience!!! Just as what I have expected. More importantly, this is very unlike some of the popular hotels in Macau where they are so packed with people gambling. You definitely won't see that in this hotel! Excellent!!",50
"Enjoyed great service from all staff. Room was very cleanand well furnished with many added facilities like coffee machine, tea supplies, etc. Hotel is conveniently located with good transport service and easy walking distance to nearby attractions and food outlets.",50
"Convenient location, much less crowded than other hotels around. Convenient access to tourists attractions. Quick response for email enquiry. Friendly and helpful staff in the lobby. It's just above the Hose of Dancing Water, and a large variety of choice of food available downstairs at the Soho. What's more, the children's playroom in the COD mall was the highlight for my child. Recommend for family trips or friends gathering.",50
"Was staying in hotel for a conference. My reservation was lost and at one point I was told that it is cancelled according to the voucher I provided- not the best experience after 26 h trip to get to Macau. Luckily my colleague was already in hotel, so I had to phone her, get her room number and somehow after that I got a  room. Considering that it was Sunday night its not the best experience, the same was at check out. Couldn't get deposit back even it was my credit card as for some reason the room was still not on my name. Other then that the rooms are nice, Internet is good, make sure that you request non smoking room as sometime ago they still use to smoke in hotel and now if you get such room which used to be smoking before its still smells really bad.",30
"To begin, a great welcome from Yan at the lobby and lead us to Eva (Grand Club) for our check in. We already feel at home! Eva lead us to our room 3266,  spacious, well appointed not to mention the view, it's just spectacular.  Not to be missed -experience the good foods at the Grand Club Lounge. Breakfast-dim sum on push cart, the serving staff will go table to table to let you chose. The fruits were all cut into bite sizes onto a cup for easy consumption.(how thoughtful)!  Hot stations are worth a try too-noodles and congee. Can asked to for veggie to be cooked separate as well.  Evening-they serve pork bun and fish bun (must try) and more than enough foods to keep you happy, no need to go for dinner elsewhere.  Must try the Latte and Cappuccino, asked for Peppermint tea or Pu…",50
Overall was great until you dine in Beijing Kitchen. Food was ok but waiting staff was lacking friendliness I did not feel welcomed at all. would never expect to experience the same at a world class venue like grand hyatt.,50
"I will strongly recommend to stay in Grand Hyatt enjoy pure vacation and leisure atmosphere and also gambling is 3 min away walk, which make hotel simple. All suite are big than I thought and from check in to check out and during stay, many staffs are concerned your status.",50
I would like to say Hyatt hotel is my best choice for business trip beacuse mostly Hyatt Hotel got the very good location and comfortable service and even very care about all guest all the servicer was perfect and great,40
"Grand Hyatt Macau is always my first choice when I travelled to Macau because of the physical environment and service standard.  The room is large and comfortable, service is attentive.  This time since I booked two rooms and there was a discrepancy between the room type and a few days before my arrival, the reservation department had sent me a note and gave me options on the room arrangement which I appreciate.",50
"The hotel is new in Macau which is a big benefit. Good and big rooms which is common in Macau. The hotel is located in the City of Dreams with a big casino, lots of restaurants and boutiques, and where you can watch famous water show. Chinese breakfast is the only disatvantage.",50
Was in Macao for 2 days of meetings.  The meeting facilities at the Grand Hyatt are 5 Star!  Attentive and friendly staff.  Very good food and beverage options/service.  The room was spacious and clean (great amenities).  The Club Lounge on the 37th Floor is the best I have ever seen globally at Hyatt properties.  Will definitely be back next time I am in Macau.,50
"Amazing hotel! Booked a ""standard"" room, which in Macau, means you get a suite with a separate living/dining area to the bedroom.  I wish I'd stayed in Macau for longer rather than just the 1 night!  Took the Ferry from HK and upon arrival (after clearing customs) it was really easy to find the COD Free bus shuttles. You just go to the last one, tell the driver your hotel name and off you go!  Really enjoyed it and it was close to other hotels such as the Venetian... Maybe it's not that close, but to get to it you just walk and walk inside the COD complex so it feels close hehe.  Bear in mind checkin is from 3pm and they're normally quite busy so it's unlikely you'll get an early checkin unless you pre-book from the night before.",50
"Have stayed in the Grand Hyatt for 4 times thus far, and every time I enjoy the moment I enter the room for the first time. The room feels so relaxingly spacious, it makes me forget my tiring travel in coming to Macau. The service is also impeccable from check-in to room service. I also like how the hotel, without a dedicated casino or a giant shopping mall, is in itself not a tourist destination, as people who come and go to the Hyatt are strictly hotel guests. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone thinking of staying near the area.",50
"Our stay was Great. Nice room. Fast WiFi. The location is nearly perfect. Many shops, casinos, entertainment and walking distance to other hotels. But I can't give a 5 (five). Repainting has been done spot areas which was easy to see from the bed! Most of the staff is very friendly but the amount that is NOT nice to too many. My wife said it well, ""They are not trained well, they behave like robots, they don't serve from heart"". At a hotel like Grand Hyatt the waitress should know that you serve ladies first. However a BIG THANK YOU to the India chef and the two ladys chefs that prepared the hot food and breakfast for us at CLUB FLOOR. You were GREAT.",40
We're so happy have a nice trip in Grand Hyatt Macau.  No matter of room services / dinning.   That's make us very highly appreciate.   We're aleady recommended to our friend.  We're looking forward for the next trip in Grand Hyatt Macau.,50
It's 5 star hotel located near the Venetian hotel. Everything was perfect. The stuff was so great and helpful. They clean the room twice a day it was a surprise. The breakfast was good too. We didn't go to the casino but they all around you :) We should come here again!,50
"we have been staying this hotel for many times. One of the best Hyatt around Asia in terms of service. Hotel staff are very helpful. The lounge is one of the best for both couple and family with kids  Also, the room is clean and modern. I can feel as if i am going back home.  The only drawback is lack of indoor swimming pool.",50
"Very nice hotel, great location with shopping centers, casinos, amusement, funs, etc. Yet service is just mediocre. During breakfast, when I requested to heat the famous egg tarts that I got from Macau downtown last night, they refused us despite we ordered food from them, and the microwave is right behind. Disappointed.",40
"We stayed there just before Chinese New Year for my birthday and it was lovely! We booked the club floor and when we arrived, they were all so helpful. The club floor was one of the best we've ever stayed in.  The staff were lovely and very friendly. I found them genuine and helpful.  The room was amazing, with a lush bathtub, great amenities and ambiance. I loved that they gave us some nespresso coffees, nice teas and some fruit.  We went for the evening cocktails for the club floor and that was a highlight. They had a well-rounded selection of food with Chinese fares such as congee and plenty of Western options, some healthy too.  The breakfast time was excellent, which again, many options and the chefs were very happy to help you with any requests. We loved our stay and will…",50
"Being a gold passport member, I always tend to book via Hotel website in order to get my best deal with my passport status, even sometimes I know it's not the cheapest deal. With the hotel's tracking of my stay history, I got upgraded to the suite room for 2 nights. I still see lots of amenities in room which suits leisure and business travelers which I do value as nowadays, many hotels are very cost cautious and just keep minimal amenities in room. I did not need everything they put in room, but just feel this is the right quality and quantity. Hotel staff are always friendly. Thanks the special CNY monkey plush set. They are lovely. Just love staying in Grand Hyatt when it is comparatively affordable!",50
"I stayed at the Macau Grand Hyatt for one night as part of my January pilgrimage to Macau to generate some much-needed cash to begin the year through a visit to the casinos. Despite being a Hyatt Diamond member, this was my first time at this property and I was mesmerised by the experience.  Upon check-in, the receptionist called the manager once he saw that I was Diamond on the system to come over and assist, and to greet me. She insisted on personally escorting me up the elevator to the Grand Executive Suite in which I would be staying. Upon opening the door, I was impressed. A large lounge room with an L-shaped sofa invited me in, with the room feeling very spacious despite it containing a roll-away for my friend. Through the doorway was a large bedroom which could easily be…",50
"The food was not good - salad was not fresh and food quality had dropped a lot comparing with my stay in Feb 2015. It does not support F&B promotion program of other Grand Hyatt. All hotels of Hyatt hotels in China, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok support F&B promotion program of other Grand Hyatt in China.",30
We have been fortunate to stay at Grad Hyatt Hotel in many countries and this newer property is one of the best. The level of service and attention to detail by the staff rivals that of the any of the worlds top hotels.,50
Stayed here for work last 2011 and was quite pleased with location - where all the new hotels are located.  Very spacious rooms and comes with great amenities and toiletries!  The best among the 3 hotels in city of dreams macau!,50
We have stayed for 1 night at the Grand Hyatt Macau. We arrived quite early and the room was not ready yet. We went to the old part of Macau and when we came back they gave us a free upgrade to one of their suites on the 18th floor. Worth waiting :-) We enjoyed the spacious room and the stunning view. Everything is super modern and very clean. I can totally recommend this Hotel !!,50
"We spent 3 wonderful nights here and the service is better than we have ever had anywhere in the world (we have traveled extensively). Club level, which we use, was amazing and once again the staff would go over and beyond to make sure you were completely satisfied. We would highly recommend this Hotel to anyone traveling to Macau and look forward to visiting there again.",50
"venue was very good both in both presentation and quality of rooms and public areas. Staff were very attentive, efficient and friendly. Location is central and gives easy access to other resorts and shopping malls. A really good experience which compares very favourably with all of the many hotels in which I have stayed across the world",40
"We spent three days at the Grand Hyatt Macau, and it was simply outstanding.  The property is gorgeous and well maintained.  The staff are friendly, courteous, and exceptionally well-trained.  The luxury lounge is absolutely worth the extra coin, and obviates the need for breakfast or dinner - the food selection and quality is just great.  Brilliant.",50
"We stayed at the Venetian macau for one night before coming to Galaxy for 2 nights. The Venetian upgraded us from our normal suite to the a higher suite, the room they gave us was huge, so my expectations for Galaxy was quite high and they did not dissapoint.  Galaxy is hands down the best hotel I have ever stayed in. We booked the Galaxy suite and was upgraded to the royal suite. The first words when entering the room was ""wow"". Molten brown amenities, free mini bar yes everything in the mini bar is free! A personal butler who purchased our movie tickets for us and then delivered the tickets to our room.    Every staff I came across was always smiling and happy to assist.   I look forward to staying at Galaxy Macau again.",50
"This was my 4th stay at Grand Hyatt Macau. Although there are many new hotels opened recently in Macau, I will continue to select Grand Hyatt Macau as my only choice when I return to visit Macau in the future. The modern contemporary design of the suites and friendliness of the staff made our stay very enjoyable.  I look forward to my next stay at your hotel, hopefully soon in the not too distant future!",50
"The hotel is at excellent location with lots of entertainment facilities and shows around. The room is clean and spacious. They also provide free shuttle buses to most location. In addition, there were free baby cot and bath tub provided. The staff are really helpful and sincere. We enjoy the stay and definitely will stay in this hotel again in future trip.",50
"We stayed on the Executive Suite. Everything was perfect from check in till the spacious room . However the breakfast experience in the club floor was disappointing. I was queuing for my sunny side egg. In front of me, was an Caucasian , your female young staff smiled n asked him to come back later. But for my turn, her face turned black n without any smile , she replied me in Cantonese come back later. Extremely disappointed, I wanted to know is she racist? Next I came back again and this time I asked for a bacon, your male staff without any smile again pick it up n drop it onto my plate . ",30
"This was not the first time that I stayed at this hotel, but the first time for a non business visit -- meaning that I had to pay this time out of my own pocket :)  The room was very comfortable and the lobby staff were very helpful.  There was only one shortcoming. We requested a non smoking room and they did provide a room that looking like a non smoking room, but the room was fully of aged smokey smell. We had to turn the air conditioning to very high to reduce that smell.  Since only staying for one night, did not ask for a room change, or else we would be spending hours on this. ",40
"We had a great stay and all the staff were friendly and well informed. Great service all the time. Excellent club floor and food in Beijing Kitchen was very good. Must try the Beijing Duck. Location of hotel is very good, central to all other hotels. Transport to other hotels and places were easily available and provided free of charge by the hotel. Overall a great hotel and highly recommended place to stay.",40
Just spent 2 days at this hotel. I could not find a single thing to fault. Rooms were fantastic. Staff were incredible. One of the Concierge team took us for a tour of the adjoining City of Dreams complex and arrange for show tickets for us. Another team member offered to go to the ferry terminal in his lunch break to sort out a ticketing issue. Brilliant experience. Best hotel that i have stayed with.,50
We decided to check into Grand Hyatt for a 1 day getaway to Macau as a family with 2 kids and 2 adults.  I was surprisingly shocked to find a GEM on Trivago and managed to book a suite for less than $300!!  I was pleasantly surprised to open the door to a very spacious suite.  The suite consist of a spacious living room with huge flat screen TV and a side bar console of coffee machine and a bar fridge.  I love the fact that Hyatt went the extra mile to provide 2 containers of chinese tea that is the unique kind and also have considerately stacked more creamer for my Nespresso coffee.  Thank you!  Then we enter into a huge luxurious twin bed overlooking the beautiful view and just below us is the view of the beautiful hyatt pool that just sparkled at night (too bad we didn't have…,40
"I was meant to come over by myself to Grand Hyatt Hotel in Macau,  being part of the City of Dreams complex.  Somehow my mom was also coming over separately and she felt rather comfortable to crash at my place - as apart from my huge bed,  there is ample rooms at the Lounge side with the big Sofa.   By rough estimates I think this Grand Suite Room can fit in 4 people easily and on week nights it is reasonably prices.   Most larger rooms offered are under $2,000 MOP.  The rooms are very clean and smoke-free,  the Swimming Pool below on the 3rd floor is a full scale size.    I think the Internet Connection works way better with my Laptop than my Mobile Phone however, this but they really need to improve as even the City of Dreams network is not too connectable compared to the…",50
"Haven't stayed here for a few years but enjoyed a very relaxing weekend here recently. Hotel still had a fresh new feeling. Location is at the rear of the City of Dream complex, but walking distance to all of the nearby complexes such as Venetian, Sands Cotai, etc. Friendly staff and very efficient check in, no time wasting at all. Fantastic, large, tastefully decorated room with nice touches such as phone charger provided. Nice bathroom with great rainwater shower. Our room was very quiet, loved the blackout curtains, we slept very well. Like many hotels in Macau this place is very large and can be a little impersonal - expect the occasional your group to come through - but overall a quality stay.",50
"I stayed here for a few days because I have Diamond status with Hyatt. The hotel is okay if what you're after is a clean, modern room near the casinos, but I was disappointed with its service and quality aspects. For one, the supposedly non-smoking room smelled of smoke. Secondly, my treatment at the spa was poor for the price (the massage therapist didn't seem professionally trained). The club lounge does have tasty food and good service, with very attentive staff. The pool area was empty, which is good if you want to be alone at the pool, but seemed a bit desolate. The hotel is far from the historic area of Macau. Overall, the Grand Hyatt seems good for people who are in Macau to gamble or shop, but wasn't for me as a tourist interested in more touristic activities.",30
"We booked 2 Grand Club rooms for 2 nights in October 2015. The rooms were spacious, with comfortable beds and large shower areas. Needless to say, the facilities in the rooms were excellent as was the Grand Club Lounge. The variety of food served during breakfast was especially notable.   But more importantly, the service in the hotel was impeccable, from check-in to check-out. The staff were friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. We asked for advice about food, shopping and sightseeing, and were not disappointed with the recommendations. On the day of our check-out, we had a very early ferry to catch and a sumptuous breakfast-to-go was prepared for us! A very special thanks to Cindy, Randy, Eva, Eagle and the other hotel staff that made our stay a truly memorable one.",50
"excellent services from hotel personnel, good environment and good view from hotel. The hotel is connected with two other hotels and sharing common facilities.  The kid's game centre is really fun and can take care of kids while parents can escape a while.  The swimming pool is outdoor and will be great during summer time.",50
"It was hard to get a room at the Hyatt but once you do, you are in for a total treat.  Excellent services all around.  Rooms are lovely and spacious.  Good gym and best grand club facilities I have seen globally.",50
Stayed here for business the Grand Club was extremely convenient for breakfast and evening work/drinks. Club lounge is on the 37th floor and affords great views of the surrounding Cotai strip. The breakfast starts early which is nice since most food purveyors don't open until 0900... even starbucks! Club staff was exceptional. All spoke english and engaged me in discussing food options.,50
"Stayed at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Cotai for work.  The hotel is part of the City of Dreams complex - connected to the casino, restaurants and shows.  Overall the hotel is very nice, rooms are clean and spacious.  The area is full of restaurants from casual to very fancy, so its a good option.  It is walking distance to the other Cotai resorts (though Galaxy may be a bit on the far side).    There are a lot of 5 star hotels in the immediate vicinity, and honestly, the quality is all pretty similar so depends on which chain you want to build rewards with the most.  If you have/want to build Hyatt rewards, go ahead and pick this one - rooms and service is comparable to any of the top hotels in Macau.",40
"We were arriving at around 4pm as we didnt realize the normal check-in time is 5pm. But they could still provide me a room for rest after sightseeing in the morning. The room was well-prepared with a variety of fruits. The view is so nice that is facing the pool.  It would be happy if they can also clearly stated what food and drinks will be charged inside the room as my mom and I were a little bit confused without instruction. Moreover, the height of the bed is too high which made my mom felt uncomfortable to sleep. Known that is difficult to change the fixed amenities but just mentioned to see if hotel will consider to improve it in the future.",50
Been in a number of grand hyatts for business. The rooms are great (my first time in Macau for business though) but maybe other hotels there are also good.I like the huge bathroom.  Service is good as well. Restaurants can be found in the attached mall. Not that public transport is still bad in that part of town,50
"The club level is well worth the additional cost.  Staff, food, drinks all good.  The club is located on the top floor and even has an open outdoor patio area to lounge around and relax.  Views are wonderful.",50
"It was a nice stay, just that need to click and wait for quite a few steps each time connect to wifi and the speed is a bit slow.  Service staff were all very nice.   In room dining is fast and of good quality, just missed 1 of the orders for once.",40
"We stayed in a Deluxe Suite at the end of a long tour of Asia.  Extremely relaxing, amazing service.  Room service is very good, I had Eggs Benedict brought to the room every morning.  Restaurants nearby have good food and great service too.",50
"If you are looking for a quality hotel, look no further the staff are awesome and it's just a simple easy experience and staff were always willing to help! From the moment we checked in, they made us feel important.  Truly a top notch hotel",50
"Grand Hyatt Macau is an excellent choice if you can afford it.  Service is excellent: the check-in staff guided me to my room, and within 10 minutes, I received a call to ask if I needed anything.  My king-sized bedroom came with a spacious living room, and the bathroom has two sections for couples. The range of cable programmes is good compared with other hotels in Macau.  Coffee is generously provided for in 6 cubes, and plenty of tea leaves in 4 choices are there for you to enjoy. There is nearby construction going on now, but this is unavoidable as Macau is racing like other Chinese cities to build more. If you need to dine, get out of the City of Dreams to look for Portuguese/Macanese food.",40
"Good services and hospitality than their competition ,   location is relevant good for entertainment .    Only should increase hotel shuttle service to ferry or key spot .    No of restaurant should increase , no good fine dining place in COD mall or hotel makes a little disappointment .",40
"I would totally recommend this hotel to everyone! Great location, fantastic room and excellent staff! We can't wait to return to the Grand Hyatt! Great shopping mall too! I was able spend my husbands winnings!",50
"spa 及 早餐強差人意...  spa 的同事欠缺知識, 只是草草了事, 尤其是 foot massage, 不是為何伏在床上做 foot massage.... banyan tree 較好, 而且較平, 房及早餐都較好...  房的環境很好, 但酒店很遠... 泳池是我在酒店內最滿意的...  grand club 的職員都很 nice, 但不知為何當我說廣東話時, 你們職員仍要說普通話, 可能我不是你酒店的 target customers, 而且可見到你們酒店只 target 內地人, 我只想安靜吃早餐, 但你們沒有控制內地人音量.... 很失望",30
"We stayed at Grand Hyatt Macau between 4 Aug and 7 Aug 2015 as 2 families of 3 (2 rooms). We were upgraded to suites, and the rooms were very spacious, clean, and comfortable. Both rooms were set up with a portacot for the babies, and came with a complimentary set of Mustela products for the babies. The bathroom had a freestanding bathtub in the middle, and a shower and rain shower in front of it, which was a bit tricky because the marble floors stayed wet for quite a while after a shower. The sliding doors between the room and the bathroom stuck easily, and it took a bit of force to get them working again. Bathing the baby was a bit tricky as the sink was a semi sphere and the draining mechanism triggered each time the baby wriggled. I didn't ask if there were alternative…",50
I dun like hotel that is too large which need to walk long to go back room. The size of grant Hyatt is just perfect. Ways to go back room will not take you long. Yet the size of the room is big. Also enjoy the mezza 9 restaurant which offers great food from lots of variety.,50
"Amazing service, beautiful pool, making it a lovely escape from the craziness of the casino's downstairs. The pizza on the in house dining menu is a must have - one  of the best I've ever tasted The kids zone (City of Dreams) has an entrance not far from the swimming pool that makes it an awesome distraction for the kids. Just remember an adult will have to supervise and you need long sleeved tops/trousers & socks. Mind you, it gave us a good excuse to hit Zara Kids, H&M over in the Venetian",50
"I was attached by the beautiful grand haytt mooncake boxes and made the reservation in early August. Total purchased two boxes ( A blue one with the dragonfly and the purple one). I did ask for the detail about the mooncake decoration, but the staff didn't mention there will be a difference between the sample and the actual products. Unfortunatly, when i collected my two mooncake boxes, i was so disappointed by the outlook and mooncake quality. The actual mooncake boxes turn out to be unexpected and looks like broken, such as the butterfly and dragonfly were not stick properly with matching with the decoration (The staff have never mention about the butterfly and dragonfly were not going to stick on the box.) Seriously, if i have known this before i made the purchase, i will not…",10
"The service has been impeccable nothing much to complain about. Staff remembered us from our last visit two years ago. Service and food quality of the Grand club is excellent. Well, if anything, maybe the wifi connection which was somewhat unstable can be upgraded a bit.",50
Hotel was connected to the designer shops and other luxury hotels by the underground.   The hotel was absolutely stunning. We were upgraded to a beautiful suite which was huge.   Unfortunately I was ill during our stay so I didn't get much of an opportunity to explore but I would definitely return. ,50

"Nice rooms, spacious, modern, comfortable, with good views, but the carpeting both inside and outside the room always smelled wet and dusty.  Also, be careful what you order from the menu as one can of coke was US$8!  I understand it's Macau but I visited other hotels in the area and none of them charged as much for food and extras as the Grand Hyatt.  Also, the location of the hotel was pretty isolated but I was there for a conference so not that important but might be for you.  I had a comfortable stay and the customer service was really good but for the price I expected more.",40
Stayed 2 nights in mid-August for a conference.  Arrived around 8:30pm in the evening n check in was very quick.  A bellboy helped me with my luggage to my room n explained the room to me.  Twin room was very spacious.  The bed was nicely firm but pillow was a bit too small n soft.  Had good choices of tea n  nespresso coffee offered in the room.  Toiletries and amenities was provided in a nice quality n quantity.  U can draw up the blind in the bathroom but not much to see from my room as all construction sites nearby.  One thing perhaps would complement the room would be a Japanese style toilet with warm seat for this class of hotel.  One thing about the air-conditioning control is that they put it on the side of one bed  which was quite difficult to find n it u decide to…,50
The people there are very friendly and will greet you as you walk past them with a friendly smile and so are their drivers. They also offer a variety of food on the 37th floor for suites only. It is also 1 of the 3 hotels within the City of Dreams Macau. ,50
There are two towers but both are comfortable and new.  I feel that this hotel is more designed for the business traveler with more of a modern minimalist feel rather than for  family travel.  That said this hotel does have a good pool area and gym.  This hotel is located on the Cotai Strip (the airport is 5 min away) but is about 15 min car ride from the city center.  The Grand Hyatt is connected to the Hard Rock Hotel and the Crown Hotel by a mall where there are a lot of restaurants and a night club.  There is a casino within a min of walk but not within the property so you don't need to walk through the casino to get to your room.  It is also within walking distance to the Taipa Village where you can find local restaurants and shops.    I really like the fact that…,50
"It's a family trip. It started only because they were promoting together with a set of the Water Dance show (House of the Dancing Water). We booked online for the Grand Hyatt Hotel and even upgraded it to a suite. It was the BEST decision I've made in terms of hotel upgrade.   We arrived at the hotel (which is actually a bit far from the pier). The check-in process took a bit longer than expected. However, when we finally get to our room: WOW!!! It's really big and everything is nicely decorated. The bar table, the coffee machine (yes, it's Nespreso and it's free), the view.... all of us had our jaws on the floor. The young one dashed to the long sofa and start pressing the tv .... he didn't sleep in bed in the end, but was still super happy coz it's like he got his own area…",50
great hospitality...of all the hotels we've stayed before this is the first time that i write a review it's because we was so satisfied and so happy that we choose to stay in hyatt macau.it was a great experience and can't imagine that my satisfaction for a great service is just few steps away. love this hotel...  I will definitely stay here again and again,50
"I stayed in this hotel for the first time recently and was very impressed with their facilities and service. I would not hesitate to stay there again if I have the opportunity. I found staff to be particularly friendly and helpful, unlike other 5-star hotels I have stayed in.",50
"Generally it's great, from check-in to check-out, except the terrible pick-up  service from airport. Nobody was there after searching 1st and 2nd floors of airport lobby. We took Galaxy's bus and transferred to Hyatt instead.  Good room with great view, only not happy to the maintenance construction by next door. Not good smelling. Must experience the Grand Club, crews there were great !!",50
"I visited Macau once a year and tended to try staying in different new hotels as there are a lot of new hotel properties launching...   Among all recently opened hotels in Macau, Grand Hyatt is the only one that attracts me to re-visit due to the excellent high quality of service from check-in, room, transport, lounge, spa treatment to check-out.   The breakfast is the one of the best that I ever have in terms of choices and food quality. Especially I was impressed by Eva who served me and my husband in the morning for breakfast really showed her passion and care on us which made us feel like VIPs. The staff are very helpful in the taxi stand too. We could get into a taxi without staying too long under the hot weather.   I definitely will stay in Grand Hyatt in Macau again as I…",50
"Grand Hyatt is located in the City of Dreams area. Very far from city centre with lots of construction happening nearby. The lobby is great. Easy access to shops, restaurants and casino. The room was great. Two LED TVs. A big living room with coffee machine and a big bed room with elegant bathroom.",40
The staff were very helpful and polite. The services provided were excellent. Highly recommended! The decoration of the hotel was first-rated and the facilities were well-equipped. It was as a whole a very unforgettable stay in the hotel.,50
"I am a Diamond member of your gold passport member. I stay in Grand Hyatt Macau on 29 August for one night.  I book the Grand Suite King and the hotel is very great to let me upgrade to room to Grand Executive Suite. The room is locate at the Grand Club Tower and the room is bigger than Grand Suite. The room is great and have a good view of the airport.   I have already stay in this hotel for 5 times booked with my father and me. Every time I stay in Grand Hyatt Macau in the past, I will have my breakfast in the Club Lounge. It is because, guest can only have the breakfast in the Club Lounge.

Amazingly beautiful and spacious with separate living room. Plenty of activities in the City of Dreams building that it occupies. One of if not the best grand hyatt that I have ever stayed in. All at very reasonable rates,50
"My partner and I recently spent 2 nights at Grand Hyatt Macau to celebrate our anniversary and we throughly enjoyed our stay.   The hotel is located at the City of Dream complex at Cotai Area and is within walking distance to the other casino resort nearby such as The Venetian and Sands Cotai City.   For our stay we reserved the Grand Executive Suite, which comes with complimentary access and breakfast at the 37th Club floor, with panoramic view of the surrounding site.   The staff at reception were very welcoming and our check-in was smooth. After knowing in advance this was an anniversary celebration trip, they kindly provided us with complimentary cake and a bottle of wine + fruit basket, which was all well presented.  Our suite located on the 16th floor and had a decent view…",50
Just returned from a 4 night stay in this hotel and cannot recommend it highly enough. The Club Lounge is an exceptional service and the staff really made the stay.. The service was exceptional. I have traveled and stayed throughout the world and hotels could learn a lot from the Grand-Hyatt Macau.,50
The F & B was excellent.  Had breakfast at Mezza9 and dinner at the Golden Pavilion.  The GP serves excellent Chinese soup.  I even invited my sister and brother-in-law who was staying at Sheraton to come over for dinner. Our cups were always filled with tea during dinner.  Kudos.,40
"stayed for one night in grand suite king. the room is spacious with a separate living room and bedroom. numerous TV channels for you to enjoy. the coffee maker in the room is brilliant, not much can be found in other hotels in macau. front office staff are professional and well-trained. greeted with smile and sincere. willing to provide suggestions for dining and leisure. only one thing to be mentioned is the bed. the size seems a hollywood twin rather than a king-sized. and the bed is too soft that affect the sleep quality, a bit back pain in the second morning.",40
"Went to Macau and stay in Grand Hyatt for two nights. Received excellent service from them.   If you are to visit Macau and happen to stay in Grand Hyatt, they customer service is more than happy to provide information for your travel. It was night time, me and my sister are bored of staying in the hotel that has no other entertainment other than gambling or shopping for luxury. Went to their customer service and ask where and what can we do and they provide excellent destination that have good food.  Apart from that, their rooms and facilities are definitely 5 star. Clean, tidy and comfortable.",50
"Having stayed at this hotel for not that many, all the staff remembered my name which made me feel right at home.  There are a number of hotels to choose from in Macau, the Hyatt Macau rooms are larger than your normal hotel rooms and extremely comfortable.  Beijing kitchen also serves the perfect Beijing duck and noodle dishes.",50
"I stayed for one night with my husband prior Chinese New Year 2015 and my package offered complimentary Grand Club access and that was definiety the highlight of the stay. The Grand Club offer Breakfast, Afternoon Tea and whole day refreshment, which means whole day unlimited eating and drinking for both of us. We hardly leave City of Dream and only went to Taipa for some souvenirs shopping.   We stayed in the Grand Deluxe Suite overlooking the Macau Airport. The room is spacious and generally clean, the overall Macau 5-star hotel standard was met. Lobby was posh and nicely decorated with flowers. Staff are generally helpful.",40
"1. room is clean, eleghant and large 2. club room service is excellent, breakfast + tea + evening cocktail + whole day refreshment = convenient for finding food near to the hotel room 3. club room food are great, many choices for evening cocktail 4. bathroom is beautiful and large 5. bed is very comfortable, two types of pillow to choose 6. late check-out (14:00) for gold passport member, platinum grade. 7. 750 hyatt points + USD 100 cash (not including tax) = MACAU GRAND HYATT ROOM  free night  8. sleeing on the sofa is comfortable enough",50
We have a one-night stay at the hotel and have a wonderful experience.  Food at Mezza is great and staff are helpful as ever.  The hotel provide different shuttles to connect almost everywhere over the Island and there is no need to use other transportation.,50
"Used my hyatt points to take the family to Macau, and got a grand deluxe suite, a corner suite with views of the Pearl river delta on one side, and the construction of Paris and MGM studio city on Cotai on the other. Got a surprise email, letting me know I had access to the club room the night before. The room really well suited for family with L shaped couch, room for one rollaway bed, if not two, a small dfning table, a seperate bedroom, large enclosed bath/rainforest shower with plenty of luggage space. Service was excellent, from check in to check out, especially the club lounge. This located in the other tower, on L37, but one of the best I have been to with 2 cooks and hot food from breakfast, to dim sum, pork chop buns, congee, as well as usual refreshments all day. My…",50
"I forgot to review this hotel when I stayed there in early May, 2015. I will definitely give them a full 5 star rating because the service was excellent. Especially one of the guest managers named Randy in the Grand Club. He recommended we try Antonio's for dinner and got us all setup. My room was very spacious and comfortable and the children's play room and pool were also fantastic.",50
"Excellent Hotel. Very well located with an excellent service and very well trained Staff. Very nice deco and chic ambiance. Located in Taipa, still, the hotel is quiet and very convenient to connect to the Cotai Strip and airport.",50
"Had a suite and it was large, excellent views, nice bathroom and typical quality of Grand Hyatt.  It is in the City Of Dreams, and not in the heart of Macau per se, but I preferred that as it ws closer to the airport and Taipa ferry from Hong Kong.  Another great stay at the Grand Hyatt.",50
"I knew I was going to enjoy my stay in Macau the minute I walked into the hotel lobby.  The hotel which is situated in the City of Dreams Casino is absolutely beautiful, and the staff efficient and friendly.  This hotel is in the new area of Macau and is walking distance to pretty much everything, with the old area only a shuttle bus away.  The rooms are enormous, beds are super comfortable and the Nespresso machine is an added bonus!  The pool and spa facilities are top notch and free wifi made for a perfect trip! Seriously cannot fault this hotel at all! :)",50
"They did check the record about my preferences according to previous stay, non-smoking, high floor, not too far from lift and newspaper. The hotel room is big and cozy. I am impressed their charger machine that located in the room is so user-friendly, you need not bring any charger or adapter. The rooms were amazing. Even the cheapest suites have a mini-indoor pool - not big enough for swimming but good for soaking and chilling out. Signature round wooden bath tub, spa-quality toiletries, separate areas for changing and make-up, addictively comfortable lounge, snore-inducing beds... It contained a relaxation pool that was perhaps ten by ten feet. The bathroom was as large as most hotel rooms and contained a huge japanese bath. We tried the gym which had the latest equipment with…",50
"This hotel is 5 star in everyway... rooms, beds, service, spa, staff... one traveling to Macau could not ask for more... they are top rate !  It is a great location and easy to walk to other City of Dreams hotels, and the shopping areas are top notch as well.",50
I would like to commend on the impeccable service given by the front desk staff Mr. Joseph Kim. He was polite and was very helpful giving us advice about dining and transportation. I would like to congratulate the Grand Hyatt Macua management for having such a good staff on the team.,50
"The quality of food was great. However, the quality of service was decreased by the manner of some waiters. A young waitress poured some drinks onto guest's ceremonial dress and left without any form (even awareness) of apology. Waiter deserves being respected if he/she respect the guests and the job.",40
"This is the first time I found that have 3 hotels connecting with each other with a casino on top of it. They call the place City of Dreams with Crown Tower Hotel, Hard Rock Hotel and Grand Hyatt.Hotel.  Free transportation {bus) to town and airport. Near to the Macau International Airports - 15 minutes drive. From the hotel you can go to Venetian Hotel through a illuminate tunnel by foot which you can have good varity of foods - cheap and good.",30
"They did check the record about my preferences according to  previous stay, non-smoking, high floor, not too far from lift and newspaper....Always my first choice if staying in Macau,feel like going back home!. Also live music at lobby restaurant was great.",50
"The hotel room is big and cozy.  I am impressed their charger machine that located in the room is so user-friendly, you need not bring any charger or adapter.  Tthough the service of the receptionist staff need some more improvement.",40
"We went there for a weekend with our 6 months old baby, for 2 nights. We have contacted the hotel before we went there for some in room baby facilities. We were expecting just a baby crib but we were surprised to have seen a baby crib, a baby bath tub, a NUK steamer, an Avent milk warmer and a set of Mustela trial.   The room is very nice and spacious. We were overall very satisfied with the hotel. However, there is 1 thing that we are quite disappointed. Although we stayed on non-smoking floor, there was a very strong smell of cigarette smoking. We smelt the odour the next morning after breakfast. We thought it might be someone smoking illegally on this floor so there was such a bad smell. We requested for a change of room and the hotel responded quickly. First with a heavy…",40
"Considerate and kind staff, convenient location, good food in lounge. Swimming pool was great, Sauna facility was excellent.  Very satisfied with the stay, Will go again to stay there. I enjoyed the stay.",50
...from the hustle and bustle!!  Everyone enjoyed their stay at Grand Hyatt.  It went perfectly well for my family members - the staff were very alert and courteous.  The meal we ordered were well presented and delicious!!  The rooms we occupied were huge with a bathtub that's so unique ;)  The kids enjoyed the pool and we adults loved the SPA.,50
"This hotel is situated in the City of Dreams complex which is a fantastic tourism destination in itself. It has a massive shopping complex, many dining options, big casino and fantastic shows, best in Macau being the “house of the dancing water”. The Hyatt has two towers at one end of the complex and has a grand lobby area that impresses you when you arrive. We came from the Ferry by hotel Limo so the superb service started then. When you arrive at the hotel the reception service through the duty manager is second to none and they knew when we were there last and made us feel welcome again and couldn’t do enough to look after us. I booked a Grand Suite King room, which was very spacious and had a separate lounge area and bedroom. It also had a really good kitchen bar area for in…",50
This Hyatt has great service and the food selection is good.  You will be very happy if you stay here.  The rates are reasonable and the staff is very helpful.  The rooms are clean and modern.  Don't miss the water show in the hotel.,50
"Really made us feel welcome. All staff remembered my name and catered to every inquiry. Helped with information, printing tickets (at their suggestion not mine) and the view and location was great. Would recommend it and stay again",50
"I spent my honeymoon during May 2011 at the property but was very unlucky as I had a short time in Macau.  The property is the one of the best properties I have ever stayed in and service whether the restaurant or the front desk, they are simple the best.  Highly recommended if you wish to feel luxury at a very affordable price as it was every bit the money I spent during my stay. Would visit back soon",50
"Went there during Easter with family.  Hotel is convenience and well located.  Staff were helpful and always carried with a smiling face.  Room was well maintained and this was what I expected from Grand Hyatt.  All in all, a hotel worth to return.",40
"we were at the suite, is clean and beautiful! specially love the bathroom! big hot tub and shower area together with windo,can make the night romantic with your partner.  Good service of all staff. Love the hotel design. The lounge is good, not alot of choice but the food is tasty, good sercive and not many people, so could have a quiet time.everytime we go macau, hyatt always comes 1st!",50
"Our stay at the Grand Hyatt Macau was just amazing.  With so many hotels in Macau we like to stay in a hotel that is elegant, high class and not crowded with gamblers.  Grand Hyatt Macau definitely meet our needs, with their elegant lobby and casino discreetly placed away from the lobby and the staff alert and attentive.  The impeccable service we received from the person who handled our luggage, to the check-in staff, to the attentive associates at the Grand Club.  Everyone has been really outstandingly helpful and friendly.  From Ken Tam, Director of Rooms, a personal warm welcome, Chef Richard who surprised us with a lovely treat to our room and again at the Grand Club Lounge and the Grand Club Team with their high level of hospitality, thoughtfulness and first class service.…",50
"Our check in was fast our room was not ready but duty manager was at the check in desk and found a room for us , which was very welcome .When we got to our room it was very large with windows on all sides we overlooked a school a good view of Hard rock café Hotel we could also see Venetian Hotel which was good to see on an evening when lit up . Mini bar in room had drinks and noodles but could have done with more things like biscuits and chocolate to have with the lovely coffee and tea. The room was very clean the service staff did a really good job. The hotel did not have a set breakfast area in our block you placed order and it was delivered to your room. This is something we have not come across before I think it would have been nicer to have a breakfast buffets all hotels we…",40
"what a great hotel! better than venetian, okura, and conrad.....stayed in the suite on 30/f, took advantage if the lounge on 37/f for cocktails and breakfast.  both were fantastic! room was really nice, nespresso and chinese tea was nice touches.  housekeeping was very helpful as were all other staff we came across.  only blip would be seeing cigarette ends littered all over the non-smoking floors and public areas.",50
"I give it a 4.5 rating, kinda between ""Very Good and Excellent"", should you make a trip to Macau, I can highly recommend it. It all started on arrival in Macau Airport, coming from Shanghai; passport control excellent, nice and friendly officers. My pick-up was already waiting, excellent car and driver, she updated me in a couple of minutes and arrived at the hotel in not time at all. The reception staff, very friendly, handed in my passport and in no time received my room key card and my club membership card. To cut a long story short, I received excellent service all round and yes you have to see ""The House of Dancing Water"" an absolute must. Highly recommended, no regrets at all and I am about to visit again.",50
"Excellent location for House of Dancing Water audience. Great service, polite, informative. However it's Macau, there are guests from other categories making the environment a bit complicated.........",40
Good with family but no breakfast included.  The best hotel I stay in Macau.  Big room and clean.  Nice swimming pool.  Some staff cannot speak Cantonese.  Their target customer may be from Mainland China.,50
Stayed in a suite with my family and the bathroom is about the size of my own living room. Everything is quite new and in good condition. The only drawback is the location. we could not catch a cab back to our hotel one night and didn't have time to fully enjoy the hotel facilities.,50
This one is not the newest hotel in Macau but the facility is still among one of the best.  The hotel has a great lounge. But SOME agents simply do not let one feel being welcomed. Seems there are some under trained staff of this hotel who have no knowledge of room features. (Eg. The view)  DSU is totally not worthwhile in this hotel given the difference between Executive Suite and Standard Suite is minimal. ,40
"The hotel has a very stylish and futuristic design, one of the factors made me chose it other than the other hotels. The staffs there are extremely friendly and carrying a great amount of responsibility. My room was very perfect.",50
"Well it's in the name....' Grand ' and that was what it was, the hotel, it's staff right from the wonderful ppl at the reception to the ever so helping housekeeping staff, they were all so eager to help us. I travelled to Macau with my family of 9 ppl and an infant. Our junior suite room was well equipped with the freshest of fruits, n a well stocked mini bar.they even threw in a bottle of champagne to greet us. Everything was impeccable n they even guided us to the best Indian restaurants in town. Kudos to the management n each member of the hotel for a wonderful property n great service. Highly recommend.... cheers!!!",50
"Macau itself is second name of Luxury and on top of it Grand Hyatt, it makes it ultimate Luxury. We stayed in suite and the view from room in the night was worth the money. The shopping arena within hotel is show stealer. Don't miss their breakfast buffet. Service is excellent and you cannot forget royal treatment.",50
"Stayed one night at Grand Hyatt Macau to watch the House of Dancing Water performance. The hotel was developed in the same phase of the City of Dreams as the theatre, so it is the closest hotel to the theatre for the House of Dancing Water, which is only five minutes from hotel lobby. Rooms are large and modern, there is a Nespresso coffee machine and there are pots of Chinese tea leaves to brew tea, instead of tea bags. Room service is very efficient. There are free shuttle buses connecting the hotel to the airport, the ferry terminal, Macau peninsula and Galaxy casino. Highly recommended.",50
"I stayed at Grand Hyatt Macau for my lunar new year vacation. I stayed for three nights at executive suite. When I first entered into the assigned room, I smelled cigarette so that I asked room change, but the manager said that there was no available room in the same category. I try to endure the smoking air, but it got stronger as the air conditioner worked harder. I asked room change again and then the duty manager assigned me another room in the same category. When I got into the new room, I told him that I still smelled cigarette, but he said that it was merely smell of wood or the room spray. I was sure that was not of wood or spray, but of cigarette, but I accepted the room because the air was fresher than in the previous room at that time.  It was still cold in February,…",40
"Pros: Good attitude and courteous staff, the suite is big with completed equipment. The bed is very comfortable. It's very great that there is a Nespresso coffee machine with free capsules. I requested a twin beds room in a higher floor and the staff is appreciated to arrange it. Cons: The bathtub is quite small, toiletries such as shampoo and bath liquid is so poor for this rating as Grand Hyatt. WiFi connection is instability and there are no chairs in lobby for guest to sit down.",50
"For the celebration of our anniversary, my partner and I booked a stay at the Grand Hyatt Macau for 2 nights. Days before our arrival, I sent the hotel an email regarding our arrival time and our purpose of stay. Coming from Hong Kong, I told them we might arrive few hours earlier than their standard check-in time which is 3pm hoping they could prepare a room and check us in earlier than usual. Unfortunately, upon arrival around 12noon, according to the Front Desk staff, no room is ready yet which, of course, we understand since 3pm is the standard checkin time. So, we decided to walk around and have lunch first. The best thing about this hotel if not only the good thing about is its facilities. The lobby is breath-taking, the architecture is one of a kind and the interior is…",20
"It's located at City of Dreams and connected to the mall and casino. The location is very strategic and convenient for exploring Macau. The room is very hugeeeeeeee, clean, modern, and nice :) The staff is nice and they serves delicious food. Very recommended if you'd like to stay in Macau",40
"Stayed in this hotel when they first opened.  Still in very good condition.  I arrived the hotel around 1:30 pm and they wouldn't let me check-in as the room was not ready.  Was not happy about it but the Assistant Manager Mr. Ki handled very well.  I traveled a lot and honestly no hotel is perfect.  It is always the front line staffs that can help the company to keep the customers.  I was offered to wait at the lounge and around 2:30 pm Mr. Ki brought me the keys and helped to bring the luggage into my room.  I only stayed for one night this time, I will definitely choose this hotel again if I am staying in Macau again.",50
"If you are looking for a really excellent hotel experience, with great service, convenience and value for money, this is one place you should consider. We were there for a business conference and the hotel experience is great. The rooms are very clean, very comfortable, quiet, smells good and your basic hotel needs are provided for. There's easy access to shopping around the hotel, as well as really good restaurants. There is also a free ride from the hotel going to the local outlet shops. Hotel staff are very helpful and courteous. I really enjoyed my stay at Grand Hyatt Macau.",40
"I rarely give any hotel a perfect score, there always seems to be something nagging in the back of my mind about the stay but this hotel is amazing. From check-in to helping get to the ferry terminal on checkout this hotel is amazing. Free shuttle buses around the area provided by city of Dream (the complex the hotel is part of) and the best concierge staff I have ever seen in 100+ hotels I have stayed in. They remembered my name approached me as I got back from a trip they helped me arrange even gave me tips on how to see the not so touristy side of Macau. all the front line staff speaks perfect English and the rooms are amazing. Defiantly worth a visit!",50
"Grand Hyatt never fails. The room was clean, spacious and the staffs were polite, helpful, attentive and always with a smile on their face. Very professional. Very Grand Hyatt. Not much choice of restaurants in the hotel, but you'll find whatever in the surrounding area with no more than 15 minutes of walking distance.  Worth every penny",50
"Our stay was enhanced by a stunning corner suite, complete with views over the Cotai strip, a lounge room, bedroom, and a bathroom larger than some hotel rooms altogether. If the room couldn’t get any better, we had access to the executive lounge that provided all-day refreshments and a delicious western and chinese hot buffet for breakfast and at the nightly cocktail hour.  We wouldn’t recommend walking, as the location was not suited to it, but being a casino city, each different casino had a free bus which picked you up from the hotel and delivered you to the other casinos. This free bus was convenient as you could get to all parts of Macau by catching the bus for free and walking from there, it even picked you up from the ferry stop, where most people come from Hong Kong.…",50
"The Cotai area in Macau is under construction, with several new casinos being built. Located inside the complex called City of Dreams, the Grand Hyatt Macau is a mega hotel with amazing suites but that lack restaurant options. The hotel caters to the Mainland China clientele, so don't expect many Western options.   We spent a day in Macau during a trip to Hong Kong and walking around the old Portuguese town was the highlight of our trip. The Cotai area is like a Vegas wannabe, but we have the real thing. That said, the Hyatt keeps his standards in luxury and ambiance.",40
"Why Macau?  Gambling, shopping, eating and sightseeing, it has so much to offer, with its Portuguese heritage not completely destroyed. Not many realise that the gaming drop is approximately seven times greater than Las Vegas, making it the most affluent gaming mecca in the world. Though not a gambler, I always endeavour to include Macau on any visit to Hong Kong. On this trip, my wife and I chose to stay at the 5 star Grand Hyatt Macau. We were new to this property but are big fans of Grand Hyatt and this hotel is certainly that – Grand.  As always with Grand Hyatt, we chose to stay on a Club Floor, where many extra luxuries are afforded. Apart from sweeping views of the whole area, the Club Lounge offers comfortable seating, a great place to relax, read or send emails,…",50
"I have been in this hotel several times during the last years. It is a fantastic place to stay in Macau.  Booked a club room via hyatt.com. Nothing special.  Checkin: In the lobby. I arrived a little bit early this time, but room was ready within 30 mins.  Room: A lot of space, nice and cozy ambience. Clean. Perfect.  Grand club: It was and is one of the high lights in this hotel. High recognition factor. Very good food. Outstanding service. Helpful, lots of hints - also for travelling. What I like in this club is, that you feel like visiting friends. The club lounge is quite big, but the team cares about everybody.   Location: Close to Macau Taipa Ferry terminal and airport. I arrived by ferry from HK at Macau Outer Harbour terminal. It is a 20 min ride by bus to GH. Left from…",50
"I think all of the rooms in this hotel are suite type. It is more luxurious than Hyatt in Hong Kong. The room comes in a small area with high-heeled table for dining, a living room, a large bedroom with the bathing room. It's pretty awesome. I would say that it is even better than Venetian in its hotel room. Just btw, the pillow and bed of this hotel is even better than all other hyatt I stayed.",50
"The Grand Hyatt Macau is actually located in Taipa which is a separate island from Macau. The only thing within walking distance from the hotel is the Venetian. There's not as much to do in Taipa as compared to Macau. The hotel is located right next to the Macau airport. We could hear planes take off from our room. Our room was non-smoking but often a strong smoke smell would come into our room. When I walked into the hallway there wasn't any smoke smell.  There are free shuttles to Macau, but we mostly took taxis.  The service at the Grand Hyatt was hit or miss. I had excellent service from the concierge, who helped us make dinner reservations and provided great recommendations. The attendant at the taxi stand actually told us to get our own taxi when we approached. The taxi…",10
"The title of my review is not meant to be sarcastic. With the exception of any breakfast venues, which oddly enough could not be found except if we paid over $36 USD per person for in-room service, or if we walked 15 minutes to the Starbucks in the Venetian, this hotel was beautiful, gleaming, offered a luxurious spa, and impeccable service. The suite we were provided was fantastic. The close proximity to expensive designer shops was eye-opening and economically humbling ($1,200 USD for a small purse?).  Yet, for my partner and me who are not gamblers and who visited Macau for business reasons, the experience fell very flat. All of the surrounding grounds were encased in construction fencing. True cultural sights were a long drive away and kept far back from the glitter and…",40
"We booked for 3 days at the Grand Hyatt in the city of dreams,Just to have a few days relaxing and unwinding in macau .Must say that the Check-in at the Grand club was superb ,fast and efficient and a drink in the process ! staff really makes you feel welcome and valued ,special Randy went all the way ,he did not hesitate to feel what our purpose of the trip was and he recommend with full explanation the sights and sounds of macau ,we went to black beach and temple somewhere down town in the old area's during these days ! me almost married for 20 years,got the feeling that it was our second honeymoon !because of the way we where treated .I had my birthday the second day of my stay and the staff congratulated me with name on arriving at breakfast ! thats what i call a 5 star…",50
"Typically, 5 star hotels are monstrocities; Grand Hyatt, however, manages to be simultaneously huge and cozy. It's not an easy feat to achieve, but the the utmost care was taken in the interior design so that all guests, whether they are here for vacation or business, can feel a semblance of home. I used the hotel's conference facilities and found the staff to be attentive (perhaps a bit too attentive as my plate was removed before I had a chance to finish), the decor to be welcoming, and the food to be delicious (a variety of health-conscious, international dishes). I would definitely recommend the Grand Hyatt as a possible conference venue for those who are looking for one.",50
"My wife and I stayed 2 nights here a few weeks ago. We paid a bit extra for a Club room as part of a package with tickets to House of Dancing Water and it was well worth it. The room was fantastic and bigger than many HK flats! Well kitted out and superb bathroom with his and hers washbasins. Extra bits like charging cables for Apple devices were available in room and for other brands by phone from Reception (I needed to charge my Samsung mobile!). The usual tea and coffe makings were supplemented by a Nespresso machine with a variety of strength capsules, including decaff for my wife. Unfortunately, the fantastic view was over the construction site across the road, but also the runway of Macau Airport. The booking gave us access to the Club Floor where breakfast was served with…",40
Checking into the hotel was very quick and easy. The bellman was the most kind and humble when he introduced us to our suite.   The room was well appointed and super clean. The housekeeping was fantastic and privacy was respected.  Unfortunately our non-smoking room did smell of smoke. It wasn’t too bad but noticeable when entering the room after some time out. Hyatt did their best upon arrival to overwhelmingly cover the scent in the sofa with a Febreze like solution which was very strong on the first day. The strong smoke smell then reappeared especially when we had the air con off.  I realized that although we were on a non-smoking floor that the smoke was coming from the vents.  You can’t fault the hotel. People are going to smoke in the rooms regardless of the smoking…,40
"It was on business occasion meeting staying it one night, which i missed the water show but still enjoy the detail design in room setting. King bed, separate shower and functional desk top computer plug enable WiFi. Only that the noise next door was heard clear at night.",40
"Stayed here a couple of times over the years.  Location is perfect for me, as its in the City of Dreams complex with good entertainment and F&B options. Venetian (and the Bellini bar within) is a short walk away, airport and Taipa ferry terminal 10 minutes away.  The hotel is beautiful! I love what they did to all the public spaces especially the lobby and club lounge (although the faux deer head lamps are kinda odd). I've tried the club and deluxe rooms, grand deluxe suite and grand executive suite here, they are all beautifully furnished with a nice colour palate. Extremely comfortable bed, powerful A/C, good water pressure although hot water takes a few minutes. The tea bags and leaves provided worked for me. I love the Grand Suites here, it comes with a separate living area…",50
"Brought my wife and baby daughter to Macau so that I don't feel lonely on business. Transportation from Taipa airport to the hotel was easy thanks to the City of Dreams shuttle. Check in was a breeze and service was excellent. We booked the Grand King Deluxe and it was well set up to accommodate our daughter as requested - there was a baby tub, baby bath amenities, bottles and bottle sterilizer and not forgetting the cot! The room itself was big and comfortable, mattress firm and had free wifi. The bath itself was huge - see pictures. Breakfast spread at mezza 9 was excellent.",50
We stayed here for one night from Hong Kong and upgraded to the deluxe suit. It was a lovely room with great views over the skyline. Dinner was spent at Mezze9 and was delicious! the service was impeccable and we thoroughly enjoyed our evening. The pool and spa are also worth a visit.,50
"I have stayed at this hotel several times and it is always consistent. Nice new design hotel and good  restaurants and great gym and nice heated pool. The service here is exceptional in all areas !  It is really nice when everyone working there are super helpful and friendly and know your name too. Make sure you ask for a non smoking floor if you don't smoke as the Chinese smoke a lot. It is the only annoying thing in Macau for me, i hate cigarettes ! If you can spend a little more go for the club lounge, it""s great !",50
"Stayed 2 nights. Took a cab from the airport to the hotel. Cab driver had no problems finding the hotel. It was about 5 mins away at MOP 25. In retrospect, we could have just taken the shuttle bus which drops you off at City of Dreams. This is the mall that attached to the hotel and is less than 5 mins walk inside the mall to the hotel.  Check in was smooth though there isn't much signage in the lobby. The room was very comfortably sized, well maintained and clean. However, while the hotel clearly states that there is no smoking, it's clientele don't seem to take that seriously in their rooms. At least you could request for air purifiers.  There were plenty of bottles of water in the room, a decently sized in room safe and free WiFi. The bathroom was clean but the water quality…",40
"Club room in the Tower: great view, extraordinary bathroom, big and clean with all the amenities you wish for. Part of the City of Dreams complex so all you need is there. Personnel is very helpful and friendly, from reception who brings you to your room to concierge who organizes everything for you. ",50
We have been staying at the Grand Hyatt Macau every year we went to Macau.  Our last visit in September we stayed for 7 nights.  Each morning we went up to the Club Lounge for our breakfast and I have to give praise to Randy Wong.  What great service we received!  He will greet you by name and remembers what you like to drink and go out of his way to make it special for you.  What a great start to the morning!!,50
"Grand Hyatt is difficult to top, really. Value for money and truly great infrastructure. From pool to fitness over restaurants to the grand club floor all immaculately maintained after about five years of operations.   One point you should be aware is that Taxis in Macao are at times hard to get. So watch out when you have dinner appointments in old macao or simply further away. At times it's better to take the shuttle bus even as this would make a number of stops.   Although City of Dreams is a large complex, it feels cozy compared to the Venetian (which is simply massive). Just across the road from Venetian on one hand and from Conrad on the other it's at the heart of Cotai Strip.",40
"We had previously stayed here & thought it was great but this time our 'non-smoking' room smelt terribly. It was so bad it was as if cigarette smoke was coming thru the air-conditioning. We were there for 3 nights & advised the reception upon checkout but in hindsight we should have done so upon checkin. This is a problem that obviously should have been picked up by housekeeping. Lots of hotels to choose from now so it should be better. Otherwise, service was excellent.",30
"I stay in this hotel in 24/8 for one night with my family and stay in the Premier Suite.  This lounge service is so disappointed to me.   I went to have the breakfast at the 6:30 am, at that time all dish have not yet prepare. I have to wait around 15-30 minutes to make the lounge breakfast well prepare.    When I have breakfast in the lounge, I order 2 set of  over easy egg dish. The chef know my order of 2 set. However he only provide 1 set of dish. When I ask for the other dish, he so rude to answers me I haven't order 2 set of dish.  Also, when I have the evening cocktail time, the others chef service is so bad. I order a Hamburger from the open kitchen and tell the lady chef to have 2 set of Hamburger. She tell me to wait around 10 minutes. I am waiting for 10 minutes and…",10
"Grand Hyatt Macau is located in a good location in Macau. Its room arrangement is nice and pleasant. The most enjoyable breakfast in compare with other Hyatt I have stayed before, from its Chinese food choices to western food as well. Highly recommended.",40
"We had a terrific 3 nights at this hotel, the hotel is near to attraction point and there are shuttle bus provided, so its pretty convenient to move about. Staffs are very friendly and provide informative information. Spacious rooms, clean and tidiness.",50
The Hotel is Very Nice it is a 3 hotels in one area the city of dreams is a very nice place but what i did not experience is the casino because i don't have money to gamble i decided to spend it to the local restaurants around macau. its a very small place so you can go around in a day.,50
"I stay at this hotel for business trip on Jul 2014. The hotel is really nice with very nice view from the room.  Very clean and cozy.. The hotel is link with Hard Rock and simple say downstair is shopping mall.   If you wish to take a jet boat to Hong Kong Airport, you can arrange at reception at ground floor. Hotel with provide ferry booking service",40
"Really nice rooms (Stayed at Grand suite with King Bed). very very spacious and clean with partition walls between the bedroom and living room. service is really good too. my only complain is that the toilet glass cubicle for the shower is clear, hence there is no privacy (if you are not couples). there are two televisions in the suite. the speaker for the tv in the bedroom comes out from the toilet, which is weird. best part about this hotel is that there is no casino, therefore the noise level is much lower and less drunk and rowdy gamblers. the hotel is connect to several other hotels, restaurants and shopping malls. so it is quite convenient.",50
"i stayed at this hotel twice and i love them both, the hotel is huge they have 2 towers one of them for guest and the other for members and actually both of them is great, the rooms are big and the living area is separated also there is a dining table. the swimming pool is very big. the hotel staff are great specially the night manger i don't remember his name but he is so polite and helpful. there is a mall connected to the hotel also a nice casino, restaurants, bank. they offer free shuttle bus mostly to everywhere in Macau.",50
A very clean feeling when you enter the lobby.The room is spacious and is nicely decorated. Nice work desk and very comfortable bed. Casino is huge as well and it is generally clean and not overly crowded. Shopping and dining are within the city of dreams complex itself.,50
What a huge hotel! The club lounge is excellent with fantastic staff especially Randy. They are polite and willing to accommodate your needs. The views over Macau and the ocean are unbelievable from the 37th floor. They serve so much food with the majority of it prepared in the open kitchen by many chefs. Chinese and western food is offered all being very delicious. The suite room is very spacious with separate living room and views over Macau. The location of this hotel is right in the middle of the gambling area and they have a free shuttle bus from the ferry which is extremely convenient. I highly recommend this hotel.,50
"I stayed in GHM for one night on 13/7, for a short break before the peak travel season in summer holiday, and to enjoy FIFA champion match with my friends.  GHM has always been my top most favourite hotel in Macau despite of vigorous competition in Cotai Strip.  Some minor defects were encountered, it may reflect the ageing after 5 years operations which needs to get attention.  Room key card was not function right after check-in, resulting in a 5-minute delay in getting into the room.  When I was soaking in the bathtub using my own bath salt, I found the plug cannot trap water properly, a waste of bath salt and water. Technician fixed it at a reasonable timing.  Bathroom curtain can still pull down when fully released, made it detach from the track.  Overall, I enjoyed the stay…",40
Gr8 hotel but this is macau so u get lots of other choices of grand hotels around so...  it's business wonderful linked to casino and many other hotels. But I will choose Macau Galaxy if I'm to go again.  Another thing is room service done by male cleaning personnel should not be touching and folding ladies' clothes and lingerie!... are they trained? :(,40
"OMG, the best hotel I have ever stayed in. Amazing staff, amazing room, amazing restaurant. Nothing is too much trouble. From the moment we arrived we were treated like individuals: everyone remembered our name, we weren't just another number. Fantastic location for the incredible Dancing Water Show. Had a wonderful pre-show dinner at Mezza9 (just as good as Mezza9 in Singapore). Concierge went above and beyond.  The pool facilities are great, though I have to say it is a bit weird the pool attendant following you right to the waters edge to take your wrap.....  Breakfast was highly disappointing though.  Next to nothing for children & the western breakfast was really underwhelming.   Free bus to the ferry terminals. Hard rock casino, cafe & hotel & crown towers & casino are all…",50
"Just completed a 3 night stay here at this wonderful and elegant property.   - The check in experience is fairly fast and effecient, with staff ready to help with any luggage, and to get you to your room.   - The rooms are huge, with a separation between the living room and bedroom being very critical.  The beds are soft, love the high top marble table in the living room.   - Had a problem with the electrical outlets next to the bed, and within 10 minutes, the issue was resolved, despite the fact it was 11:30pm at night.   -The room service was extremely fast and prompt, with little touches as a round tray and individual condiments as a nice touch.  They came back later to pick up the tray on their own, without me having to call down.   - Housekeeping and the housekeeping…",50
I earned a free night and checked in into a King suite. The room is awesome. I love the marble high table with bar stool instead of a traditional dinning table. We chose to have breakfast from in room service instead of the restaurant to enjoy more privacy & the room. Definitely will go again.,40
"Stayed here as part of the House of Dancing Water show and hotel package.   Nice big shiny hotel on the Cotai side of Macau.  Never stayed at a Grand Hyatt before and came away from this 1 night’s stay quite impressed.  Our check-in took a long time but service from front desk was exemplary.  Tone was very professional and staff took time to explain all the details of the room and my stay.    The room itself was a Grand King Suite, decorated in an understated minimal style.   Suite consisted of a large sitting room with adequate seating for up to 6 people. large bedroom with a very comfortable US Kingsize bed, walk in wardrobe and a large bathroom/vanity area.  The egg bath was a nice touch and very luxurious.  The suite came with all the usual equipment and extras you come to…",50
"I travel to Macau on business a few times a year, so my needs are for business travel, instead of gambling or relaxation.  For this reason I always stay at The Grand Hyatt Macau.    Although it is attached to a Casino, it is more suited for the business traveller.  All rooms are Suites, with large bathrooms, bedrooms, living and dining areas.  Additionally the wi-fi is free with the stay and is fast enough to log on to email if you need to whilst in your room.  Huge flat screen TV's in both the living and bedrooms, with all kinds of channel choices including US, UK, HK, EU, and CN channels.  The amenities in the rooms are top notch and plentiful, and each room has its own Nespresso Machine, which is just fantastic for me!  There are several restaurants in the hotel including…",40
"The service at the Grand Hyatt Macau is excellent with all staff keen to attend to your every need. Rooms are large and luxurious and the suites are very comfortable. Located in the City of Dreams with easy access to the other casino resorts. Although there is only a limited choice of bars and restaurants, we were very well looked after whilst dining at Mezz9 Macau for our pre show dinner. Special thanks to Deepak for his great advice on menu selection and for making sure everything was just right for my wife and I. A must see is the spectacular show, the House of Dancing Water, which is absolutely amazing. We would recommend this hotel to our friends especially for a couples getaway from Hong Kong.",40
"What can I say, It's a Grand Hyatt and it lives up to that status. Wonderful customer service, awesome room and amenities. Definitely made my mother and I feel like we were living in luxury. It's within the City of Dreams Casino complex which made our Macau vacation easy on the feet as far as walking around. Free shuttles to and from pretty much any other large property in Macau made getting around convenient.",50
"My girlfriend and I stayed here in May 2013 for 1 night (I selected July 2013 as it is the option earlist from the drop down list in the review form). It was a really good experience due to the great room. We would consider staying here again. Recommeded for couples living in HK who want a quick, easy and luxurious break.  Room (9/10): We stayed in the Grand Suite King.  + Matress was very comfortable and large (king size), linen was good quality. Had a really good sleep. + Room was very spacious.There was a seperate living room area with couches lining 2 sides of the walls and with a dining counter. Could easily have spent most of the day in the room (but we went out for sightseeing). + Large LCD TV with a wide-ish selection of channels. + Bathroom was modern, large and…",40
"Good location, good service, super large room with a suite style for a friction of price. Directly link to the House of Dancing Water. shuttle bus link you to every part of Macau. staff are very helpful and professional it can be.",50
"I stayed a weekend night with wife and our 5 year old boy. The hotel is within the City of Dreams complex and a little off the main attractions, which to us, is a plus, as it's quieter and less busy compared to the Venetian. The lobby is classy with very friendly staff. We booked a suite, with a bedroom and a spacious living and dining room. There isn't a lot to do for kids, except going to the swimming pool, which is a medium length, rectangular shaped one. Not fancy, but we had a good time swimming and playing in the water. Taxi's are sometimes hard to get in Macau but the staff there was very helpful in offering help in our transportation needs.",50
"Fantastic Hotel! It truly has a grand feel to it, I was in the Premium Tower and had a 1 Bedroom King Suite on of the top floors I believe it was the 34th Floor so I had an amazing view of the hotels and the water! The casino is alright and is connected for a 3-4 hotels  so it's pretty busy even at like 2 in the afternoon.   The standout feature for me was the staff are very diligent and always giving suggestions on where to go and what to do which was a pleasant surprise. I had breakfast at the HYATT CLUB restaurant where which is on the top of the hotel with floor to ceiling windows so again really nice views and the breakfast was very very good!",50
The best part of the suite room was the overhead rain shower.  The large rectangular shower head could easily fit two bodies underneath.  It was the largest shower head of all the hotels that I have stayed in Macau.  The shower is separated from the bedroom by a transparent glass.  The bed was not as comfortable as some other hotels and the pillows were too soft.  We had to ask for extra pillows which was quickly delivered.  The sofa in the living room was a bit hard.  There was a Nescafé espresso machine which I thought was nice. The wifi was fast.  The service overall was friendly.,40
I want to thank the Grand Hyatt staffs for re-arranging my tickets for the House of Dancing Water due to unforeseen personal circumstances and hey were able to accommodate my requests in any manner possible! Grand Hyatt Macau is of the best hotels in the City of Dreams with free shuttle buses to the Venetian. I booked the House of Dancing Water package with Twin Suite and the room is extremely spacious full of amenities. Free shuttles offered by the City of Dreams will definitely take you to any place in Macau! Will definitely go again!,50
"Stayed here for 2 nights and wished it was 2 weeks. Upgraded to the club level and the snacks and drinks were wonderful. Apart from the spacious and well appointed room, the highlight was the fantastic service from staff. We were always addressed by name and fussed over with whatever we needed. In particular, Randy was wonderful. The shuttle bus services were great and we had a nice time in Macau without going near a casino. Only small problem like a previous review was a smell of tobacco smoke in our non smoking room. Loved the Hyatt experience and would use them anywhere. ",50
"Personally I can't recommend the service at this hotel enough. Out first  trip to Macau for a stay -over in 15 yrs. I choose the hyatt because I tend to stay in the hyatt a lot around the world and I know what I'm getting! the service is usually great. I fell sick on our first day of arrival and the staff ran around getting medicine for me even sending freshly squeezed orange to my room, every time I ventured outside, the hotel staff asked if I was feeling any better and if they could help with anything, nothing was too much trouble including arranging a doctors visit. The hotel itself is in a quiet location, a little off the beaten track with construction site views ( but not at all noisy) but really quite nice after going into central Macau where it's noisy and super crowded.…",50
"This hotel is very clean and tidiness. It was spacious and staffs are very helpful and provide good service. If you are looking for hotel that is quite, this is the hotel. You can pre-check in to your room, they will deliver your baggage to your room if the room is ready and you no need to worry about your baggage and come back to check in at the middle of the day.",40
"A great hotel with first class rooms, first class service, attention to details and wonderful follow-up on various inquiries.  Great club lounge with attentive services. Nice concierge follow through and great Housekeeping services. Absolutely a place that other hotels should learn from.  TEN out of Ten!",50
"This is my first time to choose Grand Hyatt Macau after compare to others similar hotels in macau. The hotel location ,environment , layout, staff service and the cleanliness of the room are make me have a wonderful holiday with my family.  The staffs always helpful and attentive , the room is big and conform and the club lounge is a good place where you can have a very quiet breakfast with nice view ( the view might be blocking by the other hotel in future seem the construction is on going). Worth to upgrade to the club lounge access without regrets. Will look forwards to stay again and it will be my priority hotel in macau. Free Shuttle bus to ferry terminal, airport and macau.",50
Stayed in a King Suite for 1 night. 2nd time at City of Dreams. Such a beautiful hotel. Most wonderful service by terrific staff who all looked great in beautifully tailored uniforms. Great attention to detail. Superb beds with excellent line. Bathroom great. The hotel spa area was also very good as was the Beijing Kitchen restaurant. And the hotel breakfast.... without doubt the best I've EVER had - in a stunning space. Will be back for sure!,50
"My wife and I were having the time of our lives at what was arguably the best hotel experience in 40 years of travel experience.  We agreed to play some tennis before we headed home only to have our amazing experience expanded by the hotel providing us with the best of equipment and... A ballboy. We felt like we were at Wimbleton.  Then I pulled a muscle. Extremely painfully. And within minutes five staff members were on the court with ice (and a banana for potassium) and a wheelchair. They helped us with getting our packing done and even sent us off to our rapid ferry with an organized car to avoid taxi mix ups.   We've now decided that our favorite brand, after the one we are building in our business, is the Hyatt.  ",50
"True to brand this hotel is a grand experience. From check in to check out we enjoyed superb service and a very pleasant room with large bathroom. Great finishes, attention to detail and quiet privacy are all there. Being able to enjoy cocktails, snacks and breakfast in the executive lounge area, far from the masses, was also a very welcome plus. Unfortunately the ongoing construction work on a nearby site is audible and not so pleasant. So too is the fact that despite the grandness of the hotel not all customers who support it are yet skilled with etiquette. But this is not the fault of the hotel.  That apart, the only points scored against the hotel were from the black night blind collapsing during the night. The noise obviously startled and woke us up. But the immediate…",50
I stayed in this hotel for 2 times and the experience was great. In this recent stay the major difference I noticed was that the Grand Club had been relocated to the 3Xth floor. It was previously on the G/F and thus wasn't private at all. Obviously the original design was kind of flawed.  I stayed in an extremely spacious suite on a high floor facing the other 2 hotels in the City of Dreams as well as the Venetian and Galaxy complexes. The view wasn't spectacular but was already the best in the Grand Club Tower. The room was extremely clean by any standard. The bathroom was huge with 2 sinks and a lovely bath tub by the window. One thing they can improve is to install automatic curtains...cos it was so time-consuming and tedious when you need to work on the curtains. Another…,50
"We booked a room on the club floor and it was the best thing ever! The all day refreshments available in the lounge were superb, be it breakfast, afternoon tea or evening cocktails. The staff on the club floor (and pretty much everywhere in the hotel) were friendly and attentive, from the time we checked in, to the time we checked out. They remembered our preferences and names even when we had meals and drinks at the lounge.  The room was fab, clean, comfortable with all the quality amenities that one could ask for. The fact that there was a nespresso coffee machine pretty much nailed it for us :)  The hotel is next to the theatre hosting the House of Dancing Water show, really convenient for us. Dining choices are varied and if you need cheaper shopping or even more dining…",50
"I was with my parents and siblings on a holiday for macau and hong kong...we stayed for two nights...the hotel was amazing and had a great front look...it was connected to other hotels like hard rock cafe etc., from basement...nice walkthrough in ground floor...had shuttles from hotel to ferry and airport...",40
"Very nice hotel close to ferry and airport. Attended a business conference where everyone worked hard in the hotel To ensure everything ran smoothly and on time. Great service by hotel team in respect to arrival, quick checking. I stayed in the club section and all was perfect in respect to room Layout and possibly too much for one person but very nice. Close to casinos and shopping checkout was smooth and pleasant. I would stay here again. ",40
We stayed at the Grand Hyatt in November 203. We had read some great things on trip advisor about the hotel and needless to say we were not disappointed. We paidd extra to stay on the club level and it was worth every cent. The all day refreshments were fantastic as was the breakfast buffet but the stand out for us was the dinner drinks and food. There was actually so much to eat that we didn't have dinner and the drinks were amazing. Staff would make any cocktail you wanted. Nothing was too much trouble for them. One night we weren't feeling the best and the chef made us up some special dinner that was easy on the stomach. Then the morning we were leaving we had to leave so early that we couldn't have the breakfast buffet but before we left in the morning they sent up this…,50
"we stayed in this hotel in Oct 2013, a suite unit is very spacious and everything is brand new. Shower is the best I ever experienced among all hotel I have stayed, conveniently located near other big casinos, delicious food as well.",50
"Booking via hyatt.com  Location: close to Macau Taipa Ferry terminal and airport. Overall location is not an issue in Macau. I arrived at Taipa Ferry Terminal by ferry from HK, then went by free bus shuttle to the hotel (City of Dreams).  Rooms: Fantastic room, nice style. Clean, good sleep.  Grand club: Definitively one of the high lights in this hotel. High recognition factor. Very good food. Outstanding service. Helpful, lots of hints - also for travelling.  Overall: Good value, all fine. One of the hotels I'm always happy to come back.",50
"Stayed there for two nights, the hotel itself is fab, clean, modern and good sized rooms, however, 99% of the staff we mat are not up to standard. We booked two rooms at the club tower, the staff at the lobby didn't ask us to go up to the 37th floor for check in, instead  we waited in the line and was told the rooms were not ready, it was 3 pm at that time. Second, 95% of the staff greet us in Mandarin. Yes we are Chinese, but do you think some people might get offence? I don't want to be rude but honestly, i am from HONG KONG, not China! We are 100% not the same, please don't put us under the same type! Thirdly, we dine at the lobby cafe on the second night, we ordered some set dinner and ask the staff what was the soup of the day, the answer I got was we have Western style…",20
"We stayed here and had a nice time. It is a casino-less part of city of dreams. The room was clean and modern. However, our room service never was delivered and we were charged TWICE! They also messed up our bills, such as charging us for parking (we took a bus from the ferry terminal) and other odd things. While they finally fixed this after calling Hyatt corporate, the staff treated us like we were looking for freebies. ",30
"This is the best Hyatt I have ever stayed (as a Diamond, I have stayed across all the Hyatt brands and all over the world).   Macau is very well connected with free shuttles provide by the hotels. You can get the free shuttle (purple bus) from the Ferry to the Hyatt (also know as City of Dream) so no need to stress about getting to the hotel and back to Ferry/Airport.   Prior to arrival, I had the Grand Hyatt Hong Kong contacted the Macau Hyatt regarding my preference for a higher floor, non-smoking and early checkin. Upon arrival all request was met and much more, they upgraded me to the corner suite on the 30th floor with the most amazing view of Macau, you can fully see the Venetian hotel, ocean, and airport. It was a 280 degree view of Macau.   This property is new - only 3…",50
"Booked: Grand Club Suite Checkin: VIP check in area on the top floor for club guests. Room was not ready at the time but was offered breakfast at the club lounge while we waited for 30mins until our room was ready. Club service checkin was impeccable.  Room: Impressive large room with sitting/ lounge area. King bed. Large bathroom with rain shower. 10 out of 10. Service: We felt we were being treated better than others Restaurants: Tried and enjoyed all its restaurants and cafes at the hotel. Though the Chinese restaurant had more of a western touch. Pool: Huge pool and has potential to have a good pool scene. Sadly, the pool seemed sad and out of place. Not much of an atmosphere. At the time of my stay, they were doing some construction work at the pool and erecting palm trees…",50
"Stayed here for two nights before heading off Hong Kong. As it is my first time in Macau, I chose Grand Hyatt because of its international brand name - and I do not regret my choice.   We stayed in the Grand Executive suite and paid around USD400 per night. The room is huge (~700sqf) with a view of the Hard Rock hotel and Venetian. We like how they will replace the mineral water and replenish the Nespresso coffee capsules everytime we came back to the room.   As it is a suite, I guess everyone who is used to staying in a suite will probably know the features and facilities. However, the service staffs are meticulous indeed.   I will definitely choose this hotel the next time I am here.",50
I stayed here as I was attending a business conference. The rooms are of a decent size with big beds but furnished in a highly minimalist style that gives a rather cold impression overall. There was no desk in my room. The location is probably good if you want to spend your time in the adjacent City of Dreams casino and shops but this part of Cotai is also a huge building site and will remain so for several years yet.Service is efficient and friendly. I had a problem connecting to the hotel wi-fi and someone came to my room immediately to fix the problem. The concierge also recommended a good restaurant for dinner and obtained a reservation.,30
"Wow. This hotel is absolutely amazing. We stayed for one night in a grand executive suite on the 21st floor. The room and hotel smells amazing. The suite is enormous and the bathroom comprises three separate areas. The toiletries are top grade. The rain shower is lovely and the view from the stand alone bath tub is to die for. The bed is so comfortable and you can lie in bed looking out at the view. There was complimentary red wine, fruit, newspaper. We went out for dinner in the mezzo restaurant and to see the house of dancing water show (both also brilliant) and when we got 'home' we found beautiful chocolates beside the bed and the whole suite had been turned down and cleaned (toiletries replenished, bathroom cleaned, full set of fresh towels). The hospitality is incredible.…",50

we are enjoying our stay. start of our second night and we have enjoyed it. When we checked in the first room smelled of smoke so they moved us to another room and put us on the side that looks out over the venetian and other hotels. it is a nicer side with stuff to look at. the internet is fast enough and there are many things to do. I emailed the concierge before arriving with a list of restaurants i wanted to eat at and they made reservations for us before we arrived.   has been a great place to stay.,50
Stayed here for 2 nights for business.  The hotel has shuttle service from both Taipai and Macau outer ferry terminal.  Hyatt service staff in Asia never fail to impress and the staff are just amazing when it comes to service.  The Grand Club lounge was one of the best I have visited as the hot food are prepared by the Chef.  There is construction near by the hotel and the work start 8am.  The gym is well equip and under used as most guest prefer the Casino.,50
"The Grand Hyatt Macau is a wonderful hotel!  It is located in the City of Dreams complex on the Cotai Strip.  There is a free shuttle service offered by The City of Dreams from both ferry terminals.  (If you are booking a ferry from Hong Kong, I would suggest taking the ferry to Taipa, it is much closer.)   We were upgraded to one of the suites and it was very nice; a bar and lounge sitting area (with large TV) are located just located outside the huge bedroom suite.   The rooms have a nespresso maker for that early morning cup of coffee.  The bathroom area is very large, with a huge bath tub and rain shower.  The towels are very fluffy and the bath amenities are by H2O.  The beds and pillows are very comfortable and made for a great night sleep.    The unfortunate thing is that…",50
"My wife & I stayed 2 nights at the hotel in November, 2013. The hotel is a quiet oasis in Macau. Located in the City of Dreams. We had a great room.  The restaurant facilities & food choices are limited unless you want only Chinese food. For one night we had a large suite which was part of the House of Dancing waters package. For the second night we had to pay more than twice the rate. We reluctantly agreed as we are 73 & 77 years old & have limited mobility.  Do try to get a room away from the construction sites & look for alternate restaurants.  Considering all we enjoyed our stay.",50
"This is a 5 star Hyatt, need I say more. Like the Grand Hyatt in Bangkok and the Hyatt Tsim Sha Tsui in Hong Kong good things happen to their guest. Great food and service and an excellent concierge! As a westerner traveling in Southeast Asia for the first time I was very impressed.",50
"Always stay at the Grand Hyatt whenever I am on Macau, which is like once every two months.   I prefer this hotel than Hard Rock, and the more upscale Crown Tower, also located in the City of Dreams complex.  The a/c of this hotel is always up to par, the beds very clean, the bathroom amenities very complete, and the service, always excellent.  Though there are come quirks with the housekeeping, especially with the language barrier, the hotel GM or asst. GM always makes up for the inadequacies for minor infractions.  Though the shops in the mall are not that extensive, more of hi end, I always walk to the next door Venetian for its up to midnight mall stores.  Grand Hyatt always will be my home in Macau",50
"THe Grand Hyatt Macau truly deserves its designation.  It is a great facility and the newly open Grand Club on the 37th floor will only add to the repuation.    The faciiity is in the City of Dreams complex, along with Hard Rock and Crowne Towers, as well as the House of Dancing Waters theater. All of the big name shops light up the boulevards between the  hotels, theater, and connectiing casino.  Adjacent is the Conrad and across the big street is The Venetian (and the Galaxy a bit further). If you prefer not to walk, there is a free shuttle from each of the hotels to the other hotels on the strip, like the Venetian. They also provide a free shuttle to the two ferry terminals, Taipa and Macau, as well as to places like the Border Gate and other areas in older Macau. Free…",50
"This is a morden hotel with minimalist design but high quality finish such as leather clad corridor wall, beautiful lightings. There were quite a lot of building works going on around the hotel at the moment but did not affect us enjoying the hotel. We stayed in a luxury suite, which was very big with luxury bathroom. It had an Nespresso machine and very good quality Chinese tea.  We also had the use of the grand club lounge, where we took our breakfast and afternoon canapies and wine, which were excellent quality. There's a very good spa and outdoor pool. Excellent sevice and staff. Recommended.",50
"We stayed here for 2 days midweek, when the hotel is a lot quieter than at weekends. Macau is often seen primarily as the oriental Vegas, with themed mega-casinos as the big attraction, but for midweek visitors we enjoyed a relatively tranquil experience, and a good opportunity to explore the old Portuguese colony.   The Grand Hyatt  is a BIG modern hotel with 2 accommodation towers rising above the City of Dreams casino and entertainment complex. Gambling is the lure that keeps Macau humming, and consequently you won't find any floors in the Club Tower with 'unlucky' numbers like '13' or anything with a '4' in it.   All of the staff that we met were wonderfully friendly and helpful. They seem to have a real gift for remembering your name and going out of their way to make sure…",50
"We had a free Hyatt night with limited selection, and we went with one night in Macau while we were in Hong Kong.  Once again, I can't speak about value for dollar, but I think you can find better places in Macau. First, the rooms were excellent.  Clean, big and easy to get to.  Service was ok, but with a hotel this size it is natural to assume service will slip some.  The hotel is gigantic, and it is right next to a bunch of other huge hotels. Breakfast was very good, though we had a quick dinner at the Hard Rock and it wasn't good at all.  My mistake for choosing the Hard Rock, I suppose.   The real problem I have with this place was that the casino was so terrible.  It wasn't that clean, and it was empty.  Never seen a casino that empty before, it is chilling.  Ended up going…",30
"As you can imagine many of the Hotels and Casinos in Macau are a bit gaudy and over done, but that's part of being in Macau or Las Vegas. I prefer a classy hotel and this Grand Hyatt is great, both this one and the one in Guangzhou are showing their new design look of wood and sophistication. Great hotel lobby cafe with live music at night and a good restaurant in the hotel too. I always take the Club tower and access to the Club lounge, which is well worth it. The Pool is also huge and heated in the winter months, and not too busy so it's a great place to relax. Most guests from Asia are in the casinos and don't use the pool, perfect to relax on the weekend. The hotel is still close to all the other big casinos such as the Venetian which is still worth a visit, but its jammed…",50
"A wonderful hotel for families traveling in Macau, the Grand Hyatt offers spacious suites and wonderful service that make it a wonderful hotel for a stay in Macau. It is much quieter than the other hotels in Cotai and has an excellent free bus system that it shares with the other hotels in the City of Dreams. If you want to get away from the crowds that you will definitely find in the Venetian, and want to stay in the Cotai side, then this is definitely the hotel for you.       ",40
"I stayed in this hotel for business for about 3 nights using all of its conference and meeting facilities.  Very satisfied with the hotel.  The room is huge, with separate living room and bedroom, room service were fast and surprise, surprise food was quite tasty. Everything is clean, practical (when a hotel has power point near the bed, that will get a thumbs up from me) and the staff was overall just great. From the arrival, to meetings and all through our business lunches, the service was quick, non intrusive, warm and ready to help.  If I were to comment about something, it is the hot shower.  It took quite a long time before it warmed up.  The bed was excellent and getting from the hotel to casinos and shopping was definitely easy.  If I were to visit Macau again, Grand…",50
The hotel is located a city of dreams and it is just five minutes away from the airport.the staff was very nice and helpful.the room was infront of the swimming pool and the room was clean.there are many restaurants and some buffet restaurants.i would recommend this hotel every time I come here but there are other hotels.but I would like you to recommend this hotel.,50
"I stay in hyatt often there Quality of service is improved at the highest leve, restaurants are good with great flavours and taste, Recent visit was for one day only but it is so relaxing and there isala spa is my favourite. must try, There are so many place of interest within this camp, Casino, Dancing Water Show, and the best Club in Macao ,",40
I visit Macau quite often and the thing that has let the hotels down in the past has been the quality of staff service. I have stayed at the Grand Hyatt in Macau before and I must say the service has come on dramatically. I couldn't fault any of the service. Easy check in. Walked to my room by the manager. Was given the exact same corner suite I had on my last visit that they had remembered. Fantastic room with every amenity you could want including a nespresso coffee machine which made getting up the morning much more pleasurable. Definitely my hotel of choice in Macau at the moment. My only criticism was why can't they deliver the newspapers before 9.30am. I like to get up at 8am drink a cup of coffee in bed and read the paper before starting my day at 9am.  ,50
"so far this year its the best Hyatt Hotel ive checked in. The shopping malls adjacent to the hotel is fantastic. The meeting rooms fabulous, the food superb. The best part is the huge rooms overlooking the sea and the beautiful sunrise and the blue skies. Its close to the airport and shopping centers.. hassle free for the busy guests.",40
Stayed one night here during a trip to Hong Kong . Everything about the place was fantastic. Staff are well trained and eager to help and there is great attention to detail throughout the hotel . We booked a deal which included reduced price tickets for ' house of the dancing water ' which was well worth going to see and utterly spectacular .,50
"Excellent hotel, very well located. The hotel not only has the option of great shopping and casinos in the vicinity, but also the view from the room was breath taking especially sun set and rise etc. in the silhouette of the ocean. I was in a suite and it was vey spacious and very well done. Also service was quite good",50
"We only stayed one night in Macau, but overall, it was quite a wonderful stay. The room was big and clean, and the bed was comfortable, too! The only thing that dropped me to 4 stars, instead of 5 is the bathroom. The wall and doors were completely transparent glass! There is a wooden sliding door on the outside, but one can't be on the toilet, while someone else is in the shower. On a separate note, the front desk staff was friendly and a great big help. They assisted us in booking tickets for the ferry to Hong Kong, and they even offered to hold on to our bags for us until it was time for us to depart.",40
"Visited again Macau and decided to stay at Grand Hyatt. Booked a club room at hyatt.com, so no special deals. Check in can now be done at lobby level or at level 37 in the Grand club. I did it in the lobby, was smooth. Even one of the club manager came along to pick me up and show me my room. Rooms are the same like last year. Huge, comfortable, nice view (even from the bathroom while showering). Very good beds. The new ""feature"": The new Grand Club lounge is re-opened. It was 1,5 year ago at lobby level, then as ""provisorium"" in the Gym, now it is located at level 37. Stunning views to all sides, nice arrangements, and good food (I do love the mini burgers, but there is much more). Most important: The team on-site is very good. They take care of you, they take care of kids,…",50
"We were really blown away by the hotel and staff. It's true that many of the staff do not speak English entirely fluently, but we didnt have any inconvenience because of it. And actually, the staff were all more than kind and helpful. Check in was super fast (using the Plat/Diamond desk was not necessary as we were helped as soon as we got there) and we were upgraded to a corner king suite on the 27th floor with views of the airport, Venetian, mountains etc and no view of the construction. And just as an aside, we really werent bothered by construction noise. The time when we noticed it most was at the pool. But the pool area is so beautiful and lush and relaxing that it wasn't really bothersome.   Anyways, the suite was huge and there was a seriously delicious anniversary…",50
"Grand Hyatt Macau is quite centrally located - connects to a few of the other hotels as well as Cubic through an underground tunnel. The room itself was large and quite luxurious. Everything quite new, unfortunately a bit bare for my liking but still quite up there. Amenities were great, pool was nice. Breakfasts were well stocked. I understand it is a 5* hotel with all that included, but I did feel it lacked a bit of the glamour like the hotels associated with the Venetian. The shuttle buses to other properties were a nice touch. On the downside the room was actually quite pricey when you can definitely get deals at other 5* hotels for possibly 20-30% less - but if you do have the moolah splurging here can't go wrong!",40
"The Hotel is good and I can only write about its good rooms, its great restaurant called the Beijing Kitchen which is a favourite and the new Club room which is fabulous. The City of Dreams is a good location and a 2 minute walk to the Venetian so overall its good. The negatives are service can be slow and to get a taxi you need the patience of a saint.",30
"Grand Hyatt Macau situated in the City Of Dreams is an ideal location, it takes you into Fantasy Land. Where ever you look is this amazing light show, the staff are wonderful & friendly the rooms where so luxurious, even the shower had a floor to ceiling window as you showered you looked out over the City of Dreams & wondered if you were dreaming. The amenieties supplied where very generous right down to the slip on slippers. Breakfasts where like a full dinner, chef was on hand to cook your request. It is situated right in the midst of everything just walk through to the most amazing show we have ever seen that was The House of The Dancing Waters, which has you enthralled to the end. You do not need to be a gambler to go to Macau to witness the glitz & glamour of all these…",40
"First off, I've stayed at numerous hotels in Macau, having been there multiple times. The Grand Hyatt was probably one of the best hotels I've stayed in there. Macau does have great hospitality so the competition is quite fierce.   My wife and I booked a room with my infant son and were upgraded to a suite (which is common with your first stay in a hotel when they high vacancies). The room was beautiful and had great views of the other city of dreams hotels which have a light show at night. We had living room area with a TV, an enormous bathroom with an old school standing bath tub. The bedroom also had a TV and a nice big comfy bed.   The hotel has an arcade at the bottom which connects its casino with the other city of dreams hotel. I highly recommend if this hotel fits your…",50
"I recently stayed at this property for one night. The property itself is great. The room, which was a suite was spacious and wonderful. My only minor complaint was that my room was facing a giant construction site , which was a little bit of an eye soar. But it was No big deal for one night. The pool is very large and relaxing plus the free spa. The hotel is attached to the City of Dreams complex but if you wanted to go to another casino there were plenty of free shuttle services. The hotel's restaurant, The Beijing Kitchen was great. My second minor complaint was that the hostess automatically told me the restaurant was full, when in actuality it want even half full. I had to speak to manager and I was seated. If this happens to you just negotiate your way to a table. After…",50
"We stayed here for one night after seeing the House Of Dancing Water show (which was located a minutes walk from the hotel lobby). The staff were very friendly and we were upgraded to the Deluxe suite which was great. The room was very nice and very big, with a Nespresso coffee maker which was lovely to have. However, our room looked onto a building site and made quite a lot of noise through out the day.  The hotel is located within the ""City of Dreams"" which comprises of 2 other hotels, a shopping mall, casino, many restaurants and 2 show stages. The Venetian is also very nearby. However, despite being so close to such a bustling area, the Grand Hyatt was very peaceful.   The hotel has a pool which was nice and had good loungers. The hotel has a couple of restaurants. We had…",40
"While I enjoy going to both Macau and Las Vegas, I am typically one that like to stay at a hotel in the heart of things, but slightly removed from the madness (asin, no casino but close to it).  This typically means the Four Seasons in both Vegas and Macau.  This time, my wife and I tried the Grand Hyatt and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Its a 5 min walk to the casino at the City of Dreams, and a 10 min walk to the Venetian.   It close, but just enough removed. If given the option, even if you have to pay more, make sure you get Grand Club.  It is brand new, on the top floor, and the service was impeccable. The Club includes breakfast, as well as a happy hour which was so good, it basically became dinner.  The gym, spa and pool were also nice.  The food, especially Beijing Kitchen,…",50
"My wife and I and our 2 kids stayed overnight in the Grand Hyatt and watched the House of Dancing Waters show. This is a truly 5 star hotel, or more. The staff - check in, check out and  restaurants were always extra attentive to our requests. We stayed in the 30th floor in a suite, with a superb view. The room had Nespresso coffee maker & pods (my favorite), a huge bathroom with ""rain shower"" head and beds ultra comfortable. Also, staying in the hotel was really convenient for the show, since it's 2 min walks from the loby inside the hotel. The show is similar to a  Cirque de Soleil and entertaining, but I would say that the highlight was the hotel.",50
"we got a package for a suite with the water show. room was fantastic, big and well decorated. don't miss the huge salted water swimming pool, with in-water seats. will come back for sure. we had ocean view but the ocean is not that nice in that place so don't bother paying the extra.",50
"Booked 2 rooms for family.  Staff tried to keep us as close as possible so ended up on the same floor.  Grand club lounge provided impeccable service and showed concern for my elderly parents.  Breakfast spread was wide and of good quality. Dora and Randy(Grand Club Lounge) stood out in terms of service, friendliness and concern. The Peking restaurant was also of very high quality, food wise.",50
"First impressions were not good.   We arrive from Bangkok and wait for the shuttle bus...and wait...and wait.  The Venetian, Holiday Inn, Cotai Strip buses coming and going but none for Grand Hyatt!!!  Thirty minutes later   I return to the terminal, somewhat hot and flustered and ask at Information.   The bus, I was told, leaves from departures, not arrivals!  Well of course, it does...why not!!!   No signs, no apologies.  Having vented that from my system, my friends and I arrive, and the blood pressure immediately comes down.  We have booked rooms on the club floor - floor 37, and the extra dollars are well worth it.   The club itself is well appointed, the evening cocktails and drinks are of good quality and a broad range.   There are 3 chefs on duty so the ""snacks"" well and…",40
"Visited this hotel from 25-28 May 2013.  First impression: Not that good as even though there was a porter or staff at the entrance of the hotel, when the shuttle bus came to a halt and I got off to retrieve my luggage, no one came to welcome and pick up my luggage even though I was the only passenger/customer. This happen only after I enter the hotel ground that someone ask me if I am checking in and led me to the counter - after I went to the wrong counter though, haha.  Good: 1. Hotel lobby is grand and nice with very high ceilings and a nice ""water ball"" display.  2. Check-in was smooth and the check in counter personnel, a young chap, was friendly and tried his best to communicate in English.  3. A porter helped me with my luggage to my room and explained the various…",30
"Stayed there last month, for an extended family week-end. This hotel has managed to keep a human size, despite the gigantism of Macau and the herds of mainland tourists. Room are clean, large and bright, well equipped. Staff is attentive, but need to keep it up. Check-in was really slow, even though our situation was very simple ... Restaurants are good, especially Mezza9, and its manager, Mr. Carlos Netto. He was a charming host during the entire night, extremely attentive to our every needs before we could even express them. Magician? Beijing Kitchen good, not as perfect as the one in Beijing. We also pampered ourselves at the spa, much to our satisfaction. In summary: a great stay, with good staff (not easy to find in Macau these days...), slightly out of the crowded way.…",50
"We had very high expectations of the Grand Hyatt at the City of Dreams.  The food situation was amazin. Beijing Kitchen and Mezza9 have excellent, attentive and knowledgeable servers with a diverse strong menu to match. Had the grandest foie gros there! It's the spa where we had the greatest issues. I booked my wife an Herbal Calm massage on their website. It sounded like something she would like as they said they used herbal botanics and other face rejuvenating things. The actuality was a totally horrible spa experience. The beautician just sprayed her face with an alcohol based toner and proceded to lather 4 different types of products on. She also got her eyebrows plucked and makeup removed But that stuff could have been done at the room later. For a sensitivw skin massage,…",30
"3 nights. Lobby massive and representative. Check in slow. Our room very large, no decoration, no flowers, no fruits. Not a Grand Hyatt, more a Holiday Inn. Equipments in the room working properly, everything is clean. Room on the 18th floor overlooking a massive construction site with some noise impact and a view to the airport. Breakfast good, but not great. Fresh orange juice, good bread and Asian food. Pancake and waffle station. Coffee is bad, try the very good selection of tea instead. Amazing pool ! 40 meters ! Location of the hotel good, bus shuttle available.",30
"The rooms are amazing, and the facilities fantastic. I was upgraded to a suite, luxury. The Casino is part of the complex, and the Dancing Water show is a must do. The Hard Rock cafe is part of the larger complex for a casual meal or a band, and the meals at Mezza9 are also very good.",50
"We went there on a Chinese National holiday & had to endure 3 hours through custom.  When we finally arrived at the hotel, we were told our room is not ready (at 3 pm?) & had to wait another hour.  We came back at 4 & the room is still not ready so we got upgraded to a suite, which is pretty sweet.    My daughter loved the hot chocolate from the room service, which was served with a separate plate of whipping cream which she licked clean.  Oh, there is this huge playground called ""Kids City"" in City of Dream which is pretty amazing for little kids.  The only problem with Grand Hyatt is they have this sucky check-out policy of 11 am.  How is that one gets to check in at 4 then has to leave at 11?  I felt short-changed.",50
"We had a small room but good enough for one night stay, I love their mini-bar,so many choices and if you are coffee lover, they have cream inside the refrigerator instead of coffee-mate, wonderful. The service is really good, when i ask for a mobile phone charger, though they have no more left but you could leave it at the concierge to re-charge. One little thing is the bed - quite high for me not like the normal one. over all experience is good",40
"From the minute you arrive, right up until your departure, you receive the absolute best service.  The location of the hotel is in the City of Dreams.  You can either lap up everything the hotel has to offer you, great food, great service and fine shows, or stroll through the connecting arcades with up market retail shops, Hard Rock cafe, coffee shops and a choice of gaming venues.  There is a free bus to pick you up from your ferry and other free buses at the hotel door to take you to other parts of Macau. When you sadly have to leave, if you are flying home, the staff efficiently process all requirements for an easy ferry transfer directly to the airport.  Your luggage is even checked in for you. Thank you for a wonderful stay, and the extra special touch of a beautiful…",50
"Grand Hyatt is located in the City of Dreams and the rooms and service was absolutely fantastic. The hotel is huge and lives up its name. The staff was nice and friendly and the first thing they showed me in the room, was the location of the hairdryer, they had me right then!!! Nice coffee and coffee machine and the tea. We checked into a suite which a little dining and living are, view is breath taking with airport's runaway on sight. The spa was heavenly, it was huge and they did a great job. The hotel is connected to the casinos, hard rock and so much of entertainment right downstairs. I loved staying there, and love to stay again in the future.",50
"The Grand Hyatt Macau is located at the City of Dreams, a big building complex consisting of three hotels with a huge casino in the middle that you can see as soon as the plane touches down.   I spent a week there on business and honestly can't fault the hotel. Amazingly friendly staff, a room that was positively huge, a modern gym and a breakfast buffet that left nothing to be desired. This is very close to as good as any hotel can get.    The hotel did offer a limo service for pick-up from the airport (at extra cost) but I'm glad I turned it down as the trip takes about three minutes and they have a free shuttle bus anyway. Once at the hotel, check-in was quick and professional and I was in my room in no time. The whole complex is wifi enabled, so you can get free wifi on your…",50
"I had stayed for 2 nights in the month of March when an unfortunate incident happened on myself. Had emailed the hotel and their reply was prompt. Not only have they followed up throughout, they compromised and answered my questions and doubts without fail. I would like to thank the Front Office Assistant Managers, Chris Un and Florence Lou and the management for the thorough investigations and explainations in assisting myself in understanding the whole situation.   Overall, room was great with a good view of macau. Cosy. From toilertries to coffee machine was a wow!. Wifi was available and the location is pretty accessible without much difficulties.  I would still choose to stay there in my future visits.",40
Wow! Beautiful hotel. Got upgraded to a suite.   Huge room. Super new. Amenities.  Very modern look.  I'm not a gambler but it is connected to the casino so you don't have to go outside to gamble and the spa is amazing if a bit expensive.   The lobby is stunning but breakfast was disappointing--they kept recycling the same choices--I was there for 10 days so I would have liked to have a bit more variety but oh well. :),50
"The check in desk was full of chinese travellers. So I suppose to check in at the Hyatt Diamond desk but there was no staff. However, one of the staff notice me and he quickly come and ask how may I help you? I sincerely said I like to check in and I am a diamond member. He quickly called to someone. Within one minute, a senior staff came down to meet me and quickly check me in. He then lead me to my room. (I got an upgrade to a Suite). Thank you.  The staff was kindly introduce me around the Suite and inform me if he can send the welcome wine and fruit to my room. In five minutes, I have received a bottle of red wine and a plate of fresh fruits. Very good customer service and fantastic welcome gift.  As for the room, it's very spacious and new. There is a living room,…",50
We were spoilt and stayed in a grand suite which was just superb in every way.  Everything from the layout to the toiletries were without fault.  The view from the room was second to none - and we enjoyed the benefits of a Nespresso machine in our room.  Lovely breakfast at Mezza and it's lovely to have a range of restaurants - everything from McDonalds to more elaborate venues.,50
"We didn't stay here but we had drinks in the lobby lounge before the House of Dancing Water show. The staff are really well trained and extremely helpful. I am writing this review though to praise the service and efficiency of the front of house staff in particular the front door. One of our party was elderly with mobility problems. At the end of the performance we decided to get a taxi from the Hyatt rather than the bus terminal. There was a lot of people wanting taxis after the performance and many of them not wanting to stand in line. The door staff a young man and woman organised a queue and arranged for one of our party to stand in the line while the rest of us waited in the lobby lounge. We were very impressed with their service orientation, training and efficiency and…",50
"I've stayed at all the top hotels on the strip and this is my second favorite, after Banyan Tree. This hotel is the total package. I love the modern, beautiful suites and the pool is very nice and relaxing. As it is part of the City of Dreams complex, you can find many great restaurants and shops within. What especially stood out for me was the breakfast, the best breakfast on the strip in my opinion! Also, I love the fact that this place is not tourist infested like the Venetian complex is.",50
"Good room, but it would have been nice to have desk for use of my laptop. Suite faced a construction site with pile driving starting at 6:30am. Service was excellent, but room placement is important. A new Wynn hotel is going up next door and they appears to be at a early stage of the project with pile driving starting at 6:30 am.  Hotel is connected to the casino and two other hotels thus the limited food availability in the hotel is not much of an issue.",30
"Wonderful stay at the Grand Hyatt Macau.  Very helpful staff - great English spoken, beautiful hotel, modern, great breakfasts at Mezza9.  Part of the City of Dreams, so makes shopping and connection to the other properties easy.  Only down side would be the construction across the street for the next couple of years...but that is most places right now in Macau - and the scenery outside your hotel room is not why most are in Macau :)  All in all - great experience.",50
"The hotel has only been open for three years, has beautiful rooms and great staff. Outstanding design, good location with casino, shopping, restaurants and just opposite The Venetian - which is also great for more shopping. As in all Hyatt hotels very good restaurants: Mezza9 and Beijing Kitchen! Hard to beat this hotel in Macau.",50
"Grand Hyatt Macau I've stay here a long time, about 2 years ago, but I wanted to contribute....  Pros:  -Design of The Hotel (both Interior and Exterior) 5/5 -Connected to City of Dreams (House of Dancing Water show, Mall, Food Court, Casino, Hard Rock) 5/5 -Free Shuttle to main tourist area/ferry terminal 5/5 -Value: big room with couch , oversized bath area, state of the art TV set comes for under USD 200???

"We popped to Macau over the weekend to explore, and celebrate a birthday. Having read raving reviews about it, we decided to reserve a deluxe suite and it lived up to our every expectations. It is really a place we would definitely visit again. Beautiful room, excellent service, and the food we tried at hotel's restaurants was amazing. Oh, definitely go for the House of Dancing Water package, its brilliant!",50
"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt Macau for a short weekend trip. Our room was on the executive floor, which meant we had an amazing room and access to the Lounge for free drinks and nibbles and breakfast. Even without the treats that come with being on the Executive Floor, the hotel staff were a delight to deal with. They offered service with a smile, and were very patient with my questions (both at Check in/out, Concierge, Lounge staff).  The room was beautiful - floor to ceiling windows, and the bathtub also offered me the same view! Luxurious ammenities. The location is great, especially if you're there to see the House of Dancing Water. Short 2 minute walk through a shopping centre -- of 10 minutes if you enjoy window shopping like me!",50
"You will not forget your days there in Grand Hyatt Macau. Everything in the hotel is made with a perfection touch. An amazing hotel, design, room, service, smell and location. Simply, it is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in.",50
"The Grand Hyatt Macau is a nice contemporary hotel in Macau which is connected to the CIty of Dreams and the famous ""Dancing on Water"" show, which is a MUST SEE !!! The service at the hotel is very good and the spa and restaurant Mezz9 is also worth visiting. The big plus to this hotel is the heated pool in the winter months.",50
When we booked our room online we requested a non-smoking room on a  higher floor and away from the elevator as it is noisier near there.  My husband received an email from the guest service saying they cannot accommodate with our wishes as they are quite fully booked.  My husband emailed them back saying in all the years we have stayed at Hyatt's properties with the same request we have never received such a negative answer and if we have not already prepaid for everything we would have chosen another hotel.  The representative who sent out emails should be better train in customer relationship. Except for the bad beginning and some minor things our stay was quite good.  The reception area is spacious and uncrowded with the mainlanders which is a blessing as they tend to be…,40
"We spent 5 nights at the Grand Hyatt Macau and it was just perfect! We took a corner King suite and ended up on the 27th floor! It was a fabulous room ... 69 sq meters of space. It had 3 views. One showed the development that is happening in Taipa ... not a great view as such but interesting none the less ... once a casino goes there (the Wynn) you won't be able to see the ocean or what passes for Macau International Airport. The second view was of the alternate Hyatt Tower that lights up at night ... the third view was the front that looked over the pool, the Hard Rock tower, the Venetian ... Taipa and it's development. Our every wish was catered for. It was no trouble to get a taxi. One day we ventured up into Macau to the Sofitel (which is also gorgeous!) but impossible to…",50
"Stayed in June last year. Booked through a good friend working for Hyatt, Overall I enjoyed my stay there very much. Food was excellent ! Especially the chinese restaurant and I would congratulate and recognize them for having one of the best Peking duck in Macao.  Room cleanliness and overall facilities was great. It is connected to other Hotels - Hard Rock, Crown and a street away from the Venetian and four seasons. I was upgraded to their suite last stay. I can recall the hospitality till now. This is an everlasting nostalgia. Hope they continue with the Hyatt standards. Porter and Concierges were friendly and helpful.  Despite having left my luggage inside the cab. The staff continue to follow up and keep me updated promptly. At last, I did not locate the luggage in the cab.…",50
We booked the water dance package and chose the club deluxe king room. Our room was located at the Grand Club Tower and it was spacious and comfortable. We had dinner at Beijing Kitchen and the food is delicious. Breakfast at the club lounge has a good selection of food and was not crowded. The staff at the hotel is friendly especially the concierge.,50
"we selected the water dance package , is a real bonus. as the hotel is within the complex.  Room is very spacious , however lots of construction around the hotel , make the view somewhat negative .. ( at least -2 )  the outdoor pool is very ordinary , I suppose everyone is in the casino , shopping and not really into pool .... ( -2 )  we asked for Non smoking rooms , when we check in is perfect no smell , But when we return at 6PM , the bed is done so the room maker have come in, but the room is full of smoking smelll .  the entrance is very GRAND ....  Resturant is in Grand Hyatt is OK , I would not call it a surprise  If you consider the Package with Water Dance then is price have beat it all !!",30
"I have always rated this hotel the best in Macau - great Hyatt service and attached to City of Dreams which is my favorite complex (as well as House of Dancing Water it has a really cool show on regularly called Bubbles).   The rooms are always impeccable and functional, although the suite we were in didn't have a desk so not perfect if you were there on business.  The only reason for the loss of the fifth star is previously the Club Lounge was on the Ground Floor and in my view the best Club Lounge ever with a wide range of food stations in the evening cocktails.  It has now moved to the 3rd floor and is more of a basic club lounge now and inferior to most that I have used with the Hyatt (particularly as compared to the incredible lounge in Hong Kong run by Jake McHugh).",40
"A true 5 star hotel, with sevice to match. Concierge , reception and Club Lounge staff to be complemented. The hotel seems less ""hectic"" than others that we visted on our rounds on the Casinos. Reception airy was uncrowded and efficient some others had a definite market place feel to them.  We stayed in a Corner Executive Suite, magnificent views from the 30th Floor in the Club Tower. Afternoon ""happy hour"" was excellent!!",50
Stayed here for 2 nights at the Club level room with access to the Club Lounge.  The room was a good size and the bathroom was very spacious and modern.  It is a typical Hyatt room.  Nothing really stands out except for the Nespresso machine and a tea pot with choices of tea leaves.   The hotel is connected to the City of Dream mall and the Hard Rock Hotel.  It's convenient if you plan to see The House of Dancing Water show.  The concierge was attentive and helpful in giving directions and booking our ferry tickets to Hong Kong airport.   Now the not so great news.  The hotel is very close to the Macau airport.  We were told the hotel offers complimentary shuttle bus for airport pick up.  We waited almost 50 minutes for the shuttle.  We could have just taken a cab for the 5…,30
Stayed here 2night..it was great..unforgetable moments for sure..checked in around 3pm..the property is the opposite of Venetian..so u can go to Venetian by walk within 2 minutes average..

"Hyatt corner room changed my mind about busy hectic long queue Macau. Staffs are helpful, although breakfast services at Messa on 3rd floor could be improved.   The show not to be missed is The House of Dancing Water!  Cirque du Soleil in Macau!",40
Had a great experience here  From the arrival and getting a room upgrade to a suite to the quality of service and food. Also it is right beside the airport - walking distance Only complaint was the internet connection was a bit of an issue,50
"I have business conference in here and serve 2 nights in Grand Suite room. Room is very neat with full facilities provided, especially Nespresso coffee maker (I love it). I reserved non smoking room but it was not available for 1st night and change to non smoking in 2nd nights. All staff are very nice and helpful (when I could not connect to WIFI).",50
This Grand Hyatt is Grande. But it lacks some personal touch. Maybe because everything around this hotel is about gambling. The rooms are well appointed but lack a bit of local flair. Be sure to book a Club room. The extra dollar is well worth the included breakfast and afternoon snacks/drinks.,40
"Stayed 2 nights in this hotel,free upgrade to grand suite king,a very spacious room with  big living room,room is clean,buffet breakfast is quite expensive and not many choice the food is just nice.overall is great for this hotel,a luxury hotel.",40
"Stayed here again last week for a few nights in a Grand Suite King. The Hyatt is part of the City of Dreams complex and has a beautiful foyer as well as good sized rooms and full 5 star services.  Likes - Very big room! The bath is extremely comfortable and integrated into a wet area in the bathroom which also includes a rain shower. - Nespresso machine and loose leaf green teas complimentary inroom - Huge range of TV channels - The changing room for the gym includes a hot spa, sauna, steam room, shock shower, a number of rain shower booths and a relaxation area - The Grand Club lounge has a good range of food and drinks and friendly service  Dislikes - Small thing if you like to gym is the gym is quite compact and only has dumbbells up to 14kgs  Overall this is still one of my…",50
"Stayed 2 nights at the grand club wing. Usual 5 star luxury which I need not mention. I like it because the hotel premises has the water show, the free sky show, lots of shops and restaurants all linked together into a big entertainment centre. Had a lot of fun, ate, entertained all at the same place. The buffet breakfast deserves a good mention.",50
"I stayed with GranHyatt for 2 nights in October.  The suite is spacious and comfortable. The sofa is so big that you can lie down comfortably to watch TV and there are two 40"" inches LCD TV in your suite.  The Nescafe coffee machine is my favourite which you could make your coffee anytime and there are 3 different types of coffee to choose. The house keeping service is good and for putting a glass with a bottle of water on the beside cabinet.  But one disappointment is about the reception service which was not up to standard of a five star hotel.  he reception assumes you are not first time here and did not even show the way of the elevator for getting to the rooms.  But that agree to reviews made by other travellers.",50
"We came to Macau for the Grand Prix and because we are Gold Passport members, chose to stay at the Grand Hyatt, booking the Grand Experience package for what we believed would be a great weekend get-away.  We took the Cotai Ferry from Hong Kong to Macau (evaluated in another review) and the City of Dreams shuttle from the ferry pier to the hotel.  The City of Dreams coach bus was anything but dreamy, with a strong mildew smell and zero service.  We had to ask repeatedly for the luggage door to be opened, to which the driver didn't even get off the bus to help with the luggage.  To be clear, this happened to AND from the hotel.  The  Grand Hyatt is the second stop from the ferry and we were dropped at the lobby entry.    The hotel is new with an impressive lobby, although finding…",40
"I stayed here one night on a business trip. Booked into the club level.  Checkin and out: Fast, efficient and friendly.  Room: Very good design, fantastic beds. Quiet. Loved it.  Club lounge: One of the best I have ever been. Very good quality food, nice selection of wines. They offer them only for a few hours... Club team: Very friendly, more a friend experience than a service one.  Location: Close to the ferry terminal. Fine for business.  Overall: Very good hotel, good value, very good service. Will come again",50
"This is s fabulous property and the service is great. Suggest you pay the extra for the club room. They are Huge and soooo comfy. Our club guest predinner canapes were served in their beautiful restaurant!! And really, no need for dinner after earing a selection of Asian tidbits, Western and mini desserts. Then went to the Dragons Treasure show which is complimentary for Hyatt guests or maybe just club guests? Great show, love the hotel and will be back when we can. Thanks to Randy too for all his advice.",50
"I've been staying in this hotel whenever i visit Macau during the weekend about every 6 weeks this year. The location is perfect for my purpose and the Club Tower rooms are roomy, modern and very comfortable with a large bathroom. I like this hotel because I feel there is more privacy with less weekend crowd when compared to the mob you see in Venetian and even in Galaxy hotels next door. However, the service needs improvements as the check-in and check-out process is long and the concierge is not very helpful. The restaurants in the hotel are most average and pricey and not many people use the pool or gym.",40
"We spent just one night there to see the House of dancing water show. The hotel is great, rooms were huge with bedroom, livingroom and a big and clean bathroom with tub and shower. Check in was smooth, great service. We also had dinner at the Messa 9 on third floor, it was ok, but not exceptional. Quite pricy, especially the wine, and service so and so. The show was great, dont miss it. Location for us was ok because of the show, but it is on the other part of the city, so if you are interested in more than shopping and gambling....well then you should stay in town. But for what we came for this time it was great.",40
I must admit that I had some apprehension on booking the property given other reviewers claiming 2 hour waits on check-in and given the size of the property as well as others voicing concerns for the smell of smoke on non-smoking floors.  Let me DISPELL ALL SUCH CONCERNS as I am able to give this property high marks without reservation.  1.  I was greeted at the front quick by a staffer who escorted me to a check-in counter with ZERO queue at around 12 noon on a date that the property was at high occupancy.  2.  The check-in staffer then WALKED me to my room and pointed out the amenities.  No hand-off to a porter.  3.  The property had assigned a bed type that was different than my choice and I asked them to make up for it with a view.    I was asked City or Sea -  I choose the…,50
"I was staying at the GH Macau in October 2012 for 3 nights including Grand Club access. We had a room in the so called Club Tower, floor 29. I was able to look into some rooms and it seemed like all 29xx room have the same layout, except of the corner rooms which much be suites.  As usual in Macau the hotel lobby is very spacious and it leaves a great first impression. The high ceiling, the vast amount of space and it's decoration reminds a lot of Las Vegas hotels. We arrived from HK by ferry to Cotai/Taipa and there were immediately shuttles available to the hotel and we arrived in less than 10 minutes (it's the second stop, right after the airport which is located next to the Hyatt). Check in was fast and only few words were lost during our interaction with an Indian front…",50
"Love this hotel so much!!  Chic, elegant, neat, comfortable, those simply can tell how nice is.   Great pool!!  Nice lobby lounge!! Brilliant room!! Big bathtub with beautiful view!   Their signature aroma is the way made me feel addicted to this hotel.  Will come again!! ",50
"It's been a while since I last visited here.  The Grand Club has shrunk!  It's now where the gym used to be.... much smaller and less appealing.   They are still having elevator troubles! I had to have my key changed several times during my weeks stay.  Quite a lot of improvements by way of staffing.  Their concierge team is now quite amazing, offering a lot of good suggestions... restaurants and alternative things to do...  David is a true gentleman and truly helpful, Eagle is also a star with a great personality.   Their front desk still isn't perfect but their supervisor Ashley is very nice and really makes up for the flaws of the team.   Mezza 9 still serves up an amazing meal both for dinner and their fab breakfast buffet.     It is still worth getting a club room,…",40
"Combining a business trip with some down time while in Macau recently we spent more than our usual budget on a hotel and received more than our money's worth. The hotel is part of the City of Dreams complex that includes The Crown and the Hard Rock along with extensive retail outlets, restaurants, a few bars and of course a casino.   We were given a one bedroom suite that was very comfortable, the living room was spacious and nicely appointed with good quality furniture. The bedroom was very nice and the bathroom a good size and functional. The rooms were in excellent condition and we ordered a great breakfast from room service which arrived in a short time.  Although a large casino hotel, the staff were friendly, helpful and attentive. We may not travel to Macau very often for…",50
Such a refreshing feeling to stay at a place that puts design really high on its list. Just amazing little touches in each suite makes this a great place to stay in Macau. Food was nice. Esspecially liked the Macanese fusion.,50
"I have stayed in this Grand Hyatt three times and I like the hotel overall. Nice rooms and Design and services. The only issue is their non smoking floors have mainland Chinese customers smoking everywhere. I mentioned this to the management and they went to check on it, but be aware 80 percent of the hotels in Macau are occupied by Chinese and many feel they don't have to follow the rules. A big problem I came across many times. Like Chinese screaming on their mobile phones in the theater. Beware Macau is fun but you have to deal with other issues. To the management of the Hyatt, be forceful and tell these customers off, don't allow this to go on. ",40
"We stayed at this property in March 2011.  We were very impressed with the club lounge on the bottom floor with wonderful service and food stations.  The gym was also a highlight of this hotel in 2011.  However, they no longer exist.  They have decided to remodel this relatively new hotel and if you have visited prior to the beginning of this year you will be very disappointed with the Club Lounge and Gym.  The gym has been relocated to a back section of the Spa.  And the club lounge has been moved to where the old gym used to be, overlooking the pool area.    This is not noted anywhere on their site and when we booked our room earlier this year with Award Points it was not noted.  We also wrote directly to the hotel in July of this year to express how happy we were to be coming…",10
"I stayed here for 2 nights,.... Well I love this among all in Macau... Spacious, Modern, clean, new, spacious, comfy....unique design especially the toilet, rectangle from wc, powder, tub, shower looking thru window the Macau airport.. The sofa is modern comfy.... Enjoying stunning view of the airport with varieties of tea...(Chinese tea, English tea, coffee, biscuit)... Hope to come back...",50
"Stayed 1 night in club king room, spacious room with view..especially like the bathtub which you can enjoy the stunning view...the sofa is large and comfortable can enjoy the club lounge at 3/F anytime you want..however, some downsides1) bed is not long enough 2) the air-temp in room starts at 25degree, try to lower the temp..but keep 23.5 whole night..i sweat and sweat and couldn't sleep well 3) late check in (5:30pm) for my room..though provide a late checkout at 1pm for compensation...but paying over HK$3000 would like to enjoy the hotel as much as possible.. still recommend this hotel but if you go in summertime, rem to lower the air-con temp once you get into room, besides, dun go to macau on saturday..unless you will only stay in hotel =P (but hv to make sure hotel give u…",40
"Not up to my expectation, here's why: 1. Checked in on Thurs, which is not even their weekend rush yet, but they couldn't get the room to us by 3pm, but only by 4:15pm 2. They gave us a non-smoking room which was filled with smoking smell. The floor clearly labelled ""Non-smoking floor"", but the front desk said they don't have a non-smoking floor, but non-smoking room only.  I can understand how hotels with business mainly from Mainland Chinese could have difficulties in enforcing non-smoking policy, but if their signs of non-smoking says ""fine of $1,000 if evidence of smoking is found"", then no guests are going to take this seriously.  This is terrible.  I have visited many 5-star hotels including the Kempinskyi in Chengdu that was able to have the non-smoking floor policy…",30
"Beautiful, clean, modern decor. Lovely pool but I didn't get to use it during my stay. Free breakfast was awesome-large variety. Arranged free brownie cake for birthday. Fresh fruits and flowers in room-very nice touch. Shuttle services to other casinos. Dancing Water show was nice but boring in some parts.  Cons-Sad view of construction from room. Light Snacks Hour had very limited selection and cookies were stale. The Cocktail Hour needs to replenish food more often. ",50
"I was there and held two different types of events for biz, both of time I encountered exactly the same problems, actually I had immediately feedback to the hotel, unfortunately, nothing had changed. The valet parking staffs were so arrogant and not willing to provide assistance, they even asked me to park in the public car park by myself. Maybe they were only work for the people who driving a super luxury limousine/super-roadster, futhermore they were just so slow to return my and my colleagues CHEAP JAPANESE cars.  The receptionists were rude and impolite, two of my vvip guests were so unhappy because of their innocent behavior and untrained conversation, finally, my vvip guests went to Conrad hotel and paid by themselves, I was embarrassed to them.  I complained to my account…",20
The room is spacious and what we had was a corner room over looking the Venetian and almost entire the Cotai strip. The bed is big and comfy. I love the bathtub which is big enough to fit two people and share an intimate moment overlooking the view of Cotai. The money spent is worthy enough for the experience. ,40
"Grand Hyatt is one of the 3 hotels in City Of Dreams. Transferred to the hotel main entrance by the ""City Of Dreams""shuttle bus which got on at the ferry terminal. Shuttle bus service is excellant which they not only take you to the ferry terminal, casinos but also the down town area. Room for improvement of the bus is that the air-conditioner is too weak.   Staff service is very good - I was effectively greeted by doorman and led to the front desk. The time consumed in check-in progress was acceptable. We stayed in the Double twin suite for 2 days which had a large sitting room, dining room(Most impressive is that there is a Nespresso coffee maker with 6 caps of different choices and 2 choices of chinese tea leafs), nice king size bed and a lovely bathroom. Although there is a…",40
"Located at City of Dream, the hotel is connected to the casino and shopping mall.  Don't miss the magnificent show ""The House of Dancing Water"" which is showing at City of Dream.  Lobby is grand and modern.  Stayed at the Grand Suite this time which is huge at 64 sq meters.  Very spacious living room, comfortable bed, overall very satisfied. But I still prefer the Grand Deluxe room that I stayed the last time, smaller (at 52 sq m) but prettier interior with better workmanship.  Service is good and courteous though I was a bit upset when they requested me to check out at 11am because business was just too good the following day.  Will continue to stay here on my return visit to Macau.",40
"This Grand Hyatt lives up to its name. Great everything and connected to the shops and casinos. The Pool is huge and heated in the winter months which is great too. It's also less commercial then the venetian hotel and some others. I have been there twice and plan to go back again. Stay on the club floors if you can, its always a bit nicer.",50
"Having double entry visa for China, you have to leave China for a moment. Rather than to go to the obvious Hong Kong we went this time to Macau; the old town still having its authentic Portuguese Mediterranean atmosphere. Street signs are still in Portuguese as well. We stayed for three nights in the Grand Hyatt Macau and from here we explored Macau.  The Grand Hyatt Macau is located in the Cotai area between the islands of Coloane and Taipa, off the tip of Macau Peninsula, China and offers shuttle service. The five star luxury hotel is part of the City of Dreams complex and has spacious rooms, a business centre, several restaurants, spa, pool and fitness centre. All you should expect, but the service is impeccable and the hotel got a several rewards this year.  We were…",50
"They are just across from each other and so staying at one place u can easily walk over to enjoy the other place. I do not gamble so cannot comment on the casinos. City of Dreams have some good shows that I enjoyed. Shuttle services from City of Dreams go regularly to the main central Macau. Indian Garden restaurant is a good place for Halal/Muslim food. Grand Hyatt is a very good hotel. We got the executive package so the room was wonderful. Booked it directly with the hotel. Although both these places are away from the old central Macau, the regular shuttle service makes it easy to move between two parts of the town. It rained continuously but all hotels provide u with free umbrellas so no need to take ur own. Our group stayed in the executive tower and rooms were great. I…",50
"I kept the idea to myself during our stay to avoid dampening my companion's enjoyment. But she said it anyway over lunch: ""This is not like a Grand Hyatt!""  Before the hotel visit, we were wondering whether to book for a two-night stay to make it a more restful one. We were glad we stayed for one night only.  The room (a suite) was exceedingly spacious, especially for a brief stay.   In order to sleep more properly, we had to put some extra effort into getting used to the loud-noise air-conditioning: constant fan / air-movement noise, regular cranking sounds of the air-conditioners turning on and off.  In order to have coffee, we had to wash the handle-less tea cups (only two tea-cups provided) for Chinese tea.  Grand Hyatt Macau put a lot of effort to down-manage my…",20
"I and my family planned to stay in this hotel for 2 nights. We have booked the grand suite twin room and mentioned that we will have a child go with us.The check-in service needed to improve. They cannot stop the people from interrupting into the queue. When we arrived  the room, we found that the room is spacious and clean except that they only provide us two sets of pyjamas and shoes . When we ask for extra blanket  on the second night since my son said that it was quite cold at night, it made us surprise since we were told to pay for the extra blanket .  Besides this , the pool is quite big and the helpers at the pool side are good. They are very nice and helpful.  On the whole, quite a good hotel although the standard of service is  below my expectation.",30
"I had an amazing experience at this hotel - from the moment I stepped out of the taxi to the moment I left.  The welcome staff was great, helped me right away and sent my bags up to the room while I checked in.  The room was absolutely amazing - huge bathroom with tub overlooking the water.  Bed was so comfortable that I didn't want to leave.  The hotel was in a great location - connected to a few other hotels and a big shopping center.  The casino was also great.  Absolutely no complaints about this hotel, I will stay here every time I go to Macau.",50
"This is our second favorite hotel option after Venetian. I guess its because Venetian is right across the street when we can't book it cause its full.  Hyatt is very spacious and the deco is modern, simple and sleek.  However, it lacks a warm feel....dunno, maybe its because of the layout.  The Nespresso coffee maker in the room is what made me real happy.  The beds are nice and comfy. The only issue I have with Hyatt is their bathrooms. I have stayed here 3 times and each time I had a problem with the drainage system that we had to change rooms twice altogether.  Not nice.  The hotel breakfast is nice but not overtly commendable. The staff here at Hyatt are very very attentive and well trained. The best thing about Hyatt is their swimming pools. Its big, there are many sunbeds…",30
"The entrance to this hotel should impress the guest not matter one comes in from the Front or through the shopping mall. The service is adequate but my stay was short due to daytime and evening engagement when the morning was cut short by unexpected flight change due to cancellation.   The proximity to the Macau Airport certainly help me to handle such a change easier than otherwise. The room is very modern with nice sitting area, the night view of the environs including the neon lights of City of Dreams is pretty. I didn’t manage to have breakfast or use other facilities due to the sleep and go travel but hope I can return someday.",40
"I had a chance to visit Macau for the Netapp event this year. We stayed in Hyatt. Its more than a hotel infact the design is as if we are at home. The room was very spacious and good for a large family. Since it was an event, all most all kinds of food was served including Indian. It has a large casino and I did dabble in Blackjack. There is a food corner serving fast food but vegetarians beware..",50
"Location may be everything but in Macau...it can sometimes be too much. I have stayed at the Hyatt in Macau a few times already both for personal and business visits and all I can say is that you can't ask for more.   If I feel like spending time in the midst of the neon jungle on the main strip, I can hop over in a cab from the Hyatt. But honestly, there's no need to go, you already have everything in this single hotel. Interconnected to casinos, shops, entertainment and food -it truly has everything.  The rooms, well, the suites are massive and have everything you could ask for and more. Ultra modern, sharp and stylish. Service has always been impeccable and while at a conference in the salon areas, ask for Jonathan who is outstanding.   Highly recommended to anyone visiting…",50

"We love Grand Hyatts! I think it is one of the best hotel chains in the world and the Grand Hyatt Macau did not disappoint us.  We stayed in their Executive Club Corner Suite on the top floor and wow.. our suite was stunning! The Layout was great! The bathroom was HUGE! Loved the 3 room bathroom. The bath tub was big sunken tub and we could see the ocean from the tub! The toiletries were Chopard.. definitely a very nice touch! The views were gorgeous! At night, it looked like a mini Vegas outside.   There were free shuttles that took guests to some other good properties in Macau. We went to Venetian and it was a pretty! Definitely a place to visit. But not as good as the one in Vegas!  Since, we had club access, we tried their cocktail hour and wow.. we were amazed! They had a…",50
"Great spacious room, great views, great service, great food, not many hotels get this far! ",50
In a city of some madness the Grand Hyatt is an absolute haven. The staff are the friendliest we have ever encountered and ensure that you barely have to lift a finger. The club rooms enabled us to enjoy numerous snacks throughout the day as well as a great breakfast and pre dinner cocktails. There is enough to eat during cocktails that it could easily substitute for dinner. The chocolate pastries are especially fine!  The pool services was extremely attentive and the rooms were kept spotless being serviced at least twice a day. The hotel is kept separate from the casino and as such does not experience the mayhem of other places we saw in Macau. If we ever get back to Macau this will be the place for us.,50
"My brother was visitng from the States and we decided to spend some time in Macau.  Moving away from the typical stay at Venetian, decided to try a more reasonably priced Grand Hyatt.   The fact that the hotel itself does not have a casino but rather connected to the City of Dreams complex was a huge plus.   It was not a ""smoky"" nightmare filled with Mainland China tourists as has become the norm at places like the Venetian.    The hotel is in great shape and the rooms were clean and comfortable.   It's conviniently located int he Coitai Strip in the middle of the action.    Nothing else left to say.",50
"We really enjoyed our stay here at GH Macau. We got a king-suite with a view of the ocean and the airport. The view was great! (Soon, this view might disappear when the Wynn hotel opens right in front).  These rooms have a Nespresso Machine!! Totally enjoyed it.  Due to limited time, we simply ordered room service. Dinner and breakfast were great. They were able to help us with great tasting veggie food!  Front desk staff were simply superb! Housekeeping folks were excellent as well.  We tried the spa and loved it!",50
"Standard room is already big enough for guest, room is very nice, design is very good. Keep the standard of Grand Hyatt. Staff is nice. Rate is a bit experience compare to the new hotel in Macau.",50
The service was excellent (especially by the pool!) and the breakfast was pretty good. The atmosphere was inviting and the proximity to all the casinos (City of Dreams) was perfect. We got a suite and it was huge - definitely a great stay.,50
"I stayed 1 night in Grand Hyatt Macau for watching the show - Dancing Water. It was really a good show. I will return to watch it again in coming future soon!   Regarding the hotel, I stayed in the suite room, it was large and well equiped. Many free channels and movies can be choosed though the TV system. My room view was the airport, it was good but I prefer to have the city (hotel) view. The tea provided in the room is high quality, and I liked the Nesprsso machine too.   Key card is required in the elevator in order to access the room floor. Good security to avoid other people go to the guest room floors.   Shuttle bus is expected, as it is a must service in every hotel in Macau. But the service is out of my expected. A welcome card was placed on the table in living room…",50
"The overall look and feel is wonderful and the room is the best we experienced in our 50-day Asia/Pacific trip.

Free water bottles and free wi-fi in the room. The staff was also amazing.  Our local friends told us this was the best hotel and they were right. Note that most other hotels have nicer, grander casinos but if you want the best hotel experience, go to the Grand Hyatt. We booked via the hotel website and somehow got a much better rate than on all Internet travel sites (our rate was HKD 1.350 per night, what a great deal!)  Free shuttle from the ferry to…",50
"Holidays in China, why should you go 4 days to Macau, not being a gambler?  Easy, just to enjoy this beautiful hotel and to be amazed at the developping of the area (they are building a bridge to connect with HongKong... 61 kms lenght!) Once you,ve finished your good tourist duties, visiting the old Macau, it,s time to relax by the huge pool or at the Club Lounge where attendants fuss constantly over you.  The rooms(we,d a suite) are bright and brand new, and the public areas decoration is very modern. Show House of Dancing Water is a must, Dragone beated ""O"" in this one.  Staff is everywhere to help on everything you should need, all of them coordinated by Ms Shimizu, Director of Rooms, a true professional on duty every moment of the day.",50
"Pros : The show for "" house of dancing water "" is located within the hotel vicinity . Anyway no issue for other nearby hotels as there are  free shuttle services available . The room is big , modern and very comfortable , in line with the usual  5 stars rating . I like in particular , the two metal containers for chinese teas which is very traditional and practical  .Very nice atmosphere at the  food and entertainment oultlets located at the ground levels . Never try the swiimming pools .  Cons :  Room facing is not so nice  . Make sure you request for a better view at the counter   As my stay coincide with the Chinese new year period  , there are lots of tourist from China Overall my stay was very comfortable and realaxing",50
"The Grand Hyatt is a true five star hotel that lives up to its name. The staff is very well trained and will do what it takes to ensure your stay is an excellent stay.  The rooms are huge and extrememly comfortable. I even had a Nespresso machine in the room which was a very nice touch. The non-smoking room I had smelled a bit like smoke; I requested a room change and it was done without a hassle. The gym was nice and the pool was a great place to knock out a few laps. It was totally empty probably because all of the guests were too busy gambling at the casino.  One drawback is that there is not a real bar at the hotel, but if you want to drink, one can take a walk to the Venetian where there are a couple of decent watering holes (McSorley's Ale House is there).  On the plus…",50

I have Diamond status with Hyatt but unforturnately did not received any room upgrade nor was there any Hyatt Gold Member check-in area.  I did received access to the Grand Club which is an excellent lounge with very attentive service.  The food and atmosphere was very good.  Although I did not try out the hotel pool, it was beautiful in a very serene setting.  The hotel is part of the City of Dreams complex and connected to the other hotels by a passageway filled with high end shops and the casino being the center core.

I stayed there for 1 night and watch the water show with my fd.  The check in time is a bit long due to full house but i was being upgraded to suite which was appreciated.   The room is big and very new. All the furniture and equipment in the hotels was nice.  The bathroom is being and with a tub which is seeing the window.   The swimming pool is big enough and in a good location in the hotel.,40
if you get the back room you'll be looking at the sort of deserted lot of land and airport in a near distance. not a good view.  the room itself is good and comfy. liked the coffee maker very much. didn't try any of the food outlets. if you get the front facing room then it should be ok. otherwise i'd book hard rock or crown within the complex,40
"I came here April 2012 and stayed in the suite room.  The hotel is quite nice, the staff is polite and professional.  A nice sitting lounge on the ground floor with cigars, whiskeys, wines, and cakes.  Very nice looking, although I didn't try it.  I booked a package, for a suite room, which included two roundtrip ferry tickets and 600MOP dinning credit.  The package was 2600HKD including 15% service/tax.  The 600MOP dinning credit is generous, although the room service menu appeared to be a little bit more expensive than the other hotels, hence you get less food.  The lobby is nice, although the hotel is located at the end and you always need to walk farther to get there.  The lift and hallways are nice, and while the room was very clean, I was not impressed.  It did come with a…",30

First I looked outside the window and all I saw was a junkyard, the living room was plain with no atmosphere, kitchen area was like a utility kitchen for staff, table and chairs were uncomfortable, no easily accessible outlets for my laptop, bedroom was plain, bathroom was like a poolside bath.

"Last min decided to have a short break over the weekend. Grand Hyatt give us excellent experience. Travel from Hong Kong to Macau by Ferry via Cotai side. Immigration is just smooth without waiting in line. Cotai terminal is next door to the Macau Airport. City of Dream offer free shuttle bus that will bring us from the ferry terminal to the hotel, around 10 min ride.  The hotel lobby is impressive and staffs are very professional and friendly. We were booked on the club floor, room are nice and tastefully decorated. Over Over Over size bath room and walk in dressing area. Typical high tier Hyatt Standard.  Bed is comfortable and sofa next to the window give us excellent view although first night was covers with fog. We could see some light and morning looking out of the window…",50
"My fiancee and me had a great holiday time in Macau. We checked in at Grand Hyatt and were truly impressed with the luxury its offer. Staying at the high floor overlooking the the prestigious Venetian and the Hard Rock Hotel, we can't help ourself from admiring the view of the lighted city at night.  The room size, the wonderful rain shower bathroom, the large bathtub, the king size bed with its silky bedsheet, the top notch room amenities with nespresso coffee maker make it even more exciting. We wish we could stay in the room forever but we have to force ourself out to explore some of the interesting places of interest nearby.  Overall experience was nothing but a fantastic one. We so look forward to come back again and the next time round will definitely be a longer one.",50
"This was my second stay here and it was just as good as the first (May 2012). From the moment you arrive in the spectacular lobby, experience the professional check in to the wonderfully appointed rooms, you sense the class this hotel exudes. The facilities are excellent. In particular the gym and pool are classy. I strongly recommend the buffet breakfast for anyone who stays - it is simply the best I have ever had!",50
"Hyatt has outdone themselves in terms of design.   Providing an amazing home base for your Macau visit.  Lots of amazing restaurants, my fave being Mezza 9. The rooms are very tastefully designed and perfectly appointed. The bathrooms are heaven, rain showers, big soaking tubs and great amenities.... Chopard in the suites! The club lounge is amazing!  Serving a heavenly breakfast and delightful canapes and cocktails in the evening.   The hotel grants great access to City of Dreams and all it offers, Casino, House of Dancing Water, Cubic nightclub and complementary transportation to all areas in Macau.  The pool area is very large and slightly under-utilized.  It looks like it should have a great bar... but doesn't.   The pool itself is amazing with great pool attendants and easy…",40
"While this hotel might not be as good as a Ritz Carlton (I don't know, I've never been in one), it provides excellent service.  I was there for a 6 day conference and was almost annoyed by the amount of service I received.  From a speedy check in, help with my bags, and up to two room cleanings a day, to a speedy check out with help securing a ferry to get back to the Hong Kong airport, I couldn't have asked for any better service.  There were people everywhere cleaning and pointing you in the right direction.  Of course I don't know if all of the rooms were like this, but my room was excellent!  First of all, it was very spacious (USA style), something I didn't expect in an Asian hotel.  It had a very comfortable bed, refrigerator, TV, etc.  And the bathroom, I wish I could…",50
"I had no issues with smell of smoke here, it's a generalized problem in Macau because of the tourist population which it targets. However, the issue of smoke stench was solved by the other problem of a stinging room fragrance, which seem to permeate all the indoor areas of 5 star hotels and their shopping malls in Macau. I do realize that this is generally a difficulty for the local staff as it's quite difficult for them to discipline the tourists that travel here. However, the smell does make it a highly unpleasant and unhealthy destination.   I do however, prefer the decor in this hotel more than the Venetian (where I had stayed for a business trip), or Sofitel Ponte 16 (where I had stayed as a couple). The decor in modern Macau generally shows bad taste and quality, in an…",40
"My dad actually loved this hotel and could not stop raving about it.  That's why we came back but unfortunately this time, it was less than I expected.    Upon entering the hotel, the lobby smells like smoke despite signs of non-smoking.  We found a cigarette butt at the elevator and even on our non - smoking floor.  No wonder our non-smoking room smells like (cigarette)smoke.  We complained but they just insisted that the room is non- smoking.   Our room has a nice modern design and spacious - true to the picture they show at their website.  Free nespresso and tea.  Free wi-fi.  Beds are comfortable.  Great shower and Bathtub too.  Strict on the check out time- they gave us a late check out up to 12 noon.  Just 3 minutes walk to the shuttle area.  Free shuttle buses to a number…",30
"Recent stay at the Grand Hyatt Macau for a business trip. Hotel was disappointing. Had reserved a non-smoking room, and was told that the floor I was on was a smoking floor, but not to worry, as the rooms had all been cleaned. Room reeked of smoke and sanitizer, literally leaving a sour taste in my mouth the entire stay. Requests to relocate to another room were denied.  Hotel also refused to honor an early check-out request given to them 4 days in advance of the actual checkout.   Hotel was thus just an 'average' experience with significant bad parts.",30
"Good location, it is only minutes from the Taipa ferry terminal though the terminal operates limited schedule to HK.  It is within the City of Dream, so that makes walk about and even ease in using the shuttle.  Free shuttle service available to many places within Macau. Room is reasonable.  I had a corner suite which has 270 degree view.  The only problem is that the view is only of barren land and the City of Dream building.  Not much of a view. Room fitting is good but less luxary than the usual Grand Hyatt standard. Hotel is always on near 100% occancy I heard.  I had problem getting extended check-out which most hotel would do until 2pm.  Check-out time at 11am, extended only till noon.",40
"Modern & chic hotel, spacious room; being part of the City of Dreams complex, offered many places to eat, shop and entertainment like The House of Dancing Water show, casino, etc. We enjoyed the convenience of the free shuttle buses that takes us around to different nearby hotels such as the Venetians, and also to the Ferry Terminal. What I like most about the hotel is- they do provide 'Nespresso coffee' in our room; the hotel is less 'crowded' as compare the the other hotels we visited and its well connected to Hard Rock Hotel where we can conveniently visit the hard rock merchandise as & when.",40
"Booked valentines stay in the hotel as a getaway from Hong Kong. There are loads of free shuttles from the Ferry taking people to City of Dreams which is where the Hyatt is. The check in was fast and they made sure my preferences were met (high floor, kingsize, nonsmoking). Our room was 3176, on the 31st floor with a view of the Venetian and the pool a loong long way down. The suite was big and had every possible amenity we needed i.e. nespresso machine and robes :) his and her sinks, rain shower and bath. One of the best rooms I've stayed in. The weather was a bit cold but the pool is heated to almost 25c which is pretty good for February outdoor swimming! We didn't eat at the hotel as the prices were a bit high for us, though we did go to Hard Rock cafe next door and Venetian…",50
"Great modern hotel.  Enjoyed our stay here very much. Being part of the City of Dreams complex,  offered many places to eat, play and the Room of Dancing Water show is also here within the complex.   We especially enjoyed the convenience of the free shuttle buses that takes you around to different nearby hotels such as the Venetians, Four Seasons and the other new complex - Galaxy Macau.   The room itself was excellent.  Very upscale and comfortably large for my husband and I.  We had a club room which also gave us free buffet breakfast and free hors doeuvre and drink in the evening downstair in the club area. During the three days that we stayed at Macau, it rained every day, but we never gotten a single drop of rain on us.",50
"Location - Convenient location. Easily accessible - a short cab ride to the Taipa Ferry Terminal. Located in the City of Dreams, have a number of restaurants and a lot of expensive boutiques.    Rooms - Excellent decor and the room is very spacious. The bathroom is amazing and the rain shower is great.   Service - Great service. Friendly staff. Only glitch is that sometimes it is hard to get late checkout times. With normal checkout time at 11am, it is extremely hard after a night of partying or late night gambling or both!  Restaurants - There are a lot of restaurants within the City of Dreams complex but haven't had anything spectacular as yet. The Hard Rock Cafe food is horrible though.   Casino - Prefer the 2nd Floor casino ie the Hard Rock theme casino. The staff there is…",40
"Free shuttle from ferry pier to hotel. Very professional staff and amazing lobby. Room was about   60 sq.m.. really huge! With open view on airport and sea. We had a drink in lobby with nice live classic concert.. Access to casinos, shops and food court in same building.",50
We stayed at the Hyatt for 2 nights. The hotel offers great service and being in the City of Dreams you have immediate access to the Crown and Hard Rock hotels and facilities. The rooms were spacious and clean but one annoying feature was our room over looked adjoining hotels and the ongoing light shows. The room curtains were none existent and keep me awake most of the night. However it didn't interrupt my wife's sleep. The location is great and close to the Venetian and Galaxy hotels / Casinos. Expect them to be busy.,40
"Overall: Excellent, modern, very clean hotel with very large and nice rooms. The hotel is part of the City of Dreams complex (with its own casino) next to the Venetian and other casinos. It has a huge outdoor pool, great spa and very good gym. Overall, we spent three nights and were absolutely satisfied. When we were there (during the week) it was not very busy. In detail:  Rooms: All the room’s interiors are new and modern (see picture #001 and #002). Rooms are very clean. We got an upgrade to a suite with separate living and sleeping room. However, also the standard rooms seem to be large as can be seen on the hotel’s website. The room had a large bathroom with tub and large rain shower. Our comments refer to room number 2706, a corner suite in the Grand Tower (one of two…",50
Visited Macau again in December 2011. Attended a superb performance called House of Dancing Water in Grand Hyatt Hotel. Worth every cent paid for the ticket. Mersmerised by the very exciting acts throughout the 1and half hour show. Highly recommended to watch other than spending time in the casinos. Top class action.,40
"My recent 4 nite-stay at this 5 star hotel has again proven the marvelous service of Grand Hyatt. The room is very spacious, modern n minimalist design. The super big space allocated for the bath & toilet area is beyond my expectation. Cool !  The complimentary tickets to watch the 15-minute show of The Bubble (360 degree dome screen) is simply not to be missed! I just need to redeem the free passes from the hotel's concierge (non hotel guest needs to pay HKD50 per ticket). This dragon's treasure show combines 3D audio and a state of the art water curtain too.  The breakfast buffet served at Mezza9 was really good! Not to be missed even you gamble thru the whole night.....",50
"The room provided a welcome escape from the smokey casino madhouses.  Our room didn't have much of a view, only the development site next to the hotel and a slight angle towards the Venetian but it didn't matter one bit because we booked it for its size and comforts rather than the view. It is at the far end of the City of Dreams which makes it feel like it is away from the hustle and bustle whilst still providing easy access to the Cotai Strip - The Venetian (across the road), Hard Rock and Crown Towers. Take time to appreciate the portugese colonial history of the island...it beats the smoke filled casion halls!",50
"Most of the hotels in Macau are noisy like Grand Central station, and built around the casino, But the Grand Hyatt is by comparison a calm oasis, but being part of the city of dreams it is right in the heart of activities, most important being the water show (itself very impressive), but good shops too. The room had a living room and a bedroom. Furnishing is plain but adequate. The bed perhaps a little soft. The Mezza9 restaurant was excellent, particularly for breakfast and outside where the air was good, if chilly, and the atmosphere quieter. The Club lounge rather uninspiring in design and the food offered limited but adequate. Transfer from the ferry terminal was fast and efficient as were shuttles to the rest of town (although they start very late in the day in some cases).…",40
"This has got to be one of the classiest hotels there is.  My wife and I spent one night here in late November mainly to enjoy the Dancing Water show as it adjoins the City of Dreams Casino.  I was first struck by the grandeur of the hotel lobby with a futuristic look and being kept in immaculate condition.  The receiving staff is efficient and courteous.  For those who are waiting to check into their rooms (check-in time is 4PM), there is a hospitality area where beverages and snacks are served.  The room we had is a suite that overlooks the Macau airport.  On the other side of the building the rooms look out to the other casinos on the island, which might be better.  Unlike most hotels, this one provides WiFi in every room.  At first, my iPad failed to connect.  I called the…",50
"We had visitors from overseas and took them to Macau for a short 2 days in 1 night trip. It was wonderful staying in Grand Hyatt. We booked a club floor room for my family with a young child and a complimentary rolled in cot was provided for us. My visitor from overseas was booked into a Grand Deluxe Twin room. We asked if it is possible to upgrade them in the same club floor if it is possible as my visitor do not speak any Chinese. After checking the availability, Grand Hyatt Macau Gold Passport Team gave us the good news that they will upgrade my friends but no lounge service which I totally understand. I think they are very understanding/considerate because my visiting party consisted of a 78 year old grandma.   The room in the club floor was very bright, spacious, and…",50
"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt In the City of Dreams complex Macau at the beginning of Jan 2012 and thought the experience was amazing.  I had made an error with my booking choosing a Club Twin rather than a Club King and whilst some language issues in sorting through this everything was remedied (which of course they did not have to do as it was clearly my error).  That said after checkin was complete we were a little in the dark re Club facilities available and needed to investigate further for ourselves rather than have explained at the outset.  The service and friendliness of the staff was faultless from the experience above to greetings at the front door, restaurants, in the lifts, to just people going about their business.  All would smile and say hello which doesn't always…",50
"This is a great hotel! Went to Macau as a side trip from hong kong. What a great city! It's not all casinos and stuff, the old bit of Macau is amazing and reminded me of europe in asia. Go there!!  Grand Hyatt is in the new casino bit... Next to a few other hotels and opposite the Venetian - which is seriously like 4 times the size of the one in Vegas which is remarkable in itself.  Grand Hyatt rooms: really large and very well designed. Best bathroom I've seen in a hotel for a long time. Maybe ever... It was always a pleasure returning to this hotel and to the room. Staff excellent.  The food: the buffet breakfast was the best ever. Wild selections all being freshly made in front of you. (put W hong kong to shame). Didn't eat here other than breakfasts.  Anyway... The hotel is…",50
"A hotel which is very simple and stylish comparing all those ""Vegas"" style hotels which are too much for me.  The room as well as the bathroom was very spacious.  Big enough for a family of 4.  Free shuttle buses to go to lots of places.  Unfortunately, I didn't have time to have a look of all the facilities.  Highly recommended if you are not after ""Vegas"" style hotels like me.",40
"I spent 2 days in Grand Hyatt with my family.  It was enjoyable, relaxing and marvelous. The hotel is next to the Casino and shopping mall but you will have a complete feeling of peace and tranquility once you reach the the front desk of the hotel.  The staff there were very helpful. The bird's eye view of Taipa from the hotel is stunning; the Grand Club has friendly ambience.  Once you are there, you really need to try the waffles in the morning breakfast in the Grand Club restaurant.  They are incredile!  Crunchy and Crispy. I can't find any other places offer such good waffles. The spa made your day a complete relaxing.  Do visit there if you want to have a relaxing trip to Macau.",50
"I booked a prepaid stay and upgraded to a suite with points - there was initially some confusion at check in and they put me in the wrong room, and then at checkout they attempted to charge me more than the agreed rate.  Besides those two hiccups, the rest of the stay was great.  Heated pool was nice, grand club breakfast and evening snacks were beyond my expectations in terms of what was provided.  Rooms are large and spacious though the layout wasn't all that efficient (rooms don't have work desks with plugs for example), location is great for watching the house of dancing waters (amazing show!) and walking to the Venetian for poker.",40
Second time staying there . Spacious room and good quality choice of coffee ( Nespresso).  The big bathroom with big tub overlooking the view of the harbour .  Not ideal choice for family as the bathroom is all glass panels.,40
"We've stayed at Grand Hyatt twice. The first time was in July and we had such a grand time, we recently went back again during the Macau Grand Prix in November. The first thing I love about this hotel is how elegant it is. From the moment you arrive, the bellboys immediately assist you with your luggage, then as soon as you enter the lobby, it smells like roses--absolutely heavenly. You will also notice how clean the hotel is. Since my partner is a Diamond Hyatt Club member , we usually have the Club access to the lounge--it is absolutely perfect! The breakfast is superb and the afternoon cocktails.  We love the overflowing Evian water! The rooms are big and well designed, plus the bed and sheets , pillows are heavenly to sleep in. We have been to alot of Hyatt chains in alot of…",50
"We stayed 2 nights in suite 3220 on the 32rd level with a spectacular view to Hardrock hotel an the amazing Venitian. the Grand Hyatt is brand new and offers a great service with tasty decoration. It is part of the ""City of Dream"" complex together with Hardrock and Crown and has a joint Casino on 2 levels.  If you arrive by ferry you can use the free of charge shuttle. after the Hyatt is not situated on the ""strip"" you can also use their free shuttle as well. Very cool is the free wifi (unique in Macao) as well.  If you would like to gamble, use the tables on the 2nd floor. Not so crowded and quick service (all kind of free drinks).",50
"We stayed for three nights at this hotel and the experience was quite nice and pleasant. First, the plus points :  1. Pleasant surprise from the hotel when they upgraded us to a suite from a deluxe double room.  2. Very friendly staff at the hotel.  3. Huge property and is part of the ""City of Dreams"", hence connected internally through a glittering corridor called the ""boulevard"" to The Macau Venetian, The Hard Rock Hotel, The Crown.  4. Has shuttle bus facilities to almost all important locations in Macau. So you don't need to hire a taxi to go around.  5. The suite was big, spacious and very comfortable.  6. Food is also quite reasonable, considering that you are staying at one of the most expensive locations at Macau. For the budget tourist, there is a small Food Court…",40
"We are on our three weeks holiday around the world, and this is the first stop.  We were pleasantly surprises how new and modern the hotel is !  The lobby and rooms are amazing. We got upgraded to the premier room. Our double room with king size bed on the 9th floor was spacious and comfortable. The mattress is a bit hard, but it is pretty common for Chinese hotels. Our rate included free wifi access and very good  breakfast. The front desk staff and concierge are very helpful. They provided us with lots of maps, brochures and good advises on Macau. We liked the of ourh otel - we had an opportunity to wonder narrow streets filled with locals, walk through open market, eat in one of the best local traditional noodle place. The taxis are cheap.  We would definitely be back.",40
"We stayed here one night in October with three kids, occupying two adjacent suites.  The rooms were in very good condition and comfortable so no complaints at all, but they are not huge and luxe as they are at the Wynn if that is what you are after.  Being in Cotai, the ocean view is preceded by a large swathe of reclaimed land but we had a great view of the overall Crown complex which is pretty mind boggling already.  We really enjoyed the House of Dancing Water show which is just a short walk away.    Unlike many mega hotels in Macau, the Grand Hyatt felt more intimate and provided personal service.   There were three things that really stood out and make we want to go back:  1)  Room service menu actually indicated gluten-free offerings.  This is very rare in Asia, but I…",50
"Stayed in the Cub Tower and we were upgraded to a suite which had an awesome amount of space; separate living/bar area. The suite was beautifully presented with great views across to the Hard Rock resort.   As part of the deal we had a buffet breakfast in the club lounge; there was a good range of breakfast option and the asian breakfast was great. There was also free canapes and drinks in the afternoon which we made great use of before heading out on the town.  The Grand Hyatt is located in Cotai and is part of the City of Dreams resort group. Its 10 minutes from the central part of Macau, but there's a free bus to take you there and to other resorts on Cotai.",50
We stayed here for two nights in the Grand Deluxe King room. For the base level room it is excellent with all the furnishing including a large couch still in near-new condition and at 52 square metres it is larger than a number of Junior suites I've stayed in in other cities. The room was very quiet and it was a good space to relax in.   The main downside was probably the location for now. There is still a lot of construction going on in the area and there isn't much life nearby just yet. The Venetian is within easy walking distance and the City of Dreams complex is adjacent but neither held our interest for more than a couple of hours. The casino complexes provide a decent number of dining choices for a short stay but it would be nice to have some other local options.  That…,40
"We took a ferry from HongKong to Macau, by the time we got there, we took the CITY OF DREAMS shuttle to be dropped off at Grand Hyatt. The check in was quick & efficient, we even got 1pm late check out, knowing our flight was at 5 pm.  The lobby was awesome.  When we got to the room, we were very pleasantly surprised. It was huge. it has a living room! beautifully decorated. we also love the coffee machine they provide in the room. we ordered the room service, the food was great too!  The swimming pool was awesome!!!! although I didn't have to time try it, the design was really great! I will definitely come back to stay with this hotel. It is only a short walk to HARD ROCK hotel, & across The Venetian.",50
"We arrived at the Grand Hyatt early in the afternoon. Had to wait till 3 PM to get a room. Check-in staff did not have any attention to our needs. When I asked the club manager, we arrived in our room 2 minutes later. A bad start for an overall great experience.   The hotel is close to the airport as part of the City of Dreams complex. Construction sites for Shangri-La, Sheraton and Conrad hotels next door. The lobby is grand and is silent. Nothing reminds you of the casino next door. That's a big plus in comparison with The Venetian, The MGM or Wynn hotels. We did get an upgrade from a deluxe to a suite room. But all rooms are large. The design is minimalistic with superior materials. The beds are huge and very comfortable. Rooms face or the swimming pool and hotel strip (Hard…",50
"I am staying there with my wife from Nov 13 - Nov 17 for business and holiday. The room was amazingly spacious considering the rate. It is a 50 plus Square meter room with a good rate of around 2000 Hkd. You have living room, a dinner table and also a spacious bathroom. The hotel is also located in the cotai strip part of City of Dream resort, where all the actions reside.",50
"I stayed here for a work training offsite.    Pluses: huge room with an almost ridiculously large bathroom.  The bed was especially comfortable with some of the softest sheets I’ve had in a hotel.  Very grand lobby area (other than the smokers!).  The breakfast certainly looked very impressive but perhaps didn’t quite live up to its good looks, and the Chinese restaurant seemed good too though I’m not an expert.  All of the staff were very helpful and we had a particularly good experience with a concierge who helped us rebook our flights back to Thailand.  The function facilities were good too.    Minuses:  lacklustre view of vacant lots from our room and many others, which detracted somewhat from the luxury experience you might expect from a Grand Hyatt, and contributed to a…",40
"We checked in late afternoon, and didn't have to wait in line at all (probably b/c it was late afternoon).  Seems the other reviewers were right, we had hyatt gold passport, and were upgraded to a suite.  Very happy with the room, large living area, just as large bedroom area that could be sealed off by solid sliding door.  Large TV in each area.  Room felt warm and inviting, clean, bright and new.  Bathroom was large, and shower pressure from handheld was good.  Also a bathtub in the shower area, but didn't get a chance to try it.  Full-length mirror was a nice touch.  Bed and pillows were comfortable, no complaints!  Asked for and got late checkout without any hassle so that was nice as well.  Check out was a breeze, no wait at all either.  Went for Sunday buffet at mecca 9,…",50

"Decided on a one day visit to Macau during our Hong Kong holiday. After looking around for a good deal we found one on Expedia.  Hotel is excellent, good central loaction (for the casino's). Our room was amazing, so big and everything was spottless. The bathroom was huge. The only downside was the veiw, we overlooked a building site, which I sure when complete will be amazing. Just not at the moment.  Overall an excellent stay and one I would definately recommend.",40
The front desk registration is unique and more personal as you check in with one staff member who also shows you to the elevator and gives you their name card to call them if you need anything or have questions about the room.  We had Jolin register us and she was very helpful and professional.  So one gets a very personal feeling in this hotel.  One also notices the floral/herbal aroma in the air which is very nice and not overbearing.  The room was spotless and featured peppermint scented soap.  Plenty of towels and a large lit shaving mirror in the bathroom which also features a stand-alone tub and 2 way rainfall/handheld shower together in one room. Note- one should put down and use the rubber floor mat under the rainfall shower as the tiles in the shower/tub room are…,50
"We stayed at Grand Hyatt for a night in Oct. The room was spacious and the bed was comfortable. But being rated as a 5* hotel, I'm kind of disappointed about the facitlies: 1) They only provide the complimentary Nescafe coffee. It is too cheap for a 5* hotel. 2) Water escapes to the bathroom floor after the shower. 3) The swimming pool is in good size but no characteristic. In general, the hotel is good but not excellent.",40
"We came with a package to see the the dancing water show.  Room is big but many small details are already torn being a year old hotel.  Curtains are torn, carpet dirty, face mark on the window, shower leaks water into the bathroom floor, air on very noisy.  Maybe they rather have guests in the casino",30

"We stayed at the Hyatt for the 4th time in what we thought was going to be the standard 50-ish square metre room.  We had purchased the ""Grand Experience"" package with a club floor room, so we had breakfast covered as well as $600 MOP in one of the in-house restaurants (as well as a couple of extra benefits).    We arrived a little earlier than check in time suggests and our room wasn't ready.  I am a member of the Hyatt passport program and had stayed here before, and this definitely contributed to the upgrade to the corner suite, which was a massive bonus.  The room was HUGE, clean, modern, everything you could want from a 5 star hotel.  It's always nice to get an upgrade, right?  The quality of spoken English by the check in staff is improving markedly with every visit to…",50

"I booked 2 grand suites at the Grand Hyatt for a Friday night.  I booked over the telephone and the process probably took about 15 minutes in total.  When I received the email confirmation of the booking, I found that the bookings were for the Thursday instead of the Friday, and we were booked for two smoking rooms when I requested non smoking.  As not everyone checks over confirmations of seemingly easy tasks, I feel fortunate that I caught these two major mistakes.    When I arrived to check in, I found that they had mixed my Gold Passport account up with another person by the same name as me, which I found strange since I had given the Passport number to the man during the reservation.  The start of my trip was not good given the number of mistakes already.  The room was…",30
"We stayed at the Hyatt in a twin room with 2 children. Arrived on a Thursday so check in was immediate with no queue.  We booked the House of Dancing Water package which included 2 tickets and the hotel organised another 2 for the kids. The package was excellent value.  Hotel was very clean and still looks relatively new. The room was good with the bed more of a double than queen and a bit hard for my liking but overall pretty good.  Nespresso machine was nice in the room and tea selection good. The pool was great and stayed open until 10pm.   Free bus to and from the ferry terminal left every 10 minutes.  We stayed on a non-smoking floor and the smelt as we hoped. Couldn't smell any smoke at all. Given that everywhere else we went everyone was smoking, this was important.  If…",50

Very seldom found hotel to have equipped with a coffee making machine which was most enjoyable for coffee lovers. There are 2 LCD 37"" TVs in the room (1 in bedroom and 1 in living room).  Besides, the hotel is located right in the heart of Taipa, which is a newly developed tourist entertainment place; City of Dreams, House of Water Dance, casino, shopping mall are all within walking distance.",40
"A very modern and luxurious hotel. Extremely useful that the hotel is connected to the City of Dreams and their shops, food court, theatre, casinos and the Hard Rock hotel . The free, regular shuttle buses to the ferry terminals was very useful.  Would stay again.",50
"Fantastic hotel, beautiful room, awesome show (House of Water and Dragon Show) and value for money....all in one!  Definitely one of the best hotel packages out there at the moment.  Our first  stay in the Hyatt chain of hotels and what a lovely experience.  The Hotel.  New, clean and surprisingly spacious.  Room has coffee & tea making facilities, well-stocked mini-bar and a lovely bathroom. Staff were attentive, helpful and well-versed in English.  Shuttle Service.  A shuttle service runs from Tai Pa Ferry Terminal-hotel and vice-versa every 30 mins.  Organised, efficient, clean and absolutely free.   Breakfast.  Complimentary buffet breakfast included in the package.  Good variety of Western and Asian dishes.   The Show.  Please check my separate review on this one.",40
The room here was spacious indeed with modern look and amenities. The bed was absolutely comfy. No nice views to speak of but it had floor to ceiling glass walls even in the bath. Attached mall wasn't really enough. Food court was ok. Also crowded like Venetian.     Left something in the safe and it was Fedexed to us promptly. That's service.,50
"This is the 2nd time I stay in the twin suite of grand hyatt Macau. The staff just never fail to impress me. Whatever extras I asked for were given, eg blankets, slippers, toothbrushes, towels, teas, toiletries, etc They even got me the lunch reservation at Robuchon, a very popular French restaurant in lisbao hotel at short notice. My period came and I was unable to get any sanitary pad in city of dreams as it was late and there was no pharmacy in the building. The receptionist, Yen, gave me some of her personal belonging. It was a very kind gesture as she will not be getting anything back from the company by doing so. I truly appreciate it and hope that hotel will reward her accordingly, perhaps employee of the month? Anyway, I bought her some on the next day. The spa is a…",50
"A modern and luxurious hotel which is still very new, so everything is clean and nice. Best thing we like about the hotel is the connectivity to activities - it's connected to a huge complex of shopping (high end only), food court, theatre, casinos and Hard Rock hotel. It provides free, regular shuttle buses to airport and ferry terminals (to Hong Kong and Zhuhai). It is also just a corner away from the huge Venetian complex, which again is full of activities - food, shopping, gambling, shows. And yet, when we are back in the hotel, it is rather secluded and quiet...unlike the madhouse in the Venetian. Overall, a very relaxing base for other hectic activities in Macau.",40
"This is the best  Hyatt hotel I've been too and its just like a dream! everything is modern and functional. Room service was prompt and friendly. Rooms are vast and wide. The bed and pillow is heaven waiting for you.  This is cheaper when book through Agoda.com or Asianrooms.com . Its got value for money than the Venetian Hotel. But of course , Venetian Hotel in Macau has more entertainment, activities  and shops to offer . But in terms of room and having a wonderful stress free time--I'd take hyatt anytime. Besides, you can easily walk to  Ventian hotel as it is just around the corner!!! Best  of all hyatt  offers FREE shuttle bus to almost anywhere!  Airport, ports and City center!",50
"Bright and clean room, nice bed, high quality amenities and wonderful location, Grand Hyatt Macau is posed to be a great hotel but ultimately let down by some mindless staff.  The check-in staff is very cold and without a glimpse of smile. We have mentioned late check-out during reservation but the check-in staff didn't seem to be aware. The hotel has offered us a complimentary cake to celebrate our special occasion yet the cake has never appeared during our stay. We've passed our cellphone for their staff to recharge and were told that it would take 1-2 hours and they will contact us once recharge completed, yet no one contacted us after more than 3 hours. We've asked the staff to return the phone nevertheless since it was late night yet it took them more than 40mins to return…",30
"I stayed here for it's close proximity to the Dancing Waters show and the great Club Cubic and shopping area. It is a bit pricy, but much nicer IMO than the Venetian. The rooms are classy and large and have a decent view. I didn't gamble and felt like this hotel was a nice place to stay during my short trip to Macau. A tip, if the spa is full during your stay, try the spa over at the Hard Rock, which is steps away. Excellent treatments for about half the price of the Hyatt's! I only found out since the spa was full at the Hyatt...",40
"Macau has some great hotels and I rank this highly.Unlike Galaxy,Sands,Wynn,Venetian and MGM this hotel is more detached from the gambling areas.So if you want a really comfortable hotel and dont to immerse yourself at the tables this is a great option on Cotai.Over at old Macau the Mandarin Oriental attached to MGM is a similar option.In reality if your coming from Hong Kong the entry systenm is vastly quicker and simpler at Cotai and well serviced by free casino buses.I liked the contemporey design of the rooms which were solidly built and tastefully decorated.The restaurant  (mezza9) is excellant and has a great range of exciting dishes.The ground floor bar was featurless.I was impressed by the design of the hotel and felt the staff were very service focussed.I stayed in a…",50
"From the moment we arrived at the GHM, I knew we were in for a great time.  The hotel is in the City of Dreams and next to the Hard Rock Hotel and the Venetian resorts.  We had decided to treat ourselves and bag a suite on the club floor and boy was it worth it.  Check-in was in a dedicated area and we were escorted to the elevator and shown up to our room.  The room itself was just beautifully appointed.  Great bed, great views, great living space.  Nespresso machine, tea pot, lovely bathroom.  And all the mod cons you would expect.  The highlight of our stay was just everything (if that makes sense...).  Service was impeccable at every turn, the spa incredible (their 90 minute massage sent me into a deep relaxing sleep), the pool amazing and the club lounge - well - just the…",50
"I stayed here for the second time in Sep 2011. My first visit was in April 2011. Same as previously, I was given a room immediately when I checked in though it was not yet 3pm. As I was a repeat customer, I was upgraded to the suite.  To be honest, I prefer the Grand Deluxe room to the suites as I like e bathtub in the deluxe room. Anyway a suite is way too big for 2 person and unless you intend to bring in unregistered guests, a deluxe room is the best option. I deem Grand Hyatt as the best value hotel in the cotai strip as I only paid hkd1300+ per nite. Compared to what the other hotels are charging, I will go back to Grand Hyatt any day! I had stayed at Venetian, Banyan Tree and seen the rooms at hard rock hotel (all in Cotai Strip) and given the rates and the rooms layouts,…",50
"Went to Macau for a quick weekend trip from Hong Kong. Bought a package deal that included breakfast and ferry tickets.  I stayed at the Venetian before. Loved the room and amenities, but found it too big and too crowded. Grand Hyatt is an excellent alternative if you want peace and tranquility.  The service standard from staff is impeccable, from the moment I stepped in the lobby for check-in to when I was given back my baggage stored at the bell service after check-out, everyone (except a Korean speaking staff that could use some smile, maybe he had a bad day) was eager to help and please.  Another slight complaint was the package deal breakfast. I didn't expect that they set up a function room for the breakfast buffet. As such, the ambience and variety are lacking comparing…",50
"Grand Hyatt Macau is located away from the strip, in a complex called City of Dreams (alongside Hard Rock Hotel, and across the street from the Venetian). When you arrive, you are greeted with a beautiful waterfall, a gorgeous lobby with a sparkling chandelier, and piano playing in the Patisserie. The smells and music in this hotel are inviting and memorable - everything from the unique T2 teas in the rooms (the Jasmine is amazing) to the music that sounds in the elevators and the hallways. The food here is out of this world - Beijing Kitchen is traditional Chinese food - the hot and sour soup is addictive, and so is the fried crab, and the beef/noodles. The Mezza9 is luxurious and outrageously lavish restaurant upstairs. The sushi platter was to die for, and the same goes for…",50
"We were impressed the moment we stepped into the hotel. For all the hustle and bustle of other hotels in and around Macau, I would say the Grand Hyatt is the least crowded with people. It was nice of the hotel staff to upgrade us to a suite during our stay as I travel along with my 3 year old kid. It's inter-connected with the City of Dreams and they also offer a free show to in-house guest.  Everything about the room is good with excellent amenities. They even offer a coffee making machine. I would definitely return to stay at this hotel the next time I am here.",40
"We definitely will be back to this Hyatt again when we're in Macau because: - Not as hectic as other major hotels including during their rush check-in/out time - Not littered with ""chicken"" throughout the hotel - Offer a very nice breakfast buffet at its restaurant or club lounge - Close to some attractions in Macau  House of Dancing Water is not a bad show, especially if you can get the tickets at good price. I have been to most of CDS show in Vegas and HDW is comparable to them. In my opinion, Le Reve is still the best",40
The grand Hyatt on Cotai Strip is a real oasis on the middle of the madness that is Macau. One thing to watch out for is that smoking is allowed in doors in Macau and lots of people do. So make sure you ask for a on smoking room if you are a non smoker. The smokers are so bad they even try to get into lifts with lit cigarettes. If you can book a club room which is in its own tower with a separate lobby.,40
"From previous pleasant  stays at the hyatt hotels around Asia we decided to stay at the grand hyatt in Macau also. it was me , my wife and 3 little kids. As we arrived the hotel their were so many people quing to check in. Lockly I have a platinum membership so we had to wait for only 15 min.  The room was ok but we expected better from the hyatt.  The most disappointing part was the dinning options. They have only 2 resturants in the hotel , one Chinese and one international which have also kids menu. The international restaurant was closed on Monday so we had no other alternative for dining with the kids. We asked the front desk staff and they recomamded to order room service. What a joke ! Staying in 5 stars hotel and need to stay in the room for dinner???  We asked for the…",20
We had a two nights stay at the Grand Hyatt . The hotel is only about two years old as a result everything looked very new. we booked a Grand suite King Which was located in the grand Tower the room was beautiful and tasefully decorated with a very spacious seperate living room overlooking the cotai view with direct views of the Galaxy and Ventian the bathroom was immaculate and so was everything else free WIFI in the room  The Lobby was very grand and elegant with more modern and contemporary decor which makes this hotel stand out from most of the other hotels which are more ornate. The hotels is attached to a fine mall with many high end brand boutiques and also the House of Dancing Water theatres. unfortunately we were unable to get tickets for this show as all were sold out…,50
"i love the grand hyatt macau and would recommend to all types of travellers  the rooms are ultra modern and huge,the staff polite and courteous and make u feel special  restaurants are amazing and the city of dreams complex it is situated in is brilliant having all that you need they have shuttles to everywhere so dont need a cab at all one of the best properties in macau get the king suite and ask for airport views for fabulous views of the macau airport and the sea beyond!",50
"We pulled up in a taxi and the door men stood around doing nothing to help (like hold the door open). Same every time we returned. Even though I have platinum status our suite had a view that included a landfill whereas the other side had a water view sand the trash. But the hotel is new and conveniently located near airport, the Venitian  small towns with great Portugese food.   ",40
- big room over 500 sq ft - big sofa - very nice bathroom - hotel staff are very nice,50
"After staying at Venetian the last time we were in Macau, we decided to stay in a hotel without a casino attached to it to avoid the pungent smells of the casino. We chose Grand Hyatt according to the great reviews from this website .  The rooms were bright, basic, and clean. We enjoyed the breakfast meal which was WAAAAY better that that at Venetian, so totally worth buying the room and breakfast deal, which we had found soooo disappointing when we bought the deal for Venetian.  The coach service was very convenient, and we were right above the House of Dancing Water show, so we didn't have to rush to catch the show.  Check in and check out was relatively fast, and we enjoyed our stay here.",40
"We stayed one night at Grand Hyatt Macau May 24, 2011.  Upon arrival the room was not available so we went to the Beijing Kitchen for lunch.  Very Good, but QUITE expensive for Chinese food..but to be expected at Grand Hyatt.  The room is laid out very differently with the tub/shower totally exposed to the bedroom.  The shades were broken to hide the shower so a repairman was called and quickly repaired the problem.  Dinner in the Mezza9 was a disaster!!  We were aked if we wanted smoking or non-smoking and were seated in non-smoking as requested.  Shortly after ordering dinner, they opened the doors to a private dining room where everyone was smoking cigars.  The smoke was intolerable!  They moved us two table toward the windows but that did not stop the smoke from ruining our…",20
"Stayed for one night whilst we went to watch the ""House of Dancing Water"" (strongly recommend btw).... rooms are great with everything you need, a nice touch is the fresh tea leaves of various Chinese teas.... asked for extra duvet and was delivered straight away....  Could not ask for more then a hot shower, a great night's sleep and superb service.... will definitely stay here again",50
"This is one of the newest hotels on/near the Cotai Strip.  Great place for seeing the Strip.  Good restaurants, big casino floor (but no poker lounge), spotless rooms, room serviced twice a day, you name it.  Beijing Kitchen is fantastic and the free breakfast buffet had more selection than I could have hoped to try in a month much less a weekend.  I was even upgraded to the ""diplomat suite"" because there were no other non-smoking rooms available by the time I arrived.  Only drawbacks were the somewhat slow check-in (to be expected on any evening of a holiday weekend) and the lack of a poker lounge--which made me go to the Venetian for much of my gaming.  Pretty expensive, especially the weekend rates, but if I could do it over again I'd definitely stay here!",50
"The Grand Hyatt is a great hotel in a convenient location. We enjoyed a lot spending 2 nights there. Though there were lots of people when we arrived, the receptionist was fast and efficient and tried her best to satisfy all our wishes. The suite we occupied was very quiet and confortable. The room was large, beautiful and well furnished and the heavenly bed it's a real pleasure! Being the hotel new, everything is still perfect and in good shape.  The gym is large and airy, with lots of brand new Technogym machines and really few people to use them. But my favourite was the swimming pool, an absolute must if you have some spare time. Breakfast is a pure treat. If I should find anything to complain about, then I'd mention the service in the room, as they hardly cleaned our tea…",50
best ever stay in macau we booked the suite.   Much better than the ventitan rooms which are almost rundown now. and cost was cheaper to including the full package of breakfast and one way ferry transfer.  very accommodating chef who made special vegetarian food for us.,50

Had a very pleasent stay in the hotel. Staff was very courtious though language was a problem with them as they can't understand english.",50
"I stayed here back in November 2010 and decided to stay here again. I saw that the Venetian was a little less but I prefer the modern design rooms at the Hyatt. Plus looking at the pictures of the rooms at the Venetian, it's almost the same as the one in Las Vegas. Checkin went smoothly and was given a room in the Grand Club Tower. Staff were friendly and even showed me how the room functioned even tough I already knew how things worked in the room. I reserved a King Suite like last time and received a room at the end of the floor which had a great view of the pool and venetian along with the rest of the City of Dreams property. The room layout was different from the past king suite but I liked it. The size of the room was large and the bed was very comfortable to sleep in. This…",50
"Stayed in the grand club level. Beautiful rooms, great location and grand club lounge is the best Hyatt has...period. Would highly recommend for those who don't want to stay right in the middle of the casino action although very close by. I love this hotel. Mezza9 Sunday brunch to die for.",50
"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt for 2 nights as part of our honeymoon, the hotel is located within the city of dream complex across the road from the Venetian. It really is a stunning 5 hotel. The hotel is very modern but still elegant the staff did seem a little disconnected with western traveler's which may of being due to their limited English. The hotel offers an excellent gym with high tech equipment and an outdoor pool which I didn't use as it was very windy and cool when I was there. We ordered some room service on our first night as we arrived on late flight into Macau and most restaurant were closed by then. I have to say its probably one of the most delicious room service meals I've  had and I had a few in my time as my husband works for a global luxury hotel chain. We…",40
"My wife and I spent 3 nights at the Grand Hyatt Macau, this is a fantastic Hotel in the City of Dreams near to other locations and resorts. The hotel is just stunning, the suites are very large, confortable, the lobby and the patisserie are impressive and the restaurant it is also very nice. The only downside is the service, not yet Hyatt standards, missing of little touches that you normally find in such hotels, for example no turn downs in the evening, no a little note or a chocolate for the “Good Night”.",40
I have been traveling all my life. I am a senior citizen that uses a stick to walk. Macau is a great destination. The hotel facilities and service were superb. The hotel made everthing easy for me. The Grand Club lounge located on the ground floor is very practicle. The House of Dancing Water show in the adjacent theater was very enterntaining as was watching the action on the casino floor. I very much enjoyed my stay at Grand Hyatt Macau.,50
"the hotel is new with spacious and well-appointed suites that let in a lot of light. overall, i enjoyed my stay here and would recommend the hotel to my friends, however, there are still some kinks that need to be resolved:  1. the svc, though well-meaning, is somewhat lacking (e.g., no porters to accept our luggage upon arrival, and no staff to manage the taxi line, which gets really long during the day) 2. very slow internet - watched the nba playoffs online using the league pass, and it froze several times and never rendered the highest resolution. (at least it was free.) 3. they don't accept hyatt pts if you've purchased your stay from a discount purveyor (unlike some other hyatts) 4. the ""ocean"" view is pretty shabby, shoudl be much nicer when fully built up, but, right…",40
"Best possible score for quiet, tasteful rooms and cleanliness. Free internet and TV with a fantastic sound system was a plus. The breakfast buffet was very good, and the staff aimed to please. The gym and pool looked great, although I didn't have time to use them. Is this a family friendly place? That depends. You don't have to worry about walking through clouds of second-hand smoke to get to your room like a certain big hotel across the street. Like many other hotels in this town, however, there are lots of prosties walking around, including one who tried to pretend she was in our group while we waited for the elevator so security wouldn't kick her out.",40
"I have travelled a to to Macau and I have stayed in many Grand Hyatts in Asia. It's always a pleasure for me to stay at the GH in Macau: great location (close to the casions, the shows and good restaurants - but away from the (cheap) mass-tourism. The hotel is not in the city center (Cotai), but you can easily get to the city by bus (take a free casion shuttle, a public bus or a taxi for less than 10 USD). The rooms are very spacious (especially in the 'Club' tower) and clean. Room service and house keeping is perfect. The breakfast buffet offers anything you like. The gym is often empty but top-notch. The pool is heated so you can take a swim late night, surrounded by the gittering neon-facads of the casinos.   The poorly organized check-in that other reviewers experienced is…",50

This is one of the newer Grand Hyatts and I love the high ceiling reception with that airy and spacious feeling.  The scent always makes me feel home.

It is still relatively new however cleanliness needs improving since there are marks on furniture already including toilet covers...

As we arrived late in the evening, there was only one staff at the reception--the staff was not particularly helpful nor warm, making the whole check in process not a very pleasant experience.   The room itself is very spacious, but somehow I found bits and pieces in the room that shows some signs of ageing--really a bit too early for such a new hotel (Perhaps this is also partly due to the building materials used). The L-shaped sofa in the living room came in very handy for a big group of people to play card games/watch TV , and the bathroom is very bright and spacious--the rainforest style shower is also a nice…",40

Tried to check in and had to wait an 30 mins in queues. There is no organised method of checking in customers on a first come first served basis. Checking in at 4pm, one hour after the check in time, and no rooms available. I had a meeting to go to and then customers to take for dinner. I tried to complain to management, however, when I finally got someone, they really could not have cared less.  Similar situation on check out, I was checking out at 7:30am, there was only one desk working. From what I was told the night before the hotel was full...so why only one desk working.

"Stayed at Grand Hyatt for short break in March 2011.  Opted for a room in the Club Tower giving access to the Club Lounge with inclusive breakfast, snacks, wine and cocktails.  THe room was on the 30th floor with good views of the Venetian and countryside beyond albeit considerable construction adjacent to hotel although no noise or disturbance from this.  The room was spacious and bright and very comfortable.  Had excellent room service at extremely reasonable costs.  Well located within the City of Dreams with access to shops, restaurants and connected to Hard Rock and Crown and across road from Venetian.  Frequent free shuttle buses are run from the hotel into Macau old town as well as to and from the ferry terminal frequently,  Staff in the Club Lounge were very friendly.",50

"Check in was slow. Although they opened up a new line after I complained.  Rooms are great with all the amenities and facilities you'd expect from a Grand Hyatt. You'd be surprised at how good the standard rooms are.  Breakfast was good with lots of choices. However, waiting for a table for breakfast at a Grand Hyatt isn't really my thing (it felt like I was at the Maxim Palace in HK waiting for a dim sum lunch).  Check out was slow.   To conclude, great rooms but could improve on service.",40
"Shuttle bus to the hotel from the ferry terminal. Slow check-in service, couldn't check into our room, told to come back later, but we were upgraded to a suite for free as our room was fully booked. The breakfast buffet was great, wide selection of food. Efficient staff. Construction going on nearby the hotel, but our room had a nice view of the Cotai Strip. It has a nice swimming pool. There are shuttle buses in the area that can take you to the other hotels. The suite was incredible, very large with a comfortable bed.",50
"We stayed in the hotel when it was brand new, and booked a suite because we didn't find any photos of the smaller rooms. Now that the images are up, I think I'd rather have one of the smaller rooms because of the lovely bathtub design, but our suite was very nice too. One thing with our suite's bathroom was the door to the toilet, which is just a sheet of frosted glass. Not really enough to cover sound or smell, if you get the picture.  Perhaps because it was brand new, the spa was closed so we had to change into swimwear in the outdoor toilet next to the pool, which wasn't ideal at all.  Everything in this hotel is big, and super designed in a very modern way, especially the massive entrance hall. The attached shopping mall and casino, called the City of Dreams, is however…",40
This hotel is located in new Macau which is another island but traveling in Macau is a breeze because of the shuttle bus service they provide..... once you come out of the Macau ferry pier you'll have to locate the bus which takes you to the city of dreams ......

I will definitely go back for the cake. =) Nice hotel, good security.",50
"It only opened in 2009, so the Grand Hyatt Macau is still very new. Located in the 'City of Dreams' complex in the Cotai area of Macau, it is indeed very grand – when you enter, it feels like you're stepping into some kind of gleaming contemporary megalith!  If you're coming to Macau more for the sight-seeing, food and culture though (rather than gambling), then this hotel is somewhat out of the way - Macau itself is about fifteen minutes drive away. However, it is a really nice hotel, and there is a frequent free shuttle bus service operated by City of Dreams. Also taxis are pretty cheap.  The lobby of the hotel is very dramatic - it has ceilings so high you can barely see them, and I loved the focal art-piece in the Lobby which was a beautiful golden decoration hanging over a…",50
"As with most other similarly rated hotels in Macau, rooms are spacious and where they differentiate themselves from the competition is the level of light in the room, creating a very airy atmosphere. There are obvious logistical issues at the property, perhaps stemming from it's relatively young age as well as balancing low occupancy levels in a poor economy. It is clear that not all rooms are made available and that they limit the number in order to better manage staffing. The knock-on effect this has is mayhem at breakfast with only 1 restaurant in the complex catering to the average guest (club rooms and elite members have access to the lounge). The restaurant is either bottle-necked or simply unavailable at breakfast as the masses swarm before a day of gambling. While being…",40

Grand Hyatt is located at one end of a  large under cover shopping mall , Crown Hotel at the other end with Hard Rock in the middle.

Doesn't quite deserve five stars as the location was soso and it wasn't exceptional value as the price wasn't that cheap.   We originally booked a grand suite and upon check-in, they upgraded us to an executive suite. Needless to say, the room was fabulous. Large living room, bath tub, TVs, etc. Location wasn't so convenient, but we didn't care as we had been to Macau before and were just there for the hotel. The pool was heated and very nice. Overall, a very nice experience.",40

I would certainly return again to the hotel. Early December was a good time to visit as weather was nice.",50
"Absolutely wonderful rooms, loved the bathroom (especially the bath with an interesting view over the airport and the Cotai wastelands) and comfortable bed, and all the amenities. I think the place has only been open for 12 months, so it is still in very new condition. Would definitely stay here again. A few downsides - this is Macau after all - crowds can mean slow check in and check out, and the place can seem overwhelmed with package tourists. Also, being right at the back of the City of Dreams, it can be hard to get a cab at some times. Not a big problem though, the CoD provides shuttle buses to points of interest in Macau, also easy walk to CoD shops and Casino, or over the road to the Venetian. Quite reasonably priced for the quality too.",50
"I had not wanted to review this hotel, but after reading the reviews here I thought I should do one as a reality check.  This is a luxurious 6-star hotel with 3 star service. Sure, the hotel and room were lovely. The photos posted by the reviewers are completely accurate. I paid about $280 Singapore dollars for a huge beautiful room that would have cost an arm and leg in Singapore and London. But the hotel is very new so therefore everything was in mint condition. I just hope they keep it that way. Reason for my stay there was to attend a conference. Otherwise, there was nothing to attract me there. The hotel is located in the City of Dreams so unless you enjoy gambling and being surrounded by an unreal and tacky atmosphere, don't go there.  The area tries to replicate Las Vegas…",30
"The Hyatt greets you to a breathtaking lobby area. Space, Lights and Water in abundance. The location of the hotel was perfect for us, close to the airport which worked as we had a late night flight in. It is also away from the hustle and bustle of the main Macau town area, so you have more space, more safety, less smoke and less of the street ladies. The hotel and location are perfect if you are coming to Macau for a luxury break. The fact that it is attached to the City of Dreams complex is a bonus, not only if you are a Casino freak but also if you like to try out different restaurants and spas in different hotels.   Pick up was on time, with 2 representatives and very recommended, even if the journey is less than 10 mins from the airport.   Our room, the Executive Grand…",50
First night I stayed here I stayed in a regular King Suite. Checkin was quick and the person who checked me in walked me to the elevator. First step into the room and I was impressed. The living room area is spacious with a sofa and an area with a table like a dining area. You can entertain a group of people here. Next to the living room area is the bedroom. Again spacious area with the bathroom to the right with a tub in the shower area. There are speakers in the bathroom so you can enjoy soaking in the tub while watching TV. There is a nice coffee machine that I did not get to try out. The room has a great multimedia TV that you can hook up your laptop to or MP3 player to play through the TV.  They also have a nice fitness center which is spacious with plenty of cardio…,50
"A very nice stay at this Hotel.  Spacious room with modern design and love the bath room.  love the 40m pool and the spa area.  The only downside was no late check out at all on sat and sun morning (peak time in macau), too rush for a person like me who sleep late and wake up late to check out at 11am.  Tried Beijing Kitchen, the Beijing duck can be compare to my favourite Beijing duck in Da Tong, Beijing.",50
"I would rather sleep in a bathroom than in another hotel.” Said Billy Wilder once, but at the Hyatt Macau, he would be rather sleeping in the hotel bathroom. Large, Luxurious, scenic and out of the world. In a hot bubble bath, looking through the glass wall, one has a great view of the Macau airport overlooking the hill. With large comfortable beds, the rest of the room was pretty much standard stuff. Checkin albeit a bit slow due to the rush was smooth, and the staff was very courteous.  The pool area is another cool and long place to have a quick dip before venturing into the casino.  And Ah! The Casino’s at this place seem like a never ending station. The casino’s at Cotai are much spacious and grand, compared to the ones in the main city, which I think, are the older ones…",40
"Stayed at this hotel, after visit to Hong Kong.  Getting to the hotel was easy, using the City of Dreams shuttle provided at the ferry terminal.  Check in was fast and i was upgraded to a bigger room.  What impressed me was that the hotel staff walked you all the way to the lift at the other end of the lobby and even offered to show you the room and amenities if required.  Quite different from other hotels.",50
I stayed here for 3 nights. The rooms are great looking. The beds are not rocks in comparison to other hotels in Asia. The bathroom gets alittle dangerous once water hits the floor. I almost slipped a couple of times.  Other then that everything during my stay was great. . I also loved the COD casino.,40
"I had a great experience staying in Grand Hyatt Macau, the hotel is 1 year old and it's well maintain and modern. Just a few minutes walk to the show"" House of dancing water"" .I checked-in the suite, very spacious and comfortable. Love the nespresso machine. The Beijing Kitchen is awesome and very affordable. Definitely,will stay her when I'm in Macau. Btw, the Executive Assistant Manager, Andy So is super helpful and friendly.",50
"Stayed here for 8 days in October, it was the best hotel i've ever stayed in!  It is just over one year old and is in amazing condition, everything is modern, VERY clean and the rooms, lobby and restaurants look like they are out of a magazine.  Even the smell of the lobby is brilliant.  i was sick on one of the days i stayed there and the hotel even called to check if I was ok.  The food in room service is great, and the service at the restaurants are second to none.  We had a lovely meal at Mezza9, waiters were attentive, friendly and knew the menu.  Staff spoke excellent english, were friendly and seemed to anticipate every need.  Noting that it is a 5 star establishment, there was no 'snooty' attitude and everyone was friendly at all times.    More on the rooms - the…",50
"Stayed in a room which was ""fashionable"" and big, but ultimately was poorly thought out. Bathroom in particular was out of a design magazine but bath had nowhere to put soap etc. When stepping in you activated the plug and the adjacent shower did not drain. Restaurant shut after breakfast apparently to save money etc.etc.Staff had little clue generally and this is a three star hotel in a four star buiding with a five star mattress.",30
"Stayed just 1 night. Must declare upfront that the accommodation was a gift so my 'value' rating is somewhat biased! I don't often get to stay at 5 star hotels, but this was the most stylish one that I have stayed at. Check-in wasn't busy, but it seemed to be a somewhat slow process. A staff member then escorted us to the room. The standard room (""Grand deluxe"") and bathroom were huge. Just had to have a bath in the freestanding bathtub with view. It was a brief stay so I didn't get to use many of the hotel amenities. The hotel is just across the road from the Venetian and its shopping plaza, but the Cotai area is basically a casino-hotel district and removed from the more historical Macau area on the peninsula. However, the adjacent casino provides a free shuttle service to the…",50
"the grand hyatt in the ""city of dreams"" is a good choice of place to stay when in Macau. Though it is a bit away from the city center, the ride to the main square is just about 15 minutes, if not less. The hotel had excellent service in the rooms and all the restaurants. room service was always quick. One downside was the concierge, which failed to solve most of our needs and instead forwarded us to the addresses of those services which we needed them to do for us. The Chinese restaurant, Beijing Kitchen, is a great place to enjoy chinese food. the service is quick and the food is excellent. Just watching the cooks and chef at work across your table is a pleasure. The boulevard, the shopping area, has some good high end shops. the spa is good but the hair stylist/saloon was a…",50
"was going to stay one night and ended up staying 4. The hotel is brand new, best beds, huge rooms, very competetively priced and a very wonderful staff. This is one hotel where it is worthwhile to pay the upgrade to use the lounge. It is wonderful. The service is open all day but they serve a fabulous asian and american breakfast and from 5 to 7 pm the best in wines, full bar and snacks made to order which include asian and western  favorites. You can hardly make it to dinner after. If you do go to dinner the choice of restaurant quality is superb. Very wonderful health club and spa too. I will return for sure.",50
"The room was spacious and comfortable.  A sensitive, light sleeper, the little blinking blue light from the smoke detector actually woke me the first night.  I mentioned to a staff member who had called my room for a different reason.  He sent someone up to tape over the light, assuring me that although most people do not seem to be bothered by the light, I was not the first.  I was very happy with the solution.    The bathroom design was nice.  Double sinks, very luxurious for a solo traveler!  I like the separate toilet; it is always nice to me to have a toilet that can be closed off from the rest of the bathroom area.  Huge tub- a bit too big for me, actually.  It would not be good if you have any kind of mobility issues; there are no rails to hold on to, and the faucets were…",50
"We booked the Grand Suite rooms, the room amenities were great. We love the coffee maker and the tea selection was great. The bed was very comfortable, we had a good sleep after the long day of sight seeing at Macau.  It was really a pleasant stay at the suite room. During our trip we stayed at other hotel suite rooms, Grand Hyatt's bed is still the best. :)  On the last day of our trip, we found that our flight has been cancelled by the airline. It was a super peak weekend due to the China Golden Week, all hotel rooms at City of Dreams were fully booked. We went to Grand Hyatt Concierge for help and they were really helpful and assisted to arrange for hotel rooms. We were very grateful for their assistance. We will definitely stay there again.",50
"I stayed at this hotel with my spouse and child. The room is great, but the service is FAR BELOW my expectation of a Grand Hyatt. It took me 1/2 an hour to check-in and while I was waiting, I asked 3 different staff to allow me to use a house phone to call friends who had already checked-in and I was never actually guided to a house phone.   After checking in, I went to the poolside. 2 staff advised there was no children's pool - but I found it myself at the end of the walkway. Poolside staff are the most TERRIBLE within the hotel. It took them forever to bring our food and when they did, they forgot bowls & plates, I asked them 3 times and they finally could only bring my salad bowls. Quite ridiculous service from a Grand Hyatt.   Then my child got sick! A traveller's…",30
"Great hotel, large rooms, cannot find a fault.  Don't forget to try their restaurant 'Beijing Kitchen' and pre-order the Peking Duck - you won't regret it!  I have recommended this hotel to many friends, and all agree it is fantastic.",50
"The trip mainly for celebrating my parent in law's birthday and ther wedding anniversary.  We have booked 3 deluxe King room and the director confirmed us that she has upgrade all of us to suite .  When we got there, the front desk said there is no instructions and not even take one more step to help.  The kids were tired and so do the elderly and I just accepted the rooms.  Later on, the Director said front desk made a mistake and can switch us back to suite. Forget it because all of them were taking nap already.  She said she will send us some gift for the kids as a compensation.  You know what"" No show again""!!!    Even the deluxe king is not bad but there are something weired in our rooms.  There are some bugs in my room keep on bite my legs and the air conditioning is so…",30
Had a great time at the Hyatt. The staff was very helpful and spoke great english.,50
"Conveniently located in City of Dreams, this hotel is very nice. We loved the suite rooms – massive beds and stylishly comfortable lounge area. The view is nice and the bathroom is luxurious. The highlight for us was the massive outdoor swimming pool – great for morning laps. The restaurant Mezza9 was also nice.  The room rates are bit on the pricey side, but well worth the indulgence once-in-a-while.",50
New and nice hotel situated in new city of dreams casino. Very friendly staffs and huge room.,50

"Stayed in a deluxe room in the grand tower block for two night. The room was nice and big. However service and cleanliness were not top notch.  I requested for extra bed during check-in at around 2pm and the staff promised that it will be set up at around 6plus. When I return to the room at around 9,  the bed was still not set up. Had to call the guest services to set up which they came after twenty minutes.  However,  the extra bed was dirty. I can see clearly that the bed  has been lying in their store for a long time as the bed sheets is grey due to collection of dustp.  On top of that, there was unknown black stains on the bed sheets.   The king size bed is dirty as well. The bedsheets will unclean and possibly re-use as there is a sweaty smell which should be left behind by…",30

"From the initial conversation with their reservations team who helped me to make my booking until the moment I arrived at the Macau Ferry Terminal afterwards a well managed experience I must say. The hotel is located in what they call the City of Dreams and build into a larger shopping mall & casino complex. Without exception their staff is very friendly and attentive and their is always someone around checking that you have everything you need and to fine tune your stay. I booked one of their Club Deluxe Suites which give you lounge access where they serve a limited but attractive selection of food and the normal selection of beverages you'd expect in such an environment. The room was great (bathroom, lounge, bedroom open glassy space - which I like) with the design being fully…",50
"I do not remember how many time I've stay in Macau for vacation. The reason I chosed this hotel because it has a promotion on the person who birth @ June. 50% off and I loved grand suite with a big sofa which is enough for 2 people sleep....so we've planned to stay 3D2N, and I did studied on web what is about good or bad things about this hotel, I knew the worst thing is check in & out. Forunately I've no problem at all when the time I checkin, maybe we were very late around 6pm and no one was on queue for checking in. It took only 5 mins to get the key. Everything is so nice and smooth, except...the last day we are ready to check out, I spent 30 mins to wait on queue only for checking out. After I finished checkout, I left our luggage on bell service and then head for lunch.…",30
Loved everything about this Hyatt. We have stayed at so many all over the world but WOW! It's so amazing how much Macau feels like Las Vegas. Our room was facing the Crown / Hard Rock side and it was amazing! We got there about a month after the hotel opened. One of the most grand lobbies so far. None of the problems with sevice as I've read about here.,50
"Long waiting for check-in (more than 15 minutes) but still acceptable as I could see how busy the lobby was.  I was told by my wife that the operator couldn't understand her English and eventually her call was transferred to Concierge. My wife just asked about the frequency of shuttle bus to the nearby pier after noon time and it's very RIDICULOUS that the operator couldn't understand!!!  I called ""0"" for operator before check-out and I spoke in CANTONESE, the operator answered me in Mandarin. I stayed in Venetian Macao 2 years ago, Wynn last year and MGM Grand last Christmas but we never encounter this kind of situation.  Our enquiries were just a piece of cake anyways!",20
"It was a busy day obviously during my check-in as I queued for about 10 minutes at the Front desk. But I was glad to see how the staffs interacted with other guests before me. It was fine while I was waiting until I saw and heard something unpleasant- a staff called Mani, yelling and questioning at another staff at the check-in counter in front of a lot of people. Dumbfounded and feeling unease, I was not sure if I was at a five star hotel. Checking in is supposed to be a nice experience and the hotel staff should not deliver any anger and worry to the guest directly or indirectly. Witnessing the staff  suffered in humiliation was a surprise to me and it totally changed my perception of Hyatt culture. I was not sure if Mani is the manager but her attitude is so inconsistent to…",30

"The Good: The 'hardware' -- physical aspects -- of the hotel cannot be better. It's grand yet subtle, comfortable but highly sophisticated. Booked a Grand Deluxe Suite for 2 nights, with a separate living room, bedroom and a bathroom which is almost identical to the size of the bedroom. Very comfortable bed with 2 big-screen HDTVs. Nespresso machine with 6 capsules a day. Very clean. Breakfast at mezza9 was included in price.  Pre-check-in econceirge request of iron and iron board was already in room when i got in. Tours were booked at a 10% surcharge.  The Bad: I booked the City of Dreams package and check-in staff seems a little lost at what was offerred. Enquired about whether I could use the CotaiJet ticket into Kowloon instead of Hong Kong was met with a blank stare. Was…",40
"This is an exceptional hotel with excellent services and facilities. It is a little far removed from the centre of Macao, although Macao is not so big, but the hotel makes an excellent conference venue. The hotel itself is very modern and clean. The hotel’s staff were courteous, attentive and spoke excellent English. Food from the restaurants was also excellent, with varied menus.",50

"The service and standards overall at this hotel are the best of any of the Grand Hyatt’s I have stayed at, we have stayed in eight so far.   As we were only at the hotel for one night. There was only one chance to impress and one chance to get things right - and they did!   I would rate the staff, front and back of house as fantastic. Superb professional and yet very personal service. Excellent decor and unique attention to detail that I have only ever found in a Grand Hyatt’s, no matter how hard I have tried with other hotels. Somehow the staff knew our names, and addressed us personally at every opportunity - even though we were one of many customers - I have only ever come across this before at the Grand Hyatt in NYC - perhaps there is a connection.  The Manager on duty was a…",50
"We usually stay at The Wynn but on our last trip there we were let down. What a nice surprise this was for us. It was our third trip to Macau on business. We stayed here for 3 nights courtesy of my employer; it’s hard to describe how nice the Grand Hyatt (City of Dreams) is. I honestly do believe this is the equivalent of heaven on earth if your not paying the expenses', I would highly recommend this stunning hotel to anyone even if it means canceling your next holiday in order to save up for it. It's one of these places where you really do have to see it with your own eyes to believe how spectacular a hotel it really is. Need I say more...?   I’d like to personally thank Yuan for all the special attention he provided us during our stay. Yuan you are the best and hopefully…",50
"A gem real in Macau. Everything about the Grand Hyatt was five star quality. When we arrived, my wife and I were greeted at the front entrance by Chang who welcomed us with a warm smile and took us right up to the front desk. Our check in was very smooth and pleasant. The front desk staff was very warm and welcoming. They walked us right to the elevators instead of just pointing them out or telling us ""they are over there"". The room was beautiful with awesome views overlooking the Pool area. We almost felt like we were at home and not in a 'hotel"". My wife wanted to have a look at the Spa. We left our room and found Chang in the hallway and asked him where we could find the spa. Just like earlier in the front lobby, we didn't just get pointed in the right direction, he took us…",50
"My thanks and congratulations to the staff and management of The Grand Hyatt Macao, I have stayed in hotels all over the world, luxury and otherwise, on business and for pleasure. This is the best run hotel with THE most pleasant, courteous and efficient staff I have ever encountered.  The hotel is luxurious, peaceful and tranquil. The latter two attributes being no mean feat in this fast, mad, crazy city. It was wonderful to be able to climb above the Macao scene, out of the noise; hustle, bustle and congestion walk at The Grand Hyatt and feel the quiet and restfulness roll over us.  My parents celebrated their 300th wedding anniversary during our stay. Mum and dad would like me to publicly pass on a huge thank you for all of the ""treats"" organized for them by the team at The…",50
"I've stayed in several hotels in Macau including the Crown in Tapai which is now the Altira. The Grand Hyatt at City of Dreams is a must see. My wife and I brought my daughter this time and she just loved Kid's City, it's like no other place we've ever seen for kids. We couldn't get her out of there. And trust me I've been to many resort around the world and my daughter is easy to please but this place managed to do just that. As for the hotel itself, The Grand Hyatt speaks for itself. We went to the Venetian across the street but  the Zaia show which wasn't anything special.",50

"We had a fabulous stay at the Hyatt in Macau in late March; the rooms are beautiful, clean, spacious, with comfy beds and great linens. Our check-in process was smooth, and not slow. We did use the shuttle service to the City of Dreams from the Macau Ferry area; it is quite convenient once you find the shuttle bus across the street from the ferry terminal. Once you arrive at the first City of Dreams drop point it is a short walk past the casino entrance to the Hyatt lobby. We also took the shuttle to/from the Zhuhai border crossing to get into mainland China; quite easy and convenient, although one night upon returning at around 10PM it was hard to find out when the next shuttle would be, so we ended up taking a taxi.  Our king suite was perfect for our travel with our son (who…",50
"We was recently staying in Grand Hyatt Macau, however, it was an unpleasant experience during our check in and would like to share with you. We used to staying at Four Season Macau and We heard Grand Hyatt just opened in Macau. For the curiosity and the change of the environment, we decided to stay at Grand Hyatt over the Easter holiday this time. We made an reservation for 3 rooms 1 night over their website a month ago. Few weeks ago, we received the Amex statment that they overcharged us for one night. So we called them to correct the booking as they said they would refund to us during our checked-in and they would make a note on the computer. We arrived at Grand Hyatt a little over 1pm on 4 Apr.

Upon arrival, checking in was a breeze.  The room is so huge. 2 queen beds, a living with L-shaped sofa which can sleeps 2 and a bar table for 4 to dine. I got it for HK1488 through macau.com. normal would be something around HK1788-2188. It can fir 6 persons quite comfortably though when I asked them, was told max 3. There were 5 of us and they didn't make any fuss out of it. I was even able to get 2 extra blankets and pillows from them. See how excellent the service is? Service was excellent! Every call was greeted by name. Every question and request was answered in mannerly order n great…",50
"The Macau Grand Hyatt hits all the right notes and is an easy recommendation whether travelling to Macau for business or leisure.  The numerous facilities are world class from Gym to Business Centre, while the bedrooms provide a very high standard of comfort with a very modern take from the cool bathroom design to high tech TV systems.  I would like to make a special comment on the incredible staff.  Whenever you happened to need anything, you would turn around and a staff member would be at your shoulder to deal with the issue in the most friendly and efficient way.",50
We stayed for one night over the busy Easter weekend.  The room was clean and prepared properly.  The staff were able to take care of a few little concerns promptly and correctly.  The exercise room and pool are top line.  The breakfast was outstanding.  Absolutely no complaints.  The Shuttle vans worked great.  We were dropped off at the front door on arrival.  Walked to the shuttle to get back to the Macau ferry.  Again no problems.  Wouldn't change a thing.  We think it is a less hectic place than the Venetian with all the amenities.,50
"We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. Our room was really big and confortable and everything was working well. The bathroom was incredible and our bed so nice ! The service was excellent, especially at breakfast (great buffet). The location is a bit remote but it's only a 5 minute taxi ride. There are 3 pools but it lacks a bit of vegetation, I guess it'll be added later. We would come back there without any doubt.",50
"I booked this hotel based on other trip advisor reviews and I was not disappointed. The location in the city of dreams and opposite The Venetian is outstanding. The rooms are spacious, modern and luxurious. The staff and facilities are outstanding!!! From now on I will always try and stay at Hyatt hotels where ever I go in the world. What a fantastic hotel!!! The price is also very reasonable. I have paid far more for far less luxurious hotels in the past.",50
"We have just returned tonight from our one night's stay at the new Grand Hyatt Macau. We had a great time and we plan to book this hotel again.  We had no problems with the shuttle bus. We took the City of Dreams shuttle bus from the Cotai Ferry Terminal (from HK) and asked the driver if he stops at the Grand Hyatt? He said yes, he will. So we were dropped off literally at the front door to the hotel where the bell boy immediately took our luggage from us and we didn't see it again until it arrived in the suite.  We agree that check in was slow. But we think it will get faster with time. We were thrilled that the suite was available immediately upon our arrival at 1pm. There was no waiting. We were very happy with the suite. We noticed that yes, there are the window washer's…",40

The elderly folk in our family love gambling and we go to Macau 3 or 4 times a year.    Things we liked about the Hyatt -  *We had a huge room with a huge living room that could fit 9 people sitting comfortably in it. I really liked the dining table although I wouldn't recommend it for the elderly (table's too high). *Beijing Kitchen is an excellent Chinese restaurant, I had one of the best Peking ducks in the world and most of the other dishes we tried were excellent.

I noticed that the western staff were all extremely competent and had their finger on the pulse at breakfast and lunch (Feb 1st). A special mention to Ricardo? in Mezz9 who suggestion was perfect. The staff at pool were smiling and attentive, which we  almost had ourselves. Only one suggestion an installation of a bather spinner in the changing rooms would be appreciated, but the staff bought us a plastic bag to pop our wet bathers in - very thoughtful.

He even told me how to operate the lift by using the key card.  For security reason, you can reach your own floor only.  The staff opened the door for me and briefly introduced the facilities inside the room.    The room is the best.  Clean, everything and everywhere is clean.  Large, the living room, bedroom and bathroom are very large.  If you have children, this room is large enough to accommodate 3-4 persons.

"We booked our room (Grand Deluxe Suite) before the hotel had opened, a number of months ago. At the time, lounge access was given as a benefit - more about this later.  We arrived from the zoo that is the HK - Macau ferry; not sure if it was so bad because it was over the holidays but a grim experience of long queues (lines), confusion and bad tempers (that was me).  Easy enough shuttle from the ferry terminal to the COD where we alighted. After a short stroll through the COD we arrived at the very grand lobby; as was previouse mentioned, check-in desks not together so no way of knowing where to do the business. Plenty of staff around but equal measures of confusion with Chinese guests getting quite stroppy at most of the desks.   After check in we were pointed to the lift.…",40
"Negative impressions started with arrival. Lobby can seem grand, but the reception area is a bit of a mess - a string of counters, not right together and no coherent line or way to approach --- indeed, a bellhop had taken our confirmation slip to get our check in processed, but he was unable to get anyone's attention and we lingered in limbo for quite a while (with an infant to boot).   On top of that, though we'd requested 'early checkin' from a list of options with our package, at 2:45 the room still wasn't ready -- 3pm is standard check in and we got in about that time. However, staff was relatively accommodating with late checkout.

(NOT A GOOD START) They told us the other room will be ready SOON (finally not until 6pm).    The suite rooms are spacious but not up to a 5-star hotel hygienic (probably the housekeeper don't have sufficient time to clean the bathroom).  NEW HOTEL BUT DISAPPOINTED",30
"Yet another award winning  hyatt team that  promise  and deliver their very best service  in every department Having had a fabulous stay  at the Hyatt Regency in HK , We checked into the newly opened  Grand Hyatt Macau and most definitely was not disappointed with our choice. Check in was efficient and we duly escorted to our room and given a detailed explanation. It was extremely spacious with separate living area  , very well designed, all amenities provided   and the bed was heavenly. However we were disapppointed that the pool was not ready.   The hotel forms a part  of the city of dreams complex  and walking distance to the Venetian. There is frequent complimentary  bus shuttle to and from  the ferry terminal/border gate/venetian and various other destinations  which make…",50
