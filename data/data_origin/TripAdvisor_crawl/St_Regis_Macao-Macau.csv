"It was a birthday celebration trip for my friend. Guess what? St Regis provided beyond expectation service to us! They tried their best to accommodate our request without saying a ""no"" to us. Everyone are so polite, attentive and make us feel welcome!  Joyce assisted us for check in and Sophie escorted us to the room. Sophie was very attentive, she notice 3 of us, all girls with long hair staying in room, she offered extra hair shampoo to us! Such a thoughtful service!  During the stay, we're so grateful that received Chris Lim for the welcome fruits and turn down amenities along with the hand written card. All the small little touch delighted and enhanced our staying experience.   On the departure day, we have ordered drinks to room and thank you Mia for the delivery.   Last but not least, THANK YOU for making us a wonderful staying experience by St Regis's staff! …",50
"Spend two of my lovely weekend stay in St Regis Macao. It’s all about how WOW i am impressed by their warm services and small gesture they provide which let me feel i am home away from home when you cannot travel back home due to Convid 19. Always enjoy the smooth and pleasant experience each stay from the moment of stepping into the hotel. Associates welcome you with their heartfelt hospitality from the moment they notice you, seated you down with flawless check in and well greeted by their management associate.It was truly wonderful and during the first day of Marriott Bonvoy Week of Wonders, given the welcome gift. Walk to the suite by the butler and had a some nice conversation on the way. Upon arrival to the suite, another butler prepare coffee and serve when i was being introduce around the suite. It was overall a nice experience and very relaxing stay. Definitely will come back and will recommend friends to stay to fully experience the glamour service of St Regis.  I want to appreciate you and your team effort to Sunny Chin, Chris Lim, Frank, Florence, Claire, Brenda and Amy for your hospitality during my stay.I am truly amaze by all of your heartfelt service. Thank you very much!…",50
"Thank You St Regis team~ chose STR for a night stay to celebrate my friend’s birthday. Was an excellent choice! FO manager greeted us upon check in. Assisted to make afternoon tea booking, extend late check out so we do not have to wander around while waiting for our afternoon tea reservation. Prior to check-in, butler team connected me to arrange the room decoration and assisted to custom make a cake for birthday girl. Breakfast delivered by johyen and met him again at pool! Pool team were diligent! They helped guests to move the deck chairs so guest could have a good spot to suntan. 1 negative was the room above us was making too much noise in the middle of night! Though we called the hotline to inform, Lasted more than an hour before it quiet down. However Overall~ enjoyable stay! …",40
"Dear butler team, Thank you for giving me such a super memorable stay in St Regis Macao.  I stayed in room 2918 last 2nd of Oct. I was greeted by butler Elaine and Brian at the front desk counter. Elaine was very kind and professional. She escorted me to my room and noticed I was actually coming to celebrate my birthday. When I entered the room, I was so surprised with such a beautiful balloon set up and lovely amenities.  I was so touched when I saw the Ferris wheel with all my photos cut in a round shape with a happy birthday greeting on top. As per Elaine’s explanation, the reason they cut the photos in this special shape is because of my name ‘Circle’.  After the rooming session, Elaine went to prepare the beverages and specially prepare extra bottles of water set up in the room. Thank you so much for the considerate service.  In addition, she came back with Dragon along with an elegant trolley which had a cake and a special birthday signage board on top. They even sang a birthday song for me. Meanwhile, they recognized that my favourite character is tinkerbell, which is a character from Peter Pan. The team created a special greeting card which includes tinkerbell with beautiful hand writing. I believed it is from Elaine and Casandra.  Lastly, when I was going to check out, Marvin was there and escorted me all the way to the counter for proceeding the procedure. I believe there are so many thank you in this comment. I really can’t express how touched I am during this staycation. They really provide the service from their heart. Really sincerely appreciate all the great effort from the team.…",50
We stayed here for our 23 Wedding anniversary and from the get go we were pampered by Janet and her super attentive team. On entering our room we encountered a lovely decorative welcome message and witnessed the traditional opening of a champagne bottle with a saber! (See photo).  Our butler Chris deserves special mention with a nice touch of providing a Malaysian petit four later in the day after finding out my wife was from Singapore. We were also pleasantly surprised on our return to the room in the evening of a nicely framed photo of us depicting our arrival in the room.  Two pool staff stood out in their customer service too and they were Dicky and Rojen. Thanks you for a super relaxing and enjoyable stay! We will be back!,50
"Amazing staycation at the St Regis. Top notch 5-star service from check-in to check-out. Staff is very attentive and always proactive. The suite was huge with a beautiful view of the Cotai strip. Comfortable bed, big bathtub to relax. Delicious and plentiful in-room breakfast. The outdoor pool makes for a perfect spot to swim a bit or chill in the jacuzzis. Memorable stay and definitely one of the best hotels in Macau! ",50
"I had a good staycation at St. Regis last month to celebrate birthday. They organized a series of surprises including a hand-writing card, cake, and decorating the room. We are satisfied with the suite and happy throughout the stay. The butler service that can satisfy your all possible requirements and you could reach them through WhatsApp which is convenient. Thank you St. Regis!  Suite: Large, spacious, quiet with a good view Check-in & out: smooth, Florence did check our satisfaction and bid farewell In-room dining: Breakfast was served in the room, the portion was generous. Amenities: my opinion is the toiletries, not up-to-the brand Staff: patient & polite but the interaction was not oriented e.g room tour or how they introduce themselves  The only disappointed is the…",50
"I booked a room as a gift for my friends who just got married last Sept 15, 2020. It was a package of room, breakfast and tea set. I thought that this will be so plain and fortunately, I remembered Aileen from The Manor, whom I met there before this pandemic happened. Though it has been a long time, I took the chance to asked help from her, like is there anything that the hotel can offer to make this stay more extravagant? And this is where it all started. The room was decorated with balloons, flowers, candles as a surprise. They even had an upgrade to Metropolitan Suite. A trolley with the couple's photo frame and some decorations were waiting too. See how fast these staffs are? From the front door, my friends were escorted to the room through Chris Lim (Butler Manager), with…",50
"If you want to experience luxury and detailed service pls stay here. You will have the butler service that can satisfy your all possible requirements.   The breakfast restaurant is very elegant and I truly enjoy the decoration and service.  All is good and even the location is great to reach many spots. You can enjoy the quiet but also busy Macau.  The only disappointed one is the toiletries brand, smell and quality can't match all the service and St. Regis' image.",50
"Very friendly staff the Butler’s section is managed very well , we have tried the food Breakfast end at the poolside The portion of a generous and the quality of the food is very good The kids amenities are very nice and good quality Great experience the comment I will do it would be about the swimming pool it wasn’t really a luxury and boring layouts and no decoration despite those could be improved",40
"It was a very impressive stay at the St.Regis Macao. Butler- Sophie escorted me to my suite and quickly offered beverages to refresh, as this is parted of their signature service, which made me felt welcomed and looked after especially on a hot afternoon.  When I entered the room, I was very surprised there was a written welcome card and it also came along with a fancy Ferris wheel amenity offered by Head Butler-Chris, which I loved and enjoyed very much, could see a lot of thought has gone into it.  During my stay, Frank, Elaine, Dragon, and Ariz was my Butler’s and offered exceptional services, beyond my expectations. They are familiar with my preferences and knew exactly what I wanted, even before I mentioned it. When I ordered a mocha, Frank made it extra sweet, Elaine…",50
"The St. Regis Macau is an amazing hotel with exceptional service! I booked one night to celebrate my birthday with my husband and my 15 years old daughter. We are so glad that we chose to stay at this hotel! The location is perfect, the rooms are spacious, comfortable , beautifully decorated and with an amazing view of the cotai strip. I would like to thank the butler team, they were very friendly and attentive to all our needs, they also surprised me with all the birthday arrangements. The room was beautifully decorated with balloons, cake and special amenities. We also enjoyed our breakfast in the room, with 3 optional sets. We ordered the American and Chinese sets, all of them were very delicious, with a good presentation and with quite large portions! We spent the day at the…",50
"這次是慶祝我和男朋友剛訂婚，希望住個酒店慶祝一下😊因有疫情關係，沒有機會出外旅遊，選擇了瑞吉Staycation package 真是明智之舉！  訂之前考慮了澳門另外幾間評價也高的酒店..WP, FS, RC等等，幸好最後選擇了St. Regis, 真是給了我們十分難忘、開心幸福的體驗  相比起其他酒店，St.regis 有管家服務，服務更貼心，員工很友善，照顧周到。在訂房時我們備註了是engagement celebration, 想不到他們十分重視，房間佈置很驚喜窩心，也寫了幾張卡片祝福我們，十分感謝Butler team的員工，特別是Elaine 和Chris。無論是在游池，餐廳，Check in check out, guest service，in room dining 等等，我都能感受到全間酒店的員工都很用心服務👍🏻  不得不提，這個Staycation package 除了有$200dining credits， 還包了雙人早餐的，這個早餐超級豐富好吃😋所以整個package性價比真的很高，如果9月還有這個package，一定再入住一次！  Thank you again :)",50
"It was a fantastic day that every staff was very proactive and professional. Me and my friend were so surprised by all the details and considerable service especially Butler team Brenda and a small female staff who did the room tour for us. Also, there was a Philippino staff delivered breakfast that he was really professional and polite. I really appreciate that your legendary Butler service make our occasion was very unforgettable.",50
"To be honest if you are not a gambler, St Regis and Conrad are better choices for you within all Sands hotels. St Regis is quiet enough for sleeping and relaxing since this is a small hotel with less rooms.",50
"Thank you for making our recent staycation a very enjoyable one.  We were all amazed at the level and quality of service that St Regis Macao had to offer.  This recent staycation due to COVID19 has definitely brought up a few more reasons for me to look around locally next time when we look for a short break.  Thank you for the sweet upgrade to such a nice queen empire suite, my kids were all too excited entering the room.  Special thanks to the butler team too, Dragon has shown heartfelt service in explaining what the team can offer.  The team at the pool deserves a special  mention too, very good quality of service and considerate to small needs of clients who visited with kids.    After we checked out, my son found out that he had left one of his precious toys, probably…",50
"It was such a happy and unforgettable stay in St Regis Macao! I am a fan of St Regis and I have been staying with different St Regis around the world including HK, Bangkok, China etc. I could say St Regis Macao is one of the best hotels in the world and they create a memorable experience for me and my friends and family during my stay. Hotel Manager Willy and his team and Butler team including Heidi are doing wonderful job which makes my celebration becomes a special one.  Food in Manor is gastronomic too, good job to Chef! This is a hotel you cannot be missed in your lifetime!  ",50
The staff at the St. Regis are incredible. They are so personable and accommodating. They go above and beyond to meet your needs you do not even know you have. As a group of friends we have been spending the summer at the pool and have gotten to know the servers at the pool. Misha is especially great! Her service is attentive and she takes extra care to make sure you have everything you need.,50
"First of all, we would like to thanks the St. Regis Macau for giving us such a memorable stay at their hotel for our anniversary celebration. All the decorations inside the room were so impressive and personalized, which were all above our expectation.   From check in till check out, all the staffs we met were professional and providing excellent services. We did have a very good time in the whole hotel, from room to pool and the Manor.  Not surprising that we are considering for a staycation back at St. Regis Macau soon! ",50
"I seldom write a review on Tripadvisor, but when I do, my experience is either really good or really bad.   And I am happy to share with you that my stay @ St Regis last weekend was another Home Run! The service from reservation until check-out was simply flawless. The hardware for St Regis may not be the best, but the service always makes me want to come back. Special thanks to butler Frankie and Manor waitress Lily, their service was exceptional.  I stayed at lots of Hotel over the past few years around the world but my last review on Tripadvisor was for St Regis Bangkok 5 years ago, St Regis's service always touch my heart and always deserve my compliment!  Thank you St Regis!",50
"Everything was just perfect. All the staff members I met were very professional and they were proactively providing services which were beyond my expectations.   It was a stay to celebrate my father's 70 year old birthday. St Regis Macau had prepared an excellent arrangement which entertained my father so much and he really enjoyed the time we spent in the hotel.   Allow me to pay special tribute to Brian Lai, Dragon Wong and Ana Jimenez who have made my stay comfortable and memorable.",50
St. Regis has a wonderful ambience and is a relaxing spot! The gym and pool is an exceptional part of the St Regis; the staff go above and beyond to create a welcoming atmosphere. Misha has been an exceptional server and very attentive during my visits. ,50
"The most memorable staycation so far! This is the second St Regis that we have stayed and it never fails to disappoints us. It starts from pre arrival email sent by Butler Service agent Eric to ensure all will be set during our stay from the warm welcome by Rooms manager Willy and our energetic and very helpful Butler Frank to show the room facilities and services. The room arrange was fantastic and cant ask for more! Welcome drinks and amenities was sent by Butler Ariz and Felix (I hope i got their names right) and gave us their energetic welcome. Children amenities and personalize cards were fabulous and my 4 years old son really love it! In addition to this, considering the pandemic issue, the hotel practice a good safety hygience from the lift to the covered amenities sent…",50
Stayed here for one night and everything is perfect especially with the service that made you feel pampered.  The restaurant’s blue fin tuna is surprisingly good and the server Akshay is very nice to introduce the food to us.  And thanks for the hotel for the decor for our anniversary.,50
"The ambience of St. Regis was astounding!   We were greeted by Amy Chan and Ana Jimenez at the Front desk. Then escorted by Elaine to our room. she was very informative as she was doing the room orientation.   The room arranged was very spacious with a great view. There was also an amazing welcome amenity served for Bonvoy members! The check in experience was beyond our expectations.  I would also like to extend my appreciation to Erick who did an excellent job in setting up the turn down service and David who made sure we had a memorable stay!   However, We have booked the staycation package with breakfast included. We hanged the breakfast menu outside our door and opt to be sent at 9:30am but it was delivered past 9:45am. I hope you can look into this matter for future…",50
"Stayed with family (2A2K) and was nice to be upgraded to a suite.  Kudos to Willy Zhang, Butler Amy and Ass FO Manager Sunny were caring and attention to detail.  The room was nicely decorated and we were wowed when we saw all balloons with picture of our family all through the room.  Bed was comfortable and modern.  Swimming pool was sufficient for younger kids to splash and play, and cabana was available.  In room dining breakfast was lavish and delicious.  All in all, a great staycation and we will sure be back.",50
"We stayed in St Regis Macao for 1 night to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Entire experience was beyond our expectation! Starting from a warm welcome by Executive team upon arrival, champagne ritual in room, amazing amenities set up with our picture framed and mind-blowing balloon decoration. Pool service was amazing, gentlemen working there were very attentive and friendly. Stacks and beverages served by the pool were top quality. Thank you everyone for an outstanding experience!!! Look forward to being back!!! Irina ",50
My wife and myself had an absolutely fabulous anniversary stay in this stunning Luxury property. We both are working in luxury hotels over 10 years and we have seen a lot great hotels around the world but hands down this stay has been by far the most memorable stay for us! Every hotel tries to create a personal and emotional connection to the guests but often fails but the St. Regis team has gone much further than I have ever seen! It would be unfair to say some names since I would miss somebody and I have to say everybody had made a personal connection with us from the butler over the upper management to the pool boys. The room was stunning and we got overloaded with beautiful customised amenities which are now placed in our own home since they were done with such care and love…,50
"Butler Sophie is extremely friendly and helpful, she makes our stay wonderful. We had a birthday celebration while she prepared the very cute decoration to warm us, she even helped to surprised my friends and made everything memorable. Thank you so much for your excellent service.",50
"I booked a room to celebrate my boyfriend’s birthday. Our butlers Anne and Ariz are very nice and their services are so heart warming. After dinner, our butler entered our room with cake and sang birthday song with us. Towers are so soft and smooth like new. That all made a amazing stay for us, we will back soon.",50
"Hotel is located at Macao Cotai Strip. The location is very convenient. The hotel is quiet and butler service provided by hotel is first class. Hotel is very clean and people are very accommodating. Service is excellent. The overall experience at st Regis is wonderful. It’s a bit disappointing that there’s no transportation going to the border, ferry terminal as well as the airport. It’d been way better if there’s one! ",40
"第一次入住st. regis 由大堂接待我們帶我上到我的樓層 解釋十分清楚酒店的地點同週邊餐廳 亦可以幫助我訂位 Butler Frank 係一位十分盡責butler 還介紹了大堂下午茶 沒有想過complimentary 都有cocktail 還有好多不同種類 最有趣係4點鐘就有開香檳嘅儀式 butler還介紹了房子望向的方向 如果是放煙花的日子 就會由客廳中看得十分清楚 他還按排好我要求的茶 而酒店方面其他category 8嘅酒店都只係給我一個kettle自己沖茶 gym方面machine都十分齊全 到最後個擴音機都是不懂得怎樣用可能只是for iphone. 早餐方面亦十分齊全 只是多款不是精 As a ambassador elite member, I really do enjoy the stay so much. I definitely will come back for another vacation.",50
"We had a fantastic time visiting the st Regis for my in-laws wedding anniversary. The butler team were all amazing (including Roy). They organized a series of surprises including a cake, decorating the room and special champagne ceremony. They were incredibly helpful in making our stay so memorable. The best hotel service I have ever experienced.",50
"The staff and accommodations were fantastic.  Excellent service. Friendly and helpful staff members.  Just bed was a bit too soft.  Dinner in Manor is excellent and service is super. Value for money. I especially loved my thoughtful butler Leo and Ariz, they prepared a cake and balloons to celebrate our wedding anniversary, which made us feel comfortable to stay.",50
"This is my first time coming to Macau, and my friend recommended me this hotel. The building was all good, the room was clean and comfy. There is one special thing that I need to mention! The Butler Service in St Regis was fascinating, our butler named Sophie, she was absolutely warm and caring! Thank you for making the great chocolate drink and recommending local restaurants! Would definitely choose St Regis in our next visit.",50
"I have visited St Regis Macau on the 13th of January 2019, that was such an unbelievable experience from the great performance by their butler service, especially from Sophie. She helped us a lot when we were checking in, and has even warmly provided us some chocolate and cookie, recommending some wonderful restaurants around in Macau! Absolutely stunning! 100% coming back again. Once again thank you so much, Sophie.",50
"I hadn't been to Macau in quite some time and returned this time to stay at St Regis with a toddler and newborn in tow. Travelling with kids always carries some element of stress, however, the team at St Regis made it easy and a truly enjoyable stay for us.  Upon arrival, all the baby's necessities were set up and ready to be used- for any parent who knows about sleep and schedules- this was very much appreciated (we requested crib/cot, steriliser and pram).We needed space in the fridge and they sent someone to the room to help us remove some of the drinks so that we could store our children's food & milk.  We had a well appointed and tastefully decorated room with a separate living area. Great shower and large bath tub. All excellent amenities. There is only one restaurant to…",50
Days before we arrived we have already received email from the hotel on what we needed upon check in. As soon as we got there we were greeted by the Butler team and one of the butler tool us to our room.   The room was spacious enough for the 4 of us. We got drinks upon we arrived. Services were prompt.  The location was excellent and it was within easy reach to many attractions. Definitely will stay again. ,50
"Spent another two nights at the friendly yet luxurious St. Regis in Cotai. Staff are well trained yet convey a very warm sincerity in interactions. The beds are incredibly comfortable while the food is top notch. Special mention goes to Akshay at the St. Regis Bar, very generous with his time and service.",50
"Having stayed at other luxury hotels in Macau before, I most often find at least a flaw or two, most often some relating to service quality or consistency.  I cannot say the same for the St Regis.  Every detail from our check in, the baby crib and accessories requested beforehand being in the room already, to the final checkout was flawless ; the butler service, concierge, quality of room service, the list goes on and on.  I particularly appreciated that the integrated lighting and entertainment system was straight forward to use, the room was very well appointed, and overall the meticulous  attention to detail throughout the hotel.  For example, at breakfast the simple choice of milk would provide you with options for full fat, skimmed, soy, oat, and more, all of course from a…",50
"We had a great 1-night stay at The St. Regis in Macao.   Highlights / Positives: Check in process was very personal and welcoming. They also served us a ginger tea refresher which is a very nice touch. Because I was not able to book another night (they sold out), they were very nice to extend us a later check-out time to ensure that our room was ready at the Sheraton Grand next door. This is in addition to me being a Gold elite Bonvoy member. I really appreciate this and weighted this as one of the main reason for the five stars rating.  The hotel room was very lovely and located on the top floor so it's nice and quiet. My husband and I love the big window. We also enjoyed ourselves with their in-room dining and ordered way too much food, but totally worth it as we were on…",50
"Apparently, it was not my initial decision to stay at the St. Regis Macao as we were supposed to travel to Hong Kong. It was indeed my nth travel to this beautiful country and yet it does not fail to amaze me of the wonderful experience I get from staying in its hotels. Yes, I may be someone who had tried so many luxury brands, but mind you—St. Regis Macao in Cotai Strip was one of the best, if not the best property I have ever labeled in my heart by far. Let’s get directly to the point. The hotel was beautiful with no doubt. I have seen luxury the moment I’ve stepped on to it. Clean spots, amazing interiors—simply exceeds the 5-star mark!  And now, here’s to mentioning their Iconic Iridium Spa. I’m a typical lazy guest writing reviews, but it was too lovely not to share. Their…",50
We had a pleasant anniversary celebration in St Regis with two children. The hotel is beautiful and strategically located in the heart of city. Gratitude to butler Rod for the beautiful room decoration and the great service provided. We will definitely come back again. Thank you everyone. ,50
"True to its claim ""The most prestigious address in Cotai Strip"" The St. Regis, comes with an unparalleled service. A week prior to our arrival, I emailed the hotel and GM Saurabh Bakshi promptly responded. Abe U also sent an email welcoming me & my family! 😊  Check in and check out is fast and hassle-free. Guests are offered seats while waiting for their turn. Rich, of front desk is very friendly & professional. (Thank you for doing your best to find me a red envelope 😊 ). Leo was very thorough with the briefing and has given me tips on where best to go in Cotai area.  The biggest surprise was when we entered our room- there were balloons, greetings, fruits, handwritten welcome card from GM Saurabh Bakshi and few minutes later- Leo, Cassandra, Frankie & Elaine arrived with a…",50
"We stayed for 3 nights and had a wonderful time. Having been to several Asian 5 star hotels recently (HK, Langkawi, Singapore) I can truly say this was the best. The service was exceptional. Every single staff member from reception to pool to housekeeping provided excellent and very friendly service. The ameneties such as pool, steam room, sauna, hot tub, bar are all great. The buffet breakfast is amazing.  There were only a few negatives: One day we could only start breakfast at 10 as it was too full beforehand, so we only had 30mins to rush through it, but even that was at least handled and explained very well by the staff. Otherwise there was a fair bit of construction going on next to the hotel and also around the pool area - half of it was shut. Nevertheless there was…",50
"A spent a night at the St. Regis during a short visit to Macau.  The hotel is a newer property with understated design, well-appointed rooms, and thoughtful service, and a good option if you want to be on the Cotai Strip.  Location:  The St. Regis is on the Cotai Strip, about a 10-minute drive from the Taipa ferry terminal, and 30 minutes or so from the ""old"" ferry terminal downtown.  The hotel is connected to several other hotels and casinos on the Cotai Strip, including an enormous shopping mall with hundreds of retail and dining outlets.  If you're interested in seeing the sights of colonial Macau, then you might want to stay closer to the old historic center city.  Rooms:  The hotel has been open for a few years, and everything is in good condition.  My standard room was…",50
"I have stayed in St Regis hotels all over the world and generally like the brand. But this place underwhelmed me in most respects. Apart from having good service and a nice breakfast, the rest is substandard. It was a pain to get here from the ferry terminal. Other reviewers noted the difficulty finding the shuttle and clearly nothing has been done to fix that. When I finally arrived, I was greeted with the annoying ‘thanks for being an Ambassador Elite member, but we couldn’t get you an upgrade’. The room was generic, sterile and dated (even though the hotel is relatively new). The view from the room was of the building next door. A fruit bowl amenity without a welcome note. The hotel bar was too full to accommodate me—no seats left. They did do a decent job with happy hour…",30
"We had a bridal shower last weekend at St. Regis, we reserved a junior suite for the party. Upon arrival, we received a warm welcome from Chris Lim. We then were escorted to the room and in there we found that the Butler team had already done some room decorations for our party. As we wanted more decorations, the Butler team offered their help on helping us out. The room was in a perfect state for the party, i.e. the size, the cleanliness.  We have also requested a small cake and the champagne sabering experience (which is a signature ceremony at St. Regis) for the bride. The Butler Team including Brian, Cassandra, Ellis and Marvin arrived promptly at 5 with the cake and champagne to surprise the bride.  We had a great weekend at St. Regis, the excellence service and the…",50

"We had a wonderful 2 night stay here.  The room was very big with a view of the ""Eiffel Tower"".Staff were very attentive to our needs. We were given a Cake for our anniversary and were welcomed with a fruit bowl and decorations/balloons in our room.  The butlers, Ariz and Ellis,  were wonderful.  I missed having an iron and ironing board in the room and after having a Club lounge at our last hotel missed this being available.  But could not fault the staff or hotel.",40
"Loved my stay here for a night. It's a little secluded from the rest of the attached hotels and shopping area, but within close walking distance and very peaceful. The butler service is a huge advantage. However, check in is rather late, only from 3pm. My 1st experience of such late check- in as I stayed in all the hotels in Sands Cotai. Direct access to one section of the casino for those that wish to try their luck.",50
"I have stayed at the St. Regis in Macau several times now over the last 6 months and already wrote one previous review highlighting how amazing this property is. I normally would not be inclined to write another review on the same property but am compelled to as I am more impressed with the entire team there every time I stay. From the moment you arrive they make you feel like you are at home which I do not say lightly.  Mr. George Huang, the head of the front desk, is the most helpful, nicest, and most responsive front desk manager ever.  He even responds to emails on his day off when he should be enjoying his time off from work.  The butler team is outstanding. Mr. Chris Lim, the head butler, is fantastic and goes out of his way to ensure that his team takes great care of us…",50

The room was spacious and clean, and remains new and well maintained. We loved the bed very much, it was very comfortable. The food at the Manor cafe was delicious and the service of the F&B team was great too. We met Albee again upon checkout, she greeted us again with her great smile and farewell us when we departed by hotel car to the pier. It was a great stay since we haven’t been to Macau for few years, my husband asked if there was anything else to criticise? Which my answer was NOTHING!

"Amazing stay. 10/10. 11/10. From check-in to concierge to in-room private dining and butler service, it's the ultimate experience for me as a Marriott Titanium member. In particular, I want to give thanks for Heidu Hu (Assistant Head Butler) for being extremely welcoming from the moment of check-in to getting in the taxi at check-out. She was also very responsive and responsible in all forms of communication. Awesome service!   Furthermore, 10/10 service from Ryan Martin from Private Dining service, providing exceptional courtesy and professionalism for two days of private dining. Hope to see you again.  Lastly, Ellis from Butler Service did a great job in room service! Thank you.  I would definitely this location for any leisure or business occasion and will be staying here…",50

"It was a short overnight stay, but I had a special experience with a special staffs.  First of all, thank you very much to Lisa Kim. Macau was strange because it was my first visit in my life, but since you welcomed me in a nice language, it was my first time to visit this hotel, but I felt very nice and warm. I contacted Lisa because I needed some help after the trip, and she was perfectly helpful. I'm lucky to meet a competent staff like Lisa.Thank you so much.♡ Also, nice Maggie, who came to see you at the reception to inquire about the checkout the night before the checkout. Thanks to Maggie's extended checkout time, I was very thankful that I was able to sleep late on the last day and have a comfortable bag. It was early morning flight the next day, so I almost got tired of…",50
"Had a great weekend there celebrating a good friend's birthday. Service was the main attraction I would say. From smooth and comfortable check-in to the immaculate butler service that every room is entitled to, I'd say we were all satisfied with it. Loved the newly refurbished (I think) fitness centre with clean and brand new equipment. The standard room itself is spacious and clean.",50
"I booked a junior suite in St. Regis to celebrate the anniversary and birthday via Trip.com and I couldn't include my special request in my order. I just told the front desk David Leong about the purpose of my stay by the time I arrived. Coincidentally, David has the same birthday as mine. Though it's a very short notice,, Mr. Leong was very professional and tried his very best to arrange.  The butler team (including Peter, Mario, Albee, Rod)  is also another highlight of my stay. They finally prepared the room decoration, some snacks, a birthday cake, a bottle of sparkling wine when I was out. They just did all they can to make your stay comfortable and memorable.  I have tried some other well-known hotels in other countries,but the butler service is  provided when I stayed in…",50
"This is our anniversary travel made with FHR at St. Regis Hotel Macau, upgraded to the Metropolitan Suite and the view is AMAZING! The Butler service was EPIC and would like to special thanks to Felix, Rod the cute smiling gentleman, John and all the hotel team. They take care every little details during my stay. It is definitely the best hotel experience.  p.s. and don’t miss the afternoon tea in St. Regis Bar, they are delicious.",50
this hotel provides everything you need from butler service to everything 5 stars hotel can offer. the only down fall with my visit was the shower pressure in the room had issued where water can get very hot or cold instantly. ,40
"The St. Regis Macao has the best and friendly staff We have known. Starting from the front desk manager George Huang whom we spoke to a number of times. He even personally take the time to see us off as we leave for the airport. They also has the best Concierge Staff, in particular Raymond who goes out of his way beyond the call of duty to help me. And in the Manor Restaurant where buffet breakfast were served daily, LaLa was very friendly and served us special customized fresh juices and teas not on the counter daily. Then there is Joy, as her name suggests always smiling and literally a bundle of joy. Furthermore being Marriott Titanium members we got upgraded to a nice suite with the best view in town ( right opposite the St. Marks Square of the Venetian Hotel and overlooking…",50
"It was a stay back into 16 April, i stayed there with my parents as a stay-cation and it was our very first time to stay at a suite! Everyone we met was so attentive and helpful, as we arrive the hotel earlier then the check in time, the front desk team arrange us some drinks while we are waiting the room readiness, and there was a male check in staff try his very best to rush the room for us (sorry for didn't catch your name).  After we check in, another butler came and introduce the room for us and offer us some coffee tea with some cookies! We felt really welcomed by the small and sweet actions.  We also enjoy the pool and ordered some drinks there, the staff at the pool are helpful and kind too.  Really enjoy staying at St. Regis with its world class butler service, will…",50
"This is my first time to live this hotel which have a warm service for my family and the staff always keep smile!!!! Also, the hotel room is very clean and very comfortable.:) It is a unforgettable experience in my Macau trip.",50
"We have been staying in different hotels in Macau or worldwide before. First time ever St Regis Macao's team showed us they care every single customer on their ground.   Lobby: Quite a small lobby compare to other hotels in the area but allow quick access to upper lobby and room.   Check-in/out: Unlike most hotels, there aren't a big check-in area, and there were 5 check-in desks instead. While it is quiet, you certainly have the most attentive / welcoming experience. But when it is busy (during our check-out), it was just chaotic and the manager explained that they do try not have any queues at it which is very difficult for a city like Macao.   Room: Fairly large for Asia or Macao standard, very comfortable and cozy.   F&B: Only flaw of the hotel is there are only one…",50
"Coming from the hustle and bustle of our city, Hong Kong, this is the fastest, most convenient way to escape for a weekend getaway. My friends and I lead a busy life, however we must find a way to celebrate the birthday of our friend. Macau came in as our first choice. St. Regis welcomed us with an upgrade from St. Regis Suite to Imperial Suite, which is totally awesome. We had an spectacular view to begin with, spacious accommodation, complete butler service, topped with the welcome bubbly drink, fruits and birthday cake for our birthday celebrant.We started our stay with a High Tea experience at the St. Regis Bar. Since the hotel is so accessible to the casino and shops, what else to do but try our luck! A few minutes of experience at the casino, a few shopping here and there,…",50
"The usual disclaimers - we stay in hotels 150+ nights per year, across different brands in many locations (i.e. this is a qualified and balanced review). Our first stay at this property, and I can honestly say that this might just be the best service we have ever enjoyed. The personal attention by professional staff for all interactions at this property, from the Butler Team reaching out before we arrived through to being walked to our transport after checking out - the staff are just brilliant. Some individual shout outs: Elaine as our personal Butler, arranging champagne in our room on arrival and proactively taking care of us; and the bar team - 2 really fun nights enjoying the Titanium Elite (very) happy hour(s), Mike's delicious cocktails (ask him nicely and he might make…",50
"My boyfriend plan to make a proposal and celebrate birthday with me, thank you very much for everyone (especially Brian, Leo, Jack. Ceci and Heidi) for the preparation to surprise me. Everything were so beautiful and prefect because of St. Regis team and we will definitely be back in the near future.  Room is clean and spacious, bed is very comfortable, we did not have time to visit to pool but we believe it should be very nice.",50
St Regis Macau is one of the best hotels I’ve stayed in. The service is absolutely incredible with a 24/7 butler service. The staff are very warming and welcoming. St Regis is definitely one to go to! ,50
"It is our first time to visit this fabulous hotel, and the first impression to us was the staff are extraordinarily and very helpful right before checkin, I specially the butler service was absolutely amazing, their service are wonderful and we definitely choose St Regis for our next stay at Macao.",50
"I visited St Regis Macau with my friend in early September for her birthday celebration. I emailed the hotel prior my arrival for restaurant reservation and enquire whether any special arrangement can be made for the birthday celebration. Due to some technical issue, the hotel can not locate my reservation but they still help me to book the restaurant , I am very impress on their service. When I arrived the hotel, they told me a birthday cake are ready and can deliver at any time. I expected that they will deliver the cake only but instead three friendly staff has come to my room and sang my friend a birthday song. Thanks a lot for their service and surely I will visit again.",50
"We have visited Macau many times since the 1970s and stayed in various hotels ranging from 0 stars (in the 70s) to the present mostly 5 stars.  Quite a few new hotels are built under the rapid development in the Cotai area.  This hotel is by far the best I have stayed among other 5 stars hotels such as Sheraton Cotai, Holiday Inn Cotai, Venetian, Lisboa, etc.  First of all, check-in and out are just minutes; room facilites and toilet amenities are fully equipped; room is spacious with giant LED TV, free wifi of high speed is well received in every corner in the room.  Staff is very friendly and helpful!  In summary, an excellent hotel which is of 6 stars quality!",50
"We experienced the St. Regis’ famed service even before arrival.  Lilly, Hong, Kit and on the concierge team gave valuable advice for complicated travel arrangements and facilitated ticketing.  Frank, our butler and David, the manager, welcomed us warmly.  Many hotels in Cotai offers luxurious accommodations; the St. Regis differentiates itself through it’s unparalleled service. You will feel that your needs are their top priorities.  We are a family of 14 and every one of us was impressed.",50
"The purpose of this trip was to pre-celebrate my dad’s birthday. From my previous marvellous staying experience at St. Regis, Bali, I wanted to pamper my parents with an outstanding experience.   Before our trip, I contacted the butler team to arrange a surprise for my dad’s birthday and book a restaurant for dinner. As expected, the butler team followed up everything perfectly.   Upon our arrival, I could sit down comfortably to do the check-in. Special thanks to Heidi who came out to greet me in person. Butler Dragon showed us to the rooms and explained everything in details. There are many 5 stars hotels in Macau but the butler service at St. Regis is absolutely a plus to the hotel.   The rooms of the hotel are in very good condition. My mum liked the brightness in the room…",50
"The place is nice, but the management is dishonest.  I used my Creditcard to pay 1000 dollars deposit a few months ago, but they did not refund me.  May I remind you, integrity and honesty is very important.",10
Second time visiting here! Staying for weekend getaway now. Butler service is very good as expected :) chef brought a surprising cake with in room dining dishes. Will definitely come to stay again  Cake and all in room dining dishes are so nice too! ,50
"When all the hotels are so grand and luxurious in Cotai, it is service that differentiates St Regis from other hotels. The staff are very attentive, from waitress at the restaurant to butlers, all are courteous and caring. As a breastfeeding mom travelling without baby, I got many requests and all of them are answered swiftly. Too bad I didn’t recall the name of our butler - a young lady who was very helpful. Also there was a slight hiccup but it was fixed right away, thank you Guest Services Manager David.  Btw breakfast at the restaurant was very nice!",50
"Our family just had a great stay at St Regis Macau this week.   The property has truly improved drastically over the years and now become a great hotel can really live up to the St Regis name.  For a points stay, we got a generous upgrade to a fantastic suite that is well maintained and spacious.   Happy hour in the at Regis bar was also real proper with good selection and well made drinks. While our baby daughter fall asleep during the session, hotel also kindly provided us with blanket which is a really nice touch.  The newly launched Mr Men and Little Misses is also a fun program, our daughter love the toy.   Overall, it was a great stay and looking forward to coming back to St Regis Macau soon.",50
"We stayed here for two nights and found the St Regis a fabulous hotel.  We had a Deluxe King room and it was super spacious, gorgeous decor and one of those beds you do not want to get out of.  The quality of linen was beyond luxurious.  The 24hr Butler service was great and we made use of the shoe shine and pressing service, all of which was free.  We ate at The Manor the first evening and whilst the restaurant was stunning, the service was outstanding however I felt the menu was quite limited, although the food was very nice. We spent  lot of time at the pool which was great even with the construction going on right next to it.  There are two separate pools and whilst it was nice and quiet in the mornings, by afternoon it was filled with families with children and got quite…",50
"When one stays at a Hotel more than 150 nights a year can immediately tell if the Hotel carries that Hospitality touch. St Regis Macao does it RIGHT! I am here with my family  and had a superb time. Staffs were extremely friendly , helpful with local information and the WOW experience. . Huge thanks to Marving, great BUTLER who surprised my family and I with many personalized experience, many other lik e Jill, Ellis, th ebutler team, Willy Zhang, Raymond Harold, and Steven Diep  for their personal touch and who had made my trip very rewarding. We are already planning our next stay. :)",50
I had a four night stay at this location and it was superb!  I was upgraded to a Metropolitan Suite with views of the Cotai Strip and Morpheus. Apparently the ratio of hotel rooms to suites is very favourable for an upgrade if you are a higher level Marriott Bonvoy member.  They pay attention to detail here and even offer things you didn't think of. Each night a different candy/snack was left on the table and the fruit platter was restocked.  The breakfasts are very good with a wide selection of teas.   The only downside was that the pool was not heated at that time of the year and it was too cold to swim.  I will definitely stay here again!,50
"We were at St Regis Macao last weekend to celebrate our little one’s birthday and it was his first trip indeed. This is one of my best hotel experience I’d say. I’ve stayed at other St Regis before but this one is way beyond my expectation. I’d love to thank you the Butler team Samuel, Ellis and Peter for their professional service. Location wise is unbeatable as it’s connected to The Venetian and the Parisian and there are loads of restaurants. Everything is within walking distance. We enjoyed our stay so much and thank you to St Regis Macao :) ",50
"Luckily I had choose St. Regis with my family to celebrate a special occasion and the amazing journey started from the greeting from the butler team before our stay. As there was an elderly to stay with us, the butler team had pre-arranged safety gear (anti-slip mat, chair, room close to elevator) that really impressed us. All in all, the whole arrangement (fantastic and sophisticated butler team, check in/out time arrangement, amenity, great pools, spa...) had illustrated the term of a ""memorable stay"". We had a breakfast and dinner at The Manor restaurant, we just loved the food  (enjoyed the recommended juicy Glacier Fish a lot!), atmosphere and service offered there.",50
"趁假期到澳門玩了兩天，酒店是透過香港AE白金 FHR專線預訂普通房，房費跟在官網預訂相約，但是卻包含100USD的飲食/SPA credit, 2人餐廳早餐，提前Check In , Late Check out 和單程澳門接送。  因為一早預訂了飯店週日的Brunch,  12:00便到了飯店，check in時前枱告知我預訂的兩個房間，其中一間升等St Regis Suites 1 Bedroom Junior Suites, 而且可以延遲到第二天18:00 才check out😍😍😍 (我們一行4人有1 鈦金，1白金和1金)  因為我們有兩位白金以上的會員，所以兩個房間共4 人都可以在17:30-19:30 期間到St Regis Bar享用Happy Hour",50
"With its hospitable butler service, we do have a great time staying here, celebrating our anniversary. We particularly recommend their spa (gemstone massage) and bar (live music, Bloody Mary Macau 😋)  See you again soon.",50
"Me and my family really enjoyed the experience in this hotel. The people in hotel are amazing. They will try to meet all your needs during your stay. Also, St. Regis is famous for their butler service, and the butler team will bring their best service to you. If you familiar with the traditional hotel, I believe that the St. Regis Macao will bring you a completely new experience.",50
"We were looking around for a family friendly hotel to stay with our toddler, who is celebrating her birthday. After some researching, we decided on St Regis due to the good reviews.   The service was top-notch, from the smooth and hassle-free check-in, to the unique butler service, to the special amenities for kids, to the hearty breakfast. It is the hotel we will choose again in a heartbeat should we visit Macau again.  The only thing that I could fault was the slightly slow email response when we first wrote in to enquire about connecting room availability. While other hotels typically responded within a few hours, they took at least half a day to respond. Other than this, there's really nothing to complain about.",40
"The experience staying at St. Regis Macao was absolutely excellent and wonderful. Ever since I stepped into the hotel for check-in, the staff had been so friendly and accommodating. Unlimited coffee and tea were provided throughout the stay and there were some yummy cookies and fruits offered. We also enjoyed the facilities. The outdoor pool was very cozy without having too many people. The steam, sauna and jacuzzi were clean, relaxing and in good condition. I tried and love them all ;)  A particular thanks to the butler team as they had been giving me lots of surprises and special memories. I booked this for my boyfriend’s birthday, and I am glad to have a room with gorgeous city view arranged. Apart from the lovely balloons and birthday card from the butlers, I was also…",50
We enjoyed staying at this beautiful hotel during a weekend excursion on our way to mainland China. My wife and I stayed at many different hotels all over the world. This is certainly one of the better ones we had an opportunity staying,50
"Room: Spacious, because of my Marriott Bonvoy membership, the hotel upgraded me to a bigger room  Location: In the heart of Cotai Strip, you could start your shopping, sightseeing and gaming experience hustle free :-)   Service: all the staffs are well trained, attentive and very friendly, I made a mistake on discount on in-room dining, and the staffs explained to me in a very kind way which made me feel very comfortable - well you know, this kind of situation could be hard to handle, but they nailed the job",50
"This is the first time I stay with St. Regis Macao. You could feel you are very welcomed once you stepped into the hotel. Check in and check out is very smooth and the staff is super friendly. Room is very nice, spacious and well decorated. Brian is great, he introduced the Butler service for me very well and also arranged coffee, delicious snacks and fruits.Heidi is awesome and very Professional, she had a comprehensive introduction of the hotel for me and recommended the bloody Mary. Next time I will have a try. She walked with me leave the hotel after I checked out. Thank you Heidi. Big big like to St. Regis Macao.  I will only stay at the St. Regis when I return in the future.",50
"We only stayed one night, coming from Hong Kong for a weekend break, purchased cheapest room on a deal so weren't expecting much. So we were absolutely blown away by how personalised and helpful the staff were when we checked in. The butler service was great, and they helped us coordinate all of our meals with restaurants and bookings and whatnot. Was seriously amazing!",50
"I chose St Regis Hotel because of the Butler service - very personal and satisfactory.  Nearly instant response.  They even provide ""turn down"" service which is very seldom nowadays.  The room is big and comfortable.  It is within walking distance to nearby shopping area.  The first day we stayed, we requested for an extra roll of toilet tissue.  The next day, an extra roll was already placed at the toilet with meticulous care.",50
"From the minute we arrived true 5 star service was given. Upon check in my Marriott Bonvoy Elite was not overlookedwith a beautiful upgrade to a Metropolitan Suite. From there fresh fruit and our butler arrived with hot tea. The concierge constantly checked on us to make sure we were enjoying everything. They even arranged for a limo to take us to the ferry complimentary with Bonvoy. The Manor provided us a great dinner as well as a fantastic breakfast one of the best spreads I’ve seen at a hotel. If you’re looking for great service, comfy beds (the most comfortable of our trip so far) and a clean hotel. This is your place friends. Thanks St. Regis for taking care of us! See you soon.  Justin K.",50
"This is our first time to St. Regis Macau and it would not be our last time. We came here for birthday celebration.   About one week before arrival, I received a warm email from the butler team. I simply replied them by saying we would be here for birthday celebration. They arrange not only a birthday cake, but also an exclusive Champagne sabering experience!!! This is our first time to have this unforgettable experience! We were sososososo happy that can’t sleep the whole night ;) Thank you so much for the butler team to make our night especially Wilson! Sorry I can’t remember all your names.  The cozy mattress, spacious bathroom, stunning room view and the caring butler service make our stay memorable! Besides, the fabulous and countless breakfast choices at Manor is another…",50

These staff are extremely well trained and made handles our needs extremely efficiently which made our holiday stress free.  Highly recommended",50
"This is a thumbs up for St. Regis. Our family spent a night with lots of good memories in this hotel. Truly it is one of a kind since there is butler service assign in every floor, who are very professional to name are Sam and  Jiji. I'd like to commend also Ms. Ana Jimenez who is excellent in handling check in services with very good communication skills and personality.",50
"Started from check-in, we enjoyed the service, facilities and our stay at St. Regis. No long queue like Sheraton, the registration procedure was smooth & efficient,, and we got our key card within 10 mins.   The standard room with the view of Eiffel Tower is a bit larger than Conrad Macao's one.  Those major in-room amenities are fully provided, and some items like coffee capsules, also tea bags are even more than other 5-star hotel.  We will definitely choose St Regis for our next trip to Macau again.",50
"My son and I recently spent the final night of a month-long round-the-world vacation at the St. Regis Macao and we were in awe of the personal touches that the hotel team rolled out for our benefit. When they became aware that we were celebrating a milestone birthday, they provided us with personalized gifts and the opportunity to take part in a one-of-a-kind sabrage ceremony. From detailed instructions on where to purchase something, to remembering important details about our trip, we were full aware that we had saved the best hotel experience for last. Regardless of the hotel options in Macao, I will only stay at the St. Regis when I return in the future. Chris and his incredible team (Brian, Cassandra, Sam, among others) are a force to be reckoned with, and made our stay…",50
Always wonderful to return to the St Regis Macau. Wonderful service at all time. One of my favourite bars to have cocktails at and loving loving the chilli peanuts. Room service is always good. Check in n check out always super fast and friendly. ,50

"From the St. Regis you can expect exceptional room and facility quality but what really made our stay phenomenal was the attentive and caring staff that works in the hotel. The butler service is there to truly make your stay the best it can possibly be and they go out of their way to make sure it is. Our butler even walked us across to another hotel to help us find the entrance of the show we had booked for the night. My wife and I stayed for our anniversary and all the little (and big) things they did for us made our stay unforgettable. Big thank you to Chris, Frank, and the whole staff for all they did. Can't wait to come back!",50
"As soon as I entered the hotel, I felt that the staff was friendly and welcoming. The hotel was good in all aspects. It was a surprise for me to stay up late and the food was good. I must go again next time.",40
"Always a pleasant stay with st Regis, it has been an enjoyable stay. My favorable attributes,  Very quiet room Bulter service  Spacious and well-equipped room  Very helpful staff  St Regis has taken care almost most issues of a hotel stay, and also paying attention to finer touches, such as,  Room was well equipped, they have airplay from the TV, which you can stream videos from your iPhone. This feature was great.  There is a blue tooth bose speaker for use.  The reading light was made part of the bed, the switching off was made extremely easy, just put your arm up for it. Also the brightness would be well-focused in bed, less dispersed when comparing to those reading lights at ceiling.   Love to visit again.",50
"I booked 2 nights thru an online portal and although I won’t earn any Marriot points, the staff would still treat me with great services. I was offered a high floor double bed room which have magnificent view to the Parisian.  Great services from every single staff that we met. Child friendly.",50
"As usual, the butler service is implacable.    Special shout-out to Rob and Wilson in setting up all the small details for my wedding anniversary.    Will definitely come back for future vacation.    Will remind myself to make future reservation via the Hotel own website so I can get my loyalty point within the marriott bonvoy membership.  您的評論長度至少需有 50 個字元。 加入詳細資料可真正協助旅客。您的評論長度至少需有 50 個您的評論長度至少需有 50 個字元。 加入詳細資料可真正協助旅客。您的評論長度至少需有 50 個字元。 加入詳細資料可真正協助旅客。您的評論長度至少需有 50 個字元。 加入詳細資料可真正協助旅客。您的評論長度至少需有 50 個字元。 加入詳細資料可真正協助旅客。字元。 加入詳細資料可真正協助旅客。",50

"We stayed in St. Regis for celebrating my boyfriend‘s birthday. The hotel is very sweet and helpful to prepare surprise for him. Here I want to appreciate Anna and Felix for their assistance.   The swimming pool is not too deep, which is safe for children and people who don’t know how to swim. They can lend you life jacket and kickboard. I enjoyed swimming here. There is a massage pool with hot water. So comfortable!",50
"My husband and I, stayed here for one night during my business trip to Hong Kong. Because my Travel Agent mentioned that it was our anniversary, the hotel staff surprised us with an upgraded Strip view room, decorated with rose petals and balloons. It was so perfect! Our butler, Marvin was amazing and ensured that all of our needs were met. We felt like royalty  We loved our stay and hope to return soon!  ",50
"Great hotel! The best part was the service. Dad had gout last month and they were able to provide transportation recs and  a wheelchair. Everybody from the concierge, butlers, room service, restaurant staff and front desk were excellent. They were able to provide gluten free options for breakfast!",50
"If it's a special occasion and you don't mind splashing out just a little bit more, my family and I wholeheartedly recommend staying here. The butler service is impeccable and even though my kids are only 12 and 13 years old, they made everyone feel so welcome and pampered. Nothing was too troublesome. The rooms are elegantly decorated and the beds are huge. One queen twin room could fit a family of four with younger children. The St. Regis is definitely our top choice for Macau from now on.",50
"World class hotel with great services and friendly staffs.   Upon arrival, escorted by the Butler for in-room orientation and check-in, which was efficient and details. Was offered the service to enjoy a cup of coffee which refreshed the day after my long wait at the immigration.  The breakfast was great, as everything was delicious and a good mix of east and west options.

Everything is fresh and delicious. If i go to Macau i must stay this hotel again. 마카오에서 묵었던 호텔 중에 가장 좋았던 호텔입니다. 작은 것 하나하나 모두 신경을 많이 쓴 티가 나고 너무 깨끗해서 객실에서 아무 냄새도 안난 호텔은 이 곳 뿐이었어요. 스태프들도 친절도가 다른 호텔들에 비교하지 못할 정도로 좋았습니다!! 아침은 안먹으면 후회할정도로 모든 것이 너무 맛있습니다! 꼭 드셔보길 추천합니다. 다음에 마카오에 가게 된다면 이곳만 가고 싶을 정도로 좋습니다~!",50
"This is a first class hotel, with terrific facilities and delightful staff. Macau is an acquired taste, but if you have to go, this will lessen the pain!  St Regis bar is a great place to hold a business meeting",50
"I had an outstanding stay here during a family trip with my mother.  The room they upgraded us to was fantastic, as was the overall personalized service and care.  The hotel is very clean/luxuruious and offers great service compared to the other 5 star accommodations in Macau that are often too large to offer truly superior service like the St Regis.  My mother had an unfortunate incident in the casino, and Chris Lim, the head butler, offered fantastic care and service to make the most out of the rest of our stay.  I cannot say enough about him and his staff - they were so polite, accommodating, and caring.    I highly highly recommend the St Regis Cotai, and will be back to properly experience Macau next time.",50
"It was a memorable stay in the nice hotel. The Butler team decorated our room with beautiful rose flower flakes. They also brought us tasteful cakes and drinks to celebrate our special occasion.  My gratitude to the Butler team Brian, Marvin, Marco and Peter, thank you!  Kambo.",50
Incredible hotel. Everything about it was perfection. I enjoyed how close it was to the other more “casino”ish properties but on its own it’s just perfect in how quiet and orderly the experience was. Would recommend.,50

I informed the hotel about my husband's birthday, they kindly arranged some little surprises for him in order to make our trip memorable.

Pros:  excellent service, clean rooms, comfortable beddings, children amenities provided, breakfast is good  Cons:  Swimming pool is a bit small,  Spa is good however the steam/sauna rooms are in different floor.  Overall we are very happy with our stay.",50

"I have reserved a Suite at St.Regis Macao and was planning to propose to my GF on her birthday. As this was meant to be a surprise, and I do not have family or friends to help, I wrote to St.Regis Macao and tell them about my plan. They get back to me promptly and even upgrade my room with a spectacular view for us.  For what was one of the best hotel experiences I have ever had. The lead up to coming was very good and I was really impressed with Sunny – Assistant Front Office Manager, Brian and his team– Butler Service, the whole Reservations team who understanding how important this stay was for us and delivering. Their help and communication in the lead up to our stay was great and the effort they and the rest of the team put in to making our room look as it did was…",50

"I proposed to my girlfriend surprisingly at St. Regis Macao. I really appreciate the butlers' help with my proposal. My requests were fulfilled with a smile, and my proposal went well, so we had a great happy time!  In spite of our poor English ability, the butlers kindly listened to us, and explained things to us, so we had a very comfortable time. We are very grateful to all the staffs we've met.  The stay at St. Regis Macao is one of the most precious memories of our lives. We are really looking forward to be back to Macao and stay again someday!",50
"I am a frequent traveler for work and pleasure and have spent over 1,000 nights in hotels and 700 nights at Marriott properties in my life.  In the last two months I have stayed at the St. Regis Macao 16 nights.  These nights at the St. Regis have been the best hotel experience ever in my life.  The combination of superb service, elegant decor, and outstanding amenities make this the best hotel stay ever.  The entire staff is very friendly, responsive, and attentive to their guests.  They go above and beyond to make you feel welcomed and special.  The check in process is very personable, the butler service is impeccable, the room service is fantastic, the housekeeping is excellent, the managers are helpful, and the general manager takes great pride in providing the best service…",50
"Our recent stay in St Regis Macao was nothing but short of superb, a true hidden gem in Macao. I have enjoyed and been so impressed with this hotel and level of service received that I feel compelled to write a trip advisor review to ensure your excellent staffs were being recognised.   As known, St Regis has always been famous for its butler service. And we could have never asked for a better level of service we encountered with Macao Butler team.   Upon arrival, we were greeted by Jackie, she is a delight and personifies everything the SR should be, not only instantly we felt welcomed and was truly embraced by the feeling of ‘welcoming to House of Astor.’ Check in process was a breeze and were instantly escorted to room by Butler-Jill.  Jill was courteous and knowledgeable,…",50
"St Regis is always my top selection of hotel at all times. My recent stay at the hotel for a special celebration with my friends is one of the memorable experiences in my recent travel.  All staff (room Butler, bell boy, receptionist, room service server, etc.), we met at the hotel are helpful and professional. My friends and I enjoyed the room facilities, which are all clean and in good condition. As well, the great hospitality service made our stay in the hotel a super good one.   As the hotel knew about our reason of stay is for a farewell gathering, we got surprised with the extra balloon decorations, and special slice of cake with greetings arranged for us at our stay. The service was absolutely impeccable.   Special thanks to Chris Lim, Head Butler, who is attentive and…",50
"This is my favorite hotel in Macau - very conveniently located in Sands Cotai Central, with many food options and access to various attractions in Venetian and Parisian through footbridge.  If you are a Marriott Platinum member you have a choice of breakfast buffet or points - I typically pick points but for this property I think choosing breakfast makes more sense. Also there are drinks offered at the bar, and their infused gin and tonic is fantastic.  Very special thanks to Lisa K who greatly helped in making our family vacation so special, and also appreciate Cassandra and Marvin in the butler team who made our trip so wonderful!",50
"It’s the best 5 star hotel I have ever stayed, wonderful butler service help me with the reservation of restaurant. Especially thanks for our butler Cassandra, she is really helpful and kind during our stay. Highly recommend St.Regis if you were planning to visit Macau. 飯店服務非常好，員工也十分有禮及熱情，從辦理入住到進房都有詳細介紹館內設施，特別感謝當時的管家Cassandra，很親切及窩心。 下次若造訪澳門，St.Regis會是第一首選",50
"From arrival to departure, the staff ensured that our stay at the St. Regis was excellent. Our butler, Samuel, was extremely detailed in showing us our room, providing everything we could need, and even surprised us with birthday cake (we were celebrating a birthday). If you want to be completely pampered and paid attention to, you will want to stay here.",50
"A short night stay, arrival was very nice ( though the taxi driver didn’t know the name of the hotel, asked for the Chinese name, which is a sign of the times) . The room was very nice with a view of the Venetian across the street. I had no less than 3 greeting messages waiting for me when I arrived.  Room was very nice, clean, just a bit dated. Breakfast was great in the morning. I’d defiantly stay again.",40
Nice hotel!  I was referred by American Express platinum card and I like this hotel very much.  I especially like the Butler Felix who is very helpful to us and very good service.  Will stay again here for sure!,50
"It's not easy to find the hotel shuttle bus at the ferry terminal and I didn't see any staffs at the ferry guiding us to the shuttle bus.  When I reached the hotel, it doesn't stop at the hotel but another hotel and I have to walk. The breakfast at Menor Restaurant is good, I am impressed by the egg station.  Perhaps I should not go to Macao during festival seasons.",30
"What a quality services at St. Regis Macao, with staffs who treated you sincerely, especially thanks to one of the receptionist, Felix, who gives warm greeting to our family. Coffee and tea can be ordered at room, which stays on high quality. Will recommend the stay to friends.",50
"The bellman is very helpful, helped me with my luggage when I arrived. Then a friendly staff escorted me to check-in.  Same feeling as my last stay at St. Regis Singapore a few years back.  Luxury!   Unfortunately, there was some problem with the phone but it doesn’t stop me going to this hotel again in the future.",30
"It was the first time to stay at The St. Regis Macao for my birthday trip with my husband. We had an excellent and memorable stay.  The hotel location is quiet but easy to walk for shopping, eating or gambling. The room is very clean and spacious. The amenities are abundant. Every staff in the hotel is very friendly and professional. The butler service is extremely thoughtful. They will contact you in advance to know about what you need and they will do the well preparation. I would like to especially thank to them for the birthday cake and the special decoration.   Manor was our last minutes pick but we did a great choice. Good environment, good service with perfect food.  I will definitely recommend this hotel and will also visit again.",50
"Overall average. I feel that the service of Conrad Macau is a bit better.   I expected it will be the same as other St Regis, but I feel that others are more luxury.    The room view is not so good,I can see whats in the other hotel room, maybe vice versa?",30
Butler services were so great!! Especially Mr. Felix. Front desk staff were very friendly and in-detailed. Outdoor swimming pool was not so crowded not too many children. Surely visit again very soon.,50
I never expect an upgrade on the room as I checked in on the 2 May 2019 for one night and it is super peak season in Macau due to the Labour Day holidays.   However to my pleasant surprise I was given a suite. This really brighten up my holidays.   All the staff are friendly and helpful.   Will consider to stay there again in future.   ,50
"Unlike my past stay and dining experiences here, the hotel lobby was full of tourists waiting for check-in.  I cannot expect no wait but I waited for my good 20 minutes.  When it was my turn, the agent was nice talking with me recommending me the hotel facilities, but didn’t notice that I was tired!",30
"I stayed at St. Regis Macao on April 27th. Upon arrival, I was greeted by the butler and Head Butler, Mr. Chris Lim. Instead of waiting in line for check-in, they even came to us and ran through all check-in process by letting my family and myself sit conformably at the sofa area. It is extraordinary service and the first time I am treated as an elite member. Furthermore, Mr. Lim asked the purpose of the stay and accidentally knew we were celebrating my Dad’s birthday. He then managed to upgrade the room and arrange the special birthday celebration event for my family. In short, this is an unforgettably awesome and one of the most welcoming services we have ever experienced at any of Marriott properties around the world (speaking as an elite member who has stayed in dozens of…",50
"It's our first stay with St. Regis Macao and we could not be more satisfied.   We were greeted warmly at the reception by David and Ryan.  This is our babymoon cum anniversary celebration trip and we were surprised to receive such attentive service from the hotel staff, especially from the Butler team (they took the initiative to arrange non-slippery mat to be placed in the bathroom).  We were surprised by the little decoration in the room too!   St. Regis is your best option for special occasions!   We will definitely be back with our baby!",50
"Went there for two nights during a weekend, and really enjoyed my stay. Staff was great, their English was fine, all very polite and helpful. And it’s the first time I was staying with St-Regis and I must admit that their butler service was very impressive! They’ve arranged plenty of things for me and this was all done by communicating with them via WhatsApp. Room service was very good and their lobby bar lounge food as well. I didn’t have time to try their gym or pool, but from my window I could see that the pool was always empty. Hotel is very centrally located right next to the City of Dreams and only about 5 minutes from the airport. It also has a casino which was quite large but I didn’t play. In summary, a very good stay that I’ve enjoyed a lot.",50
"We had a very memorable celebration of our wedding anniversary at Macau St. Regis.   Their butler service was very attentive which could not be offered by other 5 star hotels in Cotai.     Overall, every staff in the hotel is very friendly and professional.    We will be back soon!",50
"The hotel is right at centre of the Cotai area. Also inside a huge resort complex, no matter stay there simply for shopping, entertainment, huge range of dining options or just relax.  When I go inside the entrance, concierge staff welcome us with nice smile and lead me to the check-in counter, check-in is fast too and I got upgrade to the St. Regis suite which I did not expect for.  I’m satisfied my room much. Although the interior design wasn’t my favourite. It’s more like a nice apartment than a luxury hotel room. But it’s very huge and cleanness which to me more important.  There’s a sport competition on my check-in date. So that I search for all channels on the TV that have not a sport channel playing the match. And I try to call the butler to help on this. They also cannot…",50
This was our first time to the St Regis Macau and for only 2 nights as part of a visit to Hong Kong. We could not fault a thing. The staff were welcoming and friendly and helpful. The room was really lovely with comfy beds and great facilities. Unfortunately the weather was not great so we did not use the pool or any outdoor facilities. We would highly recommend and of course stay again. We are looking at other St Regis hotels for holidays this year as were so impressed. Thank you everyone at St Regis Macau and we will see you again next year !,50
"My wife and I recently chose the St Regis in Macau to celebrate a big wedding anniversary. We had an excellent, memorable stay.   This was due to the caring, willing and classy service provided by not only the many butlers who helped us, but also the Front office staff (Special thanks to Blair Gao), the Concierge staff and the Bar staff, especially Kim.   Also the room service and the quality, finish of the Metropolitan suite and the views that we  had were great. I would revisit and stay again at The St Regis when I get to Macau again.   A big thanks to the hotel management and staff for a really complete and yes excellent and memorable stay. ",50
"Awesome hotel and great service. The staff was incredibly accommodating to every ask. Very convenient location within walking distance of other properties as well as having a great pool, spa, restaurants, bar, and casino on site. The price was very fair for a luxury property for the experience you get. I wish I was able to stay longer!",50
Grand Deluxe Room Larger Guest room 1 King Cotai Strip view 77sqm   ประทับใจทุกครั้งที่ไปพัก นอกจากห้องพักจะดีมากๆแล้ว การบริการก็ดีมากๆเช่นกัน เราได้รับการต้องรับที่ดี ตั้งแต่เดินเข้าประตูโรงแรมเพื่อไปCheck in ส่งถึงห้อง จนCheck out ถ้าการจัดระดับจำนวนดาวของโรงแรมมีมากกว่า5ดาว ที่นี้ก็สมควรได้ ,50
"Clean and tidy room , everyone is nice here !  Good place to relax, love the view of room , big bathroom  comfortable bed and pillow . Good choice for you to stay in macao with reasonable price , should come again next time !",40
The service here is awesome. I sent email to hotel stating our purpose of stay and I wanna surprise my wife. They really do help me for the arrangement of flower delivery and also I felt surprised by their amazing arrangement.staffs here are nice especially Felix Butler. I would love to stay here again and highly recommend it.,50
"""St. Regis Hotels - where indulgence meets sophistication.  Pursue your passion to relax, unwind and getaway to the perfect retreat.""    This is my 5th time at the St Regis Macao, Cotai Central, I can testify the above statement.  Got welcomed by Heidi Hu and sent off by Jill and Chris Lim.  Appreciate all the kindness shown during my stay - my work clothes pressed, my shoes polished.  The chocolates & cakes sent to my room at different times, welcome fruits, especially the grapes was great!  Would be nice if there is a fruit skin peeler available, the knife in the room is indeed difficult to use.    I like the TG teas they have in the room - espcially the fruit teas/ red passion favours.  I think they now changed to TWG, still nice, the other stay I asked about the tea bag, TG…",50
"Great cocktails by Mike (our barkeep) at this swanky, yet down to earth spot in Macau. Get there around 18H for a lil champagne sabrage action (you’ll get a comp glass of champs post- sword action).   Try the classic Old Fashioned if you’re in a Draper-esque mood or ask for the signature Gin trolley to customize your tipple. ",50
"We've been staying at the St. Regis Macao Cotai Central for three nights and our time there was not just a stay - it was an experience.   For starters, the non-gambling property, situated in prime-location of the cotai strip aside the Sheraton, Parisian & Venetian is brand-new. We received a huge Metropolitan Suite that had sweeping views and one of the largest bathrooms I've ever seen. But what really sets the St. Regis Macao apart (and I'm travelling a lot) is the service. Virtually everybody from the team has been fantastic from start to finish. In my view, the St. Regis Macao is a great example of how high-end hospitality should work. We were greeted by name even by the housekeeping (!) and the team of butlers was outstanding. Our questions have been anticipated more than…",50
"St. Regis, one of best hotels I’ve stayed in Macao . The hotel is luxurious and services are prefect. A butler named Rebecca made me feel at home. She is very professional, packed my luggage very neatly, Delivered my coffee, She was always helpful and polite. Her attentives were not found in other hotels. Will come back again absolutely.",50
"This property has an unbelievable staff - attentive, professional, courteous, and personal.  Not personal in an invasive way, but personal in a - we want you (the customer) to be happy way.  And they remembered your name.  Every time.  Very impressive. The butler assigned to my room was Eileen.  I asked about where to buy a diet coke.  She recommended a close convenience store in the attached mall.  Then an hour later she delivered 4 diet Cokes in a bucket of ice.  Very thoughtful, very classy.",50
The main entrance was spectacular. It was a group of us and our rooms were just perfect. The bar was a bit of a highlight and we got to experience their version of the Bloody Mary which was amazing. It was incredible to see that every one knew who we were at an instant and enjoyed the service and elegance the staff had to offer. Incredible hotel.,50
"My friend and I had a fantastic two-night stay at the St Regis, Macau. From arrival to departure, we were so well looked after - the service was amazing.   We had a lovely suite overlooking the Eiffel Tower. It had all the amenities we could want or need and the beds were so comfortable!   Breakfast at The Manor was very civilised and not overcrowded like most of the Cotai hotel buffets. The food was fresh and delicious.   We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who would enjoy a more peaceful visit to Macau in a luxury hotel. ",50
"Booked three rooms under the Fine Resort and Hotel program. Not only did we receive all the upgraded amenities and accommodations, but the concierge and butler services were just outstanding.  The rooms are spacious and well appointed, and it's location is perfect for shopping and gaming.  Every one of the staff at the St. Regis Cotai that we’ve met is to be commanded on providing exceptional service, which is what really sets this property apart as the best St. Regis that I have ever stayed at.",50
Superb hotel. Great service and hospitality.  They were always up to ensure the most memorable comfortable stay I had. They had also upgraded me to Suite. Would love to come back again and stay at St. Regis only in Macao!!!,50
"Very nice hotel/front desk staff and butler are very friendly, polite and with smile/provide Good services/I stayed here twice and I would choose this hotel for my next vocation in Macau due to above reasons.",50
Very nice hotel with excellent bulter service provided. Warm and nice preparation for our wedding anniversary. This is one of the highly recommended hotels for staying in Macau. The room is spacious and clean. Convenient to shops and restaurants in Cotai but locating at a quiet corner. The check-in exerpience was nice and fast comparing to other hotels that we had been to in Macau.,50
"We go Macau almost every year and have stayed at 10+ hotels.  St Regis is the only hotel that is worth a written review.   Quiet hotel but walking distance to everything you possibly want to eat/see/experience.  Manor semi buffet lunch was excellent - quality rather the quantity.  Coffee / tea delivered by Butler service always first class - still very hot.  Their coffee beans are high quality.  Make sure you get the staff to help you preplan restaurant booking, newspapers, etc.   Gym equipment new and high standard. I went twice in 24 hours. ",50
"Very spacious room and the bedding is very comfortable!    Easy to access to the mall and is convenient.  Casino entrance is just next to the hotel entrance.    The equipment is updated and clean, but the changing room in the gym is quite small and there’s not enough shower facilities.",30
Excellent service and their butler service provide the best assistance for me to celebrate my wife’s birthday and provide necessary stuffs for my infant during my stay They also prepare the unexpected room upgrade and decorate the room during my stay,50
"Lily and Sami maybe the best concierge and butler I ever came across. Outstanding service, great luxurious rooms, perfect location. Highly recommend.  They arranged all our tours, we saw the pandas, last minute reservation at 8 which is a 3 Michelin chinese. Great breakfast too!! ",50
"I was hestitated when my husband asked me to choose a hotel for just a 1 night transit in Macau and I booked this hotel because it has the lowest price comparing with the same class hotels nearby and we found we made the right decision.  The room is very clean. The room service staff who took our order not really understand my husband's request. Anyways, I appreciated the male staff who helped to helped us to press my huaband's shirt as well the complimentary coffee. We took shuttle from the airport however the shuttle did not stop at hotel entrance but stopped at another hotel and we had a long walk through the mall to the hotel.  We had a lot of luggage and took taxi to ferry port instead of shuttle.",30
"I want to preface this review by first saying that it may sound like I have been paid to write this review but i truly write it out of my own pure volition.   Lets start off with the positives, of which are plentiful. Obviously the basics are all perfection, the room is spotless, staff is extremely friendly, and amenities are abundant. Now I've had my fair share of fancy hotel experiences but St. Regis takes the cake. What differentiates them from the others is their 24 hour Butler Experience whom you can contact multiple different ways(including messaging them). They are responsive, friendly, efficient etc. At first I thought it was just a gimmicky feature used to allure tourists into divulging into their crazy rates. However this was not so, it is a completely game changer. In…",50
"Impressive room with great views. Friendly and very helpful staff. NIce pools, Jacuzzi and sauna, steam room etc... And something most appreciated is that there is no additional charge for all the amenities. Be it from Check-in, the Restaurant, pool staff etc... the staff was very friendly and offered a great service.",50
"First time to stay in s St Regis. The Hotel has traditional St Regis style expected, Elegant. The staff all eager to greet snd help you with s big smile. Even at 3am in the morning.  The Room was a good size, good condition and well decorated,also was very functional. Everything you need. including a well stocked mini bar at that time of the morning as a pick you up.  The bathroom was also of good size and well equipped. Including Colgate mouthwash.  I also found the Butler service top class. You called if you wanted anything, tea or coffee. When the butler was in your room. They know your name snd reason for your stay giving it a personal touch. Always asking if they can press your cloths or clean your shoes. Truly an experience. Thank you Sam. He was my Butler on 32nd floor. …",50
"Had an absolutely amazing stay at the St.Regis Macao. The metropolitan suite is extremely well designed and the room cleanness is unbeatable. Really appreciate and touched by the entire Front Office team. From the check in till I checked out, everyone is all so friendly and professional they provided service I need on time and on point. Special thanks to Joyce and Cecil from the front desk, Dragon, Peter, Mia(thank you so much for setting up the room for me it was the sweetest thing ever) gave me fantastic butler service. And concierge CC Mabel and Ryan, you guys are incredible. Millions thanks to Willy the Manager of rooms division, you have well-trained staff and a fantastic team. 11/10 Would recommend for anyone whos looking for a stay in Cotai area.",50
"The level of hospitality and customer service in this hotel is extremely high. All staff, from front desk to security to management know how to make the guests feel very comfortable.  The rooms are spacious, very clean and decorated with everything one can ask for. Although, it is a funny detail, I think it is over the top to have a tv screen in the mirror in the bathroom, nice gadget though.  The mattresses are soft but give enough support when sleeping. Only the pillows are a bit too soft and don't offer much support for your neck & head, never the less sleeping was certainly pleasant in this room.  I certainly recommend this hotel and will also return more often as the rooms are excellent and I really appreciate & enjoyed the friendly staff here. To me is is a hotel with a…",50
"My friends and I had a fantastic stay: the St. Regis Macao has indeed lived up to the storied reputation of the St. Regis name. I’d like to call out a few individuals who made our stay extra special:  •	Willy who was there to personally welcome us to the resort, and made sure throughout our stay that we were well looked after •	Samuel our butler who worked tirelessly and cheerfully on every request – including leading us through the labyrinth from the hotel to our dinner venue, and arranging a most delicious birthday cake •	Anna at the front desk who very considerately arranged an extra breakfast so our kids could be satisfied after the most important meal of the day •	Heidi who made all prior arrangements before we arrived and also sent us off – making sure that our departure…",50

Check out was also smooth and simple.  Overall, a 13/10 stay!",50
"Being this is my first time at a St. Regis, I did not know what to expect, also first time in Macao. I typically stayed at a JW or other boutique hotels but I’m glad I chose the St. Regis. I went there with my wife for 1 night to spend my birthday there. We arrived via ferry from Hong Kong. I had done the app check in to arrive around 11:44 am. We arrived around 12:30. The check in was smooth the the staff greeted us and identified us with our titanium status as we were introduced to your butler and showed us to our upgraded suite with a tour of our suite.

We also visited the complementary happy hour at the regis bar which included…",50
"I traveled to Macau for 1 night after landing in Hong Kong and taking the ferry. From the second I stepped in the door, the St. Regis was absolutely flawless. My bag was taken and I was seated at a check in desk. Check in was professional and quick, and I was passed to my butler June who was extremely professional and poised. I was escorted to my St. Regis Suite, an upgrade thanks to Platinum Premier (now Titanium) status. Waiting for my were two welcome gifts of fruit and pastries. June showed me around the suite and quickly delivered a cappuccino so I had energy to go waste money gambling in Macau.

A short business trip. Delightful rooms with very comfortable beds and a luxury bathroom. Didn’t indulge in the casino but did check out the gym which was super well equipped. A very large hotel but manages to retain some character. ,50
"While staying there recently, and since our stay there, my husband and I have since been down with both lung and eye infection.  While staying there, my husband and I experienced difficulty in breathing but were not sure what may be the cause of these issues. We asked the hotel to investigate the air vents in our room to clean out the vents and filters. They apologized after sending their HVAC engineer to investigate and even gave us a bottle of Prosecco and other gifts to apologize.   We thought it was due to poor ventilation in our room and didn’t think too much about it, but after checking out for about a week now, we are still experiencing the same symptoms that we got while there.   To the St Regis Hotel Management / Marriott Bonvoy Management: Please kindly investigate…",10
"My family consisting of 2 little kids <9 years old, stayed at the St. Regis for 1 night and it was a wonderful, relaxing and enjoyable stay. Check-in was professional and the staff did a great job despite an electronic hiccup resulting in a delay.  Extremely clean and all staff are at least bilingual (English, mandarin, +other)! Professional and conscientious staff, especially our butler Anne Kuang, who anticipated the needs of our little family. Excellent outdoor pools with wonderful pool staff who ensured the pool was relaxing and clean. It was a chilly day, and their staff ensured we had adequate towels and water. Highly recommend the butler service. Very clean, modern, well-kept and luxurious rooms. The special bathroom amenities for the kids made the trip extra special.…",50

They do room cleaning twice a day, Awesome! ",50
"Fantastic resort, great food at the bar in the lobby ( where they have a great gin and tonic cart where loyalty members can get amazing mixtures prepared table side,) all complemented by wonderful service from all the staff. Stand out service from Sam (Samuel) the bulter who seemed to be there any time there was the slightest need.   Celebrated the Spring Festival in style and would 100 percent go back",50
Our stay was great.  The is quiet and Felix is an amazing person.  He made our stay very memorable.  Felix is a true professional.  We will go back to this hotel for sure.    The hotel gym is also very good.,50
"Of the 5 star hotels we have stayed at in Macau, the St Regis wins.  We were here to spend one night, and upon reserving our room on their website, the hotel’s butler service promptly emailed us to welcome us in advance.  He asked if we would be there for a special occasion, which was the case.  They upgraded our room to one with a beautiful view, as well as decorate it with balloons.  Every staff offered birthday wishes, and they prepared a birthday cake as well.  Thank you St Regis for such wonderful hospitality, and for making my birthday a special one.",50
"WOW..WOW..WOW and yes another WOW!!! First time in Macao and our first time in the Hong Kong area. As soon as we entered the impressive lobby we entered a world of luxury and opulence. Our luggage was taken and we were quickly invited to take a seat at check-in.. An amazing agent checked my gold status was recognised immediately. The li elyse agent up-graded our room without the slightest problem thanks to Ana in the back office.  A Butler arrived (Marvin) what a fantastic person he is. Walked both my partner and I to our room. Unpacked for us, brought coffee, tea, ice, even organised a birthday surprise for my partner. Now the room...Oh what a room..amazingly perfect, one and a half bath, with all the amenities you'd expect from a prestigious hotel. Lush robes, bath salts,…",50
I believe this is the best stay I ever had so far and I would need to highlight something for this hotel. First is John Lio from call center. I did sent an email to ask the way to hotel from airport and he provide us a great directory and explanation from airport to the hotel with additional tourist attractions information I believe this is way more than he should have done.   Following with our butler Eric and Amy. They provide such a great service while we check in and something to surprise me. I never know they have prepared a little cake and some decoration in the room to welcome me as birthday trip but i never mention this to them. They are always response like whatever and whenever i request something from them and its efficient.   I will also wanna to give a big thanks to…,50

We stayed at the St. Regis Macao for one night with a group of good gents.

We would like to specially thank Elaine for being very service intuitive and proactive during the whole stay.  You guys are La Classe!  Thank you ,50

The rooms are decadent, modern and well equipped in every way .  Gorgeous and comfortable rooms.  Very spacious with sensational amenities .  Nespresso machines as well.  Any room type gets you an amazing set of Butler services.  My butlers picked me up at the ferry and escorted me to my hotel.  My 3 children had mini night gowns prepared for them in their specific sizes.  It was a knockout gesture.  They arranged birthday cake and special birthday games for all of us.  I could not be happier.  The whole hotel knew it’s my birthday and I was constantly greeted and wished by every member of staff.  The location is perfect.  Right on the first…",50
We stayed in St Regis a lot and this hotel has one of the best butler service. The butler and manager greeted us at checkin and our butler gave us a comprehensive introduction of where to visit and how. My mum really enjoyed the stay and we would definitely come back shall we visit Macao again!,50
"I cannot tell you what a fantastic experience it was staying at this St. Regis in Macau.  The property is just fantastic (5 stars).  Luxury throughout.  The bed was the most heavenly luxurious bed I have ever slept in in my travels (I have traveled 700k miles in my life with a fair amount of hotel stays).  The people who work at this hotel are top notch.  They are extremely social and interested in you as an individual.  The Front Office Manager, Sunny Chin and the Butlers (Felix, Cassandra and Amy) made us just fall in love with this place.  We loved the pools and Jacuzzis (yes there are two each!).  The spa took me to a new place mentally (I just needed to relax) and the en suite bathroom and separate changing area just added to the feeling of luxury.  The breakfast buffet is…",50
"My wife and I are regular visitors to Macau but we had never stayed in the St. Regis before. On this occasion we chose it because we had heard about such high levels of service. I am happy to say we were not disappointed. On being greeted at the door and shown swiftly to check-in we were warmly greeted by our butler Samuel (Sam) whose service and attention to detail throughout our stay was exemplary. He was there to answer any questions, help with arrangements, unpack our luggage if we wanted and  assist with hotel services. To have a personal service like this in any hotel is truly a luxury, thank you Sam. We were also drawn to the Hotel bar where Roy and his team delivered service and quality rarely seen in bars these days. We opted for the infused gin trolley option which…",50
"In the context of a St Regis, this property is just an average one.  It looks very aged.  You can tell the towels are really ""used"".  The location is nice.  But Macao is small anyways.  The breakfast options are oK but nothing exciting.  The staff is keeping the St Regis standards.  Very professional and helpful, from front desk to bell boys.",30
"It’s a celebration trip for my boyfriend birthday and our 3000 days anniversary, so I contacted the hotel via email to ask if they can help to provide surprise for my boyfriend. And the result are very good.  Other than that, the concierge are extremely helpful, since I’m planning to have dinner at a place that is quite far from the hotel, so I send email them to ask how can I get to there, and they reply me really fast.   The thing that really surprises me is that, when I arrived the hotel and ready to go out to that restaurant, I ask the concierge to confirm the route, they took out a envelope that has my name on it, and take out three printed sheet, which is the map around the restaurant that has written down where are the bus stop, 2 sheets that  are the bus route and where…",50
"Butler service is great when you are stuck in your hotel room with yet another all day conference call. Then migrate to St Regis bar for Happy Hour with live music. Finish evening with Michelin Star dining and one of the few Craps tables in Cotai. Perfect for exec who needs the extra day in HK with variety, especially fighting jet lag.",50
"I am writing this review 2:15am at St Regis Macau and hoping I can cool down and  sleep soon!    We picked this hotels because it's long term repetition and remarkable services.  Not sure we got any of these in the stay.    Check in : The front desk staff services was great as usual.  However, we booked 3 rooms and arrive at 1430, official check in time is 1500, we thought the rooms should be ready but they weren't.  We were told one of the room is almost ready and rest not yet.  We came back at 1530, 2 of the rooms are ready but one still not.  We checked in the other 2 rooms and try to pickup the key for the last one at 1600 and it was still not ready.   My baby needed to use my aunts toilet because our rooms wasn't ready. It was so inconvenience!  Stay : Before we sleep, we…",10
"The hotel was a really nice break to the sometimes craziness of Macau.  Fantastic staff (especially Mike & Eurika in the bar) and very beautiful product.  The pool was good (not great) and the views were so-so depending on where your room (or suite) was.  But, overall, a great property in Macau and I'd be happy to go back.",40
"1. Good service, the butler will deliver coffee or what you like to drink to your room upon checking in. 2. Caring staff, when my mother was suffering toothaches, the waitress would suggest an lemonade to ease her pain.",50
"I stayed too comfortable with their kindness. I was moved by pleasant cleaning,  delicious food, and careful consideration. I'd like to visit again next time.  Thank you for making a good memory for my family.",50
"As told to be the most luxury hotel in Macao Cotai,the hotel is just up to standard.Guest room I stayed has normal facilities as other hotel and decoration is just ok.Hot food in breakfast time is just warm .I have to ask the chef to fry mushroom for me again as it is cold.When I complained,the waitress said guests prefer warm food as hot food may hurt!Is it too funny?I was also reminded when I checked in not to touch items in frig ,as cost will be charged after ten seconds!I found it is a bit mean in this luxury hotel.",40
"Very nice hotel, right on the Macau “strip”! They went out of their way to recognize my platinum status and gave us a beautiful suite. As you’d expect from a st Regis, the rooms feel luxurious, the bathrooms are huge and the bed is amazing. What was surprising is that they offer happy hour at the bar with free drinks and light snacks for platinum guests because they don’t have a lounge. I’ve never seen this before but it was a great touch that makes you feel recognized, especially given the high quality of the drinks and food. Breakfast was also great so overall I’d really recommended this!!",50
"Clean room, comfortable bed, attentive butler service.  We stayed for 2 nights and had our dinner table reserved at our preferred restaurant each night.  The hotel is located in a less crowded area in Sands Cotai and we like it.",50
"Stay there for an overnight. Located in Cotai, the new heart of Macau, shuttle buses come and go anytime and anywhere around the area, so it is very convenient and free to go anywhere in Macau。 If compare with the other luxury hotels in the area, St. Regis' rooms are not the biggest nor the most luxury, but it is more than adequate for a one night stay.  Butler service is their signature, and it is really good indeed. The check-in process is very nice, they have four or five office desks there to help you, and you can just sit there to complete the procedures.  Breakfast quality is just so-so, you will just forget when you walk out of the restaurant, it is not worth if breakfast is not included in your package. St. Regis will give you a First Class ferry tickets to go to Hong…",40
"room condition was so great  and Butler service was impressive.  Most of all... last day our concierge staff was friendly and attentive.  If I visit Macau again, I  will surely stay at St. Regis Macao Cotai.  Thank so much...  all of them...",50
"We have been staying in St. Regis every month for over a year. We really love their hospitality as well as the Filipino crew, which makes us feel like we are at home. Our loyalty starts when they gave us , on our very first stay, an upgrade to Metropolitan suite and the upgrades continue up to today. As we celebrated my husband’s birthday they gave us a surprise during our stay too. We love the elegance of this hotel. It has a homey feel but in an upgraded type of home. 😍",50
"Overall Service and environment is good. I like the coffee Latte that serve to my room it taste good. When check in front desk attendant said will provide us the room with view of Parisian Hotel, she have guest expectation knowing that we are husband and wife come for relax so that arrange a romantic view to us, we are so happy and will come again also introduce to our friends and family. Overall rooms environment and cleanliness was good.  One thing to improve is the black marble of the toilet wash basin, there have serious white mark on the marble seem long time never polish, and the mark may cause by the chemical use when during cleaning.",40
"My 2nd time at St Regis Macau and everything was as great as before from the well appointed rooms, amenities, the St Regis bar and breakfast at the Manor. Most importantly is the attentive care and services from all the staff!",50
"It was my third times stay at the hotel. In this time, I used their butler service and she offered some drinks quickly. I was very impressed by their kindly supports. I wanna stay the hotel the again in the near future.",50
"The hotel room very comfortable, especially the bed, and the furnitures very thoughtful with dining table and double sinks in bathroom. The fitness centre with sauna, steam room and a jacuzzi. Lovely!",50
"I just finished a two day stay at the St. Regis Macau, booked through American Express.  It is my favourite property in Macau. The staff are the most attentive, helpful staff that I have come across in 15 years of business travel. The rooms and amenities are very good. The breakfast is one of the better hotel breakfasts around. (Sorry but the view from HK Shangri La earns it top spot).  The St. Regis Lobby bar is a great place to eat, unwind and enjoy legendary Bloody Mary’s and an amazing Gin cocktail hour.  Special thanks go out to Sunny with the front desk team and Toni at the concierge for exceeding expectations very time.  Always look forward to my next visit.  Andrew from Canada",50
"Stayed at the hotel for one night. Check in and check out went very smoothly with no problems and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful.   As a platinum premier member got an upgraded room with a great view. The bed was really comfortable and had a great night’s sleep.  The room has everything you could possibly need.  The staff in this St. Regis is what really make it special and stand out. Especially Roy and his team in the bar. The bar has a great selection of drinks, food and entertainment provided by Aaron from around 18.30 until late.  Not to be missed !  The Manor also has a very good breakfast to start the day and a great Sunday brunch which goes on until 15.30.  Can’t wait to go back again.",50
"It's generally difficult for a St. Regis hotel to exceed expectations seeing as the bar for excellence is set by the brand and everyone else follows. The St. Regis Macao, however, did just that and then some. I have to admit that my stay there got off to a rocky start but that mostly due to my getting lost on the way there from the shuttle. Once I was in the hotel, it was all smooth sailing from there.   The hotel itself is superb, with the rooms upholding the lofty standards of all St. Regis hotels. The facilities are also outstanding, especially the dining venues (highly recommend the Manor restaurant and their flagship bar). But it all pales in comparison to the service. The entire staff is absolutely top-notch, led by the amazing Sunny. They took great care of us every step…",50
"We had our anniversary celebration here at St Regis Macao! We received email before our arrival from Butlers, Oscar, John, Jack and Circle. Staffs are very friendly and responses quickly.  Room was ready before our arrival, Richard assist us to check in and Meilin and Mia showed us the way to the room and we were surprised when we get in our room! They prepared some balloons for our anniversary celebrations! Also they offered a cake along with some tea for us as amenity! That’s sweet!  The room is nice and clean, the city view from our room is cool. We would also like to thanks Surya, Eric helping us for room cleaning and turndown service, Keya assist to check out and Kit from Concierge for helping us to change the restaurant reservation. It is a great experience for our…",50
"Having stayed for 4-5 times since its opening, we continued to choose to stay at the St. Regis.  However, maybe due to our high expectations from their past excellent service, we were slightly let down this time.  This is because : 1. They have taken out the Handy mobile phone from all rooms and it is confirmed that even if you request for one, they won't have it anymore. 2. Seems like there were quite a lot of new staff and they were either forgetful or not well-trained because we requested the butler to deliver forks and knives but as he dropped one of the knives on the floor, he told us that he would get a clean one but he never returned.  Also, though we only have stayed for about 4-5 times, we were never greeted as if we are return guests.  There were a few more minor…",40
"I can’t say enough how friendly and helpful the staff of St Regis have been in my recent visit with my wife! From the registration, concierge, Butler service to restaurant waitresses, they all wear a smile and try their best to serve the guests. The Butler service was second to none. Room service coffee and tea around the clock! Complimentary shoe shine and morning tea. We bought a few bottles of vintage port and one manager at reception helped us pack skillfully into our luggage. What a personalized service. The hotel room was spacious and comfortable. It was near perfection! Just one little suggestion: can we have more choices of pillows other than soft and firm? Medium firm? Thank you.",50
"Third time staying here now.  Overall the hotel infrastructure is great and is unlike many of the other more tacky Macau options.  Check-in was smooth and attentive, rooms are good and comfortable. The bar has much improved and now the bartenders know how to make regular cocktails very well and were v friendly and professional; hostesses warm and chatty.  Pool area is spacious but maybe too much? Feels a bit dead and like a vast concrete area outside. Maybe some landscaping changes (greenery, divisions, wood, music) and work on atmosphere would make it feel less brutal and more welcoming and comfortable.  Only real, but major issue, was there were a lot of pretty rough tourists staying there, one of whom at breakfast decided I was not being swift enough for their impatience and…",20
"The service provided by the hotel staff was impeccable. A fantastic, new room with a great view. Excellent location walking distance to many other hotels, casinos, and restaurants. Don’t let the hotel fool you, it might not have a casino but there is a casino right outside the lobby door. The only thing that kept this from being my favorite hotel of all time is the disgusting amounts of perfume they pump into the lobby. If I can taste your scent when I leave your hotel, that’s too much.",50
"Enjoyed the St Regis Suite with my kids.  This is my 2nd stay at St Regis, we were being taken care of by Heidi the assistant head butler and her colleague.  Warm welcome and yes, bespoke and flawless as they promised.  Love the suite, so spacious, as a parent with two little ones, it’s great to have a corner by yourself.  I was amazed at their unpacking service, the way the butler displayed my toiletries, nice spread out on a towel, making it at ease to get anything from the make-up bag.    They have prepared soft toys for my kids, plus freshly baked cookies for us when we were enjoying our last minute there while the butler packed our stuff for check-out.  The room service was set up nicely on the dining table.  The congee was a little bit salty, a little be too strong for the…",50
"Came to Macao for just one night, just to experience the ""Las Vegas of Asia"" The St. Regis is located right in the middle of the Cotai strip, so every famous hotel and every casino is in about 5-10 min walking distance.   Stayed in a beautiful suite on the 31st floor with great view over the whole city! Service and room was perfect, also room service at 2am was really fast!^^  Especially the breakfast was absolutely great! One of the best buffets in my life!   Would come again!",50
"We're just checking out of St. Regis after a 2 day stay.  This is our 71 night of the year at SPG/Marriott and 220th day in hotels this year.  A number of those nights in other luxury brands.  This was by far the best stay all year.  The check-in process was smooth.  They brought our little girl a monkey stuffed animal which is loved.  Being SPG Platinum we were upgraded to a metropolitan suite overlooking strip/Venetian hotel.  Room is beautifully done in classic luxury.  The bed was so comfortable we didn't want to leave the room.  We had breakfast at the Manor which was splendid.  It was a cut above any breakfast we've had on the trip.  The eggs Benedict, pastries, and coffee were on point.  The only minor complaint is it was a bit crowded so we had to wait a little bit each…",50
"Room is spacious. Front desk assigned a room with “Eiffel Tower”view. When they heard it’s my son’s birthday, arranged balloon decoration and birthday cake during turn down service, which made my boys extremely happy. Also gave puzzles and amenities (toiletries, bathrobe and stool)for kids. Butler service is good, I could enjoy a cup of cappuccino in my room sofa while waiting  for my kids to wake up and the boys can have a cup of warm milk before they sleep. All the services staff are friendly. Breakfast got good combination of both Chinese and western. They will also serve the food ( with nice plating) to your table so u do not have to wait at the egg station. Location is good. Easy access (if u do not get lost) to Wynn Palace for cable car ride and Venetian for Gandola ride.…",50
"From the moment you arrive , the staff is present to help you You really feel that all want to help At happy hour you must taste the gin tonic grapefruit Best ever Rooms are big and very nice The manor restaurant is absolutely worth the experience ",50
"Spend two nights in this first class hotel. Everything was just great, from my upgrade to Metropolitan suite, the awesome breakfast, the attentive staff in all departments, that’s the reason for all the guests complement to this hotel. If I may just have one suggestion: since there is no exec lounge (surprise!), the happy hour snacks that were served in the bar was kind of not to the standards of everything else. For 2 days, I was served the same popcorn, chips and fried chili-peanut (which is stale and had a funny smell). The Camembert cheese and Spanish ham is good (but not Asian clients favorites). Cater to the market 😐 ",50
"I was very pleased with my stay at the St Regis, Cotai Central. The location is perfectly centered on the busiest part of the strip and the accommodations were elegant, clean and welcoming. It was my first time visiting Macau and with inclement weather on the day I arrived, I was worried my stay would be as somber as the rain soaked, cloudy skies. Luckily, when we arrived, the staff was very prompt at serving us and provided us with excellent accommodations with a perfect view of the strip!  As soon as we entered our room, we were greeted with a large bowl of fresh fruits. The butler service as others have mentioned was fantastic. I was able to have my clothes ironed and shoes polished before my dining reservations later that evening.  They provided nightly turn down service and…",50
"I particularly like their butler service which I could request through whatsapp  Room nicely decored and upgraded, lovely space and view.   Nice bar on the ground floor with selection of drinks with one really nice spicy snacks like dried peppers cracks. ",50
"Thanks to Cassandra and the rest of the butler team who helped me sort out everything on the 2 day stay! From spa booking, birthday celebration, car pick up and restaurant reservation, I used the designated Whatsapp number to communicate with the butler team. Very convenient. Together with the passion, it proves they are the nicest butler team I have ever met!   Credit go to them!!!  Downside - the butlers great service was discounted by the cigarette smell in the room. A few changes of rooms finally get me a room with fresh air! I feel bad the efforts of the team is discounted by irresponsible hotel guests who smoked in non smoking room.  I’ll return next time!  Fireworks were great. They arranged a nice pick up for us at MO so that we can get to the ferry fast!",50
"We chose a relative small hotel to avoid the crowd. We like the hotel in general. It is very clean and well organized. The pool is great and the hotel is well connected to other Cotai hotels / sightseeing places on foot.   Service has been mixed though - we have reserved a junior suite as we are bringing baby and helper. While they already charged us, upon check in, they gave us a wrong room type... it took us a while to realize that, and imagine the hassle when we had to pack and move everything out that night... they did rectified the problem swiftly and arranged for a room just across the corridor (but it's no longer a king bedroom) and got a manager to supervise the whole move but it's a bit of a pain given we are travelling with a toddler and an infant. Having said that,…",40
"I had a wonderful experience with St. Regis Macau from the moment I received their pre-arrival email until I departed from the hotel after a 3-night stay. This is my first time experiencing the butler service and Heidi Han certainly delivered it perfectly. She took the initiative to double confirm my self-arranged restaurant reservation when she found out I had one. The Deluxe Twin bed room was really nice with the space and view. My friend and I spent some quality time in the room watching movies by using the TV Bluetooth system.  The concierge team, including Ryan, Mable, and Lily, helped me a lot during this trip, from showing me ways to my many destinations, to reserving restaurants and ad-hoc tickets.  A huge thank you to Danny Leong, Christian and the Housekeeping team for…",50
"Definitely a bit less flashy than some of the other well-known hotels, the St. Regis is still located in the heart of Macau's casino central. I definitely appreciated the room upgrade and with the fruit as a welcome gift in addition to the staff accommodating my early check-in. The room itself was extremely spacious and offered an unobstructed view of the Eiffel Tower in the evening. Taxis were easy to come by with a quick call to concierge and staff were friendly and pleasant. The breakfast buffet had a good mix of Eastern and Western cuisine as well. Overall a very nice stay for my recent business trip and would recommend to anyone looking for something a little more on the quiet side in Macau.",50
"We have been travel around and always choose St. Regis as our first choice, but after this time, we will change to other 5 stars brand hotel.  We are celebrating our anniversary and my birthday, so about few days ago, we have already booked a room through Trip.com and sent an email to St.Regis to double confirm everything, cause this time of staying means a lot to me and my fiancé.  Unfortunately we didn’t have a good time of staying here.  First, we bring our own cake and asked for serve at 10pm, but we came back earlier so we called and ask for serve at 9:30.  When the staff bring the cake to us, it’s not what we think the way to “serve”.  He bring me the cake with whole packing, no plates, no forks, not even light up candle for us.   We have been to many other 5 stars brand…",10
"We arrived in Macao with no hotel reservations. It was a last minute, spur of the moment trip. We thought that Macao with its numerous hotels, finding a hotel room would not be a problem. To our dismay, we arrived on a very busy weekend and found no available rooms at other hotels. We were panicking, got on several cabs going from one hotel to the next and got very tired and annoyed and irritated at other hotels who brushed us off after finding out that we had no reservations and just said they can put us on a waitlist because they're unsure about inventory! Either they're all incompetent or they were too busy/rude to help us out. Our phones were juiced out at this point with zero battery so we couldn't check online hotel availability ourselves. We were not even picky with room…",50
"We had an excellent stay here. Everything from service to facilities were top notch. The hotel is connected to some of the best resorts in Macau. We took wrong shuttle bus from ferry terminal to the hotel. Apparently there are 2 Sands Macau (from what I understand). Actually the hotel already sent me some directions few days prior, but I did not notice the incoming email.  Special thanks to Concierge team who was ready to assist me booking my ferry ticket at 2 am in the morning and even arranging my schedule. Kudos!",50
"Our stay at St Regis Macao is wonderful! Days before check-in, butler Joseph emailed us asking if we had requests. Always a nice touch from any hotel! And we appreciate that our requests are perfectly made! Upon check-in, we were gracefully served by Ceci and Elaine, who explained us everything and also worked some magic! The platinum upgrade is amazing! Thank you Elaine for your special arrangement. Thank you GM Mr. Bakshi & assistant butler Heidi Hu for writing us personal notes and thank you for all the special amenity! The St. Regis Bar is a must! The platinum happy hour is absolutely stellar and the service is INCREDIBLE! Thank you Annie, Renee, Francis, Aaron, Mike & Kim! The staff is always courteous and friendly, and the whole experience is wonderful! We would definitely…",50
"Been to Macau 4 times, worst hotel here so far.  Rooms are tiny, expensive (can be near $1000 AUD per night for a standard room) and you have to wait for breakfast (now 2nd morning in a row I’ve had to wait for over 10 minutes for buffet breakfast!), cockroach in my room (not a huge deal but annoying on top of everything else). The staff/people are amazing though, very friendly and they do want to help but the actual hotel/infrastructure isn’t great. I’m in a St Regis suite. Try Sheraton (better value as only level 4 SPG compared to level 6) or Wynn or Banyan Tree (amazing!!!)  Have fun! ",20
I had a wonderful experience in St.Regis for celebrating my boyfriend birthday. St. Regis prepared a birthday cake for us. It so warm and nice! All of the services were high standard. The team are professional and helpful. Highly recommend this hotel! Good!,50
"The personal touch of this hotel is beyond words. We have traveled all over the world and have stayed in every kind of hotel. On this trip alone we have stayed in a jw, shangri la, ritz and a courtyard. By far and away the St. Regis service was beyond anywhere else we have stayed.   David, the front desk manager was fantastic and made sure any needs we had were taken care of. Make sure to ask the desk ahead of time where to eat as he grew up in Macau and knows where to go.   Our bellman Ely was so attentive and made our kids feel like they were VIP’s. We would recommend this place to anyone.   The hotel is connected to all the other hotels in the area by skywalks which makes exploring easy. ",50
The butler team is just amazing. They make your trip a superb and memorable one. Thanks Angela & Raymond for a lovely conversation and hospitality. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for work trip or even for leisure.,50
I brought my 2 kids for a 2 night stay to celebrate my birthday and loved the butler service service. Our 1st butler Martin was particularly amazing and arranged a birthday celebration with 2 more guys and guitar. Loved that my kids can get their evening cold milk delivered for free by the butler. The big disappointment was that my non smoking room reeked of cigarette stench. Even with an air cleaner it still smelled. To top it off even one of our towels reeked of cigarettes. ,40
"Loved loved loved my stay at the St Regis Macao! I have travelled the globe and stayed in 5 star hotels but St Regis exceeded my expectations. It was in a perfect location and the service was truly exceptional. The butler team was excellent and they went above and beyond to ensure a great stay for me and my friends. We got a room upgrade and had a fantastic view. The complimentary 24/7 coffee and tea service was an added bonus. From My birthday surprise, the balloons, birthday cakes.... there is no other address indeed like the St. Regis!",50
"Last month, in celebration of my 10th year wedding anniversary. We chose to stay at St Regis. I highly recommend the hotel to have a little me and couple time. I usually try to avoid big family hotels when I visit Macao.   First off, the breakfast was excellent. Super yummy. Then there is the bar that is good for wine tasting and snacks The team throughout the hotel was very accommodating.   As a nursing mom, they had all the essentials. Sterilizer, freezer, very experienced in handling things. I find the butler service helpful in situations and the occasional one-off requests.  Lastly, what made it incredible is the way in which they handled security. As I was checking out, a fellow guest picked up my phone asking for compensation. There could have been a misunderstanding…",50
"Truly beyond expectation. Each staff member showed genuine desire to make my stay special. From the bell staff, front desk, reception, management, pool staff, restaurant (both breakfast as well as The Bar), and Butler service - everything was perfect. There is a consistency of service that I have not experienced before.  Special thanks to the eButler service. They were very responsive and booked 5 different appointments for me during my stay from restaurants to a table at The Bar.   Thank you for a wonderful stay!",50
"St Regis is next to Sheraton which is a mega hotel full of people, within the same complex , I would strongly recommend to stay in st Regis which is also a spg hotel. The check in will be faster and it’s quieter. I also went to the gym where they have good facilities and an area to do your own exercise. Next to the gym, there’s a sauna and steam area that’s pretty good. The only suggestion I have for the gym is to have more dumb bells. The gym can be access for 24 hours where they have the staff until 10pm.  The breakfast offers good choice of local and western food. House wine in the bar is also nice with reasonable price. I just don’t like the dinner. I think they can do better. I always like the shower soap from st Regis.  Overall, Great service and value for money.  ",40
The place is very convenient and all the freebies and facilities are excellent. Special mention to Eurika who is working in the bar for being so friendly and accomodating.  Relaxing place. Very Good view. ,50
"I have stayed in all the best 5 stars hotels in Macau, with the exception St Regis, until now! The St Regis service level and the very high standard quality of their hotel rooms & bathroom totally held up to my expectation! I stayed in 2 St Regis prior; both in Indonesia and that’s the reason why I ventured to try this one in Macau! St Regis Macau totally held up to my expectation!!! Moreover St Regis is perfectly location, right in the centre to all action! Now I have another preferred hotel in Macau, besides Wynn Palace, that I would definitely go back to!",50
"This hotel , from the first day it’s open it’s simply remarkable.  I’ve been here several times already and no matter what other hotel coming up in the future, St Regis Macau is just the best hotel I’ve aber been stayed in .   They can read your wishes they know what you need ..... just come and make your own experience.   The Paradise in Macau , there is simply no better place. ",50
"One of the best hotel I have stayed in Macao , everything is perfect , I stayed in the metropolitan suite during my visit and I recorded a tour of the room during my stay . You guys can just search it on YouTube “ St Regis Metropolitan suite 15/7/18” and have a look of how it looks like . Nevertheless, I will definitely be back again soon ",50
"The St. Regis Macau is the best St. Regis property that I have stayed at so far. The hotel is luxurious and rooms are spacious. I did receive an upgrade to a Cotai View Deluxe Room and had a view of the Parisian Hotel which was amazing, especially at night. The pool area is beautiful although one of the pools were under maintenance. Also, one of the locks on the men’s bathroom was broken during my visit. The St. Regis Athletic club adjacent to the pool is also a fine place to relax after a day of site seeing, the steam room sauna areas were very clean and well kept.   Breakfast at the Manor restaurant exceeded my expectations with a wide variety of hot and cold items including an egg station and a noodle station as well.

"On my last visit to Macau i dined at this hotel and decided that i would stay at the St Regis when next in Macau. Visited there in June 2018 for my mothers 80th birthday. What a great decision it was. form the time the staff met us at the ferry terminal unto we departed we were treated to fantastic service in awesomely appointed rooms and public areas and what i could only describe as the best service i have ever experienced at a hotel.  From the check in and check out experience, to all the other staff and fabulously awesome butler team the staff went above and beyond what you would have expected. Our every wish and desire was catered for in an expeditious, friendly and totally professional manner.  The 2 suites assigned to us 1 for my parents and 1 for me were stunning, and…",50
"The property is lovely but the staff outshine.  I’m not sure I’ve ever had such personal service before but I appreciated every second.  Though we only stayed one night, the hostess at breakfast greeted me by name and knew my room number though we hadn’t dined there yet.  The checkin process is thorough, the butler service terrifically useful (laundry, pool cabana reservations, taxi arrangements, timing suggestions on when to arrive for shows, delivering toys for my 9 year old in the suite without me asking, spreading balloons about the room once they learned about my son’s college acceptance).  While you definitely pay for some privileges (for instance - for the price of the express laundry you might just be able to go buy those clothes new), so much is offered gratis - smiles,…",50
"There's nothing quite like St Regis hospitality. Even before checking in,I corresponded with the staff regarding dining reservations (within St Regis) and transportation options. They responded promptly via email and answered all of my inquiries. Even then,I was already impressed. We celebrated our 1st wedding anniversary at St Regis. Upon entering our room,we were pleasantly surprised by the balloons on the bed and the romantic view of the Parisian's mini eiffel tower. On the eve of our anniversary,we returned home (for that's what I want to call it) to find complimentary cake and tea waiting for us. During our stay,our room was always immaculately clean each time we returned from the shops or the casino. St Regis Macau has an excellent butler team. The staff anticipated our…",50
"My second time visiting Macau and this time I stayed for a night... and it was the best decision ever! St. Regis was of course the reason behind our perfect weekend getaway. I cannot find fault of how amazing our stay was. Every single staff we encountered were very courteous and kind. I cannot name them all but let me start with a few notable ones that made our stay experience one of the best ones we’ve had. Raymond Harold (Manager, Private Dining), Roy Padilla from the pool, Raymond Wong (asst. chief concierge), Ryan our Butler and the very friendly Aris Azhar leading the team. Thank you once again! ",50
"Aris and Blair made it an amazing experience for my wife and kids. They constantly ensured our happiness and provided the kids and family with the extras that were very much appreciated.  We thoroughly loved the care and the luxurious service and rooms that they provided us.    If there was any room for improvement, I would say it is the spa.  I would say for the money I paid - it was way below average.  Everything rocks here except the Spa.  Thanks St Regis, if we come back to Macao we are staying with you again.",50
"I was blessed with a trip to Macao and a week-long stay at the St. Regis. OMG! It's one thing to read about a hotel and see its' five-star rating. It's another for that hotel to exceed every expectation. From the beautiful, lively location to the extraordinary hotel staff, this was a once and a life-time experience for me. The hospitality was superb. The Butler service was outstanding. They went above and beyond to accommodate my every need, as well as those I may not have imagined. Blair, Sam and Felix were absolutely the best. The living quarters were extremely cozy and elegant. The food, particularly the breakfast buffet, was excellent. Raymond was there at every turn at breakfast. If you are planning a trip to Macau, the St. Regis is a MUST stay. The amenities are great but…",50

Concierge team managed to help us change the return ferry so we don't have to pay extra. Reception team got us the same room we stayed last time. Butler team made sure our room was well decorated! No details is too small and no effort is too minimal. Special shout out to Blair, Lisa and Anne who took great care of us.  Breakfast time was BUSY! The queue was long, we have reserved a table and it's not immediately available. But we understand it's peak day, it is what it is. Perhaps it's time to add another F&B outlet or even a club lounge to alleviate the demand?  For the pool, it's a bit of let down. Albeit the…",50
"This place is located in the “new town” if you are looking for great food it’s better for you to stay at the opposite side of the river. Overall experience with this resort is great, especially with the nice hotel staff, but he casino security is simply horrible. They racial profiles and it just brings bad images to the hotel, and they should have to casino staff to the same standard as the hotel.  As for the local food choice, you need to be very cautious with the local taxi driver as they will always trick you to go for the longer route (across the bridge). When we asked the hotel staff about the local good dinning area and they gave us a name and tell us to just grab a taxi and it ends up the taxi driver lied to us that it’s not opened and suggest us to go across the bridge…",40

Bathroom and toilet amenties very nice, especially amenties for kids, it was surprisingly my kids when the buttler came to our room and put it in the bathroom my kids very happy to looked that, and said will stay for next time. Check in very warm and personalized, very professional. We got an eraly check in at about 2pm.Swimming pool are small and only can be used when we were there. We got 8 botle of water a day.

"This review is quite frankly is written with the intention to single out a particular manager in St Regis. Mr. Aris who along this 2 years of serving me has been humble and very service oriented.  Over the course of staying in St Regis (since the opening), I have come to reply on Mr. Aris and his service team for all of my visits to Macau. From airport transfer to assigning rooms for my guest coloured or not, Mr. Aris always delivers.  Being an ambassador with SPG for the past 5 years accorded me with some extra privileges, room upgrades are always welcomed but not a guarantee. However, Mr. Aris tries to get me the room upgrade whenever I stay with St Regis Macau. Upon check in, my preference are evidently noted and prepared in advance. Water by the bedside, coffee once…",50

Thanks to Mr. Aris Azhar (Operation Manager), he arrange a very nice room for us to celebrate my husband birthday. He is a very nice, responsible and friendly guy. We are happy to stay with St. Regis Macau.During my 1st time staying with St. Regis is around 2 years ago, but Mr. Aris still can remember all my request.

"WARNING: If you are ASIAN or COLORED people, you would be treated differently in this hotel. I have never been treated this bad in a five star luxury hotel in my entire life.   My white Australian friend and I (Asian) recently stayed at the St Regis Macau for one night during our trip around Macau and China. I am a SPG Gold member. When we checked out, the front desk staff asked about our stay, I said we were happy, except we did not get upgraded to an enhanced room, which is a STANDARD benefit for Gold member. We booked a Cotai view room, and we did not even get the view from our bed. All we could see was another hotel, we had to stand by the window in order to see the Cotai view. I believed we had been downgraded.   The staff apologized and told her Room Operations Manager,…",10
"The check-in went fine, with a small hiccup for the baggages being sent to the room, which was quickly corrected after I point out the delay. The overall decor I would classify as luxurious but a bit generic, I think the feel of the hotel in terms of the hallways and room allocations felt kind of like the Venetian.  Other St. Regis' that I've stayed at previously (e.g. Osaka, Chengdu) had really a unique feel, this one a bit less so. The staff is multi-cultural, although I am not sure that is an advantage.  It felt a little bit like if you ask something from someone, they would take you to the other person who is in charge of that task and re-explain to them.",40
"Grade A, first-class experience.  As a loyal SPG member I didn't expect anything less, but the staff at the St Regis really did impress.  Every detail is important to them, and they take every opportunity to show you why the St Regis is probably the best hotel in all of Macao.  The restaurant has phenomenal food, a great wine selection, and the daily breakfast was an amazing blend of eastern and western-style food.  If and when I go back, there won't be any question where I'm staying - the St Regis is top notch.",50

Thanks for Renee Wu, Aaron Lo, Nett, Annie Rao, Roy & Kim. Thanks for the services. Like The Manor, They know we got 2 kids and they are noise. To avoid they to disturb another Guests they put us in the small room. They are very thoughtful. Thanks for Nanny Nie & her teams. Last and not least, Thanks for Butler team & Concierge Team.

One of the best hotels in Macao the st Regis Macao is a great hotel from conceirge to swimming pool from food to room everything is just amazing the staff is also cooperative . The staff showed us everything around Macao too amazing hotel loved my stay here  ,50
"From check in to spa, all the staff were extremely professional and friendly - the rooms were very nicely appointed (though I understand all the hotels at this Cotai Sands development look and feel the same, therefore hotel operators have relatively little say in room modifications/decorations compared to normal situations), and the breakfast spread at the Manor was very well done and of high quality (though there was a wait at even 10am - perhaps something mgmt should look to address). Spa massage was excellent, however the wet facilities (located on the 8/F instead of the Spa level of 38/F) remains to be desired - small given the size of the property and just seems not luxurious enough (I only state this given it's a St. Regis, the top brand of the SPG/Marriott Group of…",50

Rooms are as you would expect, luxuriously appointed in great condition.  Look forward to my next stay.",50

"This is a late review Macao was an overnight trip during our honeymoon to Hong Kong and Japan in 2/2018. My husband and I celebrated Valentine's day in Macao and am glad we made the choice to stay at St. Regis.  The hotel group offers free shuttle buses connecting the Cotai Ferry Pier to strip. Board the Holiday Inn bus and get off at Holiday Inn, as there is no direct stop at St. Regis. If you went to Sheraton, then you have missed your stop. The bus does make overhead announcements but it can get loud when packed with tourists.  We arrived early and the lobby was quite empty. We were seated and offered tea during check-in.  The lobby is open, airy, with modernistic decoration. It was a nice reprise after travelling in the noisy Cotai ferry.  With our SPG tier, we were upgraded…",50

Note that you would have book your ferry tickets beforehand before you can approach the ferry counter at the airport to transfer your luggages to the ferry.   Upon arrival at the Macau, we took a shuttle bus under the Sands Cotai branding to arrive at Holiday Inn hotel. St Regis is just beside Holiday Inn hotel so you just need to walk through the holiday inn lobby to get to St Regis lobby.  Checkin was prompt. Overall service was great! I celebrated my birthday in the room where a grp of hotel staff brought a cake to my room upon my friend’s request.

"Wonderful property overall.   Great staffs here, special thanks goes out to Frank Lo for being especially gracious as my butler on my first day. Although it is one of the largest SR, it still manages to retain the warmth and cosines of the smaller properties. Rooms and staffs were all very warm hearted and unreserved in offering assistance. Location of hotel was very central, and well connected to the entire Cotai Strip.   Will definitely be back soon - whenever I am in town. ",50
"First time to stayed in St Regis, very impressed by their butler service. Very well down and warm services.  I stayed there with my partner for a short weekend staycation, very nice decoration for our couple stay.   Would definitely put St Regis brand as one of my favorite brand collection for next time travelling.",50

From them having my room ready for an early checkin and having all my materials prepared when i arrived, to check out time...I told them the time I would expect to leave and they also had everything ready for me and referenced me by name. The room was enormous and they brought fruit for me, as well as the butler service bringing me tea when I requested...no detail was too big or too small.",50

And we meet our butler in lobby, who is friendly and considerate, that's what St Regis is famous for, right?  So we got upgrade to the suite, thanks for the platinum membership the suite is spacious and neat, which is so comfy. And I always love the bathroom with the tub, this one is impressive, which is big enough for two person and even put a bottle around the corner! Speaking of it, as it's winter season, we just went down to the little jacuzzi, which is small but nice.   And the one thing that really let me down is the Happy hour in the Regis bar, there's just a few bite and very limited choice of drinks. If you compare this to other St Regis, this maybe the most…",40

We got there on a rainy day so we spent a whole day indoor, using the gym with indoor jacuzzi, shopping, having high tea. There're plenty to do without leaving the resort area, including a kid's park if you're there with children.  The room is spacious, clean and has the best view of Cotai strip. The service is exceptional, as always. Service we received from the ebutlers, butlers, checkin, concierge and restaurants maintain the finest quality.  Welcome drink was included in our package.

"I spent one night in St. Regis on May 3-4, and was lucky enough to get upgraded to Metropolitan suite (also a corner room). Front desk took me to my room to complete the full check in process. The view from the room was absolutely amazing, both day and night - full view of Venetian from one side, and Eiffel Tower on the other side. (The only down side was that I traveled myself and did not have someone to share the capacious room. Haha)  The Butler service was also fabulous. They were able to complete pretty much all my requests in a short period of time (from basic water delivery to stationary). This really surprised me.  I also hosted a meeting here and their refreshments were fabulous - truffle dumplings, gold foil shrimp dumplings, mushroom bun, etc. Very innovative and…",50
"Check-in: The checkin was personalized and attentive as usual per St. Regis traditions.  They took time to explain benefits of your status and the room you'll be in.  The english level for these check-in agents are amazing!  Room: The room was well appointed and large around 800 square feet!  The bathroom was large with a standup shower and a tub inside.  The design of the room was a bit dated, however the room feel relatively new given the size of traffic that goes through Macau every year.   Since we had a child, the butler was very proactive about providing amenities for toddlers, which I have never experience in any other hotels, our daughter had her own showering kit with lotions and stuff.  We loved it!  Location:  The location of the hotel is located as part of a 5 hotel…",40
High standard high end brand of this hotel group. Check in took time... Haha. Room is average. The restaurant manor was good. I like the bloody Mary cocktail here. Many things should be improved. A bit disappointed ,30
Perfect. I would only use this word to describe our experience. They were very accommodating to our request as we have senior with us. Butler has shown us to the room and indicate the details to us. Rooms are big and nice with good isolation of sound. The bed is super comfie! Good facility with nice pool and gym room. Definitely would like to book and enjoy the room again. ,50
"They just know how to get it right!  A beautiful property located across the road from the City of Dreams and an oasis of tranquility in what can be a fairly crazy environment. The casino's and entertainment is not in your face but everything is close by if needed.  Breakfast is wonderful and the St Regis bar is a great place to relax and have a drink.  The team from arrival to Sam, the butler, were awesome and check in and check out were smooth and painless.  The way travel should be.  I highly recommend the St Regis Macau for a peaceful oasis of refinement and wonderful service.  I look forward to a return visit later in the year,",50

Our butler Mr. Frank is very kind and attentive, I would highlight it again later.   Room is spotless, of course, with decent size, nice bathroom and heaven beds. Housekeeping is amazing, always so attentive and great turndown service.

They provided some fruits and cookies every evening time of a day, free wifi, cell phone with 4g for you when going out but we didn't use it, All staffs are friendly, polite and willing to help for any cases that you may need. Stayed & good sleep for 3 nights,  All meals we ate outside as our plan, just have chance to try breakfast on last day that feel regret a bit since it is so nice&delicious. I would certainly recommend this hotel.",50
I went up to Macau for 1 night I had spare between business meetings to watch the show «  the house of dancing water «  the show was a must see spectacle. I stayed at the St Regis as I do wherever possible as the service is impeccable with very friendly staff . The facilities were great and I had a quick morning swim and hot tub before heading off,50
"Without a doubt, it is one of the finest hotels you will find around. The room, which they had actually upgraded, offered spectacular views of the Parisian and the Eiffel Tower. The rooms are spacious and stylish, just like the entire hotel. The campus also houses other hotels, a mall, Casino and Banquet Halls. We had a special request for Food, in terms of being a Vegetarian, and while there were some options available for us, the hotel went out of their way and custom made our dinner, really late at night!",50
Great Bar and Cocktails with incredibly friendly staff.. The room is very comfortable and we were lucky enough to receive a free upgrade. In house dining is also excellent. Look forward to staying at St Regis again.,50

One of the very best hotels in Macao where you are not surrounded by Chinese gamblers. Excellent rooms and services. Don’t miss the Happy Hour in the Bar. Amazing bathrooms with private TVs. Felt very comfortable in absolute luxury. ,50
"I was pretty amazed by the service in St. Regis Macau, the staffs are polite and very helpful. Room was excellent and finest elegant decorated. Few things they might can improve and it will make this property better : 1. Large space in Gym but only 1 shower room and 1 make-up area  for women side, it doesn't quite make sense, maybe they can consider re-arrange the shower room for gym. 2. Maybe consider add washlet on toilet for guest room.",40
"We stayed for one night in March 2018 and had a short but pleasant stay. The service from the moment we arrived was fantastic - there was no shortage of staff to greet you and ask if there was anything they could help with. Check in was great, and we received some nice recommendations. The room was spacious and nice, though it smelled as if it had formerly been a smoking room, which was a bit off-putting. It's nice that the hotel is connected directly to a casino, and we found the location to be great on the Cotai strip. Overall, it was a great stay.",40

Thanks for the front desk staffs Chris and Meggie, who enthusiastically to upgrade the room for us. Thanks for Samuel, Dragon and Allen Lei from butler team, they gave me a lot of advice to decoration my room, and sang the birthday song to my friend!

Staying at the St. Regis was a perfect home-base while in Macau.  The service is some of the best i have seen around the world.  The location to Venitian and MGM is very easy and walkable.  Francais is one top bartender and knows his stuff.    We will be back!,50
"Great BOSE speakers to enjoy.  Bathroom TV produce a fantastic sound system.  Enjoyed the electronic curtains and shade.  Didn't enjoy their Seersucker Robe, prefer the Velour Robe (which not avaialble I think).  Generous to provide babies & kids amenities.    Very touching message from the Butler Peter.  As a spg member, they have prepared two St Regis bears for my kids, even they are not with me in this stay. Enjoyed my flats & converse being polished.    Surprised for the online check-in/ out with the spg app!  It's fun and engaging for the whole experience.

"I booked a suite with my wife to celebrate her birthday on 29-March.  The good part about my stay is that butler service there was amazing especially a girl named Elaine who serves us very well.  If it wasn't for her service, my rating for this property would be terrible and not poor!  They offered a butler doll to my wife as a birthday gift and also some baby toys to my soon-to be born baby.  Coffee and tea are free during the stay and the deliver time is always within 10 minutes which is good. The bad part which caused them such low rating are the other departments beside butler team.

Service was superb throughout the hotel -- at reception, concierge, restaurant, etc.  Staff was friendly and efficient, and followed up promptly (every time, a first!).  Bravo!  - Concierge/butler pre-arrival - The butler service set the tone; they immediately responded to various email requests for help with restaurants, shows and tour bookings.  After initial contact, they continued to follow up and then execute. - The rooms - well decorated, comfortable beds, quality linens, great shower pressure in the bath, great black out shades, nice sitting area plus desk. - Check-in - It was nice to be able to sit at a desk and check-in in a relaxed setting, rather than waiting in long lines like at the Venetian -…",50
"I was in Macau for 2 days and stayed at St. Regis on Cotai Strip for one night. Previously I had stayed at St. Regis in Shenzhen (which was disappointing...) - but St. Regis Macao exceeded my expectations! Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a more luxury, comfortable, quiet hotel located conveniently on the strip.   I rarely write reviews but the service was really great - from check-in, to the butler service (and the butler was so kind), to the staff at the bar and at the restaurant. The room was spacious with a good view, and also clean, modern and nice.   There are many so-called ""luxury hotels"" that don't live up to their name, but St. Regis Macao really delivered. Thanks!",50
"I think this is the third time spending a birthday celebration of members in my family at this prestige hotel and every time they do have something different to surprise us! This time it was the Butler team who came to surprise us and sang the birthday song in my room. What a wonderful celebration we had. And the upgrade to suite was fantastic too thanks to the SPG platinum benefit! Evening cocktail and breakfast was great too we simply wish to stay longer at this hotel. Housekeeping also really pay attention to detail, Room was so clean and all room facility was in perfect order. This time We ran into a few hotel staff at front desk, restaurant, housekeeping and they all provided exceptional service such as Lively if I spell the name correctly. Thank you for making us feel…",50
"It’s our 3rd time staying at the St Regis Macao and again we were upgraded to a suite for our anniversary.  This time, they have wowed us with a st Regis bear as a gift and ensured us with the personal butler service. Really Impressed!!!  As usual, staff were all friendly especially butler - Sam.   Classic tea set at the St. Regis Bar and breakfast at the Manor were as great as before.   Definitely we’ll be back for a future visit to Macao as it is now like home to us!!!  Keep up the good job!!!",50
"My partner and I stayed for 1 night to celebrate our anniversary last week. From the moment we arrived we knew we were in for a great stay. Every and I mean every member of the team was incredibly friendly and always had smiles on their faces. We were made to feel right at home and everyone went out of their way to ensure we had a memorable stay. We booked the 'Stay Exquisite' package which is incredible value and a must try. The team simply understand service and how to deliver it with passion and pride.

"We are regular St Regis visitors around the globe and one year away from lifetime platinum spg status, and could not be more surprised at how much we love this hotel and the staff here. We are still here, and only here for a few short days, but already planning our next trip. We had a quick stop, and belated anniversary celebration here for only two nights and had asked several times for a platinum suite upgrade, and were blown away with how nicely it was romantically decorated for us with rose petals, helium balloons and sweet treats everywhere. We also went to happy hour last night where they treated us to a special anniversary cake and cocktails, and have been recognized by name all over the hotel. Our concierge staff, including Arvin and Lilly, helped us book show tickets,…",50
"This was my third trip to Macau and the St. Regis Macau is always my one and only choice. As most hotels in Macau emphasize in casinos, this hidden gem is my Insider go-to place being pampered by A++ service from their signature St. Regis butler service. Led by an extremely professional, capable and passionate leader Jon Yau, this is nothing of your ordinary experience. Upon arriving at the hotel, someone will rush up to take your luggage and cover the top of your limousine sharp edges so that you don't bump your head. This same person then will follow you all the way up to the lobby for check in, and then all the way up to your room to personally make sure your luggage has safely landed on the luggage rack in your room. You don't get this anywhere else in Macau. The check in is…",50
"Excellent Services!!! All my needs were properly taken care during check-in, private butler escorted me to my room explaining the facilities in my room and the hotel, and the room was perfect in terms of hygiene, size, comfort. Staffs were polite, helpful and very friendly. Checking out was easy and great; the shuttle service to the ferry pier was on time and safe. Would definitely go back again for my next trip to Macao.",50
"Thank you for the most wonderful stay in Macao. Excellent service with warm and charming smiles, most importantly, you could feel the hospitality from personality. I would definitely suggest to stay with St. Regis Macao!",50
Honestly one of the best hotels I’ve been everyone is very helpful and friendly. Especially their butler service. We met Felix the butler who was extremely helpful and didn’t leave us till we checked in to the ferry ,50
"Friend contacted concierge few days before our trip and they did a great job providing us with all the required information. We also managed to book tickets with good seats for the House of Dancing Water through them on the day of the show. They provided a portable wifi device which we can bring out and could use it to call our friends as well. It was great! They also provided some fruits upon our check in and some Madeleines on the next day.  The hotel is just opposite the city of Dreams where we watched the House of Dancing water and walking distance to most attractions. They also offer free ironing service, 2 pieces each guest per day. Overall very good service and great value for money.",50
"I traveled with my family in Macao,  and have stayed in the St Regis for two nights.  To be honest,  this is definitely a  memorable living experience to stay in St Regis.  Since we arrived at the St Regis, all the staff we've met in the hotel, were all showed full courtesy welcome to my family and we got a Butler, Frank,  who escorted us to the room and did the detailed introduction of the room and some attractions of Macau. His kindness and consideration made my parents felt like at home. As well as the other butlers and staff all provided us a warm greeting during our stay in the hotel.  My parents were so enjoyable with this trip, and St. Regis stands most of parts.  Thank you souch for all of your efforts. ",50
"Me and my friends has stayed in St. Regis Macau for only 1-night from Feb7-8. It was frustrating because we should have stayed longer in this wonderful hotel. Everything was beyond perfection! From the moment I have checked-in, up to my journey to the room with superb assistance of the bell team and the butler who have escorted me. It was fantastic! No words can explain such a wonderful experience that I have never encountered to some other 5-star hotels anywhere! Room was bigger than any. It was really clean and spotless. Amenities are great. Food at the Manor was delicious. Location was excellent. I was given a room on the 32nd floor facing the Parisian. Mostly, I have so appreciated the service of the entire team. I really wanted to commend those people who have checked me…",50
"There is excellent service, and then there is St. Regis. I never knew that such a level of customer service excellence is possible until I stayed in St. Regis Macao. I was down with the flu and fever for the whole duration of my stay and everyone in the hotel went above and beyond to help me feel home and really well taken care of. They were doing literally all they could to help me feel better - warm tea in my room anytime I needed, filling the bath for me, calling a doctor, sending a butler with me to the hospital, sending food in my room from the main restaurant. I never felt such a warm and really personal and caring attitude from the staff in any hotel. And here I want to mention Frank, who by the circumstances of having to spend 3 hours accompanying me to the hospital…",50
It was a bit underwhelming. It seemed it had opened in a hurry and the hotel facade and foyer is nothing to write home about. Rooms are nice and large but not exceptional like some of the suite rooms in nearby hotels. Location is good and central but thats not saying much. I was expecting more from the st regis.,40
"This must be one of the best hotels in Macau.   We were picked up at the ferry terminal and quickly taken to the hotel. Check in occured in the room and the staff had kindly written us hand written welcome letters and given us some lovely complimentary cake.   The location on the strip is perfect and the hotel is connected to a shopping centre.  Breakfast was delicious each morning.   The gym and pool were great to use.  Overall, the room was perfect and very comfortable. The butler service was amazing and the staff in general were very professional.  If we return to Macau, we will certainly return here. ",50
One of the luxurious hotel of Macau.Centrally located at Cotai central.Opposite of City of dreams.All the staff were friendly.This is one of my favourite St Regis.I would love to visit again.Private dining food was also delicious.5 star hotel.,50
"Haven’t been travel for sometime , our first  stop is Macau . I picked St. Regis cause I had very memorable experience with this brand in Shanghai.    We arrived in the evening as expected butler showed us to our upgraded room  on the 30th floor which facing Cotai Strip . Lovely specious room we love it.    So enjoyable we can have coffee or tea  serve to our room anytime we like to and is inclusive.     Next morning I needed my shirt urgently  pressed . Within 30 mins it came back though not perfectly pressed but I really appreciate the team effort.     Food- the danish and croissants are very good and fresh. Can’t remember when I have such lovely danish in Sydney.     St. Regis - my wife, daughter and myself  love stay at again and again.     ",50
"Arrived in the morning at the Hotel and was accommodated with an early check - in.  The Hotel was discreetly tucked away at the northern end of the massive Sands Cotai Complex.   The entrance to the Casino is well hidden from the lobby.  I have stayed in 3 St Regis Properties in 2017 and I must say the St Regis Butler's service at Macau is the best, from checking in to checking out.",50
"We have chosen St Regis Macau to celebrate my hubby's birthday this year.  The receptionist, Florence and the butler team have prepared a wonderful birthday experience for my hubby. Florence greeted me with warm smile and make me feel welcome. Marco, our butler, show us the way to our room and proactively introduce in room facilities. This is not what I experienced in St Regis Singapore 2 years ago  Once again, we have comfortable bed for our great sleep to relax last night. Definitely will be back again!",50
"This is the second time I check in to this hotel , the regular room is still big space like last time , the room provide handy phone that can make free international calls for few country and local phone too ; blue and yellow combination Interior design make my eyes are very comfortable ; dine table , chairs and mini sofa give me a corner to drink coffee and proper place for eating ; clean and good smell are always best choice hotel condition to return . ",50
St Regis Macau is an amazing hotel. The butler service is awesome. they are very kind and easy going. The inroom dining is very good. The bed is the best i ever slept in. All the staf is friendly and like to help you.,50
"Top of the class experience from check-in, F&B, room assignment, view of the room and service level! Thank you everyone who contributed to make my stay a pleasant and memorable one! We have been assigned a room with a decent view of Parisian, a room which was spotless clean, and classy. A nice TV as well which you can mirror your mobile device.  The high standard of F&B is another spotlight of the hotel, we visited the Bar for afternoon tea and also a drink at night, i think it's hard to find a competitor in Macau, top class food and service, also an amazing singer with great selection of songs, not to mention about the joyful experience of song ordering session. May I give a credit here to one of the best waitress I've ever met, Renee. Hope I get your name correctly since I…",50
From the moment we got to the hotel nothing was too much trouble for the staff.  They should be justifiable proud of the service they deliver as they often went above and beyond to help us make the most of our visit to Macao. As per most of the top end hotels the staff took particular efforts to remember our names and preferences  The food in the hotel was amazing and the breakfast excellent with a good selection of eastern and western fair including freshly squeezed juices. Although it was cool when we visited the pools are heated and were delightful for a quick dip after a long day of walking and shopping.  I would certainly recommend this hotel,50
"Helicoptered over to Macau w family for two nights - three days w family .. check in efficient butler service welcoming but this hotel not up to St Regus standards by any means..   Awkwardly tucked in a corner of a casino , many tiles in pool missing, and operator reception not attentive...  we spent most of our social time at Four Seasons...  they have work to do here  ",30
"I travelled to many luxury hotels around the world, privately-own and hotel chain, I have to say St. Regis Macau belongs to the top of the best 1%. The staff are very efficient, check in is done with a seat-desk instead of the normal standing counter. I don’t know how to explain but it does make you feel the service is way more personalized and approachable.   Our butler Ryen swiftly escorted us to our room and explain all the room details and amenity. The bedding is so plushy I suspect they are made from magnet, it just suck you in and never let go! Oh so comfortable! The butler service is so good we keep ordering coffee and tea and they always deliver with a smile! I’ve heard they can even help you pack and unpack, but we are only staying for few nights so we didn’t request…",50
"I travel a lot but I have to say that our experience at the St Regis was outstanding. It started with the extremely nice and personal check in (thx, Liu), we got an outstanding room with was showed to us by the fun and knowledgable st Regis butler (thx, Marvin) and continued with nice gym and spa staff  Everybody was genuinely interested in making our stay better. It was the best service experience I ever had in a SPG hotel - congrats!  We will definitely come back when we are the next time in Macau  ",50
"Truly Luxury Hotel Brand. Prefect hotel ,All in good condition Very good management for all hotel staff Special mention to Mabel ,Assistant Chief Concierge to take good care for our stay  Prepare a greeting card and cake arrangement. butler even fail for walk up call as requested ,however thanks June and Team to address the issue and personally apologize to us with gift .Very impress. Definitely will return. 👍🏻",50
The moment we stepped into the hotel we awe how luxury the interior of the hotel. Furthermore all the staff is very Helpful. During check in process Head of Butler gretted me and voila! within couple minutes my brief 2 days in Macau already set with reserved restaurant we wish to go to and all transport we need. Two thumbs up for the Butler team! They really taking care of the guess.  I believe their key of sucess is listening to guess needs and ability to pass information between team on duty. This is truly world class service.,50
"For what was being paid, this was a more-than-fantastic stay. Everything was incredibly well organized and was a great improvement over my previous stay.  I had well-appointed high-floor room overlooking the entire Cotai strip. The butler service was extremely attentive and quick. Everyone I met was very courteous and polite.   Location was central to all the main resorts, and was easy to get around with almost all the major buildings within a 15 minute walk.   Breakfast at The Manor was much improved over my last stay when the hotel just opened.   I will be back again for sure!",40
Went with family and the room (St Regis Suite) was beautiful. Breakfast was not as extensive but quality was good. Lunch at the Manor was superb in terms of food quality. Not everything was smooth but staff and managers try everything they could to improve your experience. The best thing is that we can sense that they do care about our overall experience being very positive.  Would definitely recommend.,50
"All the staff are friendly, helpful and professional from checking-in to checking-out. I was surprised that our suite was upgraded for free. The Empire Suite was huge, clean and elegant. The breakfast was delicious and the servers were nice and caring. For sure, I will recommend this hotel to my friends and relatives.",50
"We arrived at boxing day for a short stay. Our room was upgraded. The butler service was impeccable as we were well-served from check-in. Welcome drinks, restaurant booking was handled with care.   Room was very clean and spacious. Absolutely enjoyed our stay and will come back again!",50
"Prestigious , very good location, with the shopping mall around. Very clean,and comfortable, all facilities. Nice staffs, very help full. Fast check in and check out. even, the price quite expensive, but we were happy . ",50
"I had stayed in this hotel for several times. Umm, in fact if you had stayed in any St. Regis before, this hotel give you everything you experienced, the butler service, the good quality of food, the bedding are high quality as well. you will not feel regret after stepping in the hotel.",50
The St Regis cotai is a very nice hotel with excellent services...located in the same areas of other hotels and casinos complex in cotai central. So that it is very easy to access if you want to go to venetian mal or the parisian mal. Many free shuttle to go to sightseeibg places in macao. Love to come again and stay in St Regis hotel next time..,50
"The St. Regis is the latest addition to the Sands Cotai Central collection of hotels. Being a St. Regis expectations are naturally high for this hotel and they sure are met. The lobby of the hotel is elegantly grand with a beautiful symmetrical staircase leading from the G/F to the lobby on the 1/F. Check in was done at individual desks and guests are seated while waiting, which was indeed far more civilised than queuing in a line. Needless to say check-in was flawless. My stay was for business so only an entry-level room was taken. The room was decorated in line with the sophisticated-elegant theme of the hotel. It was not as big as I thought it would be, but there was a little corner of sofas on one side and a small working-cum-dining desk at the other corner, both…",50
"Everybody are nice and helpful. Wonderful room upgrade. The room is clean, elegrant and comfort. Tasty breakfast. Well prepared and responded to my needs. Prompt reply on email before check-in. The best hotel I ever stayed in Macau.",50
"I’m back with st regis macau for the second consecutive year, my ultimate choice for service oriented balanced with cosy decor/furnishings at a very fair price.  I have always preferred the st regis brand particularly because of the extra mile they go in providing service for the hotel guest. The st regis butlers (God bless them) will do your pressing, shine your shoes, bring you your coffee and assist you in reasonable sense to make your stay comfortable to the best of their abilities.  This is no mean feat, as having compared to other st regis (not mentioning which one) the response time for the Butler to get you what you want is industry best I kid you not!  I have previously written a positive review about st regis macau and I have never posted a second review before but on…",50
"The St. Regis Macao is a nice place, if you stay in Macao and do not really want to stay in one of the big places. But I have to admit the lobby and the style check-in is different and not so intimate like in Bangkok or KL. Of course the stuff is friendly and very attentive. We got a nice upgrade and the Butler tried to explain everything to us. The only thing I never get is - if you are Starwood Platinum and well experienced about hotels - you really know how the lights are working. So please take in your greeting workflow - ask the guest - if you already know - how things are working. That could save a lot of time.  Apart from that - we had a nice time. We went to the Astor Bar and the Gin Trolley Tasting I can really recommend - it is brilliant. Breakfast in the room was…",40
"Seamless experience! Even before arrival, the St Regis Butler contacted via email to enquire about preferences and estimated arrival time . On arrival, I was personally greeted and had a swift check-in. Exceptionally nice room over looking the Lagoon end of the Cotai Strip. I was charmed to receive a hand written note and fruit and night time sweets as an SPG member. Excellent turn down service and an express check out upon departure meant the stay went without a hitch. The rooms are large, spacious and tastefully attired. The pools were exceptionally well-maintained with heated water - only one open on this occasion - but no issue as no overcrowding problems. Lovely stay and look forward to returning soon!",50
"I have to say St Regis Macau surprise me with their exceptional service every time! Special thanks to George Huang for inviting us to the cocktail party. And John Lio, Echo Hu, Abe U, Heidi Han, Blair Gao from the butler team who helped me with number of questions regarding my stay, my family booking for Tomas and friends breakfast. And other team member who helped my daughters with painting kits, kids amenity etc. Overall extremely satisfied experience again! Well done!",50
"Haven't visit Macau for a while , new pier at cotai was impressive , its clean and only 5 mins by car to st Regis .  The room and bathroom are very spacious , I like hotel that is bright , with expanding view . Will be back . ",50
Hi，we really want to say a big thanks to your butler Victoria Lio ，she is helpful and professional. We asked so many questions and have lots of requests during our stay but she still show her patient. ,50
"Stayed at St Regis hotel, really deeply appreciated with their hotel's butler service. Especially thanks to Blair Ggo & Richard of the front desk, and Raymond Wong of Concierge Dept., for their warm hospitality and care. The butler team led by Mr. Ersipit Pelawi provide an excellent service to make our stay very comfortable, feel as home.",50
"Location: Centrally located - you can walk to the Four Seasons, Parisian Hotel and Venetian by foot. The first two hotels are interconnected by inner walkways so very easy. Rooms: beautiful, spacious and modern. All rooms have a separate living room and bedroom. Very high tech - they have a master light switch, USB ports etc. and good amenities (toothbrush, toothpaste etc.) . If you have a flexible budget the suites here are beautiful and many come with butler boxes - essentially this means they can put your dry cleaning for example in a box from the outside of your room and drop it off without having to enter your room!  Facilities: beautiful gym and spa is stunning - I highly recommend going if you have time Service: excellent - everyone was friendly and attentive in all…",50
"We spend a few days in Macau after a business trip in HongKong.  I choose the St. Regis to provide my wife with a nice surprise. Special experience the high level of service.  We were well received by the staff and also got a room upgrade as SPG platinum member.  The service is excellent in all means, the restaurant ‘The Manor’ quite nice for breakfast and dinner. There are many excellent option in Macau and also close the the St. Regis.  All in all very happy and high recommendation for the Macau St. Regis.",50
"We stayed 4 nights last week and were so impressed with both the hotel and the fantastic staff. From the friendly greetings in the entrance and courtyard to the excellent service in the cocktail bar from Eurika, you could not fault the staff. Eurika even remembered our names each day and what we had ordered the day before. Food in the bar and restaurant was delicious. Our room was spacious and very comfortable, with nice fittings and beautiful (big) bathroom. Even a butler provided! The reception staff were very helpful with information about local restaurants and tourist sights. They were happy to recommend a Portuguese restaurant in the old village area and book a table for us.  The location is perfect and very close to all of the “Vegas” themed hotels and casinos. There is…",50
This is a well better than Sheraton Macau. But the bad showerhead still remains the same kind. Checking-in is quick. They providing free breakfast and free happy hour for their Platinum member. Now the breakfast not as well as one year before. The internet connection is good. They giving free parking for guest visiting.,40
"Nice luxury hotel. Checking-in quick, free breakfast for Platinum SPG member. Free happy hour as well. Internet connection is good and free of charge. Free parking for guests. Bulter service is great.",50
What can I say....where do I begin...the entrance ...the lobby..the room...just when you think...your impressed enough...there's..more.. The attention to detail...the warm smiles and helpful  ambience.....yet classy to the core...wanna come back..and stay for longer this time...thank you for wonderful expirience and amazing cuisine....very Happy...,50
"I stayed here midweek for one evening for work. The rooms are way bigger than the photos make it, the room has a nice layout and a comfortable desk to work at. Tv is huge, bathroom is great. Amenities are French by Remede and they have a face soap and body soap which is great since i forgot my cleanser and don't like using harsh body soaps! The real standout though is the butler service and the friendly staff. Everyone is smiley and happy to help. A few standout things  - They offer ironing services with a serious quick turnaround and it saves you time as you don't have to order an iron from housekeeping and do it yourself. - Freshly made tea or coffee anytime to your room.  - Stay facing Eiffel tower as there is a fanatic light show at night.  - They left a lovely note in my…",50
"I must say, the hotel has anything and everything to call it Uber LUXURY. The rooms are spacious, equipped with all modern amenities and technology. The service element is the best part which is reflected by each on of its staff start from welcome people to all. The St. Regis Butler service is the best to take care of  your smallest of need. Dont miss out their Champagne Sabering ritual which takes you to whole new world in evening. Great celebration. Hotel is ideally situated in proximity to all commercial and tourist attractions.",50
"I stay st regis Macao from 11/16-11/19 and they provide the excellent service. The room is very nice n the location is very convenient includes shopping mall, kids playground, many nice restaurants ard the area.  ",50
"Great service always felt welcome and at home. amenity's are exactly what you need before you need it Wi-Fi perfect and fast. bed...the bed you wont want to leave in the morning it was so comfortable. got stuck one extra day due to T8 being hoisted, cant think of a better place to get stuck in!!!",50
"Hotel was lovely - staff very eager to please as there are so many. The style of the hotel rooms, bars and restaurants were immaculately decorated!  The Spa is great - massage was right on but on the pricey side. Bar and Resturant were nice but felt I kept looking for something that was a little simpler such as a fried rice, or a stir fry or a sandwich at lunch. Pool food was lacking.  Great location to get around the rest of the shops and casinos. Easy to get to the other island. We stayed four days- was prob a little much for a leisure holiday esp If you don’t gamble!  ",40
"I have stayed at this hotel for the past few times that i have been to Macao and i like the spacious clean rooms with nice showers and soaps etc.   The location is also ideal and within walking distance to the WYNN, NEW MGM, Venetian, COD etc.  The price by SPG group standard is also not expensive (due in part to the current low visitors to Macau)   the only negative is that the in house restaurant is not great and you need to travel out for meals.",40
We recently visited Macao for a day from Hong Kong. It’s a must to visit place . Not only the landmarks but the whole city is very historical and you can experience the Portuguese culture. We are a family of four with two young kids. I must admit we all had Fanta time there.,50
Great room and great service. I stayed with my 4 year old boy. There were actually kid’s toothbrush and shower cream etc. they also prepared a stool for my kid so that he’s able to reach the wash basin. Very spacious room and toilet. Comfortable bed and pillow.,50
My wife is on her wheelchair but we have enjoyed the stay for four nights here with 100% satisfaction. The room for a wheelchair user is confortable and this hotel is located very convieniently .  I enjoyed swimming at the open-air swimming pool. Meal is excellent at St. Regis. Especially breakfast. Elegant and quiet room. Service is good. We will stay in  this hotel again. The staff are very wll motivated.,50
"Very good and fancy hotel! I was here a few weeks ago and it was my first time in this hotel, butler Peter showed me the room and how everything works! He was very kind! I had lunch in the restaurant it was nice especially the dessert table! Greets from Holland, and thank you for the lovely stay!",50
"It is my first time to stay with The St. Regis Macao, it was great hotel! The service that we have received from all of them has been wonderful and we truly appreciated to make us feel relaxed and super happy...especially Front Office gentlemen - Rich who is professional and kindly, always greet us by name! We are definitely come back sometime in the near future.",50
"My husband and I are based in Hong Kong, and snuck away to nearby Macao for a quick respite. We stayed at the St. Regis, and their kind, attentive and discerning staff made the jaunt one we won't soon forget. The hotel, itself, is beautiful and certainly worthy of its  five-star distinction, but the staff should be commended for truly understanding what hospitality service means. Upon our arrival, we were greeted from the taxi and carefully tended until we were delivered to our room. Our butler, Felix, was knowledgable of the area and helpful in making sure that we made our dinner reservations on time (we were a bit delayed getting in) by having a taxi waiting for us when we arrived downstairs.  The guest receptionist was welcoming, gracious and informative. We enjoyed the…",50
"This hotel has everything from great service, beautiful looking hotel, dining venues and close to all tourist activities. Our room was a Deluxe King room. Very spacious room and bathroom. In built TV into the mirror in the bathroom, shower pressure was amazing and quality products. The room came with a butler service which we utilised to get our clothes pressed and also they also offer to make you tea or coffee at anytime. Concierge could not do enough for us, from looking into what shows were to booking a restaurant in another hotel.  The staff were amazing, very polite and accommodating to any of our questions for assistance. When they found out that our room had not been made until after we returned from a day out they organised a gift of two mugs and a personalised message…",50
"The staff is super kind and efficient, the rooms are superb in size, comfort and details.  I just wished they had Nespresso in the room, having to boil water to make coffee for me means... no coffee.  The pool is my favorite in Macau and the Spa is an experience worth trying, in particular the jacuzzi.  I definitely recommend this hotel!",50
Excellent service!!! To all the management and staff of The St. Regis Macao. Every staff has that bright sunshine smile on their face. An excellenct experience and great hotel enviornment if you want a peace of quiet yet enjoy the busy colourful of Macau. This will be the best hotel to stay at. Special thanks to Mr. Harris for all the arrangement and we will sure come back again.,50
"Comfortable stay and excellent service all through reception, restaurant, all the way to room services.  Rooms are spacious physically with good equipments, Bluetooth speakers, etc.  Worth it despite the price point is set higher than the hotels around.",50
"We have travelled to Macau many times & stayed in various hotel but first time in St Regis. For this trip, we were doing hotel hopping to explore different parts of Macau & hotel. This hotel hospitality is definitely the best and we will stay here the next time we visit Macau. We were welcomed by staff, Jill Peng, who provided excellent services, personally brought us to our room, oriented us on the hotel surrounding & even walked us to Cotai theatre. She was also very attentive to our needs & accommodating to our requests. She has gone beyond our expectation which make a big difference from other hotels we visited. In general, Staff attended to us at reception were very smiley & friendly. Thanks for the pleasant stay in St Regis Macau. ",50
Stayed at the St. Regis Macau for one night at the end of October 2017. Got  upgraded to a Suite for being a SPG Platinum member.  The Suite was really nice and on a high floor with good views of the Eiffel Tower.  The Butler service was very good and the butler explained to us how everything worked in the room. The bed is very comfortable and we had a great night's sleep. Also got a morning newspaper delivered to your room which you don't often get in hotels any more.  Went to The Bar and The Manor restaurant. The quality of the food and the choice of drinks is excellent and the staff really look after you in both the Bar and the Manor. This hotel is very special in Macau !,50
"We were supposed to stay 3 nights at this property but due to flights cancellation because of typhoon LAN. We ended up arriving a day later. The front office team were very accommodating and upgraded us to a 2 room suite. It was a great extra for us , to cover for our late arrival. (no fault of the hotel).  It was tip top service from the rooms divisions manager , all the way to the housekeeping staff, living up to the St. Regis premium branding. The Butler even helped us to buy Macau show tickets.   We will certainly come back again to this hotel.  All thumps up.  Thank you St.Regis Macau for a memorable experience.",50
"This was my second visit to Macau but my first stay at the St Regis. As a regular guest at Starwood Hotels I did expect a lot and was not disappointed. The hotel is a calm oasis from the hustle and bustle of Macau. Check in was smooth and friendly, our suite was spacious and luxurious with all the amenities one would expect. The restaurant and bar offer a good variety of drinks and snacks. Happy hour for SPG gusts is unique and takes place in the bar as the property doesn’t have club lounge. The hotel prepared a nice small surprise for my wife’s birthday. As with any St Regis they offer butler service which I generally find a bit overrated. We didn’t get to use the spa and the pool this time around. WIFI reception was great across the whole hotel. Overall an excellent stay for a…",50
"Macau has many nice and great hotels. St Regis macau is one of them.  They are located at sands cotai central in taipa. Rooms are spacious with great view, city of dreams on one side and parisian on the other.  What really captured our attention was the service and the hotel surroundings. There is a butler assigned to every room, yes you are talking about someone looking after you personally if you need one.  Next is the surrounding, it is not messy at all, unlike the other properties there where many unnecessary people who will approach you for 'business'. There is a security at the side entrance from the casino making sure no unnecessary people can loiter around the hotel. Will definitely return for their tip top service. ",50
I visiting Macao for the first time and stayed 3 nights at the St. Regis. Wonderful Hotel and the Staff was amazing. Very helpful with anything I needed. The spa staff was wonderful and I enjoyed the lounge and cocktails each evening. I will for sure return.,50
We had a weekend stay at St Regis hotel. Unfortunately we bumped into a rare typhoon in Oct - but the hotel was very accommodating with late check out as well as helping us navigate the situation with all transportation out of Macau suspended. Samuel from the butler team looked after us throughout our stay and his kindness was a highlight in the trip. Thank you!,50
"Many times in Macau, stay 1 night in St. Regis Macau, over all service is almost impeccable in Macau's standard... Particular in bar lounge, though the afternoon tea's taste  was't perfect but service is great !  the picky things was the buffet breakfast's taste especially the pastry, just so so... and the service in the pool was't standardized...but all in all, I think this hotel is one of the great among all luxurious hotel in Macau! definitely will be stay again !",50
"I have stayed at several properties in Macau. St. Regis is not bad, compared to others. Service was very attentive (some of us thought ""overly"" attentive, perhaps due to the abundance of staff, but that isn't a problem), the property was nicely appointed with common areas and rooms tastefully designed and decorated, unlike some of its gawdy competitors. Food was great, the gym was decent, though the pool was on the small side.  Despite meeting expectations all round, I still think the St. Regis lacks the special ""it"" factor, thus only a 4-star rating.",40
"This is my 3rd time staying in St. Regis for special occasion and the hardware and software of the hotel never failfail to impress! The stay was to celebrate my mom's birthday so apart from what other 5 star hotels would do to provide a bday cake, st. Regis also decorated my room with balloons and other items which made it so special for us. Thank you Butler Peter who escorted us to our room to extend a warm welcome and other butlers who have been in touch with me in emails to ensure what I requested were reasonably fulfilled. Will come visit again!",50
"The Director, St. Regis Hotel, Macau  Dear Sir/Madam,  We would like to express our heart-felt thanks to your staff, in particular Ms Janette Dimarucut, and Nancy Min for their ambassador service and heart-warming hospitality during our stay between 11 and 12 August and breakfast, lunch as well as dinner at Manor of your hotel. They made all our family members feel enjoyable and cozy.  Please also extend our special thanks to Sammi Tong who recommended your hotel to us and also arranged a birthday cake to my husband with a great surprise that made him feel unforgettable of this extraordinary event in Macau on 10 September 2017 during our lunch at Manor. I don’t think we will ever forget her smiling face and sincere attitude that made us feel comfortable and mouth-watering when…",50
"i went with my friend for our small bachelorette trip. we emailed the hotel beforehand to see if anything special they could arrange for us, but it was forgotten and we had to ask again. eventually we got a small piece of cheese cake which tasted not bad, but not as special as the other birthday surprises i saw on trip advisor.   let me start from the very beginning. we arrived st. regis thru holiday inn (which had a very long check in line), so we were grateful to see personal check in service. BUT, maybe we both look young (we dressed so causal for the vacation), when we walked in we were asked ""what could i do for you"", kind of like you are not in the right place. and after check in, because we wanted to confirm our ferry back, the personal butler or representative did not…",40
"this is our 3rd stay this time both rooms in the 18th floor, still didn't disappoint.. some of the staff even recognize us, really make us feel welcome from check in to check out.. & this time our 9 month old daughter is with us so they gave us special gift shoutout to Samuel for giving our baby a toy, also to the butler & housekeeping who setup the baby amenities ",40
"We had stayed in St Regis Macao several times and we had always enjoyed our stay there - and this time was no exception.   I somehow booked a smoking room even though I don't smoke and was travelling with 2 kids - Lisa K in Front Office / Guest Services sent me an email few days prior to my check in to confirm my preferences and happily arranged a non-smoking room for us.  Our room had views of the Venetian and the Parisien, and of course the replica of the Eiffel Tower in the Cotai Strip - and our kids really loved it. When we went down to the lobby to get some recommendation on dinner options, Lisa K and a senior manager helped us with the selection and even showed us the way to Bene (in the same Sands Cotai Central mall), and helped us with the order for the kids. It was…",50
"The staff and service were great, treated me like family. Everyhing was outstanding!  Great room, great view, the staff greeted us by name everywhere we went. Always smiling and friendly.  Daily breakfast was more like a high end sunday brunch.",50
"This is my second stay at St. Regis Macao. Just like my first stay a year ago, the service was excellent, the staff at check in desk, Service manager Samuel and butler made the check in process very smooth, and I felt welcomed. There are so many details during my stay touched me, such as they always prepared a bucket of ice for me at night ( how do they know I like to drink something chilled before sleep, so I normally need to ask for ice in other hotel ), the small gift every night also shows they paying so much attention to detail. Thanks the whole St. Regis Macao Team, your guys made my holiday unforgettable. Highly recommended. ",50
The stay was very memorable and the butler service is well done. They were very accommodating with my requested. Will definitely. They really live up to the excellent service of st Regis.The area where the hotel is located very close to the airport and the area has all the required services as the ground floor and the first is a shopping center and restaurants that meet all the requirements.,50
Much easier access to move around as it connects to the complex. Meal quality okay and could be the choice if you are looking for a less crowd hotel in Macau. Staffs are friendly and helpful. Room is typical St Regis style and slightly different from the same brand in other countries.,40
"My husband had surprised me with a night of stay here.   After all his arrangement, I realized that the whole Butler team was so caring and helped him planned so much ahead, which he never has done this kind of arrangement to me in 10 years!  Upon check in, my Butler escorted me to the upgraded room and provided me a detailed rooming. Room cleaningness is always my biggest concern whereever I stay as I am allergic to dust.Surpsingly, it was thoroughly cleaned and they have placed an air purifier in my room. I feel comfortable to stay in the room in most of the time. I also tried out their gym which is clean. I found they were thoughtful that they place water bottles and towels in front of each machine.   Out of my courisioty, I went to check out the spa facility. Attendant…",50
The stay was very memorable and the butler service is exceptional. They were very accommodating with my request to assist with the packing from all my shopping and to assist me as I am currently a nursing mother who is away from  my baby by helping me freeze and store my milk even in the middle of the night.  Will definitely stay here again for my next trip.  They really live up to the excellent service of st Regis. ,50
"This hotel would have to be one of the best Macau the location is great the rooms are well maintained and presented and the service from food and beverage to the staff is world class. I would like to thank our butler Samuel for looking after us in every possible way and been there the whole time for us, he is a true professional and an asset to the hotel",50
St Regis Macao is one of the best hotels that I have stayed. It has about 300 rooms and in an intimate setting. The butler service is unique and not available in other hotel chains. I would definitely stay here again.,50
"Love the sophisticated and tasteful ambience of St Regis so we decided to celebrate our anniversary in this prestigious hotel on Cotai Strip.  We were delighted to have our room upgraded to a spacious bedroom with a good sized dressing room. Our butler had also brought us a complimentary cheese cake as courtesy. There had been a few butlers helping us during our stay and all of them were professional with good smiles.  The gym and pool were not huge but adequately equipped.  However, there seems to be executive lounge in the location so Manor, the restaurant serving breakfast, was quite busy. Anyhow, breakfasts at Manor were wonderful.  St Regis is definitely on our list of stay. ",50
This is a superb Hotel so it was such a major treat to be able to come here again. The service was impeccable and the Hotel's systems worked like clockwork-but with heart! Reception was very helpful and the comfort of the rooms has to be experienced to be believed!,50
I stayed 1 night for celebrating birthday with my friend. I was upgraded to a St regis suite with birthday surprise creased by the butler team. Thanks for the arrangement especially my butler SAMUEL. The cake was excellent and the room was spacious and equipped with high end technology. A local cell phone with cellular data was provided in the room which could be used outside hotel. The only thing that should be improved was the food in breakfast. The options was limited but the quality was good.,40
"We stayed on the 37th floor, which is the topmost room floor, with breathtaking views of the Cotai Strip, a 180 degree view. The view-window spanned a lengthy 40 feet, never seen before.I would go on to say, this room was better than the Presidential Suite, given the location of the Presidential Suite, which was on the same floor. The Butler service was beyond par, with one even accompanying me to drop me off to the adjoining Sheraton, which was only moments away; he could have easily directed, instead, chose to accompany. The Manor, a fine French themed restaurant, has rooms within the restaurant, for dining at different times, and the mood changes according to the time of the day, hemmed by Paul. The St. Regis Bar, hemmed by Roy, has its signature BloodyMary, a Cigar lounge…",50
The butler service is amazing - had an excellent weekend taking advantage of the hospitality that these guys offer. they're attentive and nothing is too much trouble. the rooms were very well appointed and clean. Gym and spa facilities also top class.,50
Very classy hotel. But Macau can be boring for adventurers of historic places and original landmarks. Best to travel with authentic friends and family members. If you want to gamble your savings go ahead as people gamble even in the morning. Porkfloss cookie (?) was so-so.,30
"I have stayed at St. Regis Macau in August. St. Regis Macau is an outstanding hotel in Macau, no matter service or equipments.  I would like to thanks the staff in the hotel.  Ryan - butler Renee Wu - bar  Lala - breakfast  Raymind - housekeeping   Renee Wu, a bartender who comes from the same country. Warm greeting from familiar pronunciation, sounds great if you haven't got back home half year.   Raymind, a nice person who is in housekeeping. He came to my room 2 times in the afternoon and take care of my room if I need help.   Lala, the staff in restaurant. She knows my aunt is a vegetarian, and try her best to prepare dishes for my aunt. The most incredible thing is that she can remember all my family's favorite beverage, and prepare it in the second morning!  Hope i can get…",50
"As one of the best luxury hotel chains in the world, this definitely attracts me to choose St. Regis to stay at. I am actually a frequent traveler to travel to Macau due to the reason of the food are so good and it is very relaxing as a travel destination and also it is very near to my hometown. Normally I used to stay at Wynn Macau, Venetian, or Hard rock (unfortunately it's gone), but as the reason I mentioned above, so I chose to stay at St. Regis this time. I was overwhelmed by the St. Regis unique butler service but however, I think the butler service that I experienced was the best service among the other services that I have experienced during my stay with St. Regis. When I stayed at Venetian, they proactively offered bottled water like it doesn't cost them any money, but…",30
"During our 2-night stay in August, we received wonderful service from all the staff at St. Regis. While we were happy with each and every staff, we would like to mention specially about Mr. Phillip who was our butler. He was very thoughtful in making our 9-year old daughter extremely delighted to be staying at the hotel. Simple gestures can win over small hearts!! Also, would like to mention Ms. Anna Wu, whose special ""Extra Hot Capuccino"" provided the much required zeal to our day. She is consistent to provide the best coffee in Macau and much recommend her service to everyone opting for breakfast at St. Regis!!! Thank you for your hospitality and hope all of you are safe in this typhoon season!!",50
"The very nice smell in lobby as you step into the hotel. Service is great and you can get complimentary drinks as much as you want . As the hotel is newly built comparing with most hotels in Macau , everything is contemporary , attention to details and new! Liked the shoe trees, bed lamp, Bose amplifier , over 4 USB plugs and etc. Thank you Felix who gave us introduction of the hotel with his warmest service . All the staff in the hotel always with smile has been impressive! ",50

"因為暑假關係，帶著小朋友來玩樂一下，基本上在澳門已住過很多不同類型的酒店，但始終都係喜歡住5星級酒店，因為無論在服務、酒店配套或是食用方面都會有一定的水準，我曾經在網絡上聽說""澳門瑞吉""不及其他地區酒店奢華或招呼不好等等問題，於是我就特意到來住一下，親身感受這些，但我要為""澳門瑞吉酒店""作出評反，因為由我在網上訂房開始，直至退房的一刻，我也是感受到酒店那種熱情招待，首先講講訂房同事的幫忙，一直相助至我們到達酒店，我要求什麼，她們真的說到做到盡力地配合，到我們到達酒店當日，一走進大們，已有很多笑容滿面及親切的服務員在迎接客人，也即刻帶我們一家到櫃位check-in，接待我們今天的是David, 他說很歡迎我們來到""澳門瑞吉酒店""，一坐下，先來3杯Welcome Drink, 由於訂房部同事已為我安排好一切，今天被升等至很好景觀的套房，還提醒我們，要試試他們酒店的自助早餐，因為是非常好的，所以check-in一切很順利，然後就由今天是我們的管家Rebecca Zhang，笑容滿面地帶領我們到房間，沿途Rebecca不斷解釋酒店的設施，詢問我們一家到澳門來玩嗎？因為她想介紹一些景點及地方給我們，真有心思啊！到達房間後，開始很詳細介地紹房間內設施是怎麼用，因為我們有小朋友，也準備好小朋友的套裝用品，令小朋友很開心啊！這兩天令我感受到她們的用心、熱情款待，這裏一切一切真的很好，沒有外間所講的不好一切，所以我們一家也熱烈推介""澳門瑞吉酒店""，你們試一下便知道什麼叫5星級的服務，我們下次一定會再入住啊！  最後我好想多謝以下這些同事，排名不分先後： Fanny & Abe (Bulter Service Desk), Vanessa (Agent, Bulter Service Desk) & your team, Ana Jimenez (Guest…",50
"The hotel is conveniently located next to the Galaxy hotel. As Galaxy is indeed a group of hotels with well-developed connection to other public facilties, staying in Regis means that you can also benefits from these traffic connections.  The room is very decent and it features a television in the washroom. Rooms are big and our views are to another hotels, but you can always close the curtains if you prefer more privacy.  The butler services are quite nice, I and my partner has called serveral times for room services and complimentary drinks.  At the ground floor are the lobby and dinning areas. Unfortunately our room rates do not include breakfast, but in Macau you can always find delicious local food elsewhere.  Overall the hotel is fairly price with regard to the overall…",50
"This was a last-minute decision to stay here as we had originally booked the Countdown (see review). The hotel is by far superior to any hotel I have stayed at in Macau (and over the last 20 years I have stayed at many!) From the first minute of superb personalised check-in (Thx Blair) to fantastic service poolside (thanks Ureka,Roy, Leron), it was an amazing holiday. The manager, Raymond, was so gracious to us, even giving us the recipe for the delicious mojitos served at the pool.  I can't say enough good things about this amazing hotel! Thank you everyone for the best stay ever!",50
"Visiting Macau is real fun these days!! best hotels, restaurants, and great shows are there!!  Specially, in Taipa area(Cotai Central), everything are in waking distance.  For hotels, my first choice is Saint Regis, which is new, so not much well known. You can feel very private atmosphere.  facing Doorman, check-in counter.... you can feel that from the start.  also location is great!!  Citi of Dream hotel is Just opposite side the road, where you can find ""the house of dancing water"" theater, the best show in Macau!!  By skywalks, you can easily get to the sands casino in Venetian hotel, the biggest casino in Macua. In Venetian, Morton steaks is my favorite!! ^^  Anyway, just try!!",50
"if you are looking for casino type of facilities, this is not the one you are looking for. everything provided is upto standard. in room dining is out of my expectation. dim sum is relatively good.  the only thing i don't like is the shutter bus service is not convenience. they stop at 1st hotel amongst the fourth and we are situated at the fourth thus take a long walk over here. if they can keep various stops, that will be excellent.",40
"From Check-in to Check-out, this hotel lacks for nothing. Super professionals and excellent services in every spot. The hotel had prepared the shower chair in the shower booth for my old parents before we checked in. What a thoughtful service. I felt like they treated us like VVIP. Of course, room was very clean and spacious. I wish I could have stayed longer.  I strongly recommend this hotel and I will definitely be back.",50
"This hotel only have 400 rooms, friendly concierge staffs, high quality front desk staffs with fast check-in, room is super to stay (suite), clean, quite and bed is very comfortable. Restaurant buffet is excellent with really good food quality, same restaurant for dinner but there is not many choices. If you get enough budget for your vacation then there is no doubt that St. Regis may be the your best choice in Macau.",50
"Second time staying in a St Regis Hotel brand. My first stayed was in St Regis Singapore. So I have some expectation of the butler service offered by St Regis.   St Regis Macau butler team were exceptional. Very friendly and helpful staff all round from arrival to departure. As a SPG Preferred member, we were upgraded to a Grand Deluxe room. Massive room with walk in robe and separate bathroom. Everything in the room were immaculate. Great view from our hotel room. St Regis is situated in a great location. Short walking distance to other attractions such as Venetian and Parisian & City of Dreams. Concierge team were very kind and helpful to make theater reservation on our behalf. We also spent a few evenings at the St Regis Bar/Lounge. Again we were served by nice friendly…",50
"We can be picky and demand more in a St Regis.  First impression was good for that the entrance is glamorous.  What I appreciate St Regis most is that we are comfortably seated when checking-in, which is not common among most hotel groups.  The room was bigger than expected and so was the welcome fruit basket.  The carpet was spotless clean and towel were soothing soft.   If I must pick something to criticize, the mattress was a mistake.  The mattress was foam instead of spring-bound (which was the first time I saw in a luxury-level hotel).  I never like foam mattresses, which support badly.  I think St Regis is rich enough to invest something better, e.g., King Koli or Simmons - please.  Also, the Axor S___k faucet  at the bath tub was another joke .  Try how many minutes you…",40
"The warm and gracious service from the reception staff and St. Regis butler team distinguish the St. Regis hotel from many of the other luxury hotels in Macau.  The St. Regis butlers were most helpful in reaching out to us by email even before our stay and assisted us with various restaurant and service bookings.  Usual response time for our emails was within a few hours.  On check-in, we were escorted to our room by Elaine, who took great pains to explain the various room features.  These notably included a smartphone (with free long-distance calls to Hong Kong and Taiwan, amongst others) which we could use as a hotspot for wifi service anywhere in Macau.  This was not something we had expected and provided a nice extra touch.  Complimentary tea/coffee service was delivered to…",50

From the moment u reach the main drive way, check-in, room and butler service. Everything is nothing but immaculate!  I arrived around 12.30pm knowing room will normally be ready at 3pm and I was given a complimentary early check-in without even asking. That's what i call going the extra mile!

"As a side trip from Hong Kong I decided to stay a couple of nights in Macao. I wanted to stay at a Starwood property to maintain my status, so I opted for the St. Regis. The overall experience was extremely good with only a couple of minor glitches preventing it from making it absolutely perfect. I had booked two nights through SPG and had requested an early check-in, around 8 am. I arrived slightly later than that, around 9 am, and the room was ready and available. My SPG Platinum status was recognised and I got upgraded to a stunning suite on the 30th floor. Check-in went smoothly and professionally and before long I was escorted to my room. The suite was nothing short of spectacular. Spotlessly clean, with all amenities I could have hoped for, it came with a huge living room,…",50

This was due to the very friendly, helpful and enthusiastic staff e.g. Anna, Supervisor of Manor Restaurant and EP, Chief Butler, and staff and therapists at Iridium Spa. Their attitude made us extend our stay!   However, there are areas for improvement: 1) Check-in and check-out process - could be more efficient. Our bill was not correct and took more than half an hour and two tries to fix! Also this reception area is quite messy and not very welcoming e.g. too many staff standing around doing nothing much. 2) Butler service - could be more special - not quite the standard we expected, e.g. our butler took good care of us when we checked in, but when it was time for us to check out it would have been nice if our butler (or a…",40

"This is our second stay at this St. Regis Macau as to celebrate my wife's birthday. Originally we planned to stay for 2 nights from Sunday to Tuesday but we finally extended one more night till Wednesday due to its great service and relaxing atmosphere.   In fact, affected by typhoon, we originally moved our booking to checking in on Monday instead but as typhoon left, we reinstated it to checking in on Sunday again at the same rates.   As a return guest, an SPG guest and to celebrate my wife's birthday, we were surprised that we were upgraded to a suite this time!

No words are available to describe the highest standards in hospitality , especially by the ladies and gentlemen at check in , concierge , doormen , breakfast attendants and head of the private butler services . Hotel staff is greeting you everywhere , giving directions ,...in an elegant and discreet way.  The experience even got better when we got upgraded to a deluxe suite with Eiffel tower views and state of the art in-room amenities ( beds are extremely comfortable as well ) , complimentary chocolate cake and late check out ( 4 pm ! ).

"Stayed here for just 1 night for my birthday...I was debating between this and the Conrad, and I sure am glad I picked here! The staff went above and beyond to make my birthday special, including sending up a cake, a mug, and some chocolates. Truly a great experience.   This hotel is a nice respite away from the busyness that are the rest of the strip hotels, like Venetian/Parisian that had massive lines in the lobby. It was a serene environment that I welcomed quite a bit. The rooms were great and the beds even better - I think I will buy a St. Regis bed after sleeping on this one! Breakfast in the morning was delectable and can not be beat - you can not miss breakfast as the buffet is incredible.  Should I ever return to Macau, the St. Regis is the place I will stay!",50
"We go to Macau a lot, and since we live pretty close it feels almost like a staycation which means we always splurge. We normally stay at the Four Seasons but we decided to try the St Regis this time and I think I have switched my allegiance forever.   Decor is not to my taste, too shiny but at least you do feel an air of exclusiveness which is hard to find in a city like Macau (cue in the tourists in sparkling flip flops and shouting around you). However the service took center stage in this visit. I fell sick (szechuanese food is dangerous, beware!) and I was really down on our check out day, I went downstairs and asked for some medicine because I could barely walk with the pain. The staff reacted immediately, they sent someone to the city to buy the medicine I needed, one of…",50

"The room has very good Effiel Tower view (The Parisian Hotel).  Thick mattress. Children slippers, stepper in the bathroom, children amenities. TV in the bathroom. Lots of USB and socket points. But one odd point in the bathroom, the toilet door opens out while the bathroom opens in. If one comes out and one comes in the two doors crash. Only 1 bar and 1 western restaurant in the hotel. The shuttle bus to the hotel stops at Cotai Hotels therefore in order to reach St Regis by shuttle you have to walk through Holiday Inn Cotai.",40

Jocelyn and Elaine took great care of us and the room was excellent.  My wife found the accommodations very comfortable.  The room came with a local mobile phone that provided a wi-fi hotspot when outside the property and free international calling, very very useful.  We enjoyed the pool as well.  This property is a must if you are staying in Macau.",50

The St Regis Macau was no exception.  I arrive late in the evening and had booked a hotel car to collect me at the airport.  My personal butler, a great touch at the St Regis! met me as I cleared customs and whisked me away in a waiting car to the hotel.  Only a 5 minute drive.  During the trip she informed me about the hotel and surrounding places of interest. As I was there on business I had no time to explore unfortunately.

"Located on the far end of the strip but I do like the exclusiveness. Attentive and friendly staff however our butler might need to put into more knowledge about the area - we asked how far by car from the hotel to the Macau pier where we can take the ferry to Hong Kong Airport, but she seemed confused and not knowing there are actually ferry from Macau going directly to the Hong Kong Airport! But she immediately checked and called back with the information we needed so it was no big deal.   Overall a great hotel - will definitely stay here again when we are in coming to Macau! ",50

Upon check in, we headed to our room and there were already 2 persons standing outside our room waiting with a cake for my husband and a backpack for my daughter. They also prepared the kiddie toiletries in the bathroom in advance. We had dinner and buffet breakfast at the Manor, and as expected, food was great.

Upon reaching the hotel, check in was fast, we have 2 young toddlers and was offered a stroller to use around Macau. The staff provided full sets of kids amenities from kids shampoo to bathrobes. Our rooms are in good conditions, clean and neat.  The staffs were very friendly and doesn't hesitate to help us whenever we needed help, be it directions or recommendations.",50
"My wife and I (with our 2 year old son) traveled to Macau. We started our trip with a 14-hour flight with a toddler that didn't travel very well. After arriving at the dock from our boat ride there, we were greeted with a friendly smile and a car to take us to the hotel.   When arriving at the hotel, we were greeted by Butler Services who already checked us in. He walked us up to our room to find balloons on the bed, a birthday gift (for my son's 2nd birthday), and a card signed by the staff.   That welcome was such the ""reset"" I needed from a hectic travel day.... and that was only the beginning! The staff throughout our stay extremely accommodating and always willing to help. We had our clothes washed, pressed, and individually packaged, turn down service done daily (separate…",50
I went with my wife and daughter for Dragon Boat Festival for the long weekend and I didn't know what to expect as this was my first time staying here. The service was top knotch from the second we stepped through the door right until we left. They gave  my daughter a toy for her birthday (my wife mentioned to them that we were coming over to celebrate birthdays in the reservation) and she was super happy. Once we got to the room they promptly arrived with some birthday cake!!  The Butler service was great for our entire stay and would have coffee and tea there very quickly.   The room was great and super clean. But for me the best part was the fitness centre and the sauna/ steam room and hot  tub in the change room. If you go you should definitely not miss going for a sauna or…,50
"My friends and i decided to do ""hotel-hopping"" for the week of my birthday and our 2nd stop is this luxurious hotel. And as expected we were not disappointed.  Check in: fast, smooth and the staff are all friendly and excellent. They gave us extra treat for my birthday!! ☺️😎😜 Butler service: attentive and anticipated our every needs. We were treated very special which was really amazing!  Room: spacious and immaculately clean!  The experience was perfect from beginning till we checked out.  Highly recommended!!",50
Centrally located and part of the main gambling complex which connects all major hotels. Friendly staff. Special thx to Diogo at concierge who was a big help. Luxury rooms good food. They provided free limo to airport and US$100 spending voucher. Great buffet breakfast included/ Large rooms with great view. Expensive but predictable. You won't be disappointed.,40
"The St. Regis is a rare oasis of gentility and personalized service amidst the ""pump-the-chumps"" corporatized madness aimed at mainland Chinese visitors. The staff will get to know you from the moment you check-in and take great care of you. There are no massive queues like in the megaplexes across the street and the butler service is one of the many unique perks of this hotel. Felix in check-in and my butler Frank took great care of me.  I give especially high marks to the St. Regis bar. If you like a quiet, dignified bar with hand-crafted and unique cocktails among interesting clientele, this is the one you want. It is the diametric opposite to the pre-mixed, cutesie cocktail trash that is served in all of the casino bars and larger hotel lounges which are inevitably infested…",50
"We enjoyed a fantastic visit to the St Regis Macau- everything was top notch and exceeded expectations. The only hiccup was the free airport shuttle bus- there was no announcement on the bus to alight at the Holiday Inn and walk through arcade to St Regis. The rooms are spacious, afternoon tea great value, and a special shout out to our butler Samuel who took great care of us.  ",50
"I stay for 3 nights here with no regret. Prices is cheap using Amex provide free upgrade, resturant voucher and great services. Will stay again for my next trip. Have to try the oyster in the resturant ",50
"A very good hotel choice in Macau. Unlike several other so-called luxury (or 5-star) hotels in Macau, St Regis Macau really provided high standard hotel service to clients, which you should expect in similar top grade hotels around the world. You would not find long queue (and keep standing) waiting for check-in. You would not find noisy and crowdy restaurant when you take your buffet breakfast or a drink. You would not see golden but vulgar decorations. Prepare to speak English there because it is an international hotel and not just for Chinese from inland China.",50
"With all the rumbling below, the overall stay is still quite pleasant.  I stayed from April 16th to 20th. My birthday was on April 18th. I sure did not experience any personal touch that my birthday was noticed.  I arrived too early at 10+ in the morning. They were nice enough to secure a room at 12pm. A little annoyed was they had already swiped my card for the deposit in the morning yet when I returned at 12+, they couldn't find the record. Luckily I had a message on my mobile telling of the charge.  Housekeeping was always my pain when I have to stay in a hotel for more than 3 nights. Somehow after the first few days, it is obvious that they only replenish the amenities in the bathroom and cleaning was also concentrated in the bathroom.  There's few taxi that goes to the…",40
"Warm welcome during check-in with warm smile & have a drink! Elegant and modern decoration, feel so relaxed  I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Butler Team. After making a reservation, an email was sent by Butler team in order to take care of us from the beginning of our trip, even we hadn't started our journey.  We stated out our needs from time to time, the team could fulfill our needs efficient. The surprised thing that the team arranged a birthday cake to me. The cake was so yummy too.  Once again, thank you for the Butler team, especially Jack, Henrique, Marvis. You guys did an excellent job!",50
"It's lots of hotel in Macau and St Regis is  definitely my first choice; I always like to stay in, with good food and comfortable room, tho the price is a bit high ^^ but it worths the price, therefore, I highly recommend that, for your next visit to Macau.",50
"This is my first stay at a St Regis and it definitely won't be my last. Macau has plenty of 5 star hotels and many of them are GRAND in size and spectacle. The St. Regis however is very subtle and low key, from the outside it looks nothing special even though it's perfectly situated on the Cotai strip walking distance from most popular places but don't let the outside fool you. As soon as you enter you are warmly greeted by every staff that walk by. Concierge team is very quick with check in and getting you into your room which also comes with its own butler. The room itself is top of the line, immaculate decor and the very best in amenities. We stayed only for the weekend but it was a lovely stay throughout. St. Regis will definitely be a stay option of mine everywhere I travel…",50
"Stayed at the hotel for 4 nights. Loved completely upto the expectation. From the cleanliness and decor of the room, to the amenities placed in the room to the. Tyler service. Everything was simply amazing. Truest lives upto it's brand name. Only feedback which I would give is that the options in breakfast buffet could be more.",50
"We had 6-stars ++ experience with our stay.   All the service, the butler service, front desk staff, the bar and the restaurant  was beyond expectation.  The butler team contacted me few days in advance and asked for the purpose of our stay.  They even prepared a cake for us.  👏🏻👏🏻  When we got our welcome drinks at the bar, the staff explained to us very patiently how the drink was made and taught us what made the drinks special.  Breakfast was excellent. The food was of the highest quality.    The gym was awesome. First class equipment, friendly staff and explain to you how to use them safely.  The swimming pool and the changing room were very clean  I love all their service. We had a great stay with them.  Will definitely come back.   ",50
"First visit to a St.Regis and with high expectations in tow. Read some good and some scathing reviews but for us we wasn't let down.   Jon Yau and Stella were fantastic with their service. All the staff were accommodating to our party of 5 and 3 kids aged 0,2, and 4.   We got a connecting room that consisted of a St Regis suite and Queen Cotai room. Rooms fantastic, hard product was very good.   We ordered room service twice. Missed a dish once but rectified in minutes so seems harsh to deduct points.   Concierge assisted with getting us the dreamworks breakfast and even saved us money by deducting our breakfast package against the dreamworks one. Who doesn't like a good saving?!  Pool and gym were deserted, all the more better for us. Breakfast was great with lots of options…",50
"Great hotel. Very convenient to ferry terminal,airport and city of dreams,Venetian ,Parisian just around you . Especially the bar was great , too .more than enough food selection. The end I want particularly thanks Salley the service she was fantastic. Highly recommend. ",50
"I just stayed RM#2810 at The St.Regis Macao with very nice room and view. First impression, Abe U Supervisor, Butler Service Desk sent email me to warm welcome, gave useful information and asked any assist between stay there. Secondly, when I arrived to the hotel for checking-in, Ms. Rebecca, Butler escorted me to the room and recommended both the hotel and visit in Macao. My room is very clean and tidy.  When I called GSC for help, it's so fast to get back to me. Concierge always gave kind support information to guest including me. Love your swimming pools and jacuzzi on 8th fl. and staff is very friendly and helpful. Breakfast at The Minor is a small choice but food quality. I love a various of yogurts and pastry items. Another impression, my omelette served to my table by…",50
"My family and I visit here from 17 Apr to 19 Apr for Easter holiday. Check-in is fast and quick. Although room upgrade cannot be achieved for the peak season, but a better view of room is provided. I love the view very much, especially with the flashing Eiffel tower at night.  Honestly, it is my first time to try this hotel brand. The butler service is excellent. They give me an email for greeting three days before the stay. It is an email not just greeting, but also to get more information on what they can serve better. Once they aware we travel with kids, they also prepare the kids amenities for us. One of the photo shows my kid love very much on finding he has his own slipper in this hotel. During the stay, he wear the slipper once back to the room.  One more thing want to…",40
"My wife and I felt we had the ultimate escape during our recent getaway to Macau, while the St.Regis Macao represented the proverbial 'ícing on the cake'. We had a wonderful stay there from whoa to go. The attendants at the door were the ultimate in discreet, professional service , securing our luggage and politely ushering us into a special Reception desk. Our Receptionist was a young man originally hailing from Portugal and he proved to be both exceptionally polite and exceptionally friendly, answering all our questions on the occasion of our first visit to this hotel, with aplomb. Our suite on the 27th Floor presented us with new benchmarks in luxury and the bathtub was particularly suitable for both wallowing  and luxuriating in, not to mention the fact that there was a TV…",50
"Location is very convenient on the strip you can walk to everything within 10 mins.  Service is amazing,  anyone I interacted during my stay went above and beyond for the 5 star service and made everything very smooth and easy.  Breakfast buffet is fantastic and the chefs can make anything happen for you just ask. Happy hour at the lobby bar is a great perk after long work days.  If I am ever back in Macau this will be top of the list for me for sure!",50
"Thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the St. Regis Macao.  Check in was smooth.  Staff were well trained and eager to help. Received friendly greetings throughout the hotel.  There isn't an Executive or Club Lounge for Starwood Premier Members, but we were welcomed to use the bar which was perfectly fine.  Again, staff were friendly and helpful - drinks and snacks were delicious.  The gym and pool were nice.    Great location on the Cotai Strip.  Easy walk to many sights.",50
Made a great choice with this hotel. It is most probably the only hotel on Cotai that have casino in it. Great location. Everything is within walking distance and the greatest this is they are all indoors. The service is truly 6 star.,50
"Just finished my short trip in St. Regis with my family to celebrate our wedding anniversary. The stay was a pleasant one with very high services standard received from every member in the hotel. We also had a sunny day during our stay and spent much time at the pool which was very relax and good for real swimming. In fact, 5 stars should be given. The one star deducted was due to a very crowd breakfast on the 1st day. Think it's because it's Easter Holiday. Long queue for actabke, food replenishment was a bit slow and staff members were very busy during the whole morning. However on the 2nd morning which was no longer a holiday, we received an excellent services during the breakfast time. The waiters and chef showed the high hospitality to prepare what we wanted. Really thanks…",40
"Staff were friendly and polite. Rooms were clean and cozy. The bed was sooo comfy! We enjoyed our in-room breakfasts and dinning a lot.   Butler service wasn't as good as expected compared to other St Regis' we've stayed at before where they will greet you upon check-in and bring you to the room. Not sure if it was due to the Easter weekend, but overall service was good..special thanks to our butler Francis throughout our 3days stay.   The bar was amaaazing! Enzo and Francis made our nights so enjoyable! Oh and not to be forgotten, Enzo is a pro at making different drinks!  Brunch at The Manor was also very good. Their 10-course menu was delicious and reasonably priced.",50
What a beautiful property. The room is very clean and well furnished. The butler service was very nice. Especially my butler Allan went far and beyond to make our stay memorable and special. Many thanks.,50
"Me and my friend stay in room 1802 on April 18 - 19 , first impression of the hotel was good , start from bellman who is very attentive something that I feel not good was when we check -in, The bellman put my hand bag on the floor instead of put on top my luggage ....Reception counter was a bit dusty ,cleanliness of the guest lift extremely need to pay extra attention ...the whole stay using guest lift I found it a lot of finger mark and oily .   Butler "" Tommy Yang"" need more training how to do room orientation and Butler knowledges , Butler "" Dragon "" the same thing ...He sent fruit amenities and cutlery without Napkin , first time in my experience stay at 5 stars hotel to see this .  Butler "" Felix "" is the best among others . More experience and knowledge about the service .…",40
"The room is clean and spacious. breakfast was great. our butler dragon is very helpful. it is truly a 5 stars hotel in macau but not that typically ""st regis"" style. i expect ""st regis"" could have more ambiance and dimmer lights in room.   i love the phone they provide i can bring that around with free IDD and internet.  I can't say that the hotel wows us a lot but it is indeed a great stay with great room amenities and bed.",40
"Room is big & cosy, the St. Regis bed is really comfortable  Our butler, Frank & his team are very friendly and helpful  Thanks St. Regis for the complimentary cake & champagne for my mum's birthday  just some recommendation: 1) a bathtub mat for the bathroom, just in case got a bit slippery 2) a little hallway chair for customer to put on their shoes",50
"A beautifully designed and very elegant hotel. Everything looks brand new and well-maintained. The rooms are spacious and has everything a discerning traveller could ask for. Very impressed by the personalized service (handwritten note, toy for my baby...). However, I was disappointed with the slow check-in process and the butler service. The butler was slow to respond, not knowledgeable and not particularly friendly. It was supposed to be St. Regis' signature but did not live up to expectations on this occasion.",50
Best of the best.I have no any words.Just awesome.Staff were friendly.I fell i am at my own home.Small but it was okay.Beyond my imagination.They do really care.Next time when I visit macau will sure come to this place.,50
"Went to Macau for a special celebration with my sisters. All of the staff were so sweet and made our stay extra special.   We had beautiful view!  Anne, the front desk manager took care of us. She's awesome!  Our butler, Allan and others were excellent!   Finally, the concierge service helped us immensely. Toni answered all our questions and advised perfectly!   Loved everything!!!",50
"Services are impeccable. St regis do value every guest. Only thing disappointing is the food. We ordered Carbonara for room service, but it's really salty that barely eat. Breakfast is okay, not much variety.",50
"St Regis certainly lived up to the service standards expected of it. The hotel is linked to Holiday Inn, and is a short shuttle bus ride ( on the green Cotai Central bus) from Macau airport.  The rooms were big and beds were comfortable.  The toilets, with with marble walls were definitely a classy touch.i loved that there was a TV in the toilet, so you could unwind and relax while having a soak in the tub.  Our Butler Samuel and his team was very attentive and provided us with impeccable service, from lint removal from coats, to daily coffee service.  We loved that each room came with a ""handy"", allowing us mobile wifi access all over Macau, without having to purchase additional SiM card.   I will definitely be back.",50
"Have stayed at this property since it's opening, and it has now (more or less) matured into a solid five-star hotel.  There is an air of luxury and calmness when entering the hotel. The staff from the doormen to the bell hops, front desk to butler, restaurant/bar to housekeeping are all helpful and well-mannered.   Have stayed in most of the room categories (Deluxe, Grand Deluxe, SR Suite, Metropolitan suite) and they are all nicely furnished and well-equipped. Bed and linen very comfortable. Bathroom water pressure is good, and hot water runs consistently.  I tried the hotel restaurant - The Manor for the first time on my last stay, and the fish soup I had was outstanding, and coupled with SPG discount it was very affordable and value for money. The hotel bar on the other end…",50
Great property of st Regis. Up to standard. Butlers were helpful and provided good service. Hotel next to casino. Room was spacious. Bathroom was well stuffed with amenities. Clean white marble design is lovely. ,50
"I stayed at the St Regis for two nights. There are quite a lot 5-star hotels in Macau and St Regis is not a good one among them. It is located at the end to the south of Cotai Central. I took the Sands shuttle bus, it dropped me off at Sheraton. I have to walk a long way to the hotel. The rate was high for the room that I stayed. It is smaller than other 5-star hotel rooms. There is no coffee machine in the room. The complimentary bottle water they provide is cheap. Maybe I am just picky but for the same room rate, other 5-star hotel like Wynn Palace or Galaxy do better.",20
"Very Small lobby, no club lounge and only one restaurant in the hotel BUT Who cares about the small stuff as  The room are big and beautiful, there is a butler dedicated to each room to service you, and the hotel is connected to pretty much everything..",50
Went to The St Regis Macau for a one night stay. Check in was smooth and efficient and the staff member was very polite. The rooms are modern and have everything you would expect from St. Regis and more. The bed was really comfortable and I had a great sleep. The Manor restaurant has great choices for breakfast and lunch.  You must also visit their Bar which has great drink choices and all the staff are very friendly and knowledgable. The Bar also serves food until late if you are feeling hungry late into the evening. Definitely one of the best hotels in Macau if not the best !,50
"I spent 2 nites in March 2017 with St Regis Macao, and the experience is true to its reputation, a bespoke one.  My wife and I plus our 3 year old daughter were there for a brief get away retreat and to celebrate our silk wedding anniversary. I believe the initial contact and the ending check out was flawless. Prior to check in, we were contacted via email about how they could service us and kindly ask of our intention for the trip. And to our surprise, they did a beautiful pair of swan-like towel ornament on our bed, lined with flaming red flower patels. Also, a kid's stool, kid's tooth brush with rack stands, a kid's 2-in-1 shampoo shower with my daughter's favourite strawberry flavour was provided, and a kid's size bath robe that made her look really posh (we all loved it!)…",50
"A bit disappointed.  The hotel lobby is very small.  standard service quality which I was not impressed.  hotel room is okay, despite the view very so so.  We booked it through expedia +gold and was misled by expedia that we could have a free upgrade.  No such thing as advised by the reception staff.  The design of the refrigerator is non-sense.  Once you removed an item for 30 seconds it will charge you.  No space for you to store your own food in the refridgerator.  Received a complimentary small piece of cake and standard decoration for my wedding anniversary.  Not impressed again but still appreciated.  For the butler service, not impressed again.  We want to borrow a portable charger for my phone but was advised no such thing available.    There is a casino downstairs, so…",40
"My wife and I was visiting Hong Kong and decided to take a short trip to Macau. As Platinum member, I was recognized and thanked upon checkin. We were upgraded to a suite and a lady walked us up to the room and showed us around as well as how to work all 3 tvs in the room. The place was well kept and the bed was really comfortable. I'd definitely go back again on my next trip to Macau.",50
"I stayed for 3 nights and was upgraded to a beautiful suite . Thank you st Regis .  True to their reputation  , The service is professional yet friendly and warm. Room service and butler service - fast to respond and friendly . The lobby bar- Deco is beautiful / cozy and comfortable . Snacks we ordered were a disappointment.  Presentation was poor and the taste was not expected of st Regis 's standards at all .  Overall , it was wonderful and if You are  thinking of staying in  Macau , this is the only place to stay .  Love the fact that the lobby is small and cozy unlike the gigantic and huge lobbies of Venetian etc that leave searching .  ",40
"We stayed for a weekend (2N) in March. The personal butler service was exceptional. All the staff are very helpful and sincere. We had enjoyed the complementary coffee/tea throughout our short stay. We also had whole milk served warm for our son since we couldn't find any shop selling fresh milk in the Cotai Central Mall. Our room was on the 28/F, the view was nice. ",50
"Amazing experience start from the warm welcome by Felix from the Butler team. Limo pickup from the pier and the in room check-in.    For the room decoration, the Butler team assist for the towel-made puppy and the rose petals arrangement prior to my arrival and it led the room being more cozy and comfortable. The size of the room is bigger than I expected and I really like the control system by the tablet instead of the old-fashioned control panel.     I like the view which facing the Parisian and it is really nice in the evening time.    Just some recommendations,  1. More food options on Breakfast Buffet  2. Too dark inside the mini bar  3. Anti-slippery map should be placed in shower room prior to guest arrival    Thanks for the hospitality again and St.Regis is for sure the…",50
"The service of the hotel is excellent! The room was decorated with birthday surprise and the butler team, represented by Felix, sent a birthday cake and a hand-drawn card to my room upon my arrival! Warm water was sent immediately to my room when the weather was cold at night (I called to ask for water). I also like the small thoughtful details like the hand-written greeting cards in the room. Besides, I would like to compliment Ely from concierge for his great service, he is very friendly. I was surprised that the staffs at the front door recognised me and wished me happy birthday.  The location of hotel is great. Around 15 mins shuttle bus journey to airport and Taipa Ferry Terminal. Venetian and Parisian are also in walking distance. The only minus point is the variety of…",50
"Having stayed in most of the other hotels in Macau, I can safely say that the St Regis is in class of its own. The staff are clearly geared towards westerners staying there unlike every other hotel in Macau which focuses purely on china mainland tourists. Extremely knowledgably friendly staff and once again the butler service is excellent, having polished my shoes on arrival. When I left the hotel at about 3pm, to return that evening at about 8pm, I found that the butler has set my mood lighting lower, put slippers beside my bed and left an ice bucket and refreshments waiting for Add to dictionary impressive. All hotels know what you are doing at all times, but I like the way that the St Regis group put it to good use and it was wonderful to see. Bathroom and rain Shower truly…",50
"St. Regis is located in the middle of a field of many famous hotels in Taipa. It is connected to the three hotels of the Sands Cotai collection - Holiday Inn, Sheraton, and Conrad. The service is good, with its signature butler service. But the location is a bit unhandy for families. Since there are no buses that travel from the hotel itself, you will have to take the tourist buses at the other side of the hotel, the ones from Sands Cotai. You will have to take a 5-minute walk to the bus stops that go to the Macau Ferry Terminal, Border, Sands in Macau and Lotus Port The food there is good, delicious, with only one restaurant and bar (The Manor and the St. Regis Bar). The check-in was fast and the rooms are nice, with a new spin on it. You can get free coffee or tea anytime you…",40
I stayed in a suite with my family last summer. The room was very comfortable and stunning. We had views of all of the swimming pools outside and the other hotels. I would recommend this hotel while you are staying in Macau.,40
"This is the first time i stayed in St Regis Macau, and is defintely great experience in terms of service. Hotel has only 400 hundred rooms, so it is very efficient in responding guest's needs. Unlike Sheraton macao, which has 4000 rooms, room services take quite a while. I am staying with my 3year old kid, st regis macao has provided all amenities for the kids, like bathrope, stool,  kids toothbrush and toothpaste, shower gel, slippers that fits her age, small toys that keeps her happy. We enjoyed very much the heated pool and the jacuzzis, that we can all enjoyed swimmimg during winter time. Food is nice at Manor with lots of nice steaks, Nancy is helpful.  Check in check out is fast, Diogo is very nice and giving me useful suggestions. Overall all the staff are profession in…",50
"Stayed at the Ritz Carlton for CNY in 2016 so I thought I would try the St. Regis this year.  While the property is nice and the Sands Cotai layout is similar to the Galaxy, maybe even more convenient since it is connected to the Parisian, the Venetian the City of Dreams.  But, when it comes to the Room, the service and the culinary experience, the St. Regis is definitely not on par with the Ritz.  For example, every time you call for service, the message devotes 5 minutes reminding you in 3 languages that the conversation will be recorded.  Also, since there is no Lounge, the breakfast at the Manor seems ill prepared for the large crowd.  The food at the Manor is also average at best and selection limited. The staff is also poorly trained - they forgot to put new place mats…",30
"Stayed for one night, but already been served greatly all the way!  Excellent environment amd services!  Will try for sure in the future.  Even when cannot get a cab, staff hv offered alternative ways for us as well.  Handy phone helps my family alot as well",50
"One of the best hotel resort I've been stayed. The place itself is nice, our room facing Paris tower, a good view that makes us feel we are in the two country at the same time (France&macau). The Butler service is good, the pool is nice, the only restaurant manor is good. There is a bar but I didn't go.   The Staff there is amazing and pro active, thanks to Diogo, Marvin, Vicente  especially to butler porter Christian who in my opinion exceeding his performance, assisting us with professionalism, and well guided, enthusiasm, dedication, ( he can predict guest need) anticipation is always there.   Downside only is the check in/out que. need to be more organized.  Overall, is a must to try and visit the st. Regis macau.",50
"Nice cocktail with excellent service... Lovely music .. Thanks to Genevie, She is very attentive to our needs and requests, very smart and accommodating the whole time that we were there. The bartender also was excellent, .. we will surely stay at St. Regis hotel again next year. Hope to meet you again guys..",50
"From the moment we arrived, we were treated so nicely. Felt like we were movie stars as the level of service and the inclusion of the famous butler service was beyond amazing. All stay went if their way to make this a memorable stay. Absolutely would recommend.",50
"I strongly recommend this hotel to travellers who look for relaxing and quiet holiday with being pampered by all staffs and special service. I would like to specially thank to Chris who always smiled and remembered us and happy to guided and explained me, mum and aunties. I really appreciate him again and also I love Mannor where is the breakfast place so firmly recommend to include breakfast then you can enjoy v trendy and Morden interior with Lindsay Adellman lighting.",50
"Their service stood out the most for me, the friendly, professional, English speaking staff were very courteous and helped me with every thing I needed, when I needed it. The rooms are well worth the price, the environment they offer is a nice change of pace from the more party centric atmosphere right across the street at the Crown or Hard Rock hotel. The location, next to the venitian mall and t galleria, places it within walking distance of anything and everything you would want to do on the Cotai Strip, and it is one of the tallest hotels around the area, allowing for great views. My room was on the topmost floor and I truly enjoyed it. Well worth it, and I will be staying again in the future.",50
First time stay in St-Regis brand! All the staff was professional and nice!  Excellent service! Butler team was provided unforgettable experience to us. Especially in The Manor restaurant – Chef Henry Li ( Egg and noodles cooking station chef) he was great! do extra mile and attentive service. He was best in the restaurant. The St-regis Bar – Manager Paul Hu nice person and very attentive service.  For sure I will back for stay again.,50
"We stayed the weekend with our three kids and loved every moment! The check in was smooth and friendly, the kids got little gifts and we an upgrade to a larger suite! The special decoration in the room for my wife's birthday was very special and wonderful! In the evening the staff even picked us up in the restaurant across the street to bring us to the show afterwards. We all slept very well as it was very quiet and the beds are very comfortable. The breakfast is very good with a nice selection and good service. We will definitely come back the next time we come to Macao!!! The Steen family ",50
"During this weekend getaway to Macau, my family and I stayed at St. Regis for 3 nights.  This hotel is one of the best hotels we stayed and most family friendly one among rest of Macau hotels.  All the staff would greet to us in a very polite manner and be very proactive to offer support. During this trip, really would like to compliment the bell captain, Christian for his outstanding customer service and he helped us to save a lot of hassles.  Thank you very much and definitely would recognize you for your great service!",50
"Stayed here for a night with some friends, the room is quite large and brand new. Loved the bathroom, it was amazing.   Nothing too special to mention about the hotel, service was friendly although at times staff was a bit clueless for what you were asking for through the phone.  There is a casino downstairs and is relatively convenient to take a walk to some of the other hotels such as the Venetian.",40
"As a Platinum member of SPG, I had expectations whilst booking this hotel.  Those expectations were dashed as the rooms were filled up during the seasonal period and room availability for the larger rooms was tight.    It would be peculiar to give a 5 star hotel a rating of only average, but note that this is done as a direct comparison to the other Cotai Hotels in the same building link.  If I was comparing the St Regis to the one in Osaka, then it would receive 5 stars because of the pricing difference.  This wouldn't be a fair comparison.    I have stayed in all the Cotai strip Sands Group owned properties; St Regis, Conrad, Holiday Inn and Sheraton.  I have also stayed in the Venetian across the road, but I'll exclude this one from the comparison as the 4 hotel chains here…",30
"Great hotel at the north end of Sands Cotai Central, so conveniently located as well.  Excellent service staff, very smooth check-in process with very little queuing.  Would certainly recommend.  We actually enjoyed the breakfast a lot and found there was some variety from day to day.  The selection of course is smaller than Feast but the quality is very good.  Also used the fitness club (good equipment and not much used) and the spa (nice ambience and service).  Too cold to use the pools.  Room was nice, of average size but good furnishings and toiletries, with comfortable beds and good soundproofing.  TV selections limited though, especially for kids, and some channels had poor audio quality.  Room rate was not cheap but with breakfast included it was reasonable for the winter…",50
"Our first time to Macao. Aris, the Front Office Manager, Sunny, Mark & team were simply fabulous. We stayed for 2 nights then to HK. Aris & his team prepared for us a itinerary of places to go & most importantly info to come back to hotel safely.. Aris has a very deep understanding of the local culture despite being non local & of cos the brand ambassador. We returned from HK for 1 more night, and the team remembered us! Even our preference for contour pillow...totally Beyond Expectation!",50
"Went there twice in November. Was greeted friendly and butlers are very attentive, especially June. She was professional and willing to assist as always.   We had a very great time in st regis macao, except we lost some money in the casino haha. The bar is very nice and we are surprised with the presentation of their signature bloody mary. Very interesting that the guest can mix the cocktail themselves. Bar snack is also appetising.   Rooms are spacious and beds are comfortable with breathtaking Parisian view. Hardware is excellent because it is a new hotel. One thing that it may not be perfect is that the staff language is not up to standard. Some of the staff may not understand english very well. However, other things are so perfect. Wish to visit agin next time.",50
"St Regis Macau is an excellent choice if you want a nice, quiet, mostly hidden hotel without sacrificing location. This hotel is on the edge of the Cotai Central complex so you're right across the street from City of Dreams and connected to the Sheraton, and connected by bridge to the Venetian & the Parisian. It reminds me of staying in the Mandarin Oriental in Vegas.   St Regis bar is probably one of the better hotel bars in Macau and has an awesome high tea set and great drinks sets, like the Wine Flight (three tastings for $198). Prices are shockingly low for a St Regis.    I also appreciate how this hotel is not artificially scented up as many Macau hotels are prone to being. Rooms are large, comfy and smell great. Watch out for the mini-bars though, they're rigged to bill…",50
"My family had a great vacation at this hotel last October 2016.  I would say that it was one of our  best vacation in Asia.  We stayed for 2 nights with the whole family. My wife and I together with  the 4 children. The room was very relaxing and homey, staffs were very friendly. We met Gnevie Abuel at the bar, who gave us an excellent service. I would highly recommend this hotel to my friends. Wish we could go back next time.",50
"I've stayed in St Regis before and butler means butler. This hotel provides the butler service but not up to the expectation. The butler, cant remember the name, cant speak english well, cant differentiate left or right.  Also, we requested tea from different butlers all the time but a different person will come and deliver all the time. Which one should I tip then?  The concierge and bell boy were much more warm and knowledgeable.  Overall, for the price you pay at this hotel, only the room made it worth it. The facilities, swimming pool, spa etc is not up to par for a St Regis Starwood expectations.",30
"The St. Regis Macau was an excellent experience.  The check in process was smooth, the concierge recommendations were excellent, and the rooms were great.    I travel a ton (life-time SPG gold, working on platinum), but this visit was the first time I stayed at a St Regis.  I have to say I was blown away with the rooms.  They were gigantic suites, with guest bathrooms, technology-forward rooms, and beautiful marble bathrooms.  The view from my room was ""okay"", not sure if the other rooms have better views.  I did have a view of the pools, which look fantastic, it was just too cold to use it during my visit.  It was also nice to have a personal butler.  They were there to help if you need anything.  However, i think the service they provide varies by butler.  Some of my friends…",50
"St. Regis hotel has been the best days of my hotel stay life.  Stayed two nights in Macau for the first time during Thanksgiving 2016.  Originally, I was going to stay one night but with too much great service I had to extend my stay in Macau and shorten my stay in Hong Kong.  Hotel is connected to Parisian and very close to Venetian, Studio City and Sheraton - a historic hotel in Macau from SPG chain, walkable distance.  I would love to go back any time.  They provide a shuttle across the bridge to get to more tourist sites such as Senado Square, Monte Fort etc so staying in this part of island was not a bad idea at all.",50
"Two days before arrival, I got an email from this hotel asking for any special arrangement needed and providing me detailed information of transportation, including a photo of the free shuttle. The excellent service started even before the trip! We checked in on Thursday around 1:30 pm, and they let us check in before the official check-in time at 3 pm. We were seated comfortably when check-in was processed, not like in some other hotels where guests have to stand up when checking in. After check-in, the butler ushered us to our rooms, showed us the amenities in the room and how to operate all electronic devices. A mobile phone was provided so we could make out-going phone calls locally in Macau and to Hong Kong for free. The butler told us all the service included, such as…",50
"Gloria and I took the trip of a lifetime (I proposed in Tokyo!  And she said yes!).  One of our stops was Macau, and we stayed at the St. Regis Macao.    The thing about hotels is that at a certain price level, they're all the same: beautiful, comfortable, elegant, with good service.  What distinguishes St. Regis Macao from its peers is the sincerety of the staff's good service.    Some examples: the hotel staff had set up our room with swans made of towels, sprinkled with rose petals (thank you again, St. Regis), the joy they had when seeing Gloria and my expression was so geniune, and then when they offered to take a picture of us in front of the display, they took the extra step and moved our coats out of the way to have a better shot.  Another example, when we asked…",50
"I'd like to start this review by first saying that while originally booking our stay in Macau through SPG, we realized the rates for the nearby Sheraton and St. Regis were identical. We'd stayed at Sheraton's in the past without any complaints, and were about to continue with an ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" mindset, until we came across the words ""St. Regis Butler Service"". That phrase alone was enough to create a certain level of intrigue among us that we all felt compelled to experience for ourselves. After a short debate, we quickly chose St. Regis.  It was at this point that we simultaneously made both our best and worst decisions of our stay in Macau: the best decision was choosing to stay at St. Regis, while the worst decision was only booking one night!  This was my…",50
"Very nice a hotel with excellent service. From the moment we walked out of the ferry arrivals the staff and driver to pick us up for the very short commute to hotel were very pleasant and professional. The welcome at the hotel by Tony, the head butler, was very welcoming and highly professional. We were immediately whisked to our suite with check-in there. Everything works perfectly with a great gym, nice pools and excellent staff. Macau does not have many western touristts or business men but the level of English has greatly improved and its excellent at the St. Regis. The hotel is perfectly located for all the malls, casinos or restaurants along the Cotai strip. I was attending a bankers conference and the opening cocktail reception was next door in the Sheraton and the gala…",50
"Checking into the St. Regis in Macao is a special treat in itself.  From the moment you walk into the beautifully decorated lobby, the lovely staff works their pampering and magic on you. The hotel is gorgeous, quiet, large but not enormous, so it still has an ""intimate"" feel to it. If you are lucky enough to have a butler (we went midweek and caught a special sale posted online) we were able to upgrade our room for a few more dollars. Jason (our fabulous butler) was able to get us drinks, return ferry reservations, dinner reservations and directions to Downtown Cotai to see the old cobblestone streets that adorn this beautiful and historic island with a quick run to his office or a phone call. Not being big gamblers, we were able to take full advantage of the warm sunny pool,…",50
" 👍服務人員親切溫暖、預訂資訊提供完整、餐飲選擇依季節承現；選擇樣式精緻、值得一提的是在澳門服務能如此周到 實在少見！值得再訪 Nice service, warm welcome Warm hospitality... especially the high quality of service since it's the most important part to have a wonderful memory. ",50
"The place is relaxing but the food is not that good. They serve breakfast buffet exactly the same everyday 😔. Staff(s) are very nice and friendly especially Genevie Abuel, Francis and Enzo (st. Regis bar). ",30
"I stayed at the St. Regis hotel in Macao for the first time last week. The service is simply amazing. They upgraded me to a junior suite because of my SPG status. The butler service is very personal. All of the staff know you by name, and they are very willing to assist in any way. I ordered breakfast in the room, and did not eat the figs in my granola. The next morning when I ordered the same thing, they had already taken the figs out of my cereal without me even asking. That's service!",50
"We booked the Sheraton and while we waited to check in, we were approached Aris the front office manager, and offered an upgrade to the St Regis. We happily accepted the generous offer, and found ourselves in this truly sumptuous, and luxurious hotel. Huge room , fantastic facilities, including massive tv, Bose sound system, tv in bathroom, massive comfortable bed, loads of power points and charging facility, and even a complimentary use of a mobile phone. The location is perfect, away from the hustle and bustle, but within reach of the Macau attractions by a, short walk. There is a terrific well equipped gym, an amazing pool, and the friendliest staff on the planet. Thanks Aris, I will most certainly be back, the hotel was everything you promised, and more.",50
Fantastic view in the poolside!! Nice swimming pool. Very polite staff and good service from the poolside bar. Thanks to Ms. Genevive and her colleague... I will surely book to this hotel on my next visit.,40
"It was an occasion to book a table at Manor St Regis to meet a friend for some business during lunch. The design of Manor is comfortable, good table arrangement (simple and appropriate), space and reasonable prices of executive lunch sets. It is even more desirable for friends to enjoy good quality of beef steaks and variety of meat available. I prefer seafood and pork more so I have ordered a set of 3 courses including soup, main course and dessert.",40
"Matt is perfect, wine set is perfect, service is absolutely amazing. As a hotelier I'm more picky than regular guests but I can say the experience was fabulous after a long day of work. And, ask for Matt when you visit, your experience will be plus plus:) ",50
Upon arrival from the Ferry terminal shuttle you sort of have to find your own way of getting to the hotel inside Sand Cotai Central.  Basically you have to walk past the Holiday inn entrance and also was some construction close to the interior entrance of the hotel. The lobby was rather humble and small which I like especially after seeing so many huge lobbies with masses of people.  During the daytime there's no line ups and you just sit to check in.  Diogo and Sunny were ever present to make sure everything runs smooth with personnel at the front.  Everyone was helpful and friendly  I booked a St Regis suite and there was a very minor problem with the room which they had found before my arrival.  It shows they have fairly good quality control.  I was offered a two step…,50
"The Metropolitan Suite offers a superb view of the Cotai Stripe.  With the opening of the Eiffel Tower in the Parisien Hotel, the glittering tower becomes the gem of the night view at Cotai Stripe.  This Suite has captured the best of the scenery at night.  The Butler Team has its name of efficiency and their arrangements always make me feel at home when staying in the St. Regis Macao.  The welcome amenities are heart-warming.  The size of the Metropolitan Suite is exactly right to make us (a family of four) feel comfortable.  Nothing is extra, in the Suite.  I highly recommend this Suite for anyone who would like to stay in the St. Regis Macao.",50
"We requested for a non-smoking room on a non-smoking floor but on one occasion coming out of the lift, we have seen cigarette buds (yes, a few!) lying around several spots of the marbled lift lobby as well as the top of the trash can. I think this is probably a Macau-wide issue that high-end hotels such as St Regis or other SPG hotels have to face on a daily-basis (with the casino giving out free rooms to gamblers). The issue I have is why, after quite a few years of operations, have they not come up with a solution in addressing this kind of situation? It is very unfair to true non-smokers and families who have definitely paid more than the guests who received these rooms for free through the casinos but aren't treated with the same level of respect. Simply saying that you…",30
"Nothing short of spectacular, we went to St Regis around 6 months ago, what an amazing hotel, newly built and conveniently located. The service from staff and concierge are outstanding, immaculate suite room with amenities. Delicious breakfast in the morning, thank you for a fanatic trip, can't recommend this highly enough. Looking forward to our return trip. Much love from a SPG Gold loyal =)",50
"4 days in Macao is perfect only with St Regis. Trust that all your needs will be taken cared of.    St. Regis Macao's Bloody Mary: not to be missed.  Let the experts do their job which they do so ever well: - exclusive and intimate tours - authentic experience - EGG-cellent breakfasts - food and wine to satisfy all tastebuds (really... ALL!) - pampering in the spa  Great also for families with children - with spacial arrangements with Dreamworks. As adults, we had a blast!  Special mention goes to Edward from concierge and Francis' butler-ship.",50

"The St Regis is great hotel with great staff and who  are truly helpful, polite and sincere about their services. The staff who stood out for me was, Ms Toni Xu, who helped organised our trip to Hong Kong, she in my opinion went out of her way. I appreciate that kind of service.   Thank you St Regis Macau",50
"Dear St Regis Macao, Thank you for a wonderful stay. Sadly it was a short trip to Macao for me, so only had one night in this amazing property. I have been familiar with and loved the St Regis brand for a few years so I knew I wanted to try this property while visiting Macao. From the ferry terminal I took the free shuttle bus to the Venetian and from there it is an easy walk across the street to St Regis. They very kindly accommodated a 12pm early check in for me and even upgraded my room to a deluxe room with a fantastic view over the Cotai Strip. Very lovely butler escorted me to my room, and I was greeted with fresh fruits and a handwritten welcome note from the head butler. Room was beyond luxurious and huge, especially as I was travelling alone. Beautiful amenities and…",50
"The relatively poor rating is all down to the fact that it is branded as Starwood's top tier and my expectations were expectantly high.  The hotel just lacks any character or soul; it is not awful by any stretch of the imagination, but bland and boring.  The Lobby is relatively small,  but that's fine, nice not to have a typical over the top Macau Lobby; but the reception area on the first floor is awful; it feels like an after thought next to the entrance to a Casino and a very uninspiring corridor to other Cotai hotels and shopping. Sitting down to check in you just want to be anywhere else.  The restaurant is so unappealing, a whole row of glass exit doors onto the same uninspiring corridor to shops and again feels like an after thought to the design.   The room, one word…",20
"You get what you pay for at St Regis. We had a weekend stay during our short visit to Macau. Getting to the hotel was simple enough: you take the bust shuttle to Holiday Inn and walk through the arcade. The welcome and checking was fast and friendly. Our room was luxurious and big though the window view was nothing much. Location was near to the casinos and you can even walk to the Old Taipa village where you can dinner at Antonio's in the evenings. Gym and pool were good. Butler service was an interesting addition. We got served tea upon arrival and throughout the day. I even had two shirts ironed at no extra charge. Good service though I would not rate it overly high. Overall, an enjoyable stay at this hotel.

"The staff is excel Enzo the bartender has a craft of making a really good ""Carpe Diem"" even takes the time to explain how it's made along with the idea of making it. The host are very welcoming to customers upon arriving and leaving the facility. The supervisor Matt is amazing when it comes to customer service and knowledge of the drinks. Very relaxing area with different choices of seating arrangements and good live music. Would highly recommend coming here after a long days work. ",50
"I love the st.regies brand since i had stayed st.regies Bail for 2 nights a few years ago. So st.regis Macau was my first choice this time. This is a well-organized hotel. the staffs there were kind and butler services were helpful. we have stayed for 2 nights, the room was clean and big enough. We both like the water in the shower room, it was very comfortable. The high-tea in st.regies bar was awesome.  The only one defect was the smell from the passage to rooms! We both felt stuffy in the passage not like the lobby has its fragrance.  In addition, I'd like to complain about the shuttle bus in the Cotai Central! our bad experience was happened on the shuttle bus from Cotai Central to the Airport around 17:00 on 10/10/2016.  We were queuing in the front but when the bus had…",50

"A new hotel (opened December 2016), it has found its feet quickly.  From the moment you enter the hotel the service is slick and attentive.  The rooms are plush, well equipped but not overstated, with big rooms and very comfy beds as standard (no idea what a suit is like, I just had a standard room).  If your working then the only desk space is a small table, but otherwise great rooms.  Butler service is a nice touch, although I made very little use of it, but they'll bring you tea or coffee (complimentary) at any time of the day or night, and press (iron) 2 items of clothing a day for you (also complimentary, they will do more, but there is a fee).  The hotel has 2 nice outdoor pools on the pool deck (a little short for swimming lengths, but doable) as well as 2 large hot tub…",50
"From the moment you walk into the hotel lobby, all the staff there are waiting to help you. They seat you at a desk and take care of you properly. My boyfriend and I had tea served while checking in. From there, our butler, Jun, introduced himself to us. He and his assistant walked us to our room, showed us everything within the quarters. Jun knew we were late to our dinner reservation so everything was a rush. I desperately needed an adapter for my curling iron, and he was quick to retrieve it. We went to our dinner and when we returned, I was astonished that down to the doorman remembered our names! It was very impressive. The room itself was very nice. The bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was to die for. I especially loved the monitor inside the mirror.   The following…",40
"We never stayed at a St. Regis because there are not many in Asia and at first when I booked St. Regis Macao, I saw some very poor reviews on their website in January and December when it was first opened. So I was hoping that they could make it up in time for our stay especially when I would expect at least the same level of service as the four seasons and Ritz Carlton. It turns out to be a perfect stay and we decided that to return whenever we are back in Macau in future.   We booked the typical deluxe room only and everything from bed, amenities, furniture, equipment were flawless. Our room was on 36/F which is the highest possible floor for guestrooms with a nice view towards the city of dreams and Venetian. Everything in the room were apparently well thought of in details.…",50

Check in is so smooth and relax, doesn't like other having a long queue. Sit relax and get my room at the lobby. Hotel is not opened entirely, some places such as main entrance hall is still under construction. Swimming pool and gym are opened but the pool is disappointing. 5* hotel designed two pools and a Jacuzzi but it is only opened a small pool.

"Had a terrific single night stay at the St. Regis in Macau with a girlfriend for a girls night out. Check in was warm and friendly and personalized. Everyone from the bellhops to those working the front desk exuded a welcome balance of warmth and professionalism. The efforts they made to remember us by our names was commendable.  The room is also terrific - on par with other St. Regis' I've stayed in. Sizeable and tastefully decorated with the utmost attention to detail. Bathrooms had double sinks and the beds were comfortable. There were plenty of outlets for the multiple electronic devices throughout the room.  What made this stay even better was the exemplary butler service. I have yet to stay in a St. Regis where the butler greeted me upon arrival to my floor, so it was a…",50
"We spent just one night in Macau, but the service that we experienced at the St. Regis was incredible. Sunny Chin and Brahms Zhao both went out of their way to make us feel right at home - they provided input on our agenda and made sure we were set up for our ferry ride to Hong Kong for our flight home. The room upgrade was incredible - best view on the strip. Breakfast was so delicious as well! As a SPG Platinum member, I've had my fair share of wonderful breakfasts at SPG hotels, but this was definitely at the very top. I'd highly recommend the St. Regis as your home base for a stay in Macau.",50
"This property is one of the newest and finest in Macau. If you're not into casinos this hotel offers a chance to enjoy a brand new St Regis.  The night before I stayed at the next door Conrad which since I have the highest status was wonderful.  However, two notable people really made my stay enjoyable- Sunny, who is one of the managers really showed interest in advising us where to go in Macau, in a very classy way so we thank him so very much.  Felix from the concierge also offered amazing personal service.  Both gentleman remembered my wife's birthday and we owe them to our lovely stay.  ",50
"Just a quick update on a recent visit.  The service has become more efficient and streamlined. Rooms are still very nice and are now in tip top condition.   One big issue remains that is really annoying. STOP shutting down the room A/C when the room door opens and closes!  There is an automated program that shuts down the A/C when the ""smart"" system thinks you have left the room. This has to be the single most annoying penny pinching move (probably under the guise of being environmentally green).  Especially in the summer, every time I returned to the room it was warm and unpleasant because the A/C shut down.  Stop it please.  This is a 5 star hotel right? I want to come back to a comfortable and cool room.  I'm sure I'm not the only guest that has complained about this issue. …",40
Came here for a weekend with my wife and daughter. The hotel is in the middle of everything but somehow manages to keep a quiet peaceful exclusive environment away from all the noise and distractions. The hotel was full but never did it feel like the other hotels in Macau with masses and chaos. Front desk check in was efficient and friendly. I told them I was spg and was given priority check in which was a nice touch. The staff smiled and greeted you as you walked by. Really welcoming feeling as you stepped in.  I booked a metropolitan suite. Room size was average but very classy and comfortable. Only complaint was that a few channels on tv didn't work. The views of the Venetian from the room was amazing.  I received a small gift for being an spg member. Seems they really do…,50

"Was a new property, hence the teething issues but nothing to complain about. The service was fantastic. Bellmen, Butler, Front Office were extremely efficient and courteous throughout the stay.  Had a serious ceiling leakage outside the bathroom started just after 1am on the night I stayed. The dripping noise was rather loud and caused some sleeplessness. But to the the hassle of shifting rooms, it was not brought up till the next morning, when it was promptly rectified.  No turndown service as I arrived rather late. Breakfast was average.  Overall, a rather average stay.",30
"Stayed in the Grand Deluxe Room for 2 nights, was very impressed by the how sweet the service is and how friendly and helpful the staffs are. Convenient shuttle bus service from Taipa Ferry Terminal to the hotel. Just rmb to get off at the Holiday Inn station and walk to St Regis while only private transfer / taxi will stop right at the St. Regis Entrance. Bulter Service is still their 'proud' but honestly I just don't know how to fully utilize Bulter service LOLLLLLLLL but they are definitely the key to make my stay pleasant and personalized. Breakfast at Manor is awesome with wide variety of choice, but we came a bit too late so some of them are gone already. I love the pools!!!!! The pool area is very private and spacious even in a Sunday Afternoon. I love the wardrobe 'room'…",50
"From the moment I checked in, to when i sadly had to leave, I was totally blown away by the personalised attention to detail and authentic hospitality offered by all staff. Mr. D. Monteiro who checked me in and out was very friendly and a great conversationalist. The famous St. Regis Butlers did their jobs with gusto, and although I didn't have a chance to dine at the Manor, the breakfast is reputedly very very worth a try. Very impressed with the Madeleines offered to me in my room, which are the hotel's signature pastry apparentely! Most definitely will be staying here again.",50
Beautiful hotel in Cotia. The shuttle conveniently connects to hotel from the aiport. Extremely professional staff. The check in is process was quick. We were escorted to our room. The butler explained about all the features of the room. The front office staff( cannot recollect the name) helped us with the map of the city to guided us. And also had given valuable inputs for quick visit to city.   Room service was very efficiency.   The room was spacious and great layout.Bathroom is very well designed.   Would recommend this hotel if one wants to stay in Cotai strip.,50
"Spend a Pool party weekend in Macau. We booked this classy hotel with around 400 rooms which we like it not because other surrounding hotels all have more then 600 rooms. As soon as we checked in a butler come to our room and give us greeting. We have choice of complimentary coffee or tea. Extreamly comfortable mattress and pillows provide us super sweet dream--even my friends can skip her ""sleeping pills"" of the nights. Then we have in-room breakfast at morning. This delicious in room breakfast consits of ""WHOLE BREAKFAST manu"" that enough for 2 person when we just order for 1 person.  Beautiful swimming pool where we took alots of memorable sexy pictures!!",50
"We have chosen to stay in this hotel and we have expectation that the butler services from St Regis would provide us something different. A few days before our arrival, we have received e-mail from the butler team asking us our requests.  Upon our arrival, everything was ready and we were so pleased that our requests have been fully arranged and more importantly, we were traveling with a couple of senior people and the hotel really took good care! I don't have to spend time describing the hotel rooms as they are very spacious and comfortable. I must take this opportunity to thank again the good work done by the butler team as well as the concierge team and our special thanks to the front desk manager Sunny Chin. I believe the hotel will be one of the best hotels in Macau…",50
The Hotel is at excellent location interconnected to the Sheraton and the Conrad. Also the shopping district of Four seasons is connected as well. The service and the food in both IRD AND ROOM SERVICE is the next level to any of the other hotels nearby. The hotel is located in the main district of Cotai Street. The Butler in the room was also excellent. I gave a shirt for ironing and the shirt came back in less than 7 mins. The level and the quality of everything in the Hotel is just at its best.,50
"I stayed one night with my husband in the past weekend.  The room was excellent with all the facilities well equipped. I would like to mention is their team work and professional service: I checked out on Sunday around 11:30am and then heading to another hotel to have Brunch.  Around 1:30pm, I received a call from the hotel and double check if I have checked out or not.  Their staff found that I've left my ring in the room! Oh yes, I totally forgot that I've left my wedding ring at the bathroom!!  Luckily their staff help me to keep it.  I got back to hotel that night and collect back my ring. I'm really appreciated for all your staff's assistance and I will definitely choose to stay at your hotel when I visit Macau in future!  Thank you.",50
"Macau is an island to easy access of hotel and casino thanks to the complementary buses 24/7.  I was there for a hotel hop for a night in  St Regis Cotai. From the Harbour to the hotel, I managed to hop on to the Sands bus (that indicate to St Regis) but however missed the stop due to not drop off point at the lobby of St Regis. You have to drop at Conrad and walk into the narrow path to the side of the hotel check in counter.  The check in is fast and smooth and within 5 minutes I could able to get my room card and check in procedure done. The Butler introduced himself and was usher to the room.  The room was simplify, cosy, spacious yet luxury and the view was beautiful, able to see hard rock hotel and far view of Macau main island.   The breakfast was kinda limited choice…",30
"This is my first stay in a St Regis hotel chain and it was perfect. The first thing you enter the hotel someone will greet you and you will feel very welcome. The room was well equip with an Illy capsule espresso machine with lots of option for coffee and tea, they have a butler when you arrive to tour you inside the room and offer you some tea or coffee.  The toiletries is in the high quality and all of the controls of the room can be controlled using the tablet inside the room like the curtains, aircon temp, tv, lightings etc. ",50
"I stayed here for 4 nights early August. The experience was amazing from check-in to check-out. I got an email before arrival from Echo (butler team) inquiring about my purpose of travel etc. I replied that I am visiting my gf who works in the hotel biz in Macau. Another team member replied suggesting that they will prepare something special for us. It was definitely SPECIAL. My girlfriend and I checked in around 12pm. People were really courteous! Served some kind of tasty tea during the check-in process. Booked deluxed, upgraded to deluxe with cotai strip view (perfect view of the Parisian Eiffel Tower, especially beautiful at night with the lights on)! Gary helped us with our luggage up where we met Kloey who greeted us as our butler. Both really courteous and smiling the…",50
"Recently stayed with my wife and two young kids for a couple of nights.  Overall was very impressed with the service and facilities.  The rooms (we were in a St Regis Suite) are a perfect size for young families.  The little added extras (e.g. kids robes/slippers/toiletries/gifts and even a little stool so they can reach the sink) were a great touch and made us feel very welcome.  Butler service was also good - with tea and cofee (and even some added extras) provided for free whenever you desired.  The pool was good and the location works very well for being able to walk to City of Dreams, Venetian etc.  The only thing that let it down was the breakfast (lack of variety in terms of Western choices, cold food etc), but overall we would definitely return.",50
"The St Regis has a boutique hotel feeling. Compared to what's around, it's tiny... it has about 400 rooms. I guess for Macau standards one could say it's microscopic. I arrived in the early evening, and I was checked in by this very nice and kind young receptionist. He also gave me some good tips about Macau. Once I arrived at my room, it didn't take much time that my butler introduced herself. Unfortunately I was in a rush, and had to cut her short. What I greatly appreciated was the welcome amenity; they clearly did their homework... thanks to SPG (and no, I am not Platinum!). This is why it felt even more special. The views were spectacular, I enclosed Some pictures... Their bar, is really a nice place. The wait staff is very switched on and attentive. And in a very charming…",50
"I had stayed in this Hotel since its opening last December .  The service had tremendously enhanced since then and the staffs had shown greater professionalism to make it a very pleasant stay .  However , the breakfast quality had rapidly deteriorated since opening .  Nevertheless is still a good spot for a quiet and relaxing stay . ",40
"In July, I took my family to St. Regis for 3 nights. This is not our first visit and they are well know for their professional service. I'd like to give compliment to its front desk reception and as well as its breakfast restaurant, the Manor. The waiter, Tul, is outstanding! His service and friendliness makes our stay even more pleasant! ",50
"As a seasoned traveller and especially multiples trips to macau on my business seminars, I am honestly very surprised by the standard that St Regis Macau has.  Although it is new, the staff and management are very dedicated to service. The location may be slightly off but the other strengths more than make up for this, I am also very impressed with the front desk manager, Mr. Aris for always going out of his way to make sure i am well taken care of.  The stark difference with the usual mammoth hotel brands cannot even come close to the standard St regis Macau has set. This benchmark is not an experience of a single stay but over the course of staying with them since opening, the improvements it has made and constantly accommodating with excellent service orientated staff…",50
"Stayed at the St Regis for a night. I will say this is truly a 6 star experience which is worth paying the money for. Service was excellent and consistent from arrival till departure. We were greeted by everyone and director of rooms, Mr. Alexander Wessels did a great job ensuring we experience a smooth check in which made us felt warm as well. Butler Chico and Yap also did an amazing job delivering our needs in a professional and efficient manner. We booked the deluxe cotai view room and it was awesome. Handcrafted furnitures with a touch of luxury and elegance.   Hotel is jusy located at the Cotai Central thus shopping and dining is VERY convenient. The hotel's restaurant Manor looks good, too bad i dint have the chance to try. I was trying to think of something negative about…",50
"It's not very often that I say this, but the St. Regis in Cotai Macao is the city's best kept secret. It's lush, the food is just spectacular (try the Belgian waffles for breakfast at The Manor, it's to die for!) and the service and people are just pure quality. We arrived in the morning, and our room was already ready! We had called ahead and mentioned that we had kids with us, so they went all out an made sure the kids felt super welcome.. lots of little amenities for them and the little madelines and virgin bloody mary's that they serve on arrival - AMAZING! Check-in was a total breeze - its not crowded and you don't have a walk a mile through throngs of people and luggage to get to the room. The pool is perfect, warm and the staff just superb. We loved our show breakfast -…",50
Hotel room was comfortable. Amazing hair dryer made in Switzerland which was ultra light weight that we have to take a picture of it. Service was excellent - helping us to make reservation for a Portuguese restaurant in Venetian. Provided a gift each for the kids.,50
We stayed here 3 nights -  I think this property does not live up the St Regis name - Its a hotel but not resorty like the others.  I don't think this hotel should carry the St Regis name.  There is nothing wrong - the staff were overly amazing and love what they do.,40
"Stayed at St Regis twice since it opened last year.  Our first visit was very impressive.  We arrived around 9pm for check-in and the procedure was smooth , Then,  our bulter came to greet us and suggested serving us tea with honey which were perfect and very thoughtful.  The breakfast at Manor was good though not big. After staying at St Regis the very first time,  we stayed there again in April. It became much busier and the restaurant no longer quiet.  We found that some food such as the very tasty yoghurt is no longer served.  Though we saw the chefs busy with refilling food, the eaters are even faster. Outdoor Swimming pool was just opened,  the first day was with warm water which could have our swim comfortably. But the second day was with rather cold water which we need…",40
St Regis Macau has only been open about 6 months.  I had the pleasure of a brief one night stay a few weeks ago and couldn't have been more impressed.  In the heart of the Cotai Strip the hotel is attached to the same complex as the 4000 room Sheraton with its massive conference facilities - but does an incredible job of offering intimacy and a boutique feel.  As a St Regis guest you expect the quality infrastructure - but the service was also second to none.,50
"My neighbour and I (together with our families) spent a weekend in Macau and could not have chosen a better hotel. We have stayed in quite a few in Macau - including the Four Seasons, Conrad, Grand Hyatt and Mandarin Oriental - and while they were all of a very high standard, the St. Regis trumps them with its personal touch.  We were greeted personally by the Director of Rooms, Mr. Alex Wessels, who ensured a seamless check-in experience. When he heard that we had also booked rooms in a neighbouring hotel for a couple of fellow travelers, he personally (and discreetly) made a call to that hotel to secure an upgrade. We were then shown around the spacious and beautiful suite by our butler, who also promptly brought in complimentary refreshments. The hotel had also kindly set our…",50
"Wow. We were incredibly impressed by the service at the St. Regis Macao. We went in with high expectations and our expectations were surpassed. Our butler Gary was so helpful--he anticipated our needs before we even knew we had them and helped us have a great visit. Similarly, the details of the room were incredibly well thought out from the automatic curtains to the weather report card on our bed. We highly recommend this hotel.",50
"The Hotel is well located and suitable for any business meeting as it has extensive meeting facilities. Rooms are clean and people are attentive. I would stay at this Hotel again, even privately with our family.",40
"I saw an opening special for the hotel of $1,888 and decided to take advantage of it as opening specials are usually excellent.  I secured a room months in advance but was disappointed to watch promotions come up which continued to drop below the price I paid and then have extras thrown in also.  I felt penalized for being so committed and organized to trying out this hotel!  The spa was difficult to book at.  I saw an ad on facebook and couldn't for the life of me find the contact phone number on the ad or spa webpage. I rang the hotel and asked to be put through to the spa.  It seemed I was put through to the bar instead and they tried to again transfer me to the spa but no one answered.  I continued to call back later that day.  I would have preferred to have made a request…",30
"Service throughout especially on food and beverage side has great scope of development. Meal quality and choices can be improved. I stayed in a room looking out onto the outdoor pool of Hard Rock Hotel and was bombarded by their hard rock music from late afternoon till late evening. There's no where in the hotel to go for escape from this serious pollution.  The main entrance is on the side; so private that no taxi would come even on call! Of course I'm an ordinary tourist not wanting the luxury of going to Cotai ferry terminal on a chauffeur driven limousine. No shuttle either. I ended up getting a taxi from the hotel next door! Fortunately, l travelled light. There is no survey received after my stay. I've always enjoyed St. Regis hotels such as the ones in Bankok and…",30
"We had booked a suite and it's very spacious with one living room, one bedroom and big bathroom. The butler and staffs are friendly. You almost have everything for stayin overnight in the room, including facial wash. The bed is also comfortable. The room is quite. I like here very much.  The hotel is very close to the ferry and airport, it's convenient if you travel from hk or other cities.",50
"The St Regis is a beautiful newly built hotel in Macau. Room are very well appointed and the Butler service is an excellent touch. The staff could not be any more helpful here. Hope to stay again. Great hotel that I can recommend absolutely, in a stunning city.",50
"We experience the most satisfied service, most pleasant stay here. Staffs are all generally helpful and provide us with extra services than the other same category's hotels. Our room are so comfortable we have nothing to pick on. Food quality are above average. Location is convenient too as it's just next to city of dreams and Venetian. Great place to stay. ",50
Stayed in this hotel with family. Absolutely stunning!!. Personalised service ensured by the butler service. Good veiw of Cotai from the room. Special care taken to ensure that guests enjoy every moment of their stay in this wonderful city,30
With couple of friend to spent time to enjoy very much of service from Pattrawut *Tul we ordered white wine is good one abd 40%off. Foods portion are reasonable look.All delicious. Chef approch to say hi and ask. Overall is good ambience. Only room is quit dark. Need prepare light for guest to see the menu. KK,50
"When things are very good, it is also worth taking the time to share. We just come back from Macau and simply had a wonderful stay at St Regis with a special mention to the Concierge and the pool team Francis & Frank Lo. Thank you!  We shall be back in the future,and certainly not only for the location and the many casinos & shopping nearby but surely for the top hospitality you share with your guests.  ",50
"I stayed in St Regis Macao for two nights right before the Labor Day. Check-in was smooth; Butler service was timely and responsive; upgrade (to Grand Deluxe Room only) was the best they could do before the grand holiday in the Mainland; Breakfast was a bit chaotic but wins in quantity and quality; the SPA was excellent; Gym and pool are not huge but cozy and well attended, and I even had dinner and lunch in the hotel's different outlets. They are greatly improved compared with my visit a few weeks ago.",40
"Was traveling to Macau on early March 2016. During check in was a bit delayed due to high occupancy, but it was fine for me. Room was great so do the butler service is outstanding. St. Regis Bar staffs was attentive and friendly when I visited the bar, the drinks and environment is fantastic. Definitely will visit again next time.",50
"Going to the hotel was a bit strange - there were no signs of it and you had to ask which bus to take.   Absolutely stunning hotel. After reading quite poor reviews of this place we decided to book it for a night since the rates are superb for a st. regis. I must say this hotel is the very definition of luxury travel. Everything is so beautiful, from the living room to the changing area and bathroom. It is not uncomfortably glitz like some hotels, but so beautiful and comforting! Upon Check in, we were upgraded from a regular suite to the metropolitan suite (same size, just better view - you face the venetian) by the manager from Singapore. The check in process was perfect - a western manager rushed out to pull chairs for us and each check in was done at the desk. We signed up…",50
"The St Regis macau is a very new hotel in Cotai area, location is great and very convenient, the room and facility is great and beautiful, I'd say service to be improved, it is not bad but not good enough, I will come back to stay again and hope it'll gets better.",30
"Words are not enough to express my gratitude with the St Regis Macao team. From front office to rooms to recreation their service always exceed guest expectations. We have checked in to celebrate my niece birthday. Rich from Front office gave us a very nice view and comfortable bed plus the fact that their  manager Aries  welcome us with a warm smile. Rich then escorted us to our room ,after that a beautiful Butler June introduced the rooms feature and offer beverage to drink.around 630 I asked for coffee one more time and butler super gorgeous Blair serve the coffee and asked if she can set up the kids amenity. It's more than a five star service . Everything you need is there and they anticipate guest needs without being asked. the fruit amenity and birthday amenity were…",50
"The hotel couldn't do enough for us. They corresponded with me prior to the stay to make sure to address any requests I might have. When I got there they knew who I was prior to identifying myself. They gave us a large, beautiful room.   When I asked for directions, they would walk with you part of the way to make sure you knew where you were going. There were delicious pears in the room.   I had a massage and being a SPG gold member, they gave me an extended massage without my asking for it.   My only regret was that I only booked 1 night here. Thank you to all the staff here for your amazing hospitality. In all of my travels you are one of the best!",50
"Booked the deluxe room at this hotel a few days in advance. We found out that the rate online was cheaper on the day we checked in and hence we requested for a match of lower rate. Though the lower rate was not match, we were given a room to match the corresponding rate instead. Throughout the process, the front office manager, Aris, was very accommodative and helpful. He did his best with his team to ensure that our stay is pleasant, from offering free cocktails at the bar, a bottle of prosecco and a box of chocolate to making reservation for dinner.  Overall, we had a pleasant and memorable stay.",50
"The butler services is good and it's a great hotel in this area of Sands. It's not like the other hotel you see waves of visitors and a noisy place. This hotel you see some peace. The swimming pool is great and we have spent some good time there with the family and friends. The hot and cold pool is interesting.  You may like to explore the other area for food, overall in Macau it's a little bit pricey now. ",50
"There are many  excellent things about the hotel but I think there are a variety of teething problems.   Lights in the room are all or nothing, it seems impossible to get pleasant low lighting. The room looks unfinished in a way; they are large but seem empty, as if some items are not yet in the room. Furnishings are bright and not really to my personal taste, it looks less classy than I would expect for the price. The lack of a desk despite having so much space seems strange, as does keeping the hairdryer in the living room rather than the dressing room. Using the shower head in the bath is very difficult as it just springs back to it's holder constantly. Water pressure in the shower is a bit variable.    Service is very friendly indeed - Stella and the team in the bar in…",30
This hotel is part of the Starwood chain. It is one of the best hotel in Cotai and the only one that provides you with your own butler. This is an unforgettable experience because you will deal with this person exclusively with your needs. He or she will even help you pack and unpack to shining your shoes for you. All staff is polite and helpful. I highly recommend this hotel and my family will definitely come back again.,50
"I recently stayed at the St. Regis on the second night of a two night stay at Sands Cotai. The first was at the Conrad in the same complex.  I walked over from the Conrad through the corridors and casino. It was literally a five minute walk. As I entered the lobby area I was struck at how nice the hotel looked. There is no front desk per say but a number of desks with different associates for a more personalized experience. The was my first stay at a St. Regis, and of the SPG brands I have been at so far, it is the classiest.  The associate helped me quickly check in and informed me that I had been upgraded to a metropolitan suite as an SPG plat. I had not expected this so it was quite welcome. She then accompanied me to the elevator lifts and I was on my way to my room. Upon…",40
"We stayed here for one night last week and found this is one of the best hotel in Macao.   All staff are nice and friendly, especially Ms Carie from Butler Services. When we checked- in we got wet as its heavy rain outside. Ms Carie brought us a pot of green tea, showing me the location of hairdryer and reminded me don't get cold. She also assisted me to dry up my jeans in a short period of time! Excellent Services!!!  Our room is on 27/F and facing City of dream, nice view! The room is clean and big, bed is comfortable, you can get all you need in the room. For coffee lover, although there is no coffee machine in room, but you can ask for a cup of coffee anytime from Butler Services.   Buffet breakfast is served at the Manor. Apart from the buffet, you may also order one item…",50
"We just finished a last minute trip to Macau over the Easter Saturday and Sunday and booked the St Regis Macau hotel using SPG points. We arrived early Saturday morning and once we found our way to the hotel using the shuttle bus, we checked in and were greeted with our very own Butler!   Troy made our stay truly something to remember. He brought us a welcome coffee/tea and arranged pressing of various items. He then organised addresses for local vegetarian restaurants for us as well as telling us about the amazing House of Dancing Water show. The butler service even has an e-butler capability where you can email the id where ever you are on Macau and the service will work on meeting your question/request.   Highly recommend the hotel, especially for the Butler Service. ",50
"Were ""invited to visit"" on Nov12-13, what a pity!   St. Regis has always been one of my best hotels, and St. Regis Macao hasn't failed. Room at the end of the corridor on 30th offered fantastic view of great many hotels, stadium and 1/3 Eiffel Tower. Lucky and caught the fireworks from our bedroom one of those nights.   Top notch furniture and design, luxurious marble bathroom were amazing and standard for St. Regis. Enjoyed our living room, dinning room, bedroom and bathroom very much. Delighted not seeing the work desk, Z wouldn't be working!  Super friendly butler and staff at Front Desk, The Manor and St. Regis Bar.",40
"Everything is great! The limousine ride, the in room check in, the spa experience, the excellent butler service, the breakfast at Manor, the attention to details. Next time will definitely stay longer! Really have a great time staying at St Regis! Love the room and all the great service provided! You have a great team! Will definitely come back again with my family! So far the best experience I have ever had in Macau.",50
"I think the hotel is good. First of all, the rooms are very large, the bed is very comfortable,and the toilet is absolutely clean and there is a bathtub inside the toilet. Second, the view outside the room is great, I can see the Cotai Strip. Thirdly, the design of the room and the lobby is great. I like the design very much. It gave me a very comfortable feeling. Moreover, the staff were very attentive and completed my requests quickly. Especially, Kenny yang, he is very nice, he leave me with a very deep impression. However, there is a disadvantage which is I need to walk very far away to the shuttle bus. In conclusion ,this is a great and unforgettable experience.",50
Stayed here with my family for a celebration and we were warmly welcomed from the bell service to the reception.  Kudos to the butler team as we didn't expect that birthday greetings! Thank you so much for making our stay one of a kind... it was a pleasure  being served by this group of  dedicated staff... kudos to your team st.regis 👍👌,50
"Stayed here for a short getaway.  Am impressed by the hotel.  Check in agent Vanessa was very friendly and helpful - by providing and making restaurant, entertainment and transport recommendation and  reservation for us.  Butler and other staffs also provide steady services.  While Macau is now flushed with luxury hotels with great hardware, the service level in most other hotels is mostly uneven.  St Regis nails it with high quality guest room and meticulous attention to guests' needs. Will stay here again.  ",50
"Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. Had a fantastic stay. The check-in was efficient and fast. I was escorted by my personal Butler and I was immediately offered a refreshing beverage which promptly delivered, for free!   Dinner &  Drinks: The service was excellent and had a wonderful evening in The Manor restaurant! The service and the food were great, try out the table side carved Beef Wellington! And absolute wow!!!! Managed to visit the bar as well, great service and the drinks were great too, very innovative mixology and generously poured. The guitarist from Spain made the bar experience so much different than in your regular hotel bar. Highly recommendable! ",50
"Had a great stay with my wife, mothin-in-law and our 18 months old son. Highlight of the stay was the birthday cake surprise that was set up in the room after we returned from dinner! The cake was prepared in a way that's easy for us to take away, yet it was beautifully made and tasty. Not to mention complimentary champagne was also served to us in an ice bucket. I have to say this is a very thoughtful touch, especially the way how the cake was prepared.   I was also lucky to have a room view facing City of Dreams/ Cotai. Room décor and bathroom was beautiful. the only down side is without a coffee machine although the coffee mixture looks more luxurious than other hotels. Also wrong type of newspaper was delivered to me. And unfortunately I didn't get to try the bulter service…",50
"This is my second trip back to St Regis in the span of 2 months. It feels great to be remembered by the name. As it was my Birthday, the personalised touches, gestures & arrangements were truly memorable. Truly second to none hospitality & service.",50
Stayed for 1 night at this new hotel. Hotel room is pretty spacious and it is connected to other hotels such as holiday inn and Conrad. Recommend for both business and leisure. The jacuzzi is okay. Breakfast is okay and staff are very friendly.,40
"I stayed with my partner at the newly opened St Regis hotel and was so impressed with the level of service, the beautifully appointed rooms and the famous butler attendance which was exemplary. It's really a hotel away from the bustle and craziness of gambling and casino madness which is infamous with Macao. If you want that, it's just a door away and easily accessible. But the luxury, quiet beauty and refined elegance of this impressive hotel makes it such a pleasure to escape the mad bling! bling! of casino life. The Remede Spa is exquisite-situated on a high floor over looking the city into views of china just across the water. Try the crystal treatments which align yr Chi energy levels and also soothe u into a perfect slumber. Thumbs up on all accounts! ",50
"Friends and I checked in to the hotel at 6:30pm, we planned to watch Madonna later in the evening therefore must be in Studio City by 9pm. Originally we wanted to have dinner at bar.celona therefore asked the concierge at the hotel to help us explain to the taxi driver where the restaurant is, however it was explained to us that it is quite far away and we won't make it back in time. The concierge Mabel Ng was super helpful, she knew we wanted to eat tapas therefore recommended a close by tapas restaurant within walking distance, she was friendly and helped us reserve a table straight away. When I returned the next day to thank her for her recommendation, she could quickly recall my surname and called me Ms. Leung on the spot. I was indeed impressed and will be back!",50
"I don't typically stay in super nice places like this but I was able to get a room with points + cash. From when my wife and I first walked in the door it was as if everyone was excited and happy to see us. We got to check in sitting down, which makes me feel important. They gave us apple tea. The whole hotel is beautiful; it is super luxurious but not tacky or over the top. Aris the front office manager was supremely helpful and accommodating and nice. He upgraded us to a huge suite even though I was paying mostly with points which has never happened to me before. The whole experience was magnificent. The carpet pads everywhere are top of the line. (I used to work construction, and I know a good carpet pad when I feel one.) Anyway, everything was terrific. The gym is huge and…",50
"Stayed for one night; the hotel is at the Cotai Strip which is the new and more well developed part of Macau. It's connected to the casino and a bunch of other restaurants and hotels, but it's a nice and tranquil escape from the madness that is Macau.   They tout the butler service, but I would say that service levels overall are excellent. Staff has poise and a very helpful attitude, while maintaining a sense of decorum.",50
"The room is very nice.  The butlers are very helpful.  The spa is wonderful.  However, there were several things I did not like.  The fitness centre is very small.  There are 8 techno gym machines, 8 cardio machines, a smith machine, and dumbells.  As far as hotel gyms go, I would rate this as below average.   The one plus is that it was fairly empty.   I had great difficulty communicating with the room service staff.  There English was not good and they had great difficulty taking my order.  Housekeeping was very late.  When I left at 9 in the morning, my butler asked me if I wanted my room cleaned then.  I said yes.  When I returned at 5pm, it was not cleaned and I had to call and ask for it to be cleaned.  And no, the do not disturb sign was not on.  After it was cleaned, I…",30
"We had a wonderful 2 night stay here.  The staff are exceptional and helpful and accomodating.  They go out of their way to make you feel welcome and to solve your problems.  We appreciated them a lot.  The rooms are spacious and clean and modern and luxurious.  Really comfortable!  Breakfast in their restaurant was absolutely memorable!  There was the most incredible selection and offerings -- diverse, something for everyone.  Only warning:  the hotel is new, so not all taxi drivers know where it is.  Make sure you carry the address with you.",50
"was at St Regis Macau for a couple of nights for a company offsite, overall was a decent experience especially after reading all the negative reviews, did not expect too much.  Overall we were happy with the stay at the hotel, the staff seem a bit new and maybe just settling in, but overall attitude was very nice and overall very friendly.   rooms and food: The rooms were nice enough but quality of the furnishing not necessarily St Regis’ standard.  I.E. not sure if it was just a matter of taste but I thought the round table in the room looked rather cheap.  The knob to go from handshower to rainshower was broken and staff forgot to replenish the vanity material in the bathroom.

Hotel was nice and service was great, I would like to specially comment about two person who was at the lobby the Manager Jon Yau and the other I suppose was the lobby ambassador Ariel. Jon was very professional upon check in anticipating all our needs making us comfortable from asking about our trip providing information about Macau and information on where can we do shopping without asking him he seem to also know our plan well telling us where is our breakfast dinner location after the check in as a manager he had even offer to carry our things and escort us to the room even as a Manager on the next day of check out he still remember who we are and knowing that we are going to Taiwan Jon…",50
"I stayed at this hotel during my first trip to macau with family.  What attracted me to this hotel was that it is a St Regis brand and it is one of the newest hotel in Macau…opened last month.    I was hesitant about staying at this hotel initially, given some early reviews were not very positive.  But we had a great stay at this hotel.  Unlike the previous reviews, I found the service to be exceptional.    The staff were all very pleasant and helpful.  Numerous times they would approach you and help answer any questions that you may have.  If they don't know the answer, they tried to find the right person for you.  We entered the lobby through Holiday Inn (I'll explain later).  We were immediately ushered to sit at the lobby to wait for the next desk clerk that was available…",50
"New! Clean! Great service !! Great hotel !! Love it !!! The receptionist was very nice and very friendly, the concierge helped us to book restaurants and gave us great suggestions for tour stuff around Macau. I loved it even more because we went right after Christmas and 4 days after it was opened, so it was extremely clean. ",50
"  New, clean and good interior. Although you would expect a bit more for a St. Regis standard.    Checking in was alright, though took a bit of time for the process. Upon checking out and before we had our breakfast, we had informed the receptionist to prepare our luggage to be carried down to the lobby. However, luggage was still in the room even after we had our meal. Even so, after being informed the second time, it took them awhile to bring down our luggage. Understand that we had to catch a cab then a ferry, before our flight.     Most importantly, breakfast at The Manor was very very limited with choices, and service was not ok. Need to seriously retrain their service to a St. Regis worldwide standard. Somehow service felt like as if dining in some casual 24 hr diner-…",30
"Stayed for only one night on 24 Jan to 25 Jan - the service is amazing! I was treated like a VIP although i only stayed in the standard room. Special thanks to my Butler - Blare, Francis and Patrick Hoi at the front desk whom helped me through my checkout process. Everyone was super sincere and polite which made me felt at home. I would recommend to to provide bath salt though, it would of been perfect for this trip as it super cold.",50
"This is a brand new hotel in macau, and it is perfect for 2 reasons: 1_ it is not massive (perfect to avoid big check in lines, or any other type of lines that do have the big hotels) 2_It is near everything in the new macao.  The rooms are wonderful. The breakfast on our first day was not what we expected, it looked kinda small compared to other st regis in the world, but within the days it started to get better since they added sushi, etc.  The staff are very friendly and happy to help, when we checked out all the reception staff came to say goodbye, very kindly.  What needs to be fixed is that when you arrive from the ferry on the stand of the st regis which is outside there was no one there, and the only 2 ppl working for the sands company didnt speak a single word of…",50
"Stayed at the hotel with my family during Christmas holiday - being an fun of st regis brand,  it came as a shock to us - the overall standard of the hotel, from overall staffs' services to room decor and hardware, the hotel feels more like a Sheraton business hotel than a five star St regis.   First, the size and decor of the room, you could easily get much better value and quality from the conrad (next door) or Ritz Carlton (all suite, and much better trained staff /thus services). The room does provide locally produced ""Bonaqua ""distilled drinking water for the guests (did not even bother changed to hotel label), feeling like they were taken straight from convenient store, let alone no welcome cookie/fruits, given its holiday seasons, letting alone it's almost basic for any…",20

Once it was our turn service picked up.    Staff assisted us with luggages from the moment we stepped into reception.  The hotel prepared kids' accessories such as children slippers, kid-size bath robe, and foot stool for the sink.   I appreciated the detailed housekeeping service they provided, such as ice bucket is always filled with fresh ice when our wine bottle was noticed.  Our room was very clean. Overall, we had wonderful time during our stay.   St Regis is connected to the Sheraton, Conrad and Holiday Inn of the Cotai Sands property & casino.  There were plenty of restaurants and shops in the complex. …",40
"This gorgeous property has just opened its door for just a few weeks and I had a very relaxing and enjoyable stay there.  Entrance – grand, spacious and sophisticated  Décor – subtle elegance with blue, grey and earth tone. I am glad they have not overly done this and makes one feel like it’s a home away from home.  Room – stayed at their metropolitan suite and it was spacious and very comfortable.   Bath amenities – Laboratoire Remede. A very refreshing, minty and rejuvenating brand! Unisex which both male and female would love. I particularly admire the fact that they don’t just have shower gel, shampoo, conditioner and lotion – they even include face wash which isn’t common!  Restaurant and bar – St Regis Bar: where I sampled their signature Bloody Mary which was a whole lot…",50
"I was absolutely thrilled by our recent stay at the newly opened St. Regis Macao. We were a bit concerned that we would run into the normal glitches that happen at new properties but experienced none. We were just delighted at the outstanding service and attention to details that we experienced there. The Manor Restaurant is outstanding; It provides world class food, service, and a wine list to match. Our suite was beautifully laid out, the decoration impeccable and everything worked... The 24 hour butler service was also impeccable. I really can't say anything but congratulations on an outstanding property.",50
"Stayed over the late December and had a couple of observations.   1) Their one restaurant ""The Manor"" is woefully understaffed.  Staff were also woefully under trained. They should have poached top talent from surrounding properties but looks like all the got were the leftovers.  2) Check-in was also a 30 minute ordeal.  No SPG Elite priority check-in available.  3) Rooms were very nice, bed was great. Amenities were nice (Remede toiletries and complimentary Evian for Suites).  4) Plumbing fixtures were already malfunctioning.  Handshower to Rainshower lever was broken. Shower was leaking into the toilet area. etc etc.  Every one from the room butler to the front office were very courteous but there were many teething issues. I think they rushed the opening a little on this…",30
"因為新業的問題, 所以很多房間都沒有開放使用。 而員工因為還未熟悉工作流程所以 check-in 以及check-out 速度很慢。 但為我 check in 的 Kim (應該是韓國人) 小姐很好笑容, 她也不好意思一直對抱歉。  今次入住的是 Suite, 分開一 living room and bed room, 還有 衣房, 可是設計在 bed room 跟 bathroom 中間, 這樣很不方便。  首先講講 Bathroom, WC用的是 TOTO, 可是最普通的款, 以為 suite 會有 Neorest 或是 Washlet。 Basin 的牌子 Decolav 。MIXER就是用 Hansgrohe。洗手間用的是白雲石感覺。很簡潔, 但最敗北是 shower room 開門的方向, 很不方便拿台上的東西。  Bedroom 方面, 床頭都準備了 USB 孔, 以及 B&O bluetooth speaker. 電視用了 LG。 床是用了甚麼牌子? 忘了, 感覺還好。窗簾是用電制開關, 這方面比其他的 St. Regis 有點 low class, 電制還有點損傷 (新開張)。  Living room 部份有客廁, 有 table, 有 tea table 有 sofa, 有 LG, 有 minibar, 有咖啡機完... 十分簡陋的設計。完全不達 St. Regis 級數。是仿 St. Regis !?  房外的指示牌也十分混亂, 我想去個 Gym Room 也得花上了半天才找到。  是次入住的失望感太強大",30
"What a welcome by all front desk, FOM Aris, concierge, porters! We were blown away by the 6* service all the way to the St Regis suite room. My butler, Priscilla did a fantastic job showing me the beautiful suite. Congratulations to all beautiful staff ; well done. ",50
"Just one week after its grand opening we stayed there for a night to celebrate my husband's birthday. Being a new hotel and a St. Regis, obviously the place was nice with relatively tasteful and minimalistic decor compared to the other hotels in macau. I've emailed them ahead of time to ask whether they could make some arrangements for the special occasion and one of their famous ""butlers"" replied to say that they will arrange something.  On check in, we were already disappointed to find out that our room was not ready at the check in time of 3pm and we just sat in the lobby for half an hour with no refreshments or anything. There was no butler to escort us to our room but that's OK. The not OK part was when we got to the room there was nothing ""special"" done at all.  Then came…",40
"everything about this hotel is wrong, not up to St. Regis standards. No branded shuttle bus at the pier, no one tells you where to get off from the general shuttle bus,  no water or refreshment in the lobby, no one greets you or help you with the luggage in the lobby. Room is ok, but bathroom is very small for St. Regis. No butler service, and no room turn-down service at night, very limited facilities, no kid club, dinning area is very small. Managers don't take serious about guest complaints. Won't go back again, and won't recommend it to any of my friends. The holiday inn and Sheraton next door have bigger lobby and much better facility.",20
"We checked in on 1 Jan and the hotel was just opened for 2 weeks, so everything is brand new.  The main entrance is on the side of the building but we entered the block from another side where airport coaches stop at. Not enough direction indicated and you may easily got lost in the building.   Before getting to the room, we found that they wrote ""330"" to indicate 30/F, and they explained it like ""Oh yes this is what we do as usual"". It's so confusing and they don't even want to explain.  The room is big and comfortable. Everything well designed and the bed is comfortable as well. TV is big and wifi is fast. Water pressure is not enough for the shower on the ceiling. Good that they have men size and women size slippers but better have 2 men size prepared since we checked in as 2…",40
"This is a brand new hotel in macau that opened up in mid-decemeber 2015. I came here to spend one night to treat my parents for holidays.   Firstly I knew check-in wasnt until 3pm. I showed up at 2pm and being a SPG gold member i approached the SPG desk checkin. The women furiously typing away on keyboard after 15mins told me that only one room would be ready. Which is fine, I gave that room to my parents. I booked my room 3 months in advance and specifically requested a high floor room and to be on the same floor as my elderly parents.   I came back at 3pm to checkin for the second room. No luck. They told me hotel was full and the only room that was available was at a low level room. This is absolutely unacceptable and ridiculous!! The person who helped me had little power and…",20
"I stayed here for one night on Christmas day with my partner. The hotel is brand new and there are lots of kinks and feels nothing like a St. Regis as far as service is concerned. Before I get into the details, I just have to say I won't be returning to this hotel anytime soon. There are other options in Macao, all of which offer much better value for money.   Check-in:  Since it was Christmas day, the hotel was full of guests. We arrived and was shown to the reception by the bell boy who insisted in speaking Mandarin with us despite us returning his every question in English. Not all Asians speak Mandarin and good service is all about flexibility and adjusting to the guest.   Upon arriving at the reception area, there was a large group of guests clamouring for the first…",20
"Lucky enough to have stayed in a few St Regis around the world. As I sit here, in a perfectly nice room, with great connectivity and a number of charge points. I reflect upon comparisons with my other experiences.   The Macau St Regis is the newest hotel on Cotai sands, which also house a Sheraton, Conrad and Holiday Inn. The main entrance is on the side of the resort, so if you catch the free shuttle bus, you need to walk a couple of minutes and enter via Holiday Inn entrance. Entering reception a bell boy takes your bags, and shows you to a seat whilst you wait for a receptionist. We booked via a hotel website, so as usual, no points, on Starwood card, but my issue with this, is that they don't know who you are, your preferences or loyalty level. Checked on a rollaway bed for…",30
"We reserved a Metropolitan Suite and a deluxe room for one night. On a whole, staff were attentive and especially our floor housekeeper cared us much as we had a baby and a child during the stay. All the baby amenities as requested before are ready in suite when we arrived. Suite is decent and and well decorated. Good point is there are many plugs in the room as we use many electronic devices (everyone has to charge phone battery). Bed is comfort and our room view is facing Venetian. We could see the Christmas laser show at the entrance of Venetian.  However, there are still some areas for improvement, 1. Slow check-in and check-out     - Our family, with old, child and baby, reserved two rooms, but they separated us in different floors initially. I think a 6 star management…",40
"Stayed on the third night after the hotel's opening. I always have high expectations for St. Regises and was afraid this one (being so new) would not be up to par yet. But to the contrary, I found that service to be very good with only minor hiccups. Check-in was very efficient and the entire process was paperless (on a tablet). Front desk was well-versed in the SPG program, which isn't always a given in a new property. Butler service was also very good. You could tell they were not full yet since two butler would usually show up for the most minor requests ;) Rooms are big and well designed. Starwood's global design team has done a very good job bringing room designs into the 21st century - you get 2 bed-side side plugs, 2 USB ports, an iPhone dock and a Bose Soundlink speaker.…",50
