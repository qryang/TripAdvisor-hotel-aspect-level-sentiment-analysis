"Only a special thing of banyan tree: the room is big and pricey but not special. The in-room service is not outstanding as 5 stars hotel. Besides, I still can see some water stains on the marble floor and some dust gather in the corners of the room. ",30
"This is (without a doubt) one of the best hotels in Macau. The architecture is really impressive and no details were left aside.  The halls in the room levels makes it feel like you are permanently in a luxury spa and the housekeeping staff are very helpful.  I stayed in the ‚Äúsignature pool‚Äù room and I can only tell you it was one of the best hotel experiences I‚Äôve ever had. The living room is huge, enough to receive guests for dinner. Also, the room and the bathroom are very big, all with luxury facilities. Truly amazing!  Cons: the breakfast was disappointing. After arriving this wonderland I could only imagine a great buffet with lots of variety, different kinds of cheese, waffles, etc - but that was not the case.  Lastly, I must say banyan tree has one of the most impressive spas I‚Äôve ever seen. Expensive, but you won‚Äôt forget it. ‚Ä¶",50
"We stayed in Banyan Tree for my friend‚Äôs birthday celebration. The room was elegant, the service was great as well. The best part of our experience was when we went to the resort deck and in the Cabana. We really had fun and the staff was so accommodating especially Omar who assisted us as if we are VIP. He made sure that we will enjoy our experience in the resort. Its like we had a pool party, We will sure go back and recommend the hotel to my family and friends outside Macau  Kudos!",50
"I tried the Pampering Getaway treatment in Banyan Tree Spa. It is almost a complete treatment and takes more than 330 minutes. I told my spa therapist that I got elbow pain, during the treatment¬†she focused on loosening my muscle around my shoulder and elbow. The therapist is very experienced and patient. I was really relaxed and refreshed after the treatment. Surely will come back again.",50
"Again as expected, lovely day with my family. Looking forward for our next stay. Thank you for the amazing service and experience. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Great offer too! perfect time to enjoy while we can‚Äôt travel. Recommend and worth to stay. ",50
I stayed here for my birthday in Jun 2019 and the staff was nice and friendly and the beds were nice and comfy and clean and the bathroom had great water pressure and I wish I had pictures of it but I forgot to take a picture of my room and even the bathroom. Overall I am definitely going to come back here again.,50
"I had an amazing stay to celebrate my birthday in Banyan Tree Macau. The staff were very friendly and proactive fulfilling guest needs, one person that I have to mention is the front office guy Michael who did the check in and check out. He was super friendly, welcoming and knowledgeable...my wife and me were very impressed with his services and professionalism!!  Additionally, the hotel provided us a free room upgrade with nice birthday deco, champagne and a cake. I just want to say thank you to the whole Banyan Tree Team for making my birthday very memorable. Cheers...",50
"The Front office Miguel was so polite and very professional. Very kind and the Manager as well. All the room attendants are very well trained. We will definitely come back! The wave pool is a bit off for they can only accommodate 2 guests in every room. If you want to bring along your son or daughter you need to pay for the whole day. Shout out to Sherman, Ms Sasa, Mark For your good service üëèüëèüëè",50
 Kudos to the Cabanna team head by Marcos and served by Leizel and Omar. We had a great stay. Fast and excellent service of food. The place we stayed was nice and cozy. Our baby also enjoyed the pool. Highly recommended to families for relaxation! ,50
"Spent a day with family at one of the Cabanas. We all loved it. Each cabana is air conditioned with plenty of space for 6-8 people. The pool and tho whole setup is beautiful, comfortable and very relaxing. The staff was very friendly and helpful, made us feel right at home! The food was good too. Definitely going back again!",50
"We spent a day chillout at Cabana, and never knew that there is a place like this in Macau. A hidden gem in a concrete jungle of resorts and casino. The services rendered by the team was exceptional and second to none. It is a perfect place for family and friends. The foods served were sumptious and appetizing. Had a wonderful time spent with my family thanks to the team of Liz, Rod, Rommel, Marcus and Omar.  Tip: The place is usually fully booked and packed, so better do a pre order to avoid waiting for your food. Also come early to maximze your time and explore the area for it has alot to offer!",50

"Our second time visiting Banyan Tree at Macau. We stayed there for 3 nights.  Overall experience was lovely.  However, we were bit disappointed and surprised as there‚Äôs only one washroom with diaper change board in the hotel. it‚Äôs located inside a handicap washroom near the lobby. On the day we checked out, our little one needed to change her diaper. We waited at the lobby as someone was using the handicap washroom. 20 minutes later we saw someone (Not handicap) cane out, we tried to rush  in with our baby. However, a staff wearing banya tree uniform bypassed us and went right into the handicap washroom. It was a long hallway to walk to the handicap washroom and we didn‚Äôt expect staff would go directly to the handicap one while the male washroom  is just right next to it.  We‚Ä¶",40
"Everything about this hotel screams luxury, serenity, and romance. Our experience with the Banyan Tree was one of the finest. Every detail is thought of, and sometimes... it's the little things that count. I particularly thought the daily oils & incense was a lovely touch in the rooms. I don't know how they do it, but staff will always address you by your name without any need for prompting! The beds were seriously comfy, and the room size is really something that you rarely find elsewhere. The heated pool in the room added such a luxurious touch, and was great to come home to each night! It was really relaxing to sink in and take in the views of the changing Macau landscape.

"I have always been so inclined in staying at Banyan Tree properties but this time around in Macau - the service was really off!  here are some things to consider before u book your stay in Banyan tree macau. 1. facilities - the room is no doubt beautiful with a relax ambiance so yes.  2. food - do not add the breakfast. considering the amount of food offered in the buffet, the price should not be $248, with so little to offer and food was way below average which is quite disappointing. scrap the buffet and offer in room breakfast options instead. 3. cleanliness - its fine 4. service front - it lacks warmth and / informative welcome to guests. no genuine interaction with guests, and more like reading a script.   would i recommend BT macau?  this time around, i would say NO.

Thank you so much for the housekeeping, Mr.Warlie and Mr.Marlow.  It was very helpful to clean and tidy up during the breakfast in the morning.

Large, quality room with lots of space.  Very comfortable huge king sized bed.  Helpful and friendly staff.  Part of Galaxy property meaning lots of choice dining and bars.   Good swimming pool and lazy river in complex.  Fast, frequent free shuttles to Macau and other Cotai hotels.   Negatives: We were not informed breakfast was included until check out.  Room View will be better when the fourth tower is completed.   Overall there are so many positives. This is a must stay Hotel including to experience the pool in the room. ",50

I had no problem with communication at all. The pool villa offers 24hours of private butler service. All the management team is great. Unfortunately,  I wasn't able to get his name. He is one of the staff of housekeeping staff. He came to my room for turn down service and found out the note I wrote there for myself. I had bit of Wi-Fi problem but didn't call anyone for help at that time. While I was gone for shopping  He came to tide up my room and found the note on the desk although the desk was very messy, called the IT team for the check up.

Their wet floor has 4 indoor pools; a heated lap pool, a waterfall got tub, and hot and cold pools for contrast baths all with an amazing view of the resort grounds.

Apart from the excellent location as part of the Galaxy site, it has some of the most amazing rooms with a pool inside and just so relaxing... and that is the selling point of this hotel. it is just so relaxing. it is one of the only places where i actually don't mind just staying in the room all day. Add to that the beautiful outdoor swimming pool, and the highly courteous staff and it makes for an amazing stay. it can be pricey but i normally try and go at the quieter times when it is only about ¬£300 a night for a suite with pool. i really like the fact that they remember your requests from previous visits and try to make the stay as nice as possible.",50

First time staying at a Banyan Tree hotel and it was fabulous.  The room was very luxurious with a pool inside the room.  The service was top notch.  The spa experience was spectacular.  This hotel is one of the best hotels that I‚Äôve stayed in as it was a nice getaway from the busy Hong Kong City.  Cannot wait to be back in the summer time to enjoy the outdoor water park.  Oct month was too cold for us to enjoy the water activities.,50

You can‚Äôt swim laps in it as it‚Äôs not long nor deep, so it's essentially a long bathtub or paddling pool for children.   The bedroom and living room area is generally open plan, with a partition separating the two. The partition hold two large televisions either face so you can watch from the living room or bed. The bed was king size, naturally and there was a day bed (which doubles as a sofa) of similar size.   The bathroom area is big also.

It was a rainy afternoon but this did not let our staycation boring or unpleasant! Banyan Tree is truly a Five Star because of its services. We felt at home from the moment we stepped in to the hotel as Ms. Jessa handled our check in professionally then escorted us to our room and explained each of the amenities clearly. I would like also to commend Ms. Catherine from the Housekeeping Team who helped drying and cleaning the water around the small pool as our grand daughter was enjoying it. All in all it was an awesome experience and surely we'll be back for another wonderful weekend!!,50

He really made sure that we will have a five star experience. Check-in was very smooth. After that, he escorted us to our room and helped us with our amenities. He offered a lot of help which made our stay very easy. Aside from him, I must acknowledge some staff like Daisy from housekeeping who offered us baby amenities, she was so kind. Mark and Jay from belldesk, helped us with our luggage during check in and check out, and even helped us to grab a taxi upon our departure.

"This is an extravagant hotel. Although expensive, it is well worth the money. The detail taken in each room is phenomenal. We opted for the Cotai Pool Suite room. The pool in the room is a fabulous feature. It is filled almost to waist height, warm, and just fun to play in, even for a grown adult. The views are great from the pool. and you'll find yourself in the early watching Macau television from the pool and hoping from the pool to the gloriously large bathtub. The smart toilet is also a fun feature lol.  The service is again impeccable. Room is cleaned each day to perfection - including the pool. On the second night, we were even given a small free gift from the Banyan Tree shop which was nice. The breakfast is perfect, and a great way to start the morning. Can get busy, so‚Ä¶",50

What makes it so special too is that the staff are very friendly and helpful. The relaxation pool in the room is just unbelievable, it's very luxurious!!! My wife did enjoy it. And to top it off, you can also have the access at the resort deck, we thought it's only for the guests who are staying in Galaxy Hotel, yes we did have the privilege too!. 2 nights stay isn't enough. I mean there's a lot of things to do in the hotel. It's a huge complex. Saffron Restaurant located at the lobby is a great experience for authentic Thai cuisine,‚Ä¶",50

"I've been to several hotels around the world (mostly 5 star) and I have to say, this was one of the nicest hotels we ever stayed at.  The room we stayed in was 2016.  It was clean, had a great view of the Galaxy plaza, swimming pools, wave pool, the whole area.  The room includes a very long spa like pool  inside the room (water has to be drained and refilled to 27 degrees Celsius). We had our AC on so it cooled off the water fairly quickly.  The room had 2 king size beds, 2 bathrooms, 2 showers (master bedroom had 2 shower heads + a wooden bathtub).  3 minor issues about the room.  1) if you leave the closet door open, coming in the front door could see you taking a shower or going to the bathroom (we just left the closet door closed but we thought that design was strange).  2)‚Ä¶",50
"The check in process is seamless and we even got an upgrade. Thanks to Yoyo. Room is spacious and we even have 2 toilets (1 main and 1 guest washroom). The pool was half full and we thought it needs more time to fill up so we head out to casino for some gambling. However when we went back to room around midnight, the pool is still half full and I doubt 'am i really able to swim in it?' I lost hope with the pool and just enjoy the lemongrass flavor candle and watch tv happily. The turndown service is nice while the signature turtle is placed on the bed. (How cute was that)",40
"I chose this hotel because I was specifically looking for a hotel with a private swimming pool in my suite. I'd never thought I would find a private pool in my villa in the middle of this concrete city. And I am totally taken by the services Banyan Tree Macau had to offer. Special mention to Senior Resort Villa Host Andry Pranama, who contacted my months before leading up to my visit, to ensure everything is arranged to my liking prior to my arrival. He even assisted with my itinerary during my stay, as well as arranged accommodation for my other relatives who stay at Galaxy which is directly next to Banyan Tree. Limo was arranged to pick me up upon arrival (but I believe there is shuttle bus that will take you from the ferry terminal to the hotel)) Andry was at the entrance of‚Ä¶",50
This hotel is sitting in an amazing location! upon arrival the staffs were very helpful and greet you in a Thai culture way. The lobby is very spacious with high ceiling and our check in was smooth though room wasn't ready when we arrived at noon time but they get alternatives by sending email WiFi is free and easy to access too! Overall service was impeccable everyone was very helpful and caring on anything you need! Total top recommendation  on my bucket list and glad i chose this hotel.,50
"We stayed in this hotel and the ambiance itself was very welcoming, the staffs we all so kind and smiling upon your arrival not to mention helpful as well. Our room was definitely what you see in the site itself. The resort was not open since its winter time but tried the fitness center and the best part is the pool is in an infinity style over looking the other hotels of Cotai. Really coming back and be recommending this hotel to my fellow bloggers!",50
"Hotel is inside of Galaxy casino together with other top brand hotels, take a big long to walk from shuttle bus terminal to the hotel. Staffs are friendly and room is huge! Price is reasonable as you wont find another hotel with private pool in room with this price in town.",50
"Mr Jay at the lobby went out of his way to give us directions and even called a cab for us as we were lost. He was very patient and helpful throughout, even though we were not staying at Banyan. Well done Jay!",50
Was celebrating my birthday and Banyan Tree gave a small cake as a present. The room is nice with a small private pool inside. It‚Äôs not deep just good to relax especially if you have kids with you I‚Äôm sure they will enjoy it and you don‚Äôt have to worry because you can always look after them. The view from the room is fantastic. Shower room is amazing and can shower two people because its hugeüòÇ. Service is nice and all the staff we encountered are polite. Have outdoor pools which is amazing from all the pool in Macau this one is unique and exciting. Also have indoor if feel cold especially during winter. So far will recommend it and will come back here next time. ,50
"We booked the pool suite. Upon arrival, the staff greeted as warmly. They were very attentive, polite, and friendly. The service is excellent. The room is so spacious that it can fit conveniently 4 people. The bathroom (wooden tub) and walkin closet is beautifully designed. We enjoyed our stay as it is very relaxing. Definitely value for money. You get what you paid for.",50
"My dad, my brothers and i stayed in Banyan Tree from October 10-12, 2018.  We stayed in a room fronting the man made beach and all other pools of the Galaxy compound.  Our stay was amazing!  With our three days stay, we spent two full days in the Galaxy Compound just roaming around and shopping.  Some of the shops are even cheaper inside the area.  The pools were amazing.  the room was luxuriously big! We love it.  I hope to bring my family back soon.",50
"The rooms, restaurant, spa, pool and absolutely everything was, in a figure of golf speech, hole in one! This is the best hotel I have ever been to and I hope I will be able to come here for every holiday possible. Thank you for the service Banyan Tree! Please ignore the underappreciating people as they are only trying to get attention. I must say, this is the HOTSPOT for a beach resort stay.",50
Excellent room on 27th floor with in room pool (Cotai king suite - resort view). King bed was super comfortable and Daniel at the front desk was kind enough to organise a complimentary rollaway bed so that our kids didn‚Äôt have to fight for space on the sofa.  Double shower had great pressure (although minor point - the temperature control kept moving on one of the showers). We also had a problem with a light switch in the living area which we couldn‚Äôt turn off. Eventually had to get all the light bulbs taken out.  However I consider these minor issues when there were so many positives. There are an indoor and outdoor pool that are both heated. The huge outdoor pool was actually empty the day we swam. I think the second night we were there we got a towel animal when the room was‚Ä¶,50
"As a whole, I find the room is amazing as what most visitors have commented.  Huge, beaultful views, wonderful double showers, indoor pool.  However, can tell from some minor areas that the hotel is a bit dated e.g. the light control knobs in my room are not working really well.  The circulation function for the indoor pool does not seem to work either.  And I'm a bit skeptical about the water quality of the indoor pool.  Do they really change the water for new guests each time?   Another disappointment is the choices of food at the buffet breakfast.  It's rather tailored for mainland Chinese tourists.  It's rather disappointing to see no Thai dishes at a Thai branded hotel.  At large, my kids still love the room and the outdoor pool facilities.",40
"I‚Äôve stayed at Banyan Tree before but this experience exceeded all expectations.  We had a beautiful suite on the 28th floor.  The service upon checking in was amazing. We were able to spend the day at both the galaxy pool deck and Banyan Tree pool while waiting for our room which was ready early. All staff treated us with such kindness and were able to assist with towels, drinks and water all day.  We had lunch at the Breeze kiosk and were greeted by exceptionally friendly staff and had a really tasty lunch including rice paper rolls and the slider special which included a cocktail.  The room was perfect with all the amenities you could need or want! I love that the staff come in at night and refresh the water, amenities and towels as well as lay out the slippers and gowns.  We‚Ä¶",50
"I honestly have no idea where to start with this review. I can not find a single fault with the hotel. Check in was quick and easy and upon entering the room we were greeted with a free bottle of wine and cake. The room itself was large with 2 toilets dining area mini bar square pool which overlooked some of the strip! having a pool in the room was such an experience, and id image even great for kids.  We only stayed for a few nights and the reception and friendliness of the staff was great. The food in the restaurant was great. We had ordered room service which I wasn't too keen on the club sandwich as the bread felt a little dry and the bath window is haze so it restricts your view. Obviously for your own privacy but it would of been nice to look out whilst relaxing. My only‚Ä¶",50
We booked the signature suite and it was just exquisite. Probably the best suite we have ever stayed in. The plunge pool in the middle of the Suite was unique and a great way to relax in. Bathroom was also something else with outstanding views over the Galaxy resort. Staff were very helpful and knowledgeable. Definitely a highlight of our trip,50
My favourite hotel room ever!  We stayed here for 5 nights! Room with swimming pool inside the room was amazing!!! LOVE the room decoration and it's definitely the best hotel in MACAU! WE WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK AGAIN!!!,50
"Booked in for a birthday celebration and couldn't have asked for a better experience.  We arrived at the front desk and was greeted by a gentleman called Curtis.  He was extremely welcoming, friendly and helpful.  Throughout the stay all the staffs were really warm and friendly and the property was in pretty good condition. ",50
Make sure to pay a visit here If you come to Galaxy Hotel Macao.  Their afternoon tea set was really good they actually offer buffet afternoon snacks with a lot of variety to chose from. I love the place very relaxing although when we went there their restroom was a bit far you have to walk to the hotel but the hotel staffs are very accommodating good service indeed.,40
It was our first time to have an afternoon tea in Macau and we‚Äôre so glad we choose to have it at Banyan Tree. It was an amazing experience! Services and foods are superb. The ambiance is very cozy and the food attendant are very attentive. Prices is reasonable too.,50
"Rooms are just incredible! I spent 90% of my time in my private room pool! üòÇ stayed at plenty of other in Macau, and this was by far the best. The service was epic, and the quality of the hotel was also amazing. Galaxy is also an incredibly huge complex (hence the name) which means you don‚Äôt ever have to leave if you don‚Äôt want to. Just great.",50
best hotel room I ever seen in my life room with swimming pool inside the room amazing room d√©cor fabulous best room in macau part of galaxy complex we can use the wave pool for sure coming back to this hotel when i visit macau again,50
"From check in to check out we were impressed by the service throughout. The staff are very friendly and multi lingual. We stayed for one night in a pool suite. The room was clean and comfortable with all the facilities you would expect. Particular highlights were the large wooden tub for a relaxing soak, and the aromas in the public areas such certainly remind you of Thailand. Would definitely recommend staying here",50
"What can I say... the moment we stepped into the Banyan Tree we were blown away.  The service was impeccable, everything was in order, everyone was helpful and friendly.  Our room was SPECTACULAR!  We had 2 adults and 2 children.  Unfortunately, the beds were a bit small for all of us but an extra bed was brought up to accommodate our family.  The indoor relaxation pool was great, plenty of free complimentary bottles of water as well!  The double shower was to die for, the shower heads big and, well, just awesome!  Having access to the water park, complimentary was our saviour, it was very hot and humid and the lazy river was just what we all needed after a busy day. I would recommend the Banyan Tree to anyone that asks... a 6 Star stay for us and we hope to be back one day soon!",50
My purpose of stay is celebrate silver wedding anniversay. Hotel automatically upgraded to bigger room with decoration. These big surprise bring us a wonderful memorable stay. We also have a very good candle-light dinner in Belon restaurant. Thanks!,50
"Although I did'nt stay in the hotel, I attended a confrence for couple of day and can safely say it is one of the best in the region for holding international confrences and symposiums. Ample space, excellent management.",50
Massive room Friendly Staff AC very lould in one of our room. Would love to stay here again. We were charged extra (small amount) for child to attend breakfast (only the adult breakfast was included). Over all a fabulous facility ,50
"That would be a relax business journey in my time. That's a suite with a pool inside, extra large dining room that can let me to have a meeting with my partner. Actually I am sensitive to the air but the armoma is good for sleep. I will come back to this hotel for my next trip to Macau.",50
"The size is so big and so grand. And it is very comfortable, each room with small relaxing pool which suite for family to come. Inside the galaxy they have so many facility for entertainment, you can watching movie, you can shopping, you can play, whatever you want.",50
"Excellent service quality except the choices in buffet breakfast not much international standard but overall still acceptable,  Room cleanliness and facilities much well maintained .  Food quality in the French restaurant Belon very much upto  French high quality standard  ",50

"Everything was amazing. Booked it through official website, although slightly disappointed as room didn't get upgraded as promised in the official website. (for that I paid extra around hkd2000 to book via the official website instead of through travel agent). However Duty Manager has been very helpful to resolve the issue. So I am a happy girl again! The dining in Belon was extraordinary, and the SPA was unbelievable. Fell asleep a few times haha. Yeah so please do come try this hotel, you will not be disappointed.",50
Really great experience at Banyan Tree!! The room was clean & comfortable. Emailed them before arrival that we are coming to celebrate my birthday. The staff were sincere and patient throughout our communication. They offered a complimentary cake for me. It was nice touch. ,50
Was a great and memorable experience staying at Banyan tree Macau. The room was in great condition. We had a great time during our stay. The staff at front desk was friendly and helpfu. Breakfast is just ok. ,50
It an amazing place to stay wonderful rooms class apart one of the best Asia .class apart service .house keeping is fantastic and the amenities they provide really very niche .size of the room and pools inside are wonderfully designed . All in all it‚Äôs worth every penny .,50
The room is very big and very relaxing! It‚Äôs like an escape from everyone. You can enjoy and relax in your room. The staff were accommodating. The service is good. The food is also great! The ambience of the hotel is on point! ,50
Wonderful room with its own relaxation pool (huge) and bath. Dual shower! Awesome!  Free access to the gorgeous Deck Pool of the Galaxy complex. Personnel very attentive and professional. Perfect turn-in service. Very clean. A luxurious experience.,50
"Staffs at reception are well trained and they reacted to sudden changes properly with enough flexibility. The house-cleaning team has done a good job and very detail-oriented. Overall Banyan Tree is a fine-tuned, well-managed and tranquilizing place to stay in such as grand noisy place, which is quite different from other hotels. Banyan tree is quite stylish, instead of just being luxury. All of its products, assets even its staffs' manner, have a consistent and remarkable identity design, which is quite easy to figure out.  I will definitely recommend this place to people around especially couples and families with kids. For myself, Banyan Tree will be my only choice for my following travels to Macau. Perhaps I can try out its famous SPA service next time. ",50
"Our family had good memories in Banyan Tree Macau. All of there were very good excepted a tiny one thing. Especially hotel's amenities were very comfortable and the turtle were so good. If we go Macau again, we will be there again. We hope.  I think Banyan Tree is the most beautiful, Excellent accommodation in Macau. ",50

Thanks banyan tree for the arrangement",50

When you come in the spa, you already totally feel relax from the atmosphere l. The reception was great explain very detail, the theorist was wxcellent . Overall, I love banyan tree",50
I absolutely love to stay in Banyan Tree Macau. It‚Äôs our first time to be here and my daughter love it very much especially with the relaxation pool inside the room. The room is clean and the atmosphere is so relax. Polite staff with the good services. Definitely will come back again in the future. ,50

"The banquet and catering team has provided excellent customer services, everyone in the team was helpful and provide the best solution for our last minute request„ÄÇ If there are relatives and friends who get married, I will first recommend Banquet hotel.",50
Everything is good but some delayed room services. I ordered some ices and waters and I was received 20 minutes after. Air conditioning and electric curtains once have stopped because of electric failures.,50
I went there with my husband and daughter. My daughter loved the grand resort deck and also indoor pool at banyantree. Room condition is also nice and wonderful. We'll visit here again sooner or later.,50
"The indoor swimming pool was good. Well equipment. The most important is the people there, the greeting you . Call my last name. When I jump out from the pool, they will give you the tower quickly without asking. Well done!",50
"Everything was good. particularly, the condition and the relaxing pool of the room remembers much. other locations and smells were also good.The quality of the breakfast is rather poor compared to others.",50
"It was such a great experience to spend 3 days here with my family! Friendly staff, breathtaking views and nice food! Cant wait to visit again! The hardware are well-designed and I really like those significant decorations!  The spa! It was so great ! I really enjoyed this memoriable trip!",50
"Stayed in the hotel for 2 nights, everythings great and the view is perfect. The staff were very friendly, such nice experience. Spent some time in the water park in Galaxy too, highly recommended this hotel!",50
There are total 94 hotels in Macau .  I have to say banyan tree Macau is the best one in town. Each room have the pool with almost more than 100 square meter standard room size . Though it already 6 years old . But still worth to stay it .,50
"We are very enjoy the stay in banyan tree Macau, we already notice we come for celebrate honey moon, they offer me a good discount for Romaric package, it was amazing, it cost me almost 1000 mop, but I have to say, it is worth, I got the romantic flower set up with nice champagne. Plus many selection for bathtub menu, also they upgrade me to the next level, the room was so big. My wife was so happy. Thanks",50
This time come with my 5 years old daughter. Indeed it was the right decision to stay. The front office lady know our concerns. They immediately upgraded us to next level room with baby amenity. My daughter love the pool and she was so surprised with the turtle. Also it is very convince to the grand resort desk. They have so many pool play grand to choose.  She was very my upset when we left the hotel. Hahaha,50
"We are couples to celebrate our 2nd wedding anniversary in Banyan Tree Macau. They provide free red wine, cake and room upgrade to us. We are exciting and very happy with their arrangement. We sure we will come back to enjoy this hotel again and again.",50
"I have to say this is one of the best hotel I ever live in, great view, great location, great entertainment and with a great experience of shopping as well. The hotel service is very impressive, especially the staff at the counter, they are polite and patient. I would love to have a return visit next time when I came to Macau.",50
This is a late review but still wanted to share my experience.  The rooms are amazing and we had a beautiful view in the night.  We were lucky to get upgraded to spa suite.  The pool in the room is temperature controlled and a must swim.  The service is excellent and worth every $ spent.,50
We come here for honeymoon. They upgraded me to the spa suite. I cannot image that I can enjoy the spa in your suite. It was unbelievable . The birthday cake was nice with celebration card. For sure I will come back again. Keep moving banyan tree Macau I love it!,50
"The service, facility and enviornment are beyond expectation. The location is in the heart of the city and easily get to the attractions we want to go. Especially the spa is exceptionally professional and relax. Will recommend this hotel to everyone.",50
"Its quite expensive but it worths it. Excellent room quality and services, from the bell service to check in. I had a wonderful night there. The staff is helpful and polite. The room is comparatively larger and more comfortable than other hotels I stayed before. What surprises me is that there is a mini pool inside the room for us to enjoy a wonderful bath. It is a mind soaring night and I will come back in the future.",50
Very nice experience in Banyan Tree with passionate and considerate services from the staffs. Good location with various entertainments within the Galaxy Resort. Meanwhile you got plenty of choices for cuisines. Good choice for relaxing and travelling! ,50
"First time stay in banyantree, very deep impression is the size of the room, wow,extra large,and the unique pool inside, I am so enjoy with the aroma preserved in room, it‚Äôs my style. And also tried the spa there, excellent experience. No matter the therapist or the environment, I were totally absorbed into it. Still look forward my next trip to banyantree",50
"Before we come to Macau, we do lot of research for the selection of hotel. Finally we choose banyan tree macau as our destination to celebrate my birthday. During the reservation, they already pay attention to my needs and get to know we are celebrate the birthday and thanks for choosing us. Them they already prepared the cake and gift for us. During C/I, the stuff was nice, she upgrade me to the next room type as she notice we come from birthday, them she also guide me to the lift and say happy birthday to us. After enter the room, it was so big, bigger them my house. It have living room and dinning room, and with the big pool. It was very touching when they present the cake with handwriting birthday card. thanks you so much.",50
"I am going to leaving the place, sitting in the lobby and enjoy the peaceful environment with thi music. I spend 3 days in Macau and it is not enough. The rooms, the facility and restaurant and the spa. Especially outside with the big swimming pool and play zoom which it already take you one days. The rooms was so big, and even they got the pool in the rooms as well which was amazing. Also i love the bathtub, they do provide different bath menu for you to choose and you just need to pay extra but it is reasonable. Banyan tree Macau I will come back.",50
"As we sit in our upgraded room of 160m2, we thank the team of Banyan Tree for making our stay most enjoyable.  Thank you to Lily for making this possible.  Kids love the private pool in the gorgeously decorated room, and the water slides, wave pool, and meandering river make this resort fun every time we come.  We look forward to our next trip to banyan tree Macau, even before this one has come to an end. ",50
"Same as my husband, we are big fans of banyan tree band, the location and the environment which make me feel peaceful. Unfortunately , the selection for the hotels was very limtIted, not same like Starwood or others big hotels group, they opened everywhere, likely this time they have in Macau . It is very unique one,  the one you can find the different casino hotel . You can find the romantic and peaceful. The stuff was perfect .",50
"I am the big fans of banyan tree , I used to been banyan tree Bangkok banyan tree Phuket banyan tree lijiang . This time to Macau for sure banyan tree brand is my first brand choose to stay. As usual, excellent Thai service.  The room was so huge , thanks for the upgraded , the view was nice , u can 180 degree to see the entire galaxy complex . The food at saffron was good . The spa was amazing . I love it very much",50
"Banyan tree Macau is an amazing and comfort hotel, which we all enjoyed staying here. Not only the services and facilities makes us impressed,most importantly, it‚Äôs a really good resort and also the only one in Macau. Relax is the key to a trip, but banyantree did it.  I will come back with my family in future.",50

"Last Monday, my dear friends celebrated their wedding reception at Banyan Tree, really enjoyed our stay there since I‚Äôm one of those who arrived early to help in the preparation.   We started the program around 7pm and I really wanna appreciate the room attendant staff, Mj and Rona who really went the extra mile providing everything that we needed for the Wedding Celebration.  Great Job, Team Banyan Tree! Your excellent service is worth every dollar.",50
"The room is huge and it is really good to accommodate few friends for a little celebration of our macau wedding. I enjoy every bit of it- from details of the room to the people. Thank you to Manager Sasa for preparing everything for us especially the amenities and upgrade, to Yuki in front office for being soft spoken and informing us the details, to our housekeeping people Rona, Noble and Michael for being friendly and accommodating our needs.  We'll definitely return to let our family try as well. :)",50
"In love with the unique Pool Villa , the decoration and space design is really impressive. massive pool and the hot Jacuzzi and sauna room  is really a plus. Spa is always one of the best in the world.",50
"not value for money. not a traditional Banyan Tree the worst breakfast i ever had i stayed in signature pool suite. the room is big, but not clean enough, i can't feel the signature sensory of Banyan Tree.  ",20
"Nice room and facilities, very good service from all crews, must go the Sky pool and wave pool, we can spend a whole day to stay in the hotel! Love the mini pool inside the room that we can have a private time with nice river view outside!",50
"A very pleasant 2 nights stay. Room rates appeared expensive but given size and quality of accommodation, it was well worth. Wished we were staying longer to experience all facilities the resort offers. Did not feel was in a casino complex at all inside the resort. Staff were very friendly and helpful.",40
"Love the overall at Banyan Tree, thanks for the birthday wishes! Polite and friendly people provided great customer services! Grand resort deck and the wave pool also is amazing.  I‚Äôm sure you will fall in love with Banyan Tree once u stay here.",50
I was a breastfeeding mother who traveled without my baby. The service about breast milk storage is very efficient. Simply call the room service! The staffs were very friendly. The whole process was very smooth and made me feel confident to store the breast milk with them. ,50
"Its worth to spend our hoilday to stay at the hotel even didnt go out. The room is excellent and the beach for the children is excellent. All the staffs are friendly and helpful, looking for the next time to stay again",50
Liking the Galaxy Complex in Macao and having veen in Okura and Ritz Carton we had a look at Banyantree. The Hotel is grandand well done as most of the prime hotels in  Macao. Staff is friendly and helpful.  The problem for mewas when you enter the room. The smell turned ne off immediately. Smelled like stale smoke or whatever. The sent us all kind of airimprovers and I hot used to it. The small pool was fun 1 time but I think the rooms would be much better without constant water in it. They have also a big  wooden tub in the room which i think is nzch more fun and can be emptied to avoid the smell problem. We decided bot to extend our1 night and rather go in May to one of the other Galaxy complex hotels.,30
"A one night stay on a Wednesday (21/03). We inquired as soon as we arrived about the possibility of an upgrade and were given a signature pool suite for just 500 MOP more. It was great and the only quibble was that the pool temperature was 27 degrees, which was cooler than ideal, for us anyway. After a big lunch at Antonio in Old Taipa we didn't need much dinner so snacked upstairs in the bar. The spa was fantastic and the service throughout our stay was impeccable. The breakfast the next day was excellent and the staff were very well marshalled, which was not the case at the Conrad's breakfast place!",50
Good service in spa and breakfast.  The staff are nice and polite.  But cleanliness is bad with condom package under the bed and smell of smoke in the room. The water in the relaxation pool is too cold which cannot adjust.,30
I took out a few days after business trip to Guangzhou. Met with very friendly staff always ready to help and nothing was too much trouble. Room was breathtaking and very clean with nice views. I also like the way you can walk into the Galaxy hotel and other hotels without going outside. A good choice of bars and restaurants. A very pleasant and relaxing stay and will be staying at this hotel again ,50
"The first thing I have to say is that the customer service at the Banyan Tree is second to none. All the staff, from reception, to those in the restaurants and at the afternoon tea, at the spa and making up the room were friendly and attentive, paying attention to our needs and making the effort to ensure we had a great experience. Now to the room. It was amazing. Huge, with a massive king size bed, living room space, in room pool, walk through wardrobe and a lovely toilet including a big Japanese spa like bathtub. Perfect for just lounging around. Last but not least, I have to mention the spa. The word that springs to mind is Wow! From the moment we stepped into the spa, tranquility just enveloped us. The smells, the sounds, the grand high ceilings and gorgeous decor, all meld‚Ä¶",50
"This is our second visit to Banyan Tree Macau.  During the interval we have had the opportunity to try other hotels in Taipa but somehow they all lack the charisma when put alongside Banyan Tree.  Even though we arrived a couple of hours before check-in time, the lady at the reception tried her best to see if they had any room available.  No such luck as the hotel was fully booked the night before.  It wasn't hard to see why!  Everyone at the reception is multi-lingual and well trained, or may be even more polished than the ones we encountered on our last visit.  Refinement comes with maturity, I suppose.  The hotel is nice and quiet compared to the adjacent ones, with no tourist groups around.  The corridors are wide enough to allow guests as well as service trolleys to pass by‚Ä¶",50
"We had the opportunity to experience Banyan tree hospitality around Chinese new year... Omg, it was an amazing experience... Top notched services, resort is beautiful, clean....So relaxing in our two bedroom villa, having our own pool and spa area are magnificent... Breakfast is included in our package, however, I have higher expectations than that... When you think of there are all these yummy restaurants in Macau competing, I think Banyan can definitely work on it to improve. Will I go back?  For sure, next time when I need a retreat, definitely first place I think of... Also interested in other Banyan tree resorts in other cities too, see you in the near future.  ",50
"excellent service, full of smiling face, excellent room, very large, in room pool so relax! very clean and new decoration, extra cake and birthday card, upgrade of room for loyal customer. clear and face booking  and handling, fast check-in/out. ",50
"Very enjoyable stay especially with the in room poor. Staff are very friendly but express checkout isn't available. Honestly it is pretty strange if such a prestige hotel with express check out. Overall, it is a satisfying stay.",50
"My most enjoyable stay at the villa. Breakfast buffet was so so, however, the resort itself score and services deserve an applaud. Will definitely explore other banyan tree resorts in the future . Bravo.  ",50
"unexpected.  this trip is my trip trip.  I heard that Banyan Tree Hotel was great.The service was great.  Receptionist are great,  but the room not expected big and clean. the pool in room are dirty. But thanks for the birthday cake. ",20
"This luxurious Hotel has amenities which are not found everywhere--- for instance... a pool in your room??!  The Spa services are also quite unique-- and almost ""over the top""!!-- but its NOT a complaint!!  The emphasis on pools is almost a fantasy-- such as the relaxation pool-- or wooden bathtubs, a steam room and Jacuzzi.  The staff are very well trained, ""professional"" and seem motivated to provide the best assistance and service possible!!  The food is well prepared, very attractively presented as well as ""Yummy""!!  Being located in the ""Galaxy Complex"" also provides plenty of choices for entertainment, eating and shopping... The quality is ""almost Dreamlike""!!!",50
Came here for 3 nights for a birthday treat and stayed at one of the hotels villas which was amazing and very relaxing.   Unfortunately it was a little chilly during the time we came and was raining too so didn‚Äôt not get to maximise the pool they had outside but they had a steam room and a jacuzzi tub inside which was really nice. The bedrooms were spacious and decorated nicely. They also had a massive living room with a dining table which could comfortably fit 8 people without any problems.   The service was brilliant and he staff were very polite and helpful. On numerous occasions they even drove me and my group to our room on a buggy. There is also a massage room for 2 in the villa so you can get a massage without leaving your room but would advise you to go to the spa place‚Ä¶,50
"Been few Banyan tree hotels in China, Banyan tree Macau certainly match our expectation about service. Friendly greeting, great breakfast, the room is spacious and gorgeous. I only have one little problem, the pool in the room will running until it is full (i guess is feng shui thing) which at beginning might be a little noisy if you want a quiet moment. Another thing is this beautiful pool is not warm enough. (the waiter kept told us the temperature cant go high) that means if you stay inside a little longer than gets cold. Otherwise it has been a pleasant stay experience.",50
Have stayed it a couple of times. Service is excellent. Amenities excellent. Room beyond excellent. We would really stay here again. Everyday is a different scent. The breakfast is good. We will definitely stay here again. ,50
"We have stayed in the Villa during our vacation. Andry and KK provied us an excellent serivces to us. The Villa was beyond our exepctation including the prviate swimming pool. Moreover, KK phoned me and  to do all the pre arrangements before our arrival . ...excellent serivces.",50
"I can‚Äôt believe I did review this place sooner!! This is by far the best hotel I have ever stayed in and I‚Äôm sure it will be VERY hard to top. The service we received was out of this world, especially from Sonia at reception and Andy who made our days by the pool very accommodating! He was always willing to help and a very lovey man. If you are staying here, I recommend using the Banyan tree pool as this is for their guests only however, anyone staying in the galaxy can use the main pool and wave machine. They have rooftop rapids which were really fun!   The pool in the room was fantastic and so relaxing after a night out. This hotel was extremely clean and I love the hot wax and incense they offer in the rooms. Towels were always replaced and I never felt I had to ask for‚Ä¶",50
We had our honeymoon here with their honeymoon package and all are perfect! The room was beyond our expectation and well designed with in room pool and bath tub. High end furnitures and fixtures even their toiletries and minibar. You wouldn't want to go outside. Their food was amazing and service was exceptional!  ,50
"First of all, amazing size, layout and decor. The room looks nothing short of stunning once you enter with the relaxation pool that stretches for about 3m next to the window as the focal point. It looks especially glorious during sunrise and for this alone I‚Äôd give a review of 4 stars.   Dimly lit, resort style decor with the aroma from the burning fragrance oil reminding you that you‚Äôre on a holiday.. the relaxation pool starts from a large sofa facing a TV mounted on a divider and ends with the beds on the other side. Bathroom has a very nice round wooden bathtub and a shower with two rainfall shower heads.   However, room cleaning could definitely be improved. Noting some of the shortcomings: candle for the fragrance oil was not replaced for one of the days, magazines read‚Ä¶",40
"We stayed 5 nights with our kids in a Resort view Pool Suite.  It was a very relaxing time.  The room and service was nothing but 5 star.  Buffet Breakfast was great and although not huge in variety,  it was large enough and all the food was fresh and presented well, rather than just bulk amounts.  Loved the room as it was big and accommodated us well.  The service in the lobby area was fantastic. Always taking care of our requests and offering assistance. Just wish we had time to visit the Day Spa.  Thank you to the Banyan Tree people. ",50
"We recently had our fourth stay-cation at the Banyan Tree pool villas and it was fantastic.  This hotel is truly a luxury experience, and one that is worth it!    The pool villas at the Banyan Tree are my absolute favorite place to have a special occasion celebration.  It is such a beautiful space and the benefit of having a private outdoor space is worth it!  Even though it's winter here in Macau, the pool was still very temperate and fun to enjoy on a bright sunny day - and the hot tub was perfect.    Every staff member that we encountered was extremely helpful - and being that it was a return visit it was very nice that they remembered us.  The attention to detail by all staff members (from the gentlemen that greeted us at the door and brought all our bags to our villa to our‚Ä¶",50
"I am very pleased with my room! Let‚Äôs just say, my stay in Macau with my love one is fantastic, thanks to this hotel!  I was greeted by Rebecca, a fun and loving lady. She assisted me throughout my check ins, and everything went smoothly.   She even prepared a cake and a red wine for my stay because I was celebrating my anniversary, which made my stay more loving and happy!  Room wise I would say the TV channels are more to the Chinese channels, not much of blockbusters (US). Space wise is spacious, image 2 people in a King Suite. I had a nice view facing the pool, and facing Venetian. Amenities wise is the bomb! Shower room equipped with 2 rain heads! Their bath salt is perfect! Don‚Äôt miss the bath salt!

"I can tell you , I stayed in many hotels around the world, but this it was my favorite. I stayed in an apartment with 2 rooms, one with a huge sofa and a big office table. Along the window it is a very big pool (6x1.2 meters) which passed both rooms. In the bedroom you will find and stylish Japanese barrel...very, very fancy...also the toilet and  both showers are excellent. At the superior level you will find a nice indoor pool and sauna. the restaurants are amazing. Very good room service...AMAZING place!...TIP: in the Galaxy building you will easily find a karaoke bar with amazing attractions.",50
"My favourite hotel in Macau. A great place to stay in the summer due to the water park. The smell, taste and service in general is 5 star. The room was excellent and I could not find fault with anything :)",50
"Got upgraded to a bigger suite. Not only did I get a little pool, but also a spa room with jacuzzi. Too bad I was there for business and did not spend too much time in the suite. Breakfast was good and staff were all polite. I loved the hotel scent and of course, the room! Would definitely be back with my family! ",50
"This is our third time staying in banyan tree macau,perfect room service,Friendly staffs,accomodating.the rooms are big and comfortable and so relaxing.i highly recommend the hotel. Im definitely coming back again.",50
"Without hesitation, me and my friends chose this hotel for our trip to Macau. We had a great experience at the hotel, it is one of the best hotel ever!! We stayed at the 2 bedroom villa and it was very luxurious. The bedroom is very comfortable, the staffs are very friendly and helpful. Even though the price for a night is costly, but it is really worth it. But, the only drawback is the in room dining, it tasted bland, for a good hotel you should have good foods. I highly recommend this hotel.",50
"We always wanted to visit Macau to explore its unique heritage and scrumptious food. After looking through reviews here and getting excellent feedback from friends, without any hesitation we have chosen Banyan Tree hotel for our stay. We got nothing to complain about the room, service and the staff there as they are significantly better than our expectation.The elegant room, prompt service and friendly staff have made our day. We highly recommend this hotel and we are sure you will be as satisfied as us!",50
"Great experience in this hotel. Bedroom and shower room are clean and comfortable, and it is quiet at night which is good for sleep. Staff are friendly and helpful. Although the price is out of my budget, we still very much enjoyed our stay. Overall, I recommended this hotel.",50
Very expensive for no particular reason. Food is at best ordinary. Very low quality ingredients and underwhelming. Staff are not particularly friendly or helpful. Location wasn't particularly amazing. Wouldn't recommend ,10
"Great facilities in the room, especially for the shower, this is very comfortable and excellent,, the staff is so helpful for the birthday cake arrangements, this is the unforgettable experience in this hotel and this brand!! We are enjoyable !!",50
"got upgrade to President Suite with just a budgeted cost. the suite is almost 9000sq ft in 2 levels. Everything is gorgeous. they are seperated with walk in area, living room, meeting area and working desk, piano playing area, 2 dining area, coffe table/bar and a wine cellar on the lower level. there is a huge cooking and preparation area for the chef to prepare food for you if necessary. on the upper level, there are 2 bed rooms and between there is a pool for relax. there is steam room, sauna room and 2 massage beds too. you can enjoy every relax moment here. there is an extra single bed room for maid or guard..... there is a door which you can go direct to the gym and swimming pool for the hotel guest. there is not much guest using these facilitly and you may feel even these‚Ä¶",50
"We started our holiday in Hong Kong, and after 5 days we find ourselves in a turbo jet heading to Macau. This is a suggestion for improvement: As we were through the immigration, there was no staff of Banyan Tree to welcome or assist us with our luggage. So we carried all 3 big luggage plus our 3 bags, went down the stairs and up (you know how difficult it is as I was expecting that once we step out of immigration we will be free from worry of how we are going to carry our luggage. I believe that is what 5 star luxury does) to go to the bus stations where again, no Banyan Tree staff. It is not a problem that we rode in a Galaxy bus but why no Banyan Tree staff? This really a bad arrival experience and I really hope that this can be improve. You want to make a good first‚Ä¶",50
"I visited Macau a few times a year and this was for my marriage proposal. I have always wanted to stay in Banyan Tree ever since it was opened and my stay there did not disappoint me at all. The staff replied my email usually within hours when i communicated with them to go over my proposal plan. And although I have numerous questions to just to make my marriage proposal plan better, the staff answered them one by one patiently and throughly. I had them assisted me in decorating the room with petals. I also asked them to help communicate with local florist for the delivery of the flower. They have made the atmosphere of my room so romantic that my girlfriend was really surprised when she stepped foot in the room. Their dedication and determination to make my stay a memorable‚Ä¶",50
"My friends and family have been here numerous times and it will always be our first choice to celebrate birthdays, holidays or to simply unwind ourselves. Attendants and staffs will always make time for you and will provide you services with a smile. I recommend this amazingly awesome place 10/10. Too bad i can only rate 5stars because i would give 7stars if i could. We will be coming back soon. Kudos to all the staffs and god bless.",50
This is an amazing hotel within the Galaxy complex. Luxurious modern suites with full facilities and an in-room pool as well as a tub. Beautiful d√©cor.  Awesome spa and Gym on the top floor as well. Great service. In total the best place I've stayed in a long time!,50
Stayed at the banyan tree pool villa and received exceptional service and the villa is worth to stay at for a relaxing vacation. The front desk staff and villa team was very friendly and professional. The pool side barbecue dinner was amazing as well. Look forward to visit again soon. ,50
"On August 24th, after the typhoon Hato, we decided to go for dinner at Galaxy as we didn't have water at home. After dinner we tried to get a taxi at the Diamond Lobby but it was a huge queue. So, we decided to go to Banyan Tree to get a taxi.  When we arrived there, no taxi was available, so I went to the door man's counter and asked if it was possible to get a taxi.  Angus introduced himself, very politely, tried to call various times to different taxi companies, and when there was no hope of getting a taxi , he nicely got as a map to try to find the most suitable bus .  Meanwhile we were able to get a taxi.  But after all the stress and damaged caused by the typhoon, Angus made us feel cared.  We would like to appreciate his great service, thank you Angus ! ",50
The hotel was still dealing with the aftermath of a recent typhoon and several items were unavailable or were coming back online during our stay. The staff were very attentive to our needs and tried to help make our visit as pleasant as possible. Our only issue was an overcooked cheeseburger during room service that was promptly remedied. Special thanks to the concierge for their help.,40
"If ever you want to enjoy the best Sunday Brunch in Macau, you have to try the Galaxy - Banyan Tree. From the minute you enter the 31st floor, the views are stunning and you are greeted by the most friendly and warm staff - Den, William and Jack were just amazing and ensured that all our needs were met with such grace and elegance.  The free flowing Mo√´t was perfectly chilled and they knew just when to refill our glasses.  The food was amazingly delicious and it was pleasant to see no long queues at the food area.  The lobsters and crabs and lamb chops were perfectly seasoned to tease our palates and make you want to try more and more.  The deserts were to die for and we found ourselves eating  more that we should.  Overall 2 thumbs up for the Banyan Tree Macau and thanks to‚Ä¶",50
"Our family had a great one night stay at Banyan tree Macau. The lobby was smaller those other hotels on the strip but it must be the most comfortable one especially after experienced the lobby of JW Marriott the previous night. The corridor  had the best aromatic smell, best decoration among the hotels of the Galaxy complex. The room we had was truly amazing. It was actually a suite, with an in room small pool, which was perfect for our kids. My wife and me could relax on the sofa while kids were having  fun in that warm water pool. Staff were nice and responded to our requests quick. Room service was good. Overall, I would rate it the best hotel of Galaxy complex, with the best rooms. I have already booked two nights for a weekend get away with my family in two weeks time. I‚Ä¶",50

"My wife and i spent two nights here and it was an experience we will never forget. The room itself is about as premium as they come, day beds, dipping pool, old school style barrel bath, twin showers and a California king bed. Needless to say we didn't leave the room much.  The service was at you would expect, top notch. Id stay again in a heart beat.",50
The room is much bigger than the other hotels in Macau. But the price is certainly more expensive. The staffs were friendly and patient. The candle in the room smells very nice but the corridor is a bit dark. It would be better if the balcony is unlocked. For the pool is smaller than I expected as the one in Phuket island is much bigger.,50
"Excellent service from checking in to checking out.  The concierge was very helpful finding prices and availability for selected shows.  Also helped with picking restaurants around the area.  Rooms are exactly what the website shows.  Clean, spacious, great beds (I'm a Chiropractor), and smells great. Never have I wanted to return to my room so much.   Shower pressure was good and the Asian toilets with rinse and dry features were a nice touch.   Definitely return for another stay. ",50
"We stayed in Banyan tree in June 17, All the rooms are suite rooms in this hotel, so u can imagine the thoughts of the management...   Our room as expected was big, elegant and beautiful, the room has a plunge pool, nice to relax, with the stunning view, what more can u ask...  Banayan tree is the part of Galaxy, which is sheer piece of luxury, The have Beautiful water park and nice swimming pool, the Atmosphere of Galaxy is nothing less then a grand palace and u feel yourself like a King..

"While the pools inside our room was a treat for my two daughters, the 100-sqm space was glorious for me. My kids also enjoyed the Roofdeck area (giant water theme park) immensely, and spent most of their time there. Definitely a great location for shopping and eating, you will not run out of choices in the Galaxy compound.",50
"Banyan Tree Macau is one of the top holiday resort to go to for excellent accommodation, service and amenities. Stay at a villa and you will experience one of the most excellent service an organisation can offer. The experience begins from the airport pick up, to being welcome when we reach the resort. All the rooms are just perfect and we have our own swimming pool with a warm jacuzzi .  The surrounding amenities are just perfect for both the adults and children. Staying in the villa is like a home away from home with service on hand.  ",50
i have not stay in this hotel but i visited the lobby and the spa. The spa is the best spa i have ever tried in my life!! everything was amazing. if you are going to Macau you should try their hammams and the massage.,50
"Yes its expensive but it worths every single dollars you paid It located in galaxy but unlike others not many non guests at the lobby so relatively quite.  We lived at the SIGNATURE POOL SUITE and its gorgeous. Dont wanna leave the room with the private pool in-room. There is house keeping at around 6 pm, for changing the towels and making up the bed for us. Which is very great as we do need towels after the use of the pool. Things are just gorgeous at every aspect.",50
"Stayed one night in 2-bed rooms private pool villa with my family & son-in-law. Check in was fast and friendly. We all "" wow "" when we entered the living room & got really excited when toured around the whole establishment. There is a jacuzzi and a sauna room. Each room can access directly to the outdoor pool. Total area was 950m2. We didn't take meals in the hotel as this time we were exploring those old areas & had our meals there. One more plus is that it's easy to get taxis at entrance of Banyan Tree instead of long queues at other hotels. Staff we encountered were all polite, friendly & efficient which enabled us a very enjoyable short break in Macau. Thank you !",50
"If you are looking to stay in a hotel room that's different to anyplace else - these rooms hit the mark.  Having a pool in our actual hotel room is amazing!  The rooms here are luxurious and beautifully appointed.  We spent two nights here and I wish I could have stayed a month!  I did not want to leave the room but the galaxy resort also has a wave pool and other great pools.  Big thank you to the staff who upgraded us on our arrival to a spa suite - made us feel very special!  My eight year old daughter, husband and I loved loved loved this hotel!",50
"Recently we stayed for a third time in one of the three bedroom pool villas, and as always it was excellent.  We live and work in Macau, and on occasion have small gatherings with friends to take a break.  Each time we have selected the Banyan Tree as our venue we have been super impressed with the level of service provided.  All of the staff are polite and efficient, helping with anything we need.  It is also lovely that so many staff recognize that we have stayed there before and welcome us back.  This is definitely one of the best of Macau for spectacular service and first-class facilities.  Will always recommend people stay here.",50
"Stayed at the room of Signature suite. Everything of this hotel was totally PERFECT. Love the scents and pool systems. Helpful staffs, really clean and the view of this hotel was just incredible! I'd love to stay here if I go to Macau again.",50
"I had a visit to the Banyan Tree Macau with my mum earlier this May and the experience was phenomenal - wandering around inside the hotel was like exploring somewhere in Thailand, the overall design was very 'Thai' with plenty of wooden elements and lightings of a dim, warm tone. As an all-suite hotel, even their most basic/standard room type, the Cotai Pool Suite which was of 100sqm, could put you in awe.  To sum up, the Banyan Tree Macau is quite an outstanding one from its peers in Macau and its just so perfect for a weekend getaway! ",50
"My business partner and myself had the rooms with the pool in the rooms and they are superb! As the whole hotel is! Very tasteful, very warm decorated, very high service level of the staf, great restaurant in the hotel, great pool venue...when Macau then for sure this hotel recommended!",50
Not to mention the impeccable in-villa service which was efficient and friendly. The buggy arrived always on time and the overall service was attentive to the point of being indulgent. The outdoor heated pool was absolutely heavenly.,50
"Banyan Tree Macau offered the best experience imaginable, from picking you up from the Macau terminal with a congenial butler in a spacious seven seater to offering a relaxing Banyan tree spa area. We stayed at the Banyan Tree Bauhinia, objectively by far the best villa available in Macau. A truly unforgettable experience.",50
"Stayed in Banyan Tree Macau for anniversary with my girlfriend. Excellent services from all the hotel staff, especially housekeeping &a front desk. Smiley face, with promising services.

Thanks for everything.",50
"It's hard not to compare the new casino complex to the likes in Vegas, only this development is much newer and grander.  We stayed at a handful of hotels in this marvelous casino complex, and the Banyan Tree is one of the high end hotel. It connects to other hotels, casinos, movie theater, shopping, restaurants, pool, spa and more.  One can spend days without leaving the premise.  We stayed at one of the luxury room that has a long pool and a wooden soaking tub. The room is spacious, and the view was great.  My mom especially like the in-room pool and she did aqua walking whenever she likes.",50

"Stayed at the banyan tree and what a memorable experience. The room we stayed in had an indoor pool, with warm water, an enormous japanese style bathtub made of wood, and lots of other small things that completed the experience. There is a living room with a second enormous tv and they prepare the room with the essential oil and incense of your choice when checking in. Good breakfast buffet and the manager settled a slight misunderstanding that occurred by waving one of our companions charge for the breakfast buffet and gave us an extra complimentary bed. Top notch place, with top notch service. Recommend it!",50
"I live in HK, but this was the first hotel I stayed at with my girlfriend (long-distance) when she came to HK and we went to Macau. It was definitely the right choice.  We arrived an hour early and our room wasn't ready (which is fine), so they politely asked us to come back in an hour, which we did. When our room was still not ready (now at check-in time), they apologized and upgraded us to an even larger suite!  We were blown away when we walked in. The room was massive, with the huge pool in the middle, and champagne on ice waiting for us.  Being a part of the Galaxy complex of course has its benefits, with the big (main) pool and plethora of restaurants etc. around.  Great breakfast buffet too, and the spa is next-level.  Definitely one of the best places to stay as a couple‚Ä¶",50
Part of a big casino complex but the hotel is very quiet (including the lobby). Room size is very generous and the pool in the room is small but functional to relax in. The spa is fantastic and highly recommended. ,50

"A very big Thank You for the whole Team in Banyan Tree! I made the decision to have my proposal done in this beautiful hotel and it certainly live up to the expectations. Such a great experience from a Great Hotel, from Reservation Staff Yuki (for flower & beverage enquiry), to Front Desk Carman (amendment to the booking follow up) & Katrina which help me with the Check-In and follow up on the decoration. Great job to the Housekeeping team as well as they done a fantastic setup that surprise my future wife and myself as well! Last but not least, Front Desk manager Michael quickly approach me upon departure to make sure my plan went smooth the night before, truly excellent service.  Lets hope we can come back again for our Anniversary celebration in future. :)",50

"We had a safe and wholesome teen birthday party in a suite at the Banyan Tree Macau.  ""Sa Sa"" checked us in and made sure my nephew Sam had a cake ""that he liked"". ( unusual for a receptionist)  Everybody had a great time and the hotel staff were super attentive.  The pool and club area outside are a safe way to have a great party for a group of kids without terribly stringent supervision. We didn't have to worry because the staff are very engaging and quite creative in their mindset.  Great time and we should have booked more time but the kids had homework on Sunday.  Six Star venue for birthdays, anniversaries, or to just pamper you wife/ husband for a night or two.  ",50
"Everything was beyond perfect! Best of all was the service from the personnel. They remembered our names and was always cheerful, helpful and polite, while still being personal. The rooms are to die for, with your own (small) indoor pool. The area outside was vast with lifeguards all around the different pools. The only downside to our entire visit was that the outdoor pool area closes as 6pm. The resort has a casino and a lot of shopping but these things don't interest us. We rarely left the hotel, since we were here for relaxation. Their own restaurant Belon, at the top floor, has great food and staff.  Would recommend in an heartbeat!",50
"We had two babies travel with us, excellent services and free upgrade to their 888 sq meters presidential suites was the highlight of the trip. This is the biggest presidential suites we ever stayed in. It's a wow experiences. ",50

"We booked one night last minute, definitely wish we stayed longer and will be back! The hotel was fantastic, the room sublime and the service top quality. Our son (19 months) LOVED the in room relaxation pool and it was really perfect for his height! I used the spa service and had potentially the best massage I've ever had - and I've had a few, so that says quite a bit. We had dinner and breakfast at the hotel, which leads me to....  The only reason why this is not 5 stars. The dinner we had at Saffron was very good but the breakfast left a bit to be desired. The choices were a bit limited and the quality wasn't as good as expected. To be honest, that didn't upset us as we weren't there to eat but to relax and enjoy family time.

Stayed here for 1 night for my 40th Birthday the lady at check in was wonderful gave us a upgrade for my birthday which l really appreciate the room was spacious and beautiful  and then to my surprise when in room a beautiful birthday cake.

Resturants plenty to chose from we had buffet breakfast in hotel which was yum and worth the money. Pools plenty to choose from for adults or kids including indoor. Like to thank all the staff for such a wonderful stay which made my 40th birthday very special. I will definitely be back with the kids in future. Once again thank you.

Banyan Full Day package definitely an irresistible option to pamper oneself a relaxation reward after hardwork. ",50
"Outstanding. Can't really think of anything not available for the ultimate comfort. In room jacuzzi, wooden bathtub for 2, double showers and so on and on. Service level as you expect from a Banyan.

"This is not our first time staying at Banyan Tree.  It was always a pleasant experience staying at Banyan Tree. They amazed me again with a perfect suite with a relaxation pool, very spacious suite, clean & tidy with a nice smell. If you check-in on week days, the price is reasonable.  Spa treatment is perfect, too. I noticed that staff at the Spa were sent to a training school. The technique is just perfect. They give you a discount too at the time of hotel reservation.   The staff at In Room Dining are fantastic; not only did they provide service with a smile, they are professional and pay attention to details. The same compliment goes to House Keeping too. The suite is clean and tidy.  However, their staff at the front office, on the other hand, behaved so differently. Two‚Ä¶",50
"basically I would like to stay again on April , or May but if the price would like to make 10% cheaper which would be highly appreciated.. also the pool  inside the room the water temperature only 17 degree, which a little but cold, if can adjust  to 20-25 would be very good ",40
"I've once booked a room named sky villa. It was actually just a suite with no balcony. So i asked the managers to change the name of the room and don't mislead others for thinking it is actually a villa. With great attitude, the manager promised that they would change the name and gave me a real villa. I went back to the same hotel every time i visit Macau.  The spa was awesome, remember to request the room with the night sky ceiling, you won't regret ",50
"This spectacular hotel and derivation offer no less than 4 hotel in one destination known as the Galaxy.   My favorite hotel by far is the spa inspired tower know as part of the Banyan Tree hotel collection. The zen vibe, spa inspired colors and music start the beautiful lobby and continue through our the spectacular property.  The staff is overwhelmingly welcoming and go out of their way to deliver a great stay and it all comes off as genuine and low key.  The hotel restaurant is without a view or windows but the stunning decor and high ceilings make up for the shortcoming. The cuisines is fabulous and inspired by southeast asian and India and full of flavor.  But the highlight is the spectacular guest rooms. Ours was oversized with a giant ""pool"" that flanked the window.‚Ä¶",50
A memorable stay at this hotel! Room was super clean and we really enjoyed our stay here. Loved the in-room pool which provided total relaxation. Comfortable bed and pillows. We will definitely come back in the future!,50
"The Staff treated us like Royalty.  Always calling us by name.  Nothing was a bother, they anticipated our needs, immediately new what drinks and food we preferred.  Our room was amazing with our own indoor pool. Restaurant Belon was exquisite.  Saffron was a Joy, Special mention to Vladimir and Neo and all the female staff too. Banyan Tree Macau was a True pleasure and we recommend to all !!",50
"Came here for afternoon tea with friends. Beautiful decor, excellent service and food was good. Staff was very attentive to details and I would highly recommend the afternoon tea set to friends and family.",40
"Fantastic short break - didn't want to leave the room, so relaxing in the middle of the chaos of Macau.The spa is mind blowing relaxing  massage and treatments Great staff throughout all very helpful and willing to go extra mile.",50
"It is only my second time to stay in a Banyan Tree property and still the hotel lived up to my expectation.  Our room was beautifully decorated and very spacious overlooking the river. There was a relaxing pool inside which the attendant prepared as soon as we got inside the room. The wooden basin-like bathtub added a very nice touch to the overall room decor. Toiletries in their signature scent were provided. Outside of Japan, this is the first time I encountered a Japanese toilet in a hotel with all its convenient uses.  Hotel guests are entitled to use the Galaxy resort deck which was so much fun!!! Also, if you just want to unwind, get a tan and swim peacefully, there's a separate pool intended for Banyan Tree guests only.  They have a wide and varied breakfast choices‚Ä¶",50
"I have always been a fan of Banyan Tree. This hotel was no exception. It was beautifully decorated, rooms are spacious and very comfortable. But we did have a bit of an issue with the pool. Our whole room smelt of damp and was extremely cold. But once we out the heating, the smell and steam problem became more pronounced. I'm not sure I would go back to this particular hotel.",40
"I had heard a lot about banyan tree hotels, but it wasn't until my wife took me to this one that I fully understood what relaxation was.   Impressive layout, great room features.   Would return without question ",50
"My partner and I were really happy to come back again after a year. Some areas has improved and some has deteriorate.   Location: Right next to Galaxy, can take galaxy shuttle to get around but it takes around 5-10 mins walk from Galaxy to Banyan tree. 5 mins walk to Ritz carlton, Marriot and Broadway hotel very convenient. Not close to major tourists destinations but can get around with cab.   Room: First impression of the room was even better than the first. The minutes we walked in we could hear water running in the indoor pool and the water was still warm which made it perfect to dip right in. Spa music was being played we felt super relaxed right after we entered the room. The ambience was unbeatable. We received a bottle of complimentary wine and fruit basket to welcome us‚Ä¶",50
Terrific and wonderful from start to finish Simply cannot fault this place - amazing decor amazing service and hats off to the turn down service Amazing! A must stay! The breakfast is also yummy and the hotel is so peaceful despite being in a busy resort,50
"Our stay at Banyan Tree was perfect. We did not want to leave. The service was excellent - from the warm greeting at check-in to the politeness of our room attendants - everyone was there to make sure our every need was met. And the room itself - it took our breath away. First of all, the standard room is not a room at all. It is more of a 1 bedroom suite. Even the standard room has a 15-foot pool/hot tub inside the room. When you first enter the room, the pool is empty but the water is running. Once filled, the water turns on automatically to maintain the temperature at a really nice 27 degrees Celsius. My 2 young kids loved the pool and quickly declared it to be the highlight of their entire vacation to Asia. We were all disappointed after our Xmas trip to Sapporo was canceled‚Ä¶",50
"We live in Hong Kong with three young children and wanted to celebrate our anniversary with a romantic getaway, but we weren't prepared to travel far without the kids. Macau appealed due to the short commute and we opted for the Banyan Tree on several friends' recommendations. Despite the strong endorsements, we were still pleasantly surprised!  The Banyan Tree Macau is the most luxurious, classy, relaxing hotel either of us has ever stayed in, and my wife flew the globe with a major international airline for 20 years! From the moment you enter the lobby and smell the lemongrass aroma that lingers throughout its halls, the Banyan Tree hotel and its staff manage to get every note just right.  The staff consistently made every effort to convey warmth and welcome, anticipated our‚Ä¶",50
"Excellent room facilities plus exceptional outstanding customer service I have ever experienced in Macau.  Spa, no matter the ambiance of the massage room and the techniques of the associate were very good as well. ",50
"It is a sanctuary!! The room is so professionally design that you can hardly find any fault!  The room is very specious, a pool with 2 daybeds along the windows where sunrises and sunsets are on display everyday !",50
It's not our first time to stay here but actually our third time! I always choose to stay here because of the warm welcome of the staffs.  Aomori was very helpful during our stay. They also upgraded our room to a suite which is AWESOME! It's my mom and mother in laws first time to stay in Banyan tree and they are so amazed how big our room is with a relaxation pool thanks to Vicky for accommodating us. I will definitely come back and stay here.,50
"The title says it all! The Cotai Pool Suite is simply WOW... Nice view, indoor (relaxation) pool, comfortable bed, wireless connection that works. Absolutely love this hotel! Service is exceptional too!",50
"It's the birthday of mine and my girlfriend when we went to the hotel. I waited awhile in the middle of the lobby to check in as seems everyone is busy. The front desk lady upgraded us to a room with Jacuzzi as it is a birthday trip but she asked us to wait an hour although it is 3pm already ( A bit surprised she did not give the birthday greetings to us even she has our id on hand). I came back 40 minutes later but the room was still not ready and she was busy checking on the phone for our room. So i told her i would be outside. I waited for another 20 minutes and no one came to inform us the room is ready or giving us even a glass of water. When i went check again finally the room is ready thanks god.  However when we went up the room, our bags are still not yet in and we have‚Ä¶",30
"Outstanding, simply outstanding.  The new General Manager has made a great difference from what the property was 6 months ago!  So happy to be back and see the positive quality changes.  The staff is well trained and attentive to all details.  The food is delicious, soft shell crab was to die for.  A must see in Macau!",50
"We are loss for words.  Banyan Tree Hotel is truly exceptional.  We love love love this hotel!!! My kids love the room, indoor pool, jacuzzi and the beach.  Thank you Sasa - from reception for welcoming us. Looking forward in using other Banyan Hotels on our next vacation.",50
"First of all the 100 square meter pool view suite with king bed is not 100 square meter for sure it feels much smaller, so I feel they are dishonest about the size of the room as a selling point.   Second the room feels a little bit not so well maintained showing signs of aging and doesn't feel super clean as you would expect in a five star hotel.  The ""pool"" in the room looks cool, but is kind of pointless it's not a jacuzzi and not warm so you won't enjoy spending time in it, also the large water surface makes the room very humid and the pool makes noises so that may bother you.  The service is quite good and they are very friendly and accommodating, but the concierge was kind of bad.  The in room dining is accommodating for gluten free options so that's a positive if you have‚Ä¶",30
"I stay in Banyan Tree Macau with my girlfriend for celebration and I contacted the Front Office Manager Daniel, to arrange a surprise for my girlfriend prior to our arrival. We were taken care during the whole period of stay, from the arrival to the departure and even the amazing service from the villa hosts. I could say that's Perfect !! I'd like to express my sincere thankfulness to Daniel for this thoughtful assistance and passion. This is exactly what service I expect from a 5-star hotel. Also special thanks to Leo as well as the housekeeping team for their considerate services. I will definitely come back to this hotel again not because of anything else but just to experience this kind of high standard services from the team!",50
"we all expect high standards from any banyan tree, but this one situated in the galaxy casino block took my breath away. the room was so spacious and comfy that I didn't even go to the lazy river or wave pool visible below. there are convenient free shuttles to the other casinos and mainland etc. the concierge and check in very efficient and went out of their way to help me with ferry bookings etc.",50
"We loved the gorgeous views, the comfortable beds ,the room pool so nice with amazing bathtub , casinos is near everything is near good location ,Overall i totally enjoyed my stay and look foward to coming back.",50
"Aside from some dishonesty at check-in (we were told every room was occupied even though it was absolutely clear that was false), this place was perfect.   The room was amazing, the pool was great, and the food was delicious. Good service for the remainder of our stay made up for the poor welcome. I would definitely stay here again if I end up returning to Macau.",50
"Loved our mini staycation.. lovely big luxe room, nice decor, good service.. special dinner and cocktails upstairs in top restaurant..fabulous pool.. all highly enjoyable. Shuttle from ferry makes it easy to get to.. it was a real treat.. ",50
"The hotel is very good, with all the luxuries and comforts of a seven star hotel. The view inside it is simply breathtaking and the ambience is something out of this world. I just found it quite expensive. You can visit the hotel, even if you stay elsewhere. So i just found it to fall a little short for value of money, except that, its perfect. Also, i want to add that you have to enter the hotel, through the Galaxy hotel, as it is inside the galaxy group of hotels. So it a long walk inside, be prepared.",40
Went with a girlfriend and enjoyed the unlimited cocktails from 5-9 immensely! Staff is so accommodating and the cocktails are really good. Very relaxed atmosphere and the view is tops. Really a great deal when visiting Macau.,50
"A fantastic hotel and well worth the room rate. Everything is designed for a most relaxing stay, the check in is quick and friendly, and the room is one the finest if not the finest in Macau with separate lounge, bedroom and bathroom complete with hot tub and cute pool all fitted out magnificently. The wi-fi works well  and the star attraction is access to the out door wave pool and gardens which are beautiful laid out. Also the lazer light show in the evening is great sitting by the pool or from Cabana restaurant and which makes for a wonderful evening.",50
It was a surprise weekend away for my birthday and it was perfect! We were on level 25 (signature pool suite) the rooms are quiet large - where I feel we need to find friends & have a massive dinner party :) We were not bothered by others & even felt we were here on our own! The place is amazing but is a little pricey. Totally distressed from HK everyday living in a 3 day surprised weekend away!,50
"The room was huge and d√©cor was exceptional. The room pool was also a huge plus point. Considering all the extra space and room pool, the price seems reasonable (at least when you really want to indulge yourself.",40
"Stayed in the Spa Sancturary suite for 1 night. The room is huge and spacious for three of us (probably it was too big). My 3-year old kid couldn't stop to swim in various ""pools"" inside the room. He laid on the comfortable sofa and enjoyed watching his favourite cartoon. We did enjoy the outdoor pool even though it was a bit cold in October. Really have a luxury experience in Banyan Tree Macau. Staffs were nice and the overall experience was good. The bed was comfortable and I believe that you can enjoy a luxury treat for yourselves in Banyan Tree for special occasions.",40
"Overall experience was good, the room was spacious with an in-room pool, love that they have provided kid's size slippers.  The indoor pool and sauna were excellent, food served was up to standard, a good choice for family short break",40
"Set within the Galaxy Hotel and Casino complex, the Banyan Tree Hotel is quiet, with beautiful rooms (all suites, in room pool, multiple reclining spaces, soaking tub and double showers) and outstanding solicitous service. Everyone went out of their way to be helpful. The spa is beautiful as well as are the three pools including a wave pool attached to a sandy beach (artificial).",50
"Had my wedding banquet here in Macau Banyan Tree half year ago and received a free one night room certificate, so just redeem it and have some fun with my wife as a 'half year' anniversary.  The room and service were all impressive until when we were leaving/checking out the room on next morning.......we found a used ""condom"" on the floor, somewhere next to the sofa seat and pool.  We didn't notice that when we checked in the previous night.....it is just disgusting when we think back...and really mess up our memory.  i did report that to the front desk during check-out and they did apologise, well i didn't blame them much as i think the Housing/Cleaning team should take the blame.  I am always a fan of Banyan Tree(that's why i had my wedding here) and i hope this ‚Ä¶",20
"In Cotai (which is not the center of Macau) but still in a very nice complex : Galaxy.  The feel is the same as in every banyan tree : zen attitude, nice smell and good service.  We got a very nice Spa Sanctuary Suite which included an in room relaxing swimming pool, a huge living room, a great bathroom and a spa area (two massage tables and a jacuzzi).  Nice check in staff.  Breakfast was very disappointing (looked like a lunch, service was not great, did not look like a 5 stars hotel breakfast).  We only stayed there for a night to see what Macau was alike and it was a good experience. ",50
"  My family and I spend 4 incredible days at the Banyan Tree Macau. The hotel is amazing; rooms are the best we ever experienced, they are huge with even a relaxation pool and a wooden bathtub that can accommodate 2 persons. Service all over is very friendly and attentive without being obtrusive; nothing is too much to ask and always delivered with enthusiasm.  Restaurants are spectacular, we loved the Thai food at Saffron and the Sunday Brunch at Belon was outstanding with fee flow of Moet and Chandon Champagne and a huge display of tasty food.  Banyan tree resorts have always been a favorite of mine for holidays and Banyan Tree Macau is without a doubt a pure jewel for the company.  Keep up the good work and hopefully see you soon.  ",50
"Spend one night at the Banyan Tree hotel and have to admit I was very impress. The rooms are very spacious and comfortable, like you do not want to leave the room. Everything have been well think of, to ensure your comfort and that is very appreciable. The smell in the lobby (ginger and lemongrass) is welcoming you smoothly and put you in a great and relaxing mood right away.   Only the elevator sound (to notify you which one is arriving) is very irritating, as I stayed in the lobby 5 minutes and it ""bip"" every 10 seconds.  Nonetheless, this is a fantastic hotel with perfect rooms. I will definitely go back as soon as I can.",50
"Upon the request of friends I stayed at Cotai Pool Suite, Banyan Tree Macau for the second time. The accommodation of this type of room was normally huge with all required facilities except there was a relaxation pool of roughly 5 x 1 metres by the window(it was said that the maintenance of the pool was incorporating the latest UV purification and technology and the pool water was kept at a constant temperature of 27degees). In the bathroom there was a huge wooden bathtub good for two or more persons; and further the shower room could accommodate two persons at the same time. In my opinion this type of room was most suitable for family with young children and couple on holiday or for relaxation.",50
Banyan tree group is always my priority for family holidays. This Macau one next lets me down either. The room is extremely huge (more than triple of regular hotel size room with almost 170 sqm). The decoration is very nice as always. The view is 270 degrees so can see most of Macau‚Äôs best views in your room. The service has always been superior. All the staffs are very nice and treating you like their families. This place is also very kids friendly. They have also prepared nice kids cod and robe / slippers which made my son very happy. Will definitely come back soon for another trip!,50
"It's quiet and clean. Staffs are friendly and helpful. A good place for getting away for the weekend, as a couple or as a family. Although it's located within a casino but once inside, the sound and sight is kept out rather well. He only problem is difficult to get a taxi.",30
"Had a terrific stay at Banyan Tree Macau! Stayed a night to celebrate a anniversary and birthday. Booked on their own site and had a tremendous amount of help from their reservations team and a special thank you to CANARY WONG. She helped me the whole way through along side her awesome team. They helped me plan every step for our special day. I also would like to thank their FO team, they also were really great and thank you guys very much for the upgrade, it just made our stay and our special day a whole lot better! the centre pool made it very enjoyable. The only minor problem i had was the time preparation for the for the pool, i asked for it to be done by 21:00.

"This was our third time at the Banyan Tree Macau. Once again, they have managed to blow us away with their astonishing hospitality. Angus, Yre, Sasa, are just some of the people that worked there that actually remembered us and welcomed us back. It felt like we were really, truly at home, and that is not something I get to say about every hotel. Lhoy was absolutely exceptional in his house keeping services-- he not only made sure all of our requests were met, but also went the extra mile by noticing our personal preferences and made sure they were met without even asking us about it. This hotel as a whole is simply heavenly.",50
"I stay here couple times a year, the hotel is one of the best in Macau, location is good, very convenience, the water park is very nice feature especially if you have kids room are great and the spa is just excellent,I will definitely come back and stay again!",50
"I frequently travelled to Macau with husband for leisure, usually stayed in JW Marriott or Galaxy Hotel in recent years as I like the location, huge swimming facilities and at reasonable price.  Found Banyan Tree is offering special rate, tried here the 1st time (wanted to try this hotel for long time but always feel it is too expensive).  Since we checked in to Banyan Tree last night, my husband told me 3 times that we have to stay here in future although paying more!  Although the hotel opened for years, it maintained quite well, decent and clean.  Huge size, wonderful aroma, interesting design with a small pool inside the room, and the most important, good services!

Services are very fine and friendly. The room is very nice compare to price is worth. I quite like the atmosphere and color of the room. I look highly luxurious and comfortably to be in. I did not say she is cheap but comparable to the quality of the room, she is worth. I might visit her again sometime when arriving Macau.",50
My family is in awe of our experience in Banyan Tree Macau. Firstly is the friendliness and courteousness displayed by Ms. Jessa from the Front Office then the coziness of the room and ultimately was the superb services provided by Mr. Noble and Reyjan who help cleaning/tiding up the room many times as we stayed in pool suite plus ensuring that we are enjoying our stay. Good job guys!,50
"This would be our favourite hotel of anywhere we have stayed in our travels in the past decade. We would go back to Macau just to stay here, its that good. So many things about this place are excellent that it is easier to say just book it and experience it for yourself - the only bad thing from our stay was that we couldn't stay longer.",50
"We stayed in the 2-bedroom banyan pool suite for 3 nites during the summer break. The room is wonderful, very comfortable for a family of four with 2 king beds. The highlight is of course the little heated pool in the room. There was even free mini bar n complimentary little daily treats. Everything works well though water always sip out from the master twin shower area. In addition to the water slides, we love the wave pool and the river ride. Banyan guests also have exclusive access to a private outdoor pool, not forgetting the well-equipped gym n a smaller infinity pool n jacuzzi. The hotel provides free shuttle service to many locations (such as the ferry terminals and the historic centre) in Macau though the queue can get pretty long at times. Service level was good.

"This was our second stay in Banyan Tree Macau and it was even more exceptional ! Before we reached the hotel, the concierge helped me organize the transfer by ferry from Hong Kong, perfectly by e-mail. Breakfast is excellent, service is in all way perfect, be it spa or activities organization or restaurant bookings. The staff is professional, caring and even anticipates our needs. We are members of prestigious resorts in Asia and Europe, but Banyan Tree Macau remains our favorite one, we strongly recommend it to perfection seekers.",50
"The hotel is beautiful. You go into galaxy resort and when you arrive at Banyan you see the difference in luxury. The room is masterful. Has an in room pool with always hot water, and has all the electric windows all new 5 star hotel have now days plus the master switch that turns off all lights. The bathroom is wonderful, with a double rain shower and an electronic toilet that opens up automatically when you get near it, plus works as a bidet also... pretty cool first time I see one of those! All in all, the hotel is one of the best I've stayed in so far... if not the best. The room is so beautiful I definitely will remember always! ",50
"My girlfriend and I stayed here for one night to celebrate her birthday. We arrived from the mainland and got to the hotel around midday. The room wasn't ready at that time but the receptionist told us that we could go up and use the pool and relax until it was. They took our bags and informed us that they'd be ready and waiting in our room. Our room became available just after 3pm and so up we went. It. Was. Spectacular! We both agreed that it was the finest room we've ever stayed in! The decor was wonderful, the furnishings were super soft, the built in pool was filling itself with perfectly temped water, the soft drinks in the mini bar were free and the scented incense sticks in the room gave out relaxing vibes. It was perfect. However, as I was walking round the room,‚Ä¶",50
"I would like to thank Banyan Tree Macau for another great experience I had with my family. Aside from the spacious clean suite, the attitude of its Team members, who will not hesitate to make your stay wonderful with their generosity and kindness where everyone genuinely smile and ready to assist, for me count the most. Big thanks to Sasa and the whole FO team. Keep up the great work!!",50
Big surprised! Rooms with giant personal tubs and a mini dip pool complete with temperature control. Very very big and spacious! Well decor and good service. Strongly recommended for couples or family. Great hotel,50
"The room was huuuuuggggggggeeeeee even what I booked was a standard room and then I found it was a suite as the basic room. Definitely enough for a party. The bed was cozy and the whole hotel smelled just like ur were in Thailand, very relaxing. The high light was there were at least 3 places in the room where beside window you could lay down and enjoy the nice view while hving some drinks.  The other high light was the swimming pool, or a water fun area more accurately. Banyan tree and Ritz hotel were sharing this area but I didn't notice it was so big when stayed with Ritz hotel last time. Besides the different pools to choose, there were floating tunnels and splashing tunnels, with a loooootttttt of fun.  The service was nice and efficient. The bell drove me and showed me the‚Ä¶",50
"Pricey yes, but rather great value for the family.  Went with wife and our two children (8 and 4 yrs of age), the kids went nuts with the pool in the suite (we stayed at a Cotai Pool Suite, their basic type).  The Grand Resort Deck was everything we expected and more, best of all after the craziness of the slides, the wave pool, the lazy river, you can retreat to the Banyan Tree pool that guests from the other hotels can't access, and I thought it was the best pool in Macau easily.  Food-wise the breakfast is sufficient though not among the best I have had, but that's nitpicking.  Food is not a problem as you're in a sprawling Galaxy complex and right next to another one (Venetian-Parisian) if you want to look for more food.",50

They told me that they will ask someone to come and clean up. But I think this is not a proper action. At least they should arrange room change for me instead of telling me to stay at the same room. As a customer, I think the room cleanness is one of the important thing.",30
"Thanks for the arrangement by the hotel during my stay in Sep 2016 for the purpose of marriage proposal to my girlfriend. I ordered their ‚ÄúSense of Romance‚Äù package directly from their reservation dept which included 90-minute couple Spa session, buffet breakfast, MOP 500 F&B credit as well as an afternoon tea set. The staff of the reservations dept are so helpful to advise me the details of the package and the turndown selection can be offered by the hotel for marriage proposal.   The staff of housekeeping dept of the hotel assisted in decorating the room with the petal (provided by hotel around HK$600) and balloon (ordered by myself) very well and within the specific timeslot when we were out of the room.

Most amazing place to stay! The room was house size with a spa that ran from bedroom through to the lounge. Amazing fruits and French Champagne on arrival. No luxury was spared. Service was exceptional.,50
"A perfect hotel, either for pleasure or business, well located and amenities within the hotel from food to shopping was great. Very courteous staff always ready to help or answer any question. Not forgetting those who wants to try a hand in the Casino.",50
"We stayed at the Banyan Tree with kids and another family. The rooms were phenomenal! Each room was huge and had its own relaxation pool, which was very large. In addition, there was a wooden tub that seated 4 comfortably. Here was a massive king size bed and 2 daybeds.  The whole room was amazingly large and luxurious!  The breakfast had a huge range of delicious food.  Staff were very helpful and discreet.  The Banyan Tree is one of 5 hotels attached to the a Galaxy Waterpark. It's enormous and lots to do. We were there on a Sunday night and Monday in summer,  and other than the water slides there were no queues. Adults and kids all had a fabulous time!",50
"Its my second stay here at Banyan Tree Macau, always an amazing stay !   What I like about Banyan Tree compared to other hotels in Macau is that - it got its own pool. Although you cannot dive into/ swim, but you can have a relaxing time with your friends and love ones.   #late-check-out rating: 9/10",50
"The main draw is definitely the room itself. The entry level already comes with a 3.5 meters long 'relaxation pool'. OK, it's not exactly a pool where you swim in, but it's quite inviting.   The good: - The room, very spacious and tranquil - Service: check in was a breeze - Free minibars - Gym  What can be improved: - Breakfast buffet seems to be highly Chinese skewed. I was looking for a continental breakfast but all I could find was congee, dim sum, and noodles.",50
"One of the hotels in galaxy resort complex, there's free shuttle connecting Macau outer/ taipa ferry pier. The banyan tree pool  is for banyan tree guests only and you can also go to other pools that belong to galaxy complex. Overall, nice hotel for couples and family. ",50
"I have been to lots of hotels around the world from budget to luxury but this has hands down been the best I have ever stayed in.  When you arrive off the shuttle bus from the ferry terminal you are greeted by a member of staff from the hotel and your bags taken away. You are guided through the casino o the hotel.  Check in is quick and full of smiles from the check in staff. All the staff will smile and some welcome you by name after you have been there a few days.  The hotel room / suite was amazing. The room was made up of a bathroom, livingroom and bedroom with a shallow pool running the whole length of the suite.  The room is turned down twice a day and the second visit you generally get a small cake and gift. During your stay you also get two or three items laundered per‚Ä¶",50

"One of the best suites I have stayed in, at less for only a few hundred euros. I went there for two nights with my girlfriend and we enjoyed a lot the in-door swimming pool. Great for couples! The hotel is also conveniently located and proposed many amenities such as a movie theatre and many restaurants",50
"Even though Macau (and its many casinos) is a tad ostentatious to my liking, Banyan Tree is not only a hidden gem but an oasis in this city of excesses.  Booking a room on their own website was a breeze.  While booking through one the hotel agents might save you a dollar or two, it would save one tons of headaches if something goes wrong or if amendments need to be made.  Check-in was like clock-work.  The long queues at the other hotels of the Galaxy complex were non-existent at Banyan Tree.  As a lot of the formalities were done prior to arrival, the actual time spent at the check-in counter was what it took to get the credit card (as deposit) embossed.  The soothing fragrance of essential oils infiltrated all corners of the hotel, from the lobby to the foyer to the guest‚Ä¶",50
"The price is really high and i expect the quality will be that high too, however it is not. The room is big and there is a so~called swimming pool which is tiny. I doubted the cleaniness cause i saw some insects in that room.",30
"We visited this long-sought 'resort' in Jun in our family trip all satisfying our expectations.  Albeit cost-wise it's a bit higher than her peers, the quality is truly outstanding and value-for-money.  Staying in a luxury of 100 sqm-sized regular suite (it's an all suite hotel), besides the basics like a comfy bed, nice view, wifi, amenities... you have on top an unique temperature-regulated in room relaxation pool (I think it's a 4M in length), a wooden bath tub (we teased it as a gigantic Japanese Noodle Cup!) and ample space for relaxation and entertainment (2 flat screen TV with a sound bar stereo DVD system...).  The living room features a Thai style seating bench (I can't figure out how to call it as it's not a sofa at all), daily in-room aromatic fragrance setting a‚Ä¶",40
"I travel a lot for business and have stayed in some of the world's great hotels; Waldorf Astoria NYC, Baron Okura Tokyo, Atlantis Dubai, etc. I have never had as positive an experience as I did in Banyan Tree Macau. To start with the room was spectacular - plunge pool, beautiful wooden bathtub, jacuzzi, day bed, massage tables. What really stood out however was the service. On check-in I asked directions to a local, out of the way restaurant I had heard about. Several hours later the staff remembered my name and where I had eaten to ask how it was. The front-desk had been briefed that we were celebrating an engagement and a handwritten note of congratulations together with a bottle of wine was in our room when we got back. This is the kind of above and beyond service that makes‚Ä¶",50

"We had a three night stay in a pool villa located on the galaxy resort deck.  The accommodation was fantastic, service excellent and amenities lovely. The accommodation included a pool and jacuzzi in a private garden with shower, seating area, massive bathroom with his and hers WC's (heated, electric), lovely living and dining room and a treatment room which served as our children's bedroom.  The hotel provided a buggy service to and from the main hotel area for guests staying in the villas which the children loved. The quality of the breakfast was excellent and having direct access to the Galaxy resort deck was great.  Highly recommended hotel for families.",50
"Last Sunday, I went to Macau to celebrate my father's birthday. I arrived at 1430, check in very smooth though early check in was not available. So I grabbed this 30 mins to check in at Galaxy for another room^.^  After that, I got the room at around 3 pm. Staff helped us to carry our luggage to the room. When we entered the room, all of us just opened our mouth and said ""wow"", ""so large"" and ""so beautiful room"". It's really luxurious and relaxing room. A birthday cake was then immediately sent to our room to surprise my dad. After finishing it, we rushed to the grand deck resort for fun. Thank you very much for such enjoyable and comfortable stay. I'm so sorry that I've forgotten to take some photos to share with all of you>.<",50
"In this hotel you will feel spoiled from the 1st second you enter to the minute you leave. Rooms are huge, with a private swimming pool and a wooden bath tub. Amazing! Ther is a private indoor pool as well as an outdoor one. Service is very smily, friendly and so nice. Every rooms are well decorated. The breakfast is various and delicious with asian and european dishes, fresh fruits and veggies, pastries, cereals, dim sum...  There is a huge aquatic complex belonging to the Galaxy complex. Kids will have lots of fun. Just loved this place!",50
"I had the best experience here at Banyan Tree Macau. This is by far the most luxurious hotel I've ever been to & I am to say I have traveled & stayed a great extent of different five-star hotels. Purpose of this trip was to celebrate my birthday & indeed had chosen the most perfect hotel without a doubt.  I was dazzled by the place the moment I walked in, the scent was very relaxing, everyone was so pleasant. Upon arrival I was greeted by Amori with such a warm welcome, offered assistance with my luggage & directed me towards the front desk. While checking in, Sasa the front Supervisor noticed my birthdate & immediately made note to deliver a complimentary cake in the room for me, which made my day extra special. What I was most infatuated about was after checking in Sasa then‚Ä¶",50

My wife surprised me by booking a room at the Banyan Tree Macau and what a surprise it was! As we walked into the lobby we were overtaken with a calming scent which immediately relaxed us. The bellman directed us to the front desk and took care of our bags in a prompt manner. Then Sasa took care of us at the Front Desk using such amazing service. Our room was not ready therefore she upgraded us immediately with a smile on her face. She then conversed with us to add another level of service and when she found out this was a birthday present she made note of it and sent up a piece of birthday cake for us. The rooms themselves are simply to die for. tons of room and luxury in every area of the room.  I would highly recommend you stay here if even for just one night. It's worth it‚Ä¶,50
"Checked in here end of June to celebrate my 47th bday with a couple of friends and after the trip, we are in agreement that the Banyan tree is by far the best hotel to stay in when in the area. From the moment we walked into the lobby we were definite the stay would be unforgettable and worth the price paid. When you check into your room, the dipping pool with lounge bed and the old school bath tub will just blow you away. Even the toilet seats were state of the art with the settings for the heat and water pressure it was such a delight. All the things needed for the comfort and added luxury were in place. For the duration of your stay, you will never feel like you are in the city where people never sleep and in fact, makes you feel like you are in an island resort. Service‚Ä¶",50
"Absolutely beautiful hotel and an amazing room.   The whole visit from start to finish was great. Friendly, efficient, helpful and polite staff and after visiting eight places across SE Asia, refreshingly good English speakers too.   Would definitely return and wish we could give more than five stars. ",50
To make it clear: the hotel is amazing and especially the rooms (we had a 160m2 suite) which are a true luxury experience. But a 5 stars hotel should provide a 5 stars service. Unworthy points : 25 MINUTES to get 2 bottles of Perrier with the room service. It was 11am and as an excuse they told me it was rush hour... Breakfast as well didn't have anything special. But the worst point was the restaurant of the pool. Pricy low quality pizza/sandwiches and poor service ! We may be back but will expect a better service,30
"Banyan Tree in Cotai proved to be the most luxurious vacation we've ever had. We stayed in a suite that was more like a sanctuary with its own private pool, a wooden bath, two separate showers and a really huge bed. The urban resort , which is included in the Galaxy complex, offers an extensive list of leisure facilities like a wave pool with real white sands and spa which made out vacation extra special. The Filipino masseuse gave me an ultimate relaxing time from the foot bath to my private tea time.  The housekeeping staff were very friendly and accommodating to all our requests. They even gave me extra bath essentials including slippers to bring home as souvenirs because I so loved the way it was packed.  Banyan Tree in this vibrant city is absolutely a must! ",50
"Such a great property! The upkeep of the property is very good. All staff that I encountered during my stay where extremely polite, gracious and helpful. I can't wait to return and experience another room category.",50
"Before writing up a review, I'm still struggling whether to write anything about it or not. As on one hand, I love it really really much. But on the other hand, I don't want to let too many people know about it as it makes it more difficult to reserve a room!   Alright then, I'll just write some of the amazing parts of it and let you find other hidden surprises!  Banyan Tree is not the most glamorous hotel in Macau, nor the most GOLDEN one as compared to other hotels. It comes with all subtle, gentle warmth while you first entered the lobby. The relaxing scents, just let you feel you're in vacation but not only travel. Upon check-in, I was greeted by one of the helpful receptionist and apologise for not being ready at the check-in time of 3pm. Honestly, I was not happy for the‚Ä¶",50

"It was a birthday trip and they probably notice this while checking in but without mentioning this they offered a cake to the room, a big thank you to ""Sasa"" from the front desk for this small detail.   One small negative was the breakfast. We were seated quickly and tea was served as requested but shame the cup was stained, the knife was dirty and the buffet plate was also dirty but this could just be a one-off incident.  Otherwise the room was fantastic and could have stay all day inside and the service was so attentive.",50
The hotel room was uniquely designed and simply top notch. The views were excellent. We had a lap pool within our room and also an adjoining massage room with a jacuzzi spa as well. It was very relaxing and enjoyable indeed. We had a very memorable time there and we will definitely be back.,50
"Standard room costs MOP 3000+. In this sense, villla is worth for money  The private pool is perfect. With safe reason the pool can be only 1 meter high. It's already fun and flexible enough to swim freely. Our villa is with private SPA room. There are also 2 steam rooms. Overall experience is great",50
"I had 2 nights stayed at the hotel, the service was excellent and very impressive. An friendly reminder e-mail sent to you 7 days ago to prepare for your stay. I went with my 2 kids, they provide baby cot, bathtub, high-chair and bottle sterilizer. Can't imagine this is so 'family friendly', nevertheless, the in room pool is incredible with great view. Every evening they will come and fill up the snack bar if necessary. And the signature Banyan Tree essential oil scent filled up the room we felt so relaxing and comfortable, we all have a great sleepy night and happy stay at Banyan Tree Hotel.",50

"Last week I stayed at Banyan Tree Macau for a post birthday relaxation. When I checked-in, I felt like somebody coz their Front Office Supervisor, Sasa Fajardo greet me and have me checked-in. When I got to my room, it was a big surprise coz they gave me a Signature Poll Suite complete with a foyer, powder room, a living room with a heated pool in the middle, a bar and a dining table for six. Not only that, there's a basket of fruits and a red wine as a welcome gift. On top of these, the F&B also send me a cake after dinner with a hand written note from the Manager on a Birthday Card. Though my birthday was a week before, yet the hotel still remembers. It was a touching and memorable stay of my life. I found out later that all these was the effort of Banyan Tree's Front Office‚Ä¶",50
We loved the suites with indoor pool! It has a huge room and spacious! They gave us a gift with a bottle of wine as it was our first year anniversary. Needlessly to say the massage was great and also the indoor and outdoor swimming pools were great as well. Highly recommended!,50
A very superb room and a very nice hotel to stay with the family. We commend the staff they are very friendly and accomodating specially Ms. Sasa Fajardo of the front office team. The Health club staff Ms. Gea and Ms. Jane who also extends their hand during our swimming time.,50
The room is spacious & nice but the wifi is really bad!! Got bites on my legs from sitting near the infinity pool thing.. The Chinese reception at the outdoor pool entrance is very rude with dark face !!! The reservation staffs are nice to reconfirmed my booking! ,30
"I enjoyed the cabana..it can sit 8 people, complete with toilet, shower and television.  There are 8 cabanas available, so I recommend that a reservation should be made early.  I made my reservation at least more than a month in advance.  To go there, approach the concierge at the Banyan Tree hotel lobby and someone will usher you to the cabana.  The service was very good.  Everyone was so attentive making sure that we get all the things we need.  The food is just ok, nothing really special.  Very ordinary hot pot food.  I wouldn't mind paying a little bit more to have some additional items on the menu.  Up until  31 Dec 2016, the price is Mop488++ during weekdays and Mop588++ during weekends.  Always check for any credit card promotions for discounts.  Galaxy membership cards‚Ä¶",40
"The Banyan Tree Macau is situated in Phase 1 of the Galaxy complex in Taipa, Macau. Getting to the BTM was easy with free shuttle buses departing from both piers regularly. An added benefit of its location is that one can walk quite easily (5 mins) to the centre of Taipa where all the local shops and restaurants are. The lobby of BTM is ""elegantly exotic"". Check in was a breeze (no pun intended)since being the top hotel of the three in Galaxy Phase 1 there was no queue at all. I was upgraded to a Signature Pool suite upon arrival which was pleasantly surprising. The check in staff, Curtis, was very polite and efficient and certainly deserved a mention. Our room was on the 8th floor which was a bit low for my liking but once i entered the room the view outside didn't matter‚Ä¶",50
"I have been there when it opened 4 years ago and now I got back last weekend for a relaxing trip. The service was much better since there are less people going to macau these days, the room was great, and to top it off, there is 27 degrees temperature control in the pool inside the room. Breakfast was nice and ends at 11 am. over all good experience. Must try the Spa, it's the best part!",40
"I went to Macau with my girlfriend for a short vacation, and chose banyan tree to stay for 2 nights. The room is roomy and clean, service is above average in the area. Price is also above average but you get what you pay for. Breakfast is slightly below average in terms of variety, but it won't be a big issue in a big casino with many other restaurants that you can choose from.",40
Overall as the hotel is part of the Galaxy Macau complex there's lots of shopping and restaurants with a fairly good range to choose from. If gambling is not your thing then there's other things to do too. Loved the indoor pool on the 31st floor and the Banyan Tree spa is as good here as it was in Phuket!!,40

Great and courteous service. We enjoyed a memorable and relaxing stay! Definitely looking forward to going again. Employees and service were beyond expectations. Book directly from hotel website and the great hospitality service will start shortly.,50

First of all when I do check in the staff seems don't know I booked a package with afternoon tea, he needed to double check see if I was booking a package.  Second, after the staff knew we booked package with spa included, the staff asked us if we wanted to make appointment for spa. But my boyfriend already sent email for  you guys to arrange, is this your responsibility to know guests arrangement other than I repeat what I reserved? What's the point for me to reply your email then? I think your hotel need to strengthen communication between departments.

Spent two days at Banyan Tree Macau and it was a pleasant experience. The room has been upgraded to a suite. Room is big enough for two of us; bathtub like a small pool; comfortable king bed; the Thai decoration make you feel you are Thai... Excellent service from reception & housekeeping. Breakfast is above average. Everything is well managed. It is a bit costly however I would recommend to stay. ,50
"We stayed at Banyan Tree Macau just after the Chinese New Year. We were not interested in gambling and were merely looking for a short getaway from the hustle and bustle of living in a busy city like Hong Kong.  We tried the sense of romance package and it was fantastic! The room was superb (we were given a free upgrade because our room was not ready by the supposedly check-in time of 3pm), and the spa was out of this world!  One minor criticism is it seemed to have taken quite long for our suitcase to be delivered, meaning that we were stuck in our room for quite some time.  Also the free high tea that was included in the package was mediocre. It was not the same tea set that you could pick from their usual menu. Frankly it was not worth wasting your time (and calorie) going‚Ä¶",40

The room is big, remain the usual Banyan Tree standard, with the design relaxing and even you are in a casino place, you can feel the spa and tranquil atmosphere. Like especially the spa smell and amenities. Yet, it's a bit old now, I have been staying here for a few times, you can just see the wear out of the facilities. Yet, with the spacious room and it's a good place for partying with friends.",50
"Having stayed in the original Banyan Tree property in Phuket on multiple occasions it was with some interest that we decided to try the Banyan Tree in Macau for the first time. Could a hotel located in a casino complex and in a city setting, and with the air temperature below 10 degrees, possible provide the same ambience and ability to make you relax that we had experienced in the resort setting, tropical paradise, of the Banyan Tree Phuket? The answer, perhaps surprisingly, was a resounding yes. Physically, while the Banyan Tree Macau is not a resort setting, they have compensated for this by leaving space everywhere and not trying to make every square inch  ""productive"" in a revenue sense. The spa was a particularly good example of this and created an overwhelming sense of‚Ä¶",50

And of course the private pool,  truly unique!

Ordered several room service food due to the credits we had - and all of them came pretty quickly, even when we ordered it in the middle of the night (around 2AM). Also received hand written cards concerning pleasurable stay from the hotel managers. The location is perfect - it's connected to the casino, but the atmosphere of the hotel itself is distinct enough to make you feel like you could be away from all the gambling areas if you wanted to. The local food street is close to galaxy as well - was super satisfied overall!",50
Stayed at the suite with a mini-pool inside. The room was comfortable and spacious and good for family and couples in a typical Banyan Tree hotel setting. The breakfast was fair and the options were limited. Would be great if offering more western dishes.,40

Aesthetically the room was out of this world from the living area and massive relaxing spa pool to the double shower and deep soaking tub. I was amused with the high-tech toilet that would lift the lid automatically on approach. However, despite the many options (front cleansing, rear cleansing etc.!), the only faulty option was flush - TWICE!! Not a very pleasant feature when you're trying to enjoy such a beautiful room.

We sent some photos to friends in HK and they came over to visit...they told us that they had never stayed in a hotel such as this and as frequent visitors to Macau they would choose this hotel.

Such a great, clean , luxury style room with relaxation pool inside. the services are excellent! comes with so friendly, charming and kind staffs from front office, saffron restaurant ,  housekeeping staffs and Indoor pool/Gym staffs who never failed to smile =) even you ask for assistance.   It was really a sweet and great pleasure to stay here!.. This hotel stands at the 1st rank for sure! =) a must choose place and 100% satisfied..would stay here again!!  Overall a splendid experience and we highly recommend this place to anyone who is visiting Macau.",50
"Highly recommended and a must try for those who are looking for quality. It is hands down one of our most memorable hotel getaway experiences to date.  While there were hiccups during the booking, the staff‚Äôs arrangements made up for it by showing that they really cared and made things right.  The experience was from the moment we arrived in Macau, from the pick-up at the terminal to our arrival at the hotel. We were treated like guests that mattered. The rooms were all set with a fine attention to detail and everything is clean. The staff were what really made the entire experience, as they were truly helpful, polite, and strived to cater to all of our needs.  The view, quality, hygiene, service and arrangements, was all beyond our expectations. Although we only stayed for a‚Ä¶",50

"The hotel and service is overall very good on my anniversary day stay with my spouse in Macau... it's memorable from checking in and the entire stay.  There is one area that need to improve being the quality of shampoo, shower gel and body lotion.  Suggest we bring our own toiletries if possible. ",40
Initially I was not impressed with the customer service emails before my trip but they came back to me and made of for it. Customer service is extremely important to me and they definitely showed it once I arrived at my hotel. This will be a very memorable experience for me. Thank you Banyan Tree!,50
"We stayed 2 nights during a break to Macau from Hong Kong.  We were greeted by a friendly bell-man and check-in was personal, fast and efficient.  The room was unbelievable.  We booked the Grand Cotai Suite King (which I believe is the standard/cheapest room type).  We have stayed in luxury 5-star hotels around the globe and paid room rates 4-5 times higher than those at Banyan Tree, yet this room was one of the very best we have ever experienced.  It was incredible.  There is a gorgeous lounge area with huge day bed and 42"" HD-TV.  The king size bed was incredibly comfortable and had beautifully soft ultra-high-thread-count bedding. The bedroom has another 42"" HD-TV.  The room benefits from a huge private relaxation pool.  It's kept at a constant warm temperature of 27 degrees‚Ä¶",50

"AMAZING experience at this hotel , I stayed in a Villa though , I think they only have ten of those .... But great , the rooms were fly , we had a private pool with jacuzzi, one of the rooms had their own jacuzzi, sauna and steam room !!! The beds OMG only can be compared with the ones at the Park Hyatt in Beijing , for the record I travel a lot , and I KNOW how a good bed feels like . The Spa amazing as well , very nice massage, breakfast well wasn't bad but it could've been better . Anyways , highly recommended. Don't know about the rooms but this villa thing is a perfect getaway, private , quiet , classy .... I enjoyed myself a lot here . ",50
"First time visit to Macau and stayed at this hotel because of the Suite. Hotel is very nice and quiet amidst all the other hotels and casinos. You feel as if you are in Thailand but the strange thing is that when you are outside walking toward the man made beach area, it feels like you're in the Caribbean. The music piped through the speakers are Caribbean music so it is kind of confusing where you are? There are many pools in this hotel and especially on the 31st floor besides the gym area. There is an Infinity Pool, Jacuzzi pool, a Hot soaking pool at 40 degrees and a Cold soaking pool at 15 degrees. The King Suite is excellent and you can spend a whole day just staying inside the room. It has a large rectangular soaking pool at 27 degrees and a wooden soaking tub for two in‚Ä¶",50

This is by far one of the nicest room that I have stayed in Macau. The room is very spacious with its own mini swimming pool overlooking the city. The decor could have been more tastefully decorated (including the lobby). The hotel allowed us to use the gym and swimming pool facilities even after we have checked out of the hotel. The access to the Wave Pool is also a bonus. I recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a relaxing experience.,50
"Different from other Banyan Tree resorts, this one in Macau only provides 'indoor villas' (hotel rooms; except a few beside the outdoor swimming pool). There is a small pool inside our room, right next to the glass window, with a fixed temperature of 27 C, which I am not quite sure about its function as it is not a Jacuzzi. Nevertheless the room is spacious, quiet, and nicely decorated, which had allowed us to unwind for 2 days. Generally good service. Great breakfast buffet which serves a good variety of fresh, healthy, delicious items. It is not associated with a casino so there is less hustle and bustle.",40

Have a great holiday there in Banyan Tree Macau. Nice Room with nice swimming pool. View outside the room is Ok. Free snack Bar with Free drinks. The room services are nice and the small swimming pool in the room is very very good.               ,40
I stayed in Banyan Tree Macau with my husband to celebrate his birthday and our anniversary. And Kelly (the receptionist staff) was very kind enough to serve us all the precious complements and upgrade. She has gave us the best impression for the Bayan Tree. I sure did go around other Banyan tree hotels all over the world but service here was the best and professional. Very special thanks to Kelly !!! :) She also showed us the room all the way~ very thoughtful and kind :)  And also Ron and Tom at the concierge desk were very helpful and made us comfortable to enjoy the Macau for the first time. Thank you all and We love to revisit the Banyan Tree Macau again. :) The best hotel and services in Macau!!,50
"If you just want to reach a nice hotel and stay whole vacation, this is it. Certainly there is casino and shopping mall surround.  We got upgrade to Signature Pool Suite with 160 square feet. The space is amazing huge for a high modern building hotel and considering only as mid range room in this hotel(for a villa at resort it is normal size).  Two person rain shower, two person wooden bathtub, more than 2 person indoor pool, 8 person round table. Good buffet breakfast with many choice. The Spa is also good.  You can't miss fun place at second floor Grand-resort-deck include; Skytop Adventure River Ride, The Skytop Wave Pool, Skytop Adventure Rapids. This is the place good for family with kids.

"Reading some of the slightly negative reviews makes me wonder if we really were staying at the same hotel. The receptionist, Harry, was excellent- he upgraded our room to a corner suite. I couldn't have asked for better services. The spa treatment was heavenly, too. Received a full 3 hour treatment from Beam, and was met with everything I could hope for, plus some. The pool service was excellent, too, and was on top of everything we wanted without being asked to do so. Overall, it was superb, and is definitely worth every penny. It was a heavenly stay. We will be back, for sure!",50
From our check-in the staffs are very kind and friendly to explain the details of the facilities and environment. The room is amazing beautiful and spacious. And the breakfast is diversified and delicious! 2 floor spa looks very nice. We were desperate to try the Banyan Tree Spa however we have 10-month baby to take care. Definately we will try next time,50
"Not the first time stay in Banyan Tree Macau, but first for my girl friends. Again a great stay! Luxury and huge room with pool. Shopping area just right outside the hotel, we bought a lot and it was so much fun. The Thai Food was great!",50
"Terrible service standard from Front Office! During check in, staff mentioned ""FIT guests are quite troublesome"" in front of me and my wife during our casual conversation, I was quite shocked and feel interesting. And my packages is included one set of high tea in the lobby lounge, I was mentioned I would enjoy it on the next day, however there is no one know this information on the next day and it took half an hour for the verification. In addition, during check out, Mr. Sxxxxl, who is the staff in Front Office. He did not have any smile for the whole process, after 30 seconds dead air between me and him, he took out a folio to verify the payment for my stay, which attached an indefinite description, I was question what is that? and he answered me ""no need to know this!"",‚Ä¶",40
Stayed 1 night. Everything was good and comfy. Just had some issues while express check-out. Other than that excellent service. Room was luxurious and spacious. Had some trouble to find the hotel though. But everything was good after that. ,40
"I think this is possibly one of the nicest hotel rooms we have ever stayed in! It was comfortable, luxurious and incredibly spacious. The relaxation pool in the room was amazing, as was the fabulous sitting area and the huge, comfortable bed. I have to say, we also loved the heated toilet seat. ( It's often the little things that count!) The bath tub was novel too and the area was made more private by beautiful red drapes.  The staff are extremely helpful and polite. We were checked in by Michael who was very efficient and welcoming. He also showed us up to our room which was a nice touch. Staff  at breakfast welcomed us each morning by name, and absolutely nothing was too much trouble. The concierge team was also most helpful in arranging a dinner booking for us and made sure‚Ä¶",50

"I have a anniversary trip with my girlfriend in Banyan Tree. The room is very spacious and luxurious. A very big changing clothes area.  The bathing shower area is big such that my gf and me can bath together. The wooden bathtub is just located next to the room. Such that we can sitting in the bathtub and enjoy the TV show. The audio system is great.   The view is great and we can see the beach area in Galaxy. The indoor pool is nice and great for couples.  The toilet seat is very clean and great. All are automatic and you don't know need to touch the seat.  The great thing worth mention is that they offer a ""Intimate Moment"" package, with romantic setup in the indoor pool with a champagne/red wine. It is great experience with my girlfriend to drink champagne in the indoor pool‚Ä¶",50
"I stayed here with family over Chinese New Years.  The room design is very luxurious with an open setting.   The service was excellent and a ton of amenities.  The only issue we had was the in-room pool, which kept making a gurgling noise, even after service personnel came to look at it.  A bit annoying for some, but not a deal-breaker.",40

For sure i will recommend it to my relatives and friends. Thanks banyan tree macau :)  ",50
"This is part of the Galaxy casino/hotel complex and the building exterior is gold and a bit glitzy/tacky (designed for the mainland China gambling tourist, not a typical Banyan Tree understated elegance) but the interiors and rooms were superb. Thank goodness for the private Banyan Tree pool as the main Galaxy pool is a zoo of kids (though one Chinese staff member was more eager to prevent our entry than welcome us as hotel guests, questioning our early check-in card). Belon sunday champagne brunch on top floor was absolutely superb! One of the best ever. The service was excellent from Filipino and Nepalese staff overall, hit and miss from Chinese staff.

It would be impossible to recommend this resort too highly.  For the benefit of the hotel management, there is (slight) room for improvement. Everything was so good except for two little things that stood out as wrong.  If you catch one of the complimentary hotel buses on arrival, you get dumped with your bags a good 5 minute walk from the lobby.

Celebrating our 10th anniversary is very special. I have seen the rooms at the Banyan Tree and it is very romantic! Starts with free transfers to and from the ferry terminal. Banyan Tree is part of the Galaxy complex which was so huge! We hardly left the complex as everything was there! Our room was facing the pools. Since all the rooms had private relaxation pools we had an in room pool with a view of the pools!! How cool is that! A his and hers day bed at each end of the pool to ensure maximum relaxation. I can't even describe how fabulous the bathrooms are with Japanese style bath tub and hi tech toilet seats. I can go on and on how fantastic our room was. No complaints at all!! Loved every moment and the staff was excellent! Would recommend this place in a heart beat!,50
"This place deserves 6 stars! The staff are lovely, attentive and smiling. The villas are spacious and comfortable. We were most surprised by the pools, lazy river, beach area, etc. We truly felt like we had a vacation even though we only stayed one night. Great for adults alone or for families. Eli was a wonderful host and made sure we were comfortable, yet was never pushy or in the way. ",50
Everything was great andry was a perfect host and very helpful and understanding... The breakfast is not amazing it doesn't rich the quality that you expect in this place  The spa is amazing such a good experience  the therapist are very good and the place is beautiful...the sanctuary pool villa is a great place to stay in Macau the pool and the jacuzzi are really nice but the check in is at 3:00 pm so the sun disappear really fast... We had a great time,50
"We stayed at Banyan Tree in May of this year; we booked 2 rooms and a one bedroom pool villa, and the 1 bedroom pool villa was amazing! Special thanks goes to the villa butlers (?) who looked after us during our stay, namely Elimar, who catered to our numerous requests without hesitation and in a speedy and professional manner, Brandon for assisting whenever Elimar was off duty and Tenderly, who assisted to set up the villa nicely for us. Quite impressive! Overall we truly enjoyed our stay and the convenience of having on-call butlers for the villa was excellent!  The only downfall was we had a slight issue with one of the rooms and the duty manager (?) took a while to resolve the issue, constantly going in and out of the villa to talk with us while we were having a nice time‚Ä¶",50
"We had a great experience in Banyan Tree Macau. It had a spacious room which provided us with a small jacuzzi. It also let us play in the Galaxy Pool, which had a artificial beach and a waterslide. However, the things in the hotel room were a bit old and rusty, and I especially hate the smell of the rooms and the lobby. However, overall, it was still a very good experience for us. I do recommend tourists who are willing to spend some money to stay here.",40
"Last week me and my family stayed in the hotel everyone was very nice and very professional, we had a great time. It was me and my wife birthday, as soon as we arrived my wife went to the spa to enjoy her treatment which she loved, and I was with my son waiting to check in,  Mr Curtis from the front desk surprised us with a incredible upgrade, the room was just amazing, on our last day my son got sick and I was seeking for medical attention then I went down to the lobby and Ms Kelly efficiently arranged a doctor to see my child, we were very pleased with the service, next time we in Macau we will definitely stay in Banyan Tree again.  Thank you to Mr Curtis, Mr Samuel and Ms Kelly for your kind welcome and professionalism.  Best Regards Michael, Maggie & Bradley",50

Anyway, I happened to visit Banyan Tree Macau again about 1 month after my last review and it is quite surprising that they managed to response my previous ramblings here on TripAdvisor and fixed my complaints in such short time. This is one of the hotel that really have very good customer-oriented services, whoever was in charge in trying to overcome my complaints and perfecting my visit really deserve my two thumbs up :) and a five-star review.

"Set within the Galaxy group hotels, the banyan is an impressive hotel. Done up to a very high standard as you would expect. We opted for the suite which was suitably impressive, although I do feel that the bathroom could have been less exposed. As usual with most of the hotels I stay in there was a lack of staff at reception causing queues. The spa was amazing and probably the best I have seen to date on my travels! Breakfast was mediocre and lacked western world substance but as I only saw about 10 westerners on my trip I am not surprised... We did have a few problems but these were eventually sorted out by the management with usual apology. ",40

The new attraction of floating river was short and unexcited, also extremely crowded.  Everywhere in this hotel complex, you see glittering gold, no interest to come again.

The suite is big with the relaxation pool right next to the window and did I mention that the bed is very comfortable? We both enjoyed our stay so much, will come back again soon!",50
"There is a lot to like about the Banyan tree at first glance.  Big rooms, yes. Wooden bath tub, yes.  Ambience everywhere you look.  But our room had a loud clunky sound for two days that no one was able to diagnose or fix.  We were booked into 2703, which is a larger than normal suite.  After two days of noise and a scene that looked like something out of Night at the Opera (8 actual engineers in our room at one time, plus the Assistant Executive Housekeeper) we finally told everyone to leave.  This was 7 hours after they had told us they would come to fix everything.  We were offered another room.  We explained it was smaller.  The assistant executive housekeeper went home and never fofllowed up on her promise to move us to a similar room.  After a full 3 hours of standing‚Ä¶",30
"This hotel is famous for big room, great in-room pool, wooden bath tub and the outdoor water facilities.  Those are all great.  Since they are full house in these few days, therefore it's difficult to do check in earlier.   Appreciated they have arrange an extra bed without charge for my 6 year old niece, which is not a small bed at all.  Still comfy.  Master bed is still very comfy, but deteriorated a bit compared to our last stay.  We have been waken by the in-room pool water refill at mid-night twice, which is a bit disturbing and scary, so sleeping quality wasn't too good.  Bath salt was not ready and the body lotion was also running out when we arrive.  The floor staff are very attentive and kind in handling all our refill requests.  Due to bad weather, we tried the indoor‚Ä¶",50

Because it's a birthday celebration, we got upgrade to a bigger room with Jacuzzi inside! We had a great time there. Highly recommended!",50

Visited Banyan Tree Macau on my husband's birthday. We were upgraded to a grand suite with a relaxation pool in the living room. The bathroom was huge with a wooden tub provided with bath salts & oil. We were treated with all non alcoholic drinks free from mini bar as we booked the room directly from the hotel website. A delicious birthday cake was offered and delivered to the room at the requested time. Everything was perfect! We enjoyed the stay very much!,50
We stayed for 4 nights  with friends. Very big spacious and  well balance decor  big size suites. Great humble service from checkin to house keeping  room service. Pool and soak tub in room add true comfort while stay. Enjoyed stay. Very speedy wifi internet. Good breakfast with indian items  on request.  Wish to stay more. Will come with family shortly.,50
Banyan Tree Macau is indeed an urban oasis.  The beautiful suite with a relaxing pool is such a relaxing & refreshing hideaway in the city.  The room is very spacious with a huge relaxing pool (temperature at 27 degrees) which is a real delight to both adults and kids.  Our room is facing the city with a lovely sunset view which is a bonus.    Staff is generally very friendly and welcoming.  We called guest services a couple of times and our requests are responded promptly.    We had one dinner at Saffron for authentic Thai Cuisine.  It meets our expectation because the food is as good as other Saffron available in Banyan Tree Resorts. Breakfast spread is quite good and it's not very packed with guests even at peak weekend morning hours.    The ambiance of hotel lobby is a‚Ä¶,50
A beautiful spacious Hotel  which includes a relaxation pool within in the room ! Absolutely luxurious and a real treat !  Their wave pool is  the perfect entertainment for families !

"We stayed in the sky villa for 2 nights. The room was so lovely! We loved the room , the smell of the aromatherapy oil really made our day:)   The room was spacious and everything 's just so nice! We enjoyed the in-room pool a lot ! We just chilled in the water, sipped our champagne and listened to the music. Its so relaxing :)   Before we went to sleep, we enjoyed the bath a lot!!!! We got the wooden bath for oneself to relax and we also got the bath tub for 2:) the banyan tree bath salt and bath oil are the best! They are all made of natural pure essential oil and blended it perfectly !!  We ordered in-room dining service but the food was just warm. It's a bit disappointing.   The swimming pool was great!

"Stayed for 1 night with unlimited massage offer.  With the Banyan Tree label, I was expecting a 100 mark experience.    I was pleased that they have tried to accommodate my requests before the visit. Customer service at both the reservation and spa was excellent and prompt.   On my first step into the 100 sq metre room I was very impressed.  The indoor relaxation pool was right by the window and would be great watching sunset with a glass of wine or champagne.   However, water came out from the shower and wetted the separated toilet floor n other areas of the bathroom. Also, they only gave 1 set of toiletries for a 2 person room.     Breakfast was very mediocre thai style or a 5 star style.  They tried to give you some variety but quality of bread cheese and fruits was not that‚Ä¶",30
"We spent one weekend in Macau in this amazing hotel. The room is huge and the pool is wonderful. Breakfast was nice but we did not try the restaurant as we eat outside the hotel. Price is high but the level of the hotel is aligned! The pool has sand and seems to be on the beach, you can have some snack from the bar. Hot bath pool are present with jacuzzi. Really nice atmosphere. Once back in your room you can enjoy the view from the mini pool if the room! All kind of comfort are there!",50

We will surely go back to this hotel, next time with our family the kids will surely enjoy the pool inside the room.",50

Good room-service, ordered dessert late at night, didn't expect much but turned out great. Will definitely go back again, hope will get an upgrade next time!!",50
"The amazing upgraded room with a relaxtion pool,HUGE living room,two bathrooms,dining rooms,was beyond anything. However forget about asking ANYTHING to the concierge,including detailed ferry tickets,show tickets,etc They were VERY poor at helping,then...sitting down to breakfast and got up for just a minute,they immediately gave my table to someone else!!! Hard to believe,never seen that happen, in addition while it may appear 'nice'the breakfast in included,we had to wait 40 minutes to get a table! You know what:CHARGE me for breakfast and lower the room bill very slightly so that you could friggin'accommodate the number of people,next time in Macau I think I'll try another hotel,cannot ever go wrong with ritz carlton where I stayed in Kowloon",40

"The Banyan Tree is the quintessential Thai hotel in the heart of the Galaxy Entertainment Complex. If you adore being pampered by gracious Thai hospitality, look no further. We had the opportunity to indulge in a luxurious suite on the 29th floor with a splendid view of the entire Galaxy complex and the ocean in the distance. The familiar fragrance of lemon grass greets you as you entered the lobby. And when you enter the suite, you are greeted by the stunning view. The couples spa in the adjourning room has a nice jacuzzi tub. The living room has a relaxation pool that is kept at a constant 27c. The king sized bed had very comfy pillows and I had a very blissful nights sleep. Loved the fully automatic toilet which has nicely heated seats! The lid lifts up automatically when you‚Ä¶",50

Every lead in room has a small pool and all the touches perfect for a luxury stay. If you stay here you will not be disappointed. I will definitely be back.",50
"One of the priciest options in Macau, Banyan Tree impresses again. We stayed here for Mum's birthday a few years ago and visited again in May, this time for Dad's birthday. The rooms were amazing. Even the cheapest suites have a mini-indoor pool - not big enough for swimming but good for soaking and chilling out. Signature round wooden bath tub, spa-quality toiletries, separate areas for changing and make-up, addictively comfortable lounge, snore-inducing beds... I think I would give a 10/10 for the accommodation itself. The spa was simply divine, the whole experience would make you feel like royalty. Service can be a bit slow especially with meal services, but generally acceptable for what you would expect from a 5-star hotel. Breakfast was on the disappointing side, though -‚Ä¶",50
"From the moment we entered the hotel we were treated royally. Daniel at the desk welcomed us and personally escorted us to our luxurious room. The room must have been more than  3000  sq feet. It contained a relaxation pool that was perhaps ten by ten feet.    The bathroom was as large as most hotel rooms and contained a huge japanese bath. We tried the gym which had the latest equipment with screens with accessibility to internet, tv, etc. Aaron made sure we had water, towels and explained the machines. The swimming pool and jacuzzi were large .  The  spa was a dream both as to its beauty and the quality of service. I Had a 90 minute massage followed by relaxation room with light refreshments. The breakfast  room  contained diverse and well made foods, both western and asian.‚Ä¶",50
"My family and I recently stayed at the Macau Banyan Tree, and while the visit was still fresh in mind, I wanted to jot down impressions for the benefit of other travelers. Though I hate to use bullet lists, since the ratings in different hotel areas varied substantially, I'll break this rule:  Hotel appearance: beautiful from top to bottom, from the first entry into the gorgeous lobby, to the design and decoration of our room  Overall staff service (except front desk--see further below): polite, considerate, always keen to help guests with requests  Dining: the in-house Thai restaurant Saffron was good, but Belon was downright excellent both in food and service; in particular, Belon's Sunday brunch was wonderful.

Daily cleaning did not clear stuff next to the pool , wifi did not work well, calling bell and telephone did not work well, one of the service managers was not able to understand simple requests and the other was better in comparison. No one was in attendance and you have to call them on mobile if you needed anything. The breakfast in villa took 2hrs to serve, you cannot ask for coffee because it may take an hour.

My partner and I arrived at the hotel after the 3pm check-in time and were surprised to discover that only smoking rooms were available and we would have to wait for a non-smoking room to become available (I assumed I had already picked a non-smoking Grand Cotai King Room).  We were very surprised by this and slightly annoyed, but the front desk eventually gave us a non-smoking room on a higher floor with a view of the Galaxy's wave pool.

"Stayed at the top floor facing Zhuhai (the opposite of the wave pool view). The view was actually not bad, so it really is a matter of preference whichever view you prefer.  The private outdoor swimming pool for banyan tree guests only are a must go, way more relaxing than the wave pool which gets crowded from guests in other Galaxy hotels.  Only downside was the coffee machine in room, waited quite a long time for it to be sent to the room- around 30 minutes which wasn't really what I was expecting at Banyan Tree. The next day, the machine was not working properly and took a long time for it to be resolved until I ultimately gave up due to their logistics+operations ineffectiveness (the banyan tree staff who help me set it up was very friendly and helpful).

Staffs are polite and friendly. 2. Rooms are clean and very spacious. 3. Room attendants taken care all of our needs, they've been trained well and maybe since we are frequent stayer here, they seems to have known what we need even before we entered the room ( e.g. we found the power cord extensions already there inside the room without ask even asking, extra blankets, towels, shampoo and soap are there without us asking ). It just makes you feel you are back home. They've been trained well. 4. More than half of the staff able to speak english, which is very good thing for me‚Ä¶",40

"‚ÄòThe Banyan Tree Macau‚Äô is definitely the best hotel we‚Äôve stayed at. Over the last few years we‚Äôve had the pleasure of staying at some of the leading hotels in Far East Asia, but I am content in saying that none of them can rival this place.

The staff was very quick to attend to any of our requests, which ranged from having an espresso machine (we didnt like the coffee from the machine already in the room) to an ironing board in the room which was all promptly provided to us.

The hotel is new, clean and well maintained and staff was friendly and courteous and they managed a very good reception for giving me a quick check in. Also, my boys have enjoyed the hotel especially the indoor swimming pool and wanted to stay more. Moreover, this hotel is incredible and I highly recommend it to all visitors as a first choice in Macau. Cheers and keep going :)",50
Pleasant and soothing atmosphere with very attentive and well trained staff. Fresh fruit was supplied daily and our suite had a wading pool in the lounge area which unfortunately was too cold to use with nowhere to change this. The light switches are not immediately obvious - one needs to stay at least a week to discover how they operate! I loved their turn down service with aroma therapy - so soothing and very special. Great bed with lovely linen so we would definitely return.,50
"We love to stay at Banyan Tree. Apart from the room and facilities, the service sets it apart from the other hotels.  I was wondering how they are going to incorporate the resort feel in such a high rise property, but Banyan Tree pulled it off really well. The only thing lacking is some soothing music to complete the overall feeling.  As what the other reviewers noted, there are so many switches around, a master switch would have made things very convenient.   On the first night, after lounging in the in-room pool and while taking a shower, the pool suddenly had a gush of hot water pouring into the pool. That gave me a great shock, I think it is a way for the hotel to maintain the pool at 27 degrees and also to sanitize it? I thought it was brilliant of it to know when I am out‚Ä¶",50
"Right off the bat, Banyan Tree was as expected; courteous staff, spacious lobby, the rooms were huge and has an indoor wading pool. Just as advertised and just what we paid for. Then comes two hitches that is simply unacceptable for anyone claiming to be 5 star hotel.  1. Lady at the breakfast buffet by some stroke of genius overlooked us and let 2 parties cut in front of us. And we have already been waiting for 15 minutes. 2. Front desk calls us to check if we are leaving on time at 1pm which by our experience normally ranges from 1-130pm. We said yes. Lo and behold someone loudly bangs on the door at 12:46 asking why haven't we checked out? That was the last straw. We went down to talk to Michael the Manager at front desk and who profusely apologized and provided concessions‚Ä¶",20
The suite is very pretty with the relaxation pool inside in each room. The exquisite service is a plus too! It is the best service so far compare to other hotels in Macau. Definitely will go back here soon.,40
"We stayed at the Banyan Tree Hotel in Macau and from the moment we arrived in Macau, I was blown away by the level of service! We had requested a car pick up and we were warmly greeted by an amazing gentleman from the Banyan Tree that took us to the hotel and directly into our villa - after showing us the amazing lobby entrance to the Banyan Tree. The moment you walk into the lobby of the main entrance, you know you have arrived at a very unique place in the world. The aroma and the decor upon entering immediately suggests relaxation and luxury in a very inviting way.   We were taken to our villa and shown the MANY features and were blown away by what we saw. The attention to detail is beyond amazing and the amenities were the best I've experienced anywhere in the world.   The‚Ä¶",50
we had a wonderful stay at the Banyan tree from 8th for two nights and the stranded of the hotel is way above the rest.  Ultimate luxury with fabulous service.good value & marvelous food at Saffron.  If you are heading to Macau-this is the place,50
"Macau might not be everyone's cup of tea, the casinos lack the atmosphere of Vegas and the town itself it a mix of old portuguese buildings and some of the tackiest architecture I have ever seen. However, the Banyan Tree was fabulous. Amazing room with its own relaxation pool. More than that the little touches like the fresh oil lamp and bath salts for the tub were lovely.   The Galaxy Casino lays on regular buses to the town - these are available from the front of the main Galaxy foyer - we got lost and tried to get on a staff bus  The Banyan Tree has a separate pool to the main Galaxy pool, although we didn't find it!   The foyer is incredible smelling! Lovely and enticing!   If you are coming from Hong Kong- take the Cotai Water Jet and there is a coach straight from there to‚Ä¶",50
"From the first time you walk into this beautiful hotel, the smells will tell you that you have arrived in an oasis of comfort and servce.  Remembering you are in Macao, where service is difficult, Banyan Tree makes all the effort and you sense they want your stay to be the best.    The room was beautiful, with a relaxation pool that hugged the windows looking over the river.  Kept at a warm 27 degrees C, it was a place to rewind after a long day of business.  And they light incense at night to give the room a soft and quiet atmosphere.  The bath tub is made of wood and sits in the middle of the room.  And the show has two shower heads, for those that can convince the other to join in.  My only complaint is the light switches--or should I say--the TOO many light switches.  You‚Ä¶",50
"We spent one night in the King size Cotei suite.  Loved the room especially the relaxation pool.  Although not deep enough to swim it was lovely to relax and enjoy the view.  The barrow type bathtub was also a real treat and my partner enjoyed the large double shower.  The japanese toilet was also a treat, love them!.  The breakfast was incredible with so much choice both chinese and western.  The only thing was that the complex is so big its easy to get lost.  When coming from the airport or ferry take the galaxy bus to the hotel its free.  It is part of the galaxy complex.",50
"Stayed for 2 nights with bunch of close friends on the corner suites where they had 2 suite rooms combined into one ( yeap, combined into one extremely large suite, not those normal connecting hotel rooms ). As always, this was not my first time staying here but we keep on coming back lol. Rooms are very big, amenities are plentiful and generous. Plus points to the housekeeping and FO team, they did a very good job keeping with our demands, even in the middle of the night. Services are top-notch, and the RA is very attentive. Basically, another great stay at Macao.",50
"My fianc√©e and I stayed here for 3 nights and it was the most memorable stay ever, we had the Cotai room and it was the perfect size for a couple. We stayed in Room 1812, and the view was perfect...overlooking the Galaxy and the pool areas. The staff were AMAZING and they spoke perfect English as well as being the most polite and well mannered people we have ever met. (Rem the doorman, Ivy the lady greeting you for breakfast...Winnie and Sibyl our spa massages and of course everyone on the front desk and room makers staff. The staff and security guards always greet you with a lovely bowing gesture and a hello.   Our room was always spot clean, especially the pool and bed linens. Every night on our stay we always seem to get snacks from them and cakes....delicious....They feed‚Ä¶",50
"Not sure why but this is my 2nd time staying here & still felt great.  Some small tiny issues here & there, such as water leaking from shower glass walls.  However, the service is great & will return again. Love the privacy of indoor pool. Need to try the restaurant on the top floor (was stupid to dine at Mandarin Oriental Macau).  The breakfast somehow tasted less colorful than a year ago when we stayed.  Suggest to get rid of guests smoking in the corridor as the cigarette smell mixing with aroma makes me want to throw up. And this is illegal smoking indoor too.",50
"Me my husband and my 4 yr old stayed here for 3 days in Cotai suite , my 4 yr old simply loved the in room plunge pool , I loved there Japanese bathtub . Breakfast served in restaurant was awesome . Although we enjoyed rooftop pool but pool next door at galaxy hotel was huge .",50
"Our 2nd stay at the Banyan Tree Macau, well what can i say? it's amazing! The room has a pool, which my children enjoyed thoroughly.  The staff were very attentive, they even provided a baby bath tub and childrens toiletries.    Would definitely stay here again, be prepared to be treated like royalty at this hotel!",50
"We arrived 3hrs early and they let us check in, then on top of that they gave us a free room upgrade to a jacuzzi suite. All staff were quite good at speaking English and helped in every way possible and definitely went above and beyond. Banyan is located in the galaxy complex which has a huge casino if your into gambling. Hotel runs free shuttle buses to other hotel and attractions which is very convenient and saves you money. Buffet breakfast was fantastic and was really nice.  I would have to say its more like a 6* hotel. Rooms are massive with your own in room relaxation pool against the window so you can overlook the strip, we had a jacuzzi with massage tables for in room massages and a huge bed where it feels like your partner is sleeping on the other side of the room.‚Ä¶",50
"Excellent stay especially for couples...This was my 2nd time in Macau but first time at Banyan Tree. Once you experience it, you will not want to stay elsewhere.  Not only the room is nice (the setting) also the pool is great! Guest at Banyan Tree can assess the Galaxy pool & also Banyan Tree pool (which feels exclusive & less people).  Breakfast was great with lots of selection. Spa atmosphere was really nice but massage was so so.  I would strongly recommend this hotel & I am sure you will not regret it.  ",50
"I went on a girls' trip with my girlfriends, we decided to stay there because we've heard about the awesome spa and how luxury it is.  Yes the room is spacious and we were impressed by the pool and the room setting, however the actual staying experience was not as good as what we think a luxury hotel should be. The shower is neither stable or strong, one of my friend got a cold after taking shower in the morning. The pillows and comforters don't suit high-end standard.  We also got charged from the"" gifts"" they left at the turn-down service, and we thought they are gifts.  What a disappointment !  I have to say Banyan tree spa is incredible, the spa room is unbelievably comfortable, we all fell asleep during the treatment.  And the concierge staff is very helpful, he booked‚Ä¶",30
"We got a room at the 29th floor. Everything was awesome from the pool, jacuzzi and bathtub. Complete amenities!   Banyan cabanas, exclusive for banyan tree guests which means you get your own privacy.   We loved our complimentary in-room spa massage for two! Great spa therapists!   Tell earlier if its a celebration so they can give you complimentary cake and wine which we also got on time.   Overall, our stay was excellent and luxurious. We were really relaxed and pampered. Great atmosphere from the lobby going up to our room.   Buffet breakfast at Saffron was also top of the line!   Stanley the receptionist was accomodating. The two spa therapist are also friendly. The 3 of them knows english which is a good thing!   The spa supervisor, reservation manager and supervisor was‚Ä¶",50
"There was a relaxing pool in our hotel room, what more do you need?  On a serious note though, the hotel is attached to The Galaxy which is attached to the largest casino in the world.  Personally, I don't gamble so watching an ocean of people playing baccarat is not my idea of fun.  But getting served drinks pool-side and swimming in a wave pool on one of the hottest days of my year definitely is.  The room was huge.  It was more akin to a suite.  We had a view of the pools which I'm thinking is the better side since it seems to be surrounded by construction on the other side.  The bathroom has a fantastic tub but the shower....ohh the shower.  It has his and her rain shower heads.  I ran them both at the same time, making one hot and one cold, jumping back and forth between‚Ä¶",50
"This is the first time I stayed at a Banyan Tree outside of Thailand; it hasn't failed my expectations. Room is spacious and smell very relaxing. We stay at one of their villa, their washroom is bigger than some apartment in HK !!! Their wooden bath tub is superb, I stayed there for hours. Their bed is so soft I literally sink in. Banyan Tree Macau is an excellent choice.",50
"Checked in on the 8th Sept 2014 for 2 nights stay in a grand cotai suite king room. Staffs were all polite and courteous. Check in was easy with no worries at all for English speaking guests. Lobby was very well furnished with a strong feel of the Banyan sanctuary. Lift was awesome as once you pressed the button it immediately indicates which one to arrive first. Walkway from the lift to our rooms was nice with the soothing music and the decor around makes us have a serene and soothing feeling. Room was spacious which was divided by a partition with one side having a resting area and a TV and the other side with the bed and TV. Views in our room was spectacular as we asked for high floor, overlooking the private beach and outdoor swimming pool. The pool was nice and warm but‚Ä¶",30
"We walked from Galaxy Diamond Area through the link to Hotel, the scent was very special, you'll know that you're already get into Banyan Tree,  the staff will greet and welcome you, that's my first impression stepped into the lobby.   We arrived around 1pm and the official check-in time should be 3pm, the staff are English speakers, they're all very friendly and sincere, we learnt the service and the hotel hardwares are both excellent, so we opted for this hotel for our anniversary, we made the right choice. We asked lots of questions about the room types & room view at front desk, but the staff was very patient and explained in details, after check-in, she personally showed us the way and even walked with us to lift lobby from front desk. When we get into the room, we were‚Ä¶",50
"The hotel was amazingly tidy and well kept from the moment we entered the lobby. Concierge and staff are plentiful and readily available to assist with any requests. When checking in, the front desk employee acknowledged we were on our anniversary so he kindly upgraded the room for free. The room was mind blowing with a large dining table, slim ""pool"" going from the living room to the bedroom, wooden tub, 2 bathrooms and ipod docking stations throughout the room. I would recommend everyone should stay here at least a night if visiting Macau.",50
"With so much choice in Macau, it's hard to choose where to stay. After much deliberation we opted for Banyan Tree. We're so happy that we did!  Free bus from airport to main Galaxy entrance, where we were greeted by a lovely member of staff who carried our bags and walked us through the Galaxy complex to the Banyan Tree, pointing out many things along the way. A great way to get our bearings. (We much preferred the Galaxy Complex to the others in Macau).   The first thing you notice as you step into the peaceful Banyan Tree is the smell! In all the corridors and rooms - the changing scents are heavenly and instantly make you relax..  Check in - fast and efficient as the duty manager welcomed us. We had arrived on an early flight so while our room was being prepared they stored‚Ä¶",50
" It was our first time to try a Banyan Tree Hotel and we were not disappointed. Check In was fast and efficient. We were assisted to our room by One of the staff / Room Boy Morri or Morry who was very friendly and efficient.   The room was everything what was in the pictures. Attention to detail was very evident, starting with the utensils, amenities, drapes, etc. One feature of the room which made my stay really memorable was the Automatic bidet. I always look for a bidet in hotel rooms and the presence of a bidet in a hotel room and this time it was not just an ordinary bidet but a fully automatic bidet with different options!  I really liked the in room pool as the water was regulated to a very nice temperature. The bathroom was huge with options for a shower or a tub.  The‚Ä¶",50
"This is the second time i stayed at this hotel.  we came here for our first family trip with 3 families - a couple with 5 year old kid, a young couple and the grand parents.  we booked 3 rooms and just couldn't get enough time to enjoy everything inside the hotel.  The check-in was much faster than last time, and we have been arranged with higher floor (29th!!!!) as we have requested when we book the hotel.  Since my family came for celebration, they kindly arranged cakes and wine for us!  I have received cakes from other hotels quite often, but a bottle of wine is something better than our expectation!  The view from the room is excellent.  We enjoyed spending time in the window side mini pool in the room, the super big and relaxing wood tub at the bathroom.  Everything was so‚Ä¶",50
Stayed here with my wife and 4 year old in last week of June . It's a fabulous property nestled in galaxy hotel compound . Best feature is the in room pool which my son really liked . They have a Japanese style bathtub which was amazing feature all made of wood . Everything about the hotel oozed luxury . While staying there we were allowed to use the wave pool of galaxy hotel which itself is really good . Breakfast served at lobby level was wholesome and full of variety . ,50
"Located in a ""casino-shopping mall-hotels"" complex called Galaxy, and marketed as a high end hotel, BT Macau falls behind my expectations. I have chosen BT Macau because I have benefited an interesting package which lowers it's price against 4S Macau, but if I ever return to Macau I would rather choose 4S the next time.  The thing I like the most in BT Macau is its rooms (I chose the Cotai suite) which are very large and include an in-room soaking pool, very nice! Aside from this ++ advantage, everything else, although fine, are more at, let's say, a Sheraton or Hilton standard. For example, service is OK but not very personalized and forgets some small details which make the difference between 4 and 5 stars. Also, the fact that the hotel is located inside a complex, along with‚Ä¶",40

The excellent morning buffet breakfast with good variety of pastry and other foods were top-up surprises - our kids and parents-in-law all loved the hotel! Thank you!",50
We booked the Royal Cotai Suite and it surpassed all our expectations. We felt like celebs and got  5-star service from all staff.   The whole complex is stunningly lit by nite and by far is the most impressive in Macau.  The location is 15 minutes away from the shops and main casinos - MGM etc although the Venetian is next door.  There are many shuttle buses/routes 10/15 minutes apart   The room  was a huge 100m2 and exactly like the pictures on the website.  The in-room pool was great and so was the bathtub.  The towels were changed twice per day and at night the beds were made and dressing gowns and slippers laid out. A candle was lit and each day had a different aroma. A gift was also left on the bed every night.  The buffet breakfast was extensive and difficult to taste all‚Ä¶,50

We had High Tea at Saffron in the Banyan Tree Macau. Although we were not staying at this property we were greeted by wonderful staff who were more than happy to point us in the right direction of Saffron. Saffron's attention to detail in their High Tea sets are amazing.  The service and atmosphere were also top notch. One of the best High Tea's I have experienced.,50

The swiming pool is fantastic. And the service is always wonderful and effective. My family stayed a happy day here. I will definitely come back and also recommend to my friends.",50
"The rooms in the Banyan Tree Macau are amazing, you don't want to leave the room. very large with separate lounge area, and a large in-room pool along the large window front. The attention to detail is what makes this room special, burning oils, towels on the pillows near the pool so you don't wet the room, heated toilet, 2 rain showers which turn into a steam room, desk area, walk-in wardrobe. The hotel itself is a nice tranquil escape from the craziness of the other large hotels. Spa experience was very good. Would definitely stay again.",50
We stayed in the suite that featured a window side private pool which had breathtaking views over the Macau sea line. Bathroom featured a wood circular tub and rain shower shower. Beautiful decor and amenities. Lots to eat downstairs in the galaxy mall and convenient to nearby attractions.  ,50

"Stayed over Easter long weekend. Hotel was nice but the service was terrible.  I was extremely sick with food poisoning from something I had eaten in the hotel. My partner and I both made it very clear on serval occasions that I was extremely ill and not one member of staff made any effort to address the situation. It was as if they had not been ""trained"" to deal with sick guests so they just ignored it all together. Meanwhile, 2 of the 4 days we spent were there were ruined as I couldn't leave the hotel room.  On the final day I was well enough to go to the outside pool. When I got out there I realised I didn't have my sunglasses and thought I had maybe left them in the indoor pool change rooms.
