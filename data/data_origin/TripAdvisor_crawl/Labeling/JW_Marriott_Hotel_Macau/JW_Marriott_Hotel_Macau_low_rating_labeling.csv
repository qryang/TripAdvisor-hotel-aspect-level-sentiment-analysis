c9000000,s1,It’s our second time staying in this hotel
c9000000,s2,Last stay was not pleasant because the whole time there was the construction on the same floor not far from our suite and the chemical smell went to our room
c9000000,s3,"This time we wanted to go for the swimming pool so we accepted the kind gesture from hotel, being upgraded to executive floor"
c9000000,s4,But again an unpleasant experience
c9000000,s5,For the executive lounge experience: We arrived 5minutes before the breakfast would be closed
c9000000,s6,"So the staff arranged us at the outside seating not the bfst/dinning area, which we accepted and totally understood with no question"
c9000000,s7,"But after they started the breakfast clean up, so they closed the partition in between these two areas, there’s no staff AT ALL in our area that we could reach or see"
c9000000,s8,"The entire time (about one hour), only one staff showed up twice but disappeared very quickly"
c9000000,s9,"even worse, there were mosquitos in our Danish pastry, but no one was around(except two cleaning staff using vacuum cleanser to clean the carpet around us when we were eating, seriously? In JW Marriott executive lounge!!? Even this is the routine, at least a staff would show up and apologize or explain, shouldn’t it??!)"
c9000000,s10,"However, in the afternoon same situation, we Came back from outside and ordered the afternoon tea set, once it’s served, no service staff around anymore"
c9000000,s11,"a while after, mosquitos flying around again, in kid’s apple juice, on the pastries, in the dippings"
c9000000,s12,we had to return the juice to the staff to change to warm milk (luckily she showed up then
c9000000,s13,)
c9000000,s14,"By the way, the food quality is really not up to the standard of a JW Marriott hotel"
c9000000,s15,It’s so far the worse executive lounge experience ever
c9000000,s16,"The Executive floor suite: coffee capsule was used when we checked in; the second day after housekeeping cleaning, still no one found and replace"
c9000000,s17,the welcome cake was a disaster that we didn’t even touch
c9000000,s18,Don’t want to come back again
c9000000,s19,The only good experience was the particular Housekeeping staff (sorry we didn’t notice his name)
c9000000,s20,"When we just entered the suite after check-in and requested special beddings for the kid, he was very helpful and thoughtful"
c9000000,s21,He created a dream bed for our kid!…
c9000001,s1,"Staying at May, 2020 (Executive suite with resort pool view)  Staying again at the JW Marriott Macau during the city lock down period"
c9000001,s2,"When I arrived to the hotel, there have only 1 counter for operation and no single person queueing for check in and out this time, as well as evening time when my friend visit, I’m glad and hardly have this smoothness registration experience in this property"
c9000001,s3,Ms
c9000001,s4,Salvia assigned me to the executive suite which I reserved
c9000001,s5,"It was pity there have no further upgrade for the accommodation, I also tried to ask for downgrade to the Retreat studio room type that hope to enjoy jacuzzi since all the wet facilities and pools are closed, which was told all “occupied”"
c9000001,s6,This is quite surprise the hotel is still that busy during the city lock down and COVID-19…
c9000002,s1,Our stay was generally good with the atmosphere and hardware
c9000002,s2,"However, we were surprised with some points"
c9000002,s3,"First, the room facilities had some technical issues"
c9000002,s4,The television on the bathroom mirror got some noises and the mirror was shaking
c9000002,s5,"Also, the toilet bidet was non-stop splashing and we felt embarrassed to call the staff because we could not stand up, then we found our way"
c9000002,s6,"Second, we got too many reminders about check-out time even before the requested time"
c9000002,s7,We felt unwelcome and like being kicked out as soon as possible
c9000002,s8,"Third, after check-out, we thought we forgot our money in the room"
c9000002,s9,We went back to ask if there was anything left
c9000002,s10,"The staff was so upset and responded that they always return our guests whenever they left something! We were just asking, but at the…"
c9000003,s1,Hello!~ I am one of big fans of Marriott
c9000003,s2,And I love to stay at all Marriott hotels
c9000003,s3,"But, This experience of check-in at the executive lounge"
c9000003,s4,"hmm,,,, I was really disappointed"
c9000003,s5,My wife did check-in instead of me at the lounge
c9000003,s6,Because unluckily I was really busy
c9000003,s7,I should have been there with my wife
c9000003,s8,My wife had to spend almost 1 hour for checking in there
c9000003,s9,"Above all, my wife felt bad and sad at the lounge"
c9000003,s10,"If you are a platimum member,  I think it is better to check in at the frontdesk instead of the lounge"
c9000003,s11,I have booked 3 rooms for all my family members
c9000003,s12,"But, I have regretted I should have booked other hotels for my family"
c9000003,s13,And one room was ready
c9000003,s14,But the other two rooms were not ready
c9000003,s15,We could get the room keys at 4:50PM
c9000003,s16,"Fortunately,  Room condition and…"
c9000004,s1,I paid 5 times the normal hotel price elsewhere but got 0 in value
c9000004,s2,Everything was just plain average
c9000004,s3,"Around the hotel shops and restaurants were expensive,  Room was average, amenities were normal, service was average, food was average,  Everything was average except the ultra high cost of the room"
c9000005,s1,"JW always my first choice to stay at hotel, I have been to Hongkong, Shenzhen, Beijing and Shanghai"
c9000005,s2,Unfortunlety macau one not the good as want I want
c9000005,s3,"No greeting, no smiling, and I need to take care my luggage"
c9000005,s4,The room facility was still ok
c9000005,s5,But it always come from noise during mid night
c9000006,s1,We booked two rooms during Chinese New Year
c9000006,s2,"The standard room was spacious enough for family with kids, it was also well appointed"
c9000006,s3,We had very good lunch buffet in Urban Kitchen
c9000006,s4,"More restaurants are available in Galaxy Casino, and there are also  shops and cinemas to hang around inside the casino if you are not into gambling"
c9000006,s5,The problem I encountered is I found my Marriott Rewards points were missing after check-out
c9000006,s6,"I called the hotel in about a week, the staff told me the relevant personnel who could help me was busy, but she would pass my details and write back to me by email"
c9000006,s7,"Another week passed without any feedback, so I called the hotel again, the staff assured me my case was being looked after, and the problem would be fixed"
c9000006,s8,It is now a month since the date we…
c9000007,s1,"I dont usually write on tripadvisor, however, my stay was not pleasant somehow"
c9000007,s2,"I just wanted to comment on the shampoo and body wash that gave me itchy skin and hair scalp for days and I only used those shampoo and body wash once during my stay! The brand is AROMATHERAPY ASSOCIATES which is a UK brand that I love, but I think this made in china ones are quite different than the ones I normally buy in store which is made in UK"
c9000007,s3,"If you are staying at this hotel and you dont want to take the risk, bring your own shampoo and body wash"
c9000008,s1,"只有把经历写在这，才会真的有人care。九月和朋友去澳门玩，之前也来澳门很多次，也住过澳门各种五星酒店，对于JW 酒店其实是第二次入住了，但是之前那次是用朋友名字预订之前那次入住体验很好，但是这次！worst!!!From front Desk to Communication, do you have any learning manager to train your staff, or do you have somebody train your staff, how to be a professional five star hotel staff"
c9000008,s2,"Upon My C/I,  the front desk agent, her name (I can not remember maybe call Su**?),she is really tall and slim, no greeting, no smile, it's seems likeI own her money, fine, I can understand everybody do have the down period, but no registration card for me!!!no paper for me to sign!!!!! no verification with my reservation, just told me the restaurant and pool, but speak not clearly! the ridiculous thing is when I come to my room,2 Keys doesn't work!! are you kidding me??? How could you tell me is…"
c9000009,s1,Stayed here for two days and three nights
c9000009,s2,The hotel is beautiful
c9000009,s3,"It links up with three other hotels, Ritz Carlton, Banyan Tree, and Galaxy"
c9000009,s4,In between there is a large shopping mall with all the modern comforts
c9000009,s5,Requested for early check in and late check out
c9000009,s6,Front desk mgr Eden was warm and accomondating
c9000009,s7,"Supv Gloria, Urban Kitchen, was fabulous and made me feel at-home"
c9000009,s8,Why the one-star? you may ask
c9000009,s9,"After check out, I had to for my ride"
c9000009,s10,"Feeling tired, I sat down in the lobby and closed my eye to rest"
c9000009,s11,"Let me emphasize, I was sitting upright, not snoring or sleeping"
c9000009,s12,"A security personel, Tin, told me that I was not allowed to rest in the lobby"
c9000009,s13,"I explained to him that I just checked out, implying I am not loitrring"
c9000009,s14,"Still, Tin was firm saying that is the hotel…"
c9000010,s1,I booked jw marriot macau from hotels
c9000010,s2,com but somehow my account has been hacked and someone cancelled my non refundable reservation
c9000010,s3,(More reviews on hotels
c9000010,s4,"com, a very bad bad one!!) I tried to check in and they said they can't do anything about it and left me with no room for the night"
c9000010,s5,All they can offer is to book another reservation which i have to pay again
c9000010,s6,They saw all the necessary document and my account is under investigation by the useless customer service of hotels
c9000010,s7,"com, and still can't even offer me the room"
c9000010,s8,"I also have other reservation in double tree guangzhou and the perkin hotel hongkong which have been cancelled by someone else, but these hotels are very helpful and let me have my reservation back at no cost at all"
c9000010,s9,"So yes, you people at jw marriot macau"
c9000010,s10,…
c9000011,s1,"First off, the rooms in JW Marriott Macau was very nice"
c9000011,s2,"However, the experience we had in our 2-day stay in this hotel very not good at all"
c9000011,s3,"This is a booking for our 10 year anniversary celebrations with our friends and families, we have booked 4 rooms and one of them being the retreat pool suite connecting with the Jacuzzi studio suite"
c9000011,s4,"We originally wanted to book Presidential Suite as it gives more space but reservation suggested that since we have less than 15 people, the sizes of both suites together that we booked will meet our needs of having a gathering, and she was right, it was good size and had what we originally wanted"
c9000011,s5,"Prior to checking in the room, I still want to know the presidential suite offered rate and expected to have a better offer upon the day of…"
c9000012,s1,I spent the last weekend with family by booking an executive floor room
c9000012,s2,"Out of our disappointment, both the service and hardware of the hotel are deteriorating:-  1"
c9000012,s3,The hotel has a Japanese type of flushing toilet but it didn't work
c9000012,s4,"When you presses the button, it made the sound but no water came out and it simply didn't work"
c9000012,s5,2
c9000012,s6,The room is non-smoking one but it smelled second hand smoke
c9000012,s7,We were with our child and it irritated us
c9000012,s8,3
c9000012,s9,"When we asked for an extra blanket for the night, the answer was no"
c9000012,s10,They only had a big towel and either you like it or leave it
c9000012,s11,4
c9000012,s12,"During the morning breakfast, the table was not set and when you asked for a knife and fork, you were being ignored by 2-3 different staff and finally after persistently raised my hand and walked up to a…"
c9000013,s1,"I'm amazed at all the positive reviews - yes the service and hotel design is nice but this is not enough for an ""excellent"" review"
c9000013,s2,I've stayed in many JW Marriott's across the globe and this is the worst
c9000013,s3,The food is simply terrible! Limited breakfast choice and not even good quality
c9000013,s4,One night the hotel dropped something to my room at midnight - WTF! My apology was an $11 bottle of wine that went down the toilet
c9000013,s5,The Chinese restaurant is so so but limited typical Cantonese style that westerners would eat
c9000013,s6,Slow check in process but good shops located near by and free wifi
c9000013,s7,With so many choices I would stay elsewhere!  Very disappointed
c9000014,s1,"I've stayed at this property couple times now, and I think I've given it enough opportunities to improve"
c9000014,s2,"Unfortunately, the same issue seems to happen every time regardless of the feedbacks (and I did so in a nice and polite way) given"
c9000014,s3,Staffs keep making mistakes when it comes to reservation specifications
c9000014,s4,"Every time I stayed here, I asked for two double beds in a non-smoking room and reconfirmed multiple times to ensure the booking is correct"
c9000014,s5,"However, at the most recent stay, they once again made the same mistake and gave me a smoking room with king-size bed"
c9000014,s6,"Also, in spite of having put in the security deposit, they locked the mini bar anyway (without telling me in advance)"
c9000014,s7,"While I don't ever use the mini bar, I do have food that I'd like to put in the fridge so…"
c9000015,s1,It's my first time to stay in JW Marriott Hotel Macau
c9000015,s2,Staff were efficient & polite in Concierge during check in & check out
c9000015,s3,They also offered  me late check out at 12pm
c9000015,s4,The room was clean & nice
c9000015,s5,"However an hour after we entered the room , a man came & wanted to check the mini bar"
c9000015,s6,"Arround 1 hour later , a lady came & wanted to checked the mini bar again ! On the day we checked out , at arround 11:30 , a lady ""pang ""on our room door & yelled"
c9000015,s7,She said she want to make up our room
c9000015,s8,She did not know the concierge had offered us to checked out at 12:00 pm
c9000015,s9,The most unacceptable was she yelled at me in such an impolite way
c9000015,s10,"I had made a complaint in the concierge with my email left for them but no reply! There are so many new 5 star hotel in Macau, its not worth to stay in…"
c9000016,s1,"I have to say, i did enjoy the stay in your hotel"
c9000016,s2,Steven extended us a very warm welcome upon check in
c9000016,s3,"Me and my wife got a very nice upgraded room with fantasic view, maybe that's a little treat to us because of my wife's birthday and we were appreciated"
c9000016,s4,"However, we realised that we left 2 phone charger in the hotel room on our way to the ferry terminal"
c9000016,s5,"Luckily, we still had time so we decided to go back"
c9000016,s6,We first checked with Concierge and took us 15mins waiting for a negative result which was not possible
c9000016,s7,"We checked again with a foreign front desk officer, after another 15mins waiting finally they found my chargers"
c9000016,s8,The front desk staff was nice enough to bring back the charger to me and it took 15mins AGAIN
c9000016,s9,Here comes the most ridiculous part : the lost & found…
c9000017,s1,"Usually I like to write long reviews, however this place doesn't deserve it"
c9000017,s2,I asked on check in how long their holds are put on credit cards and I was told it would be released straight away
c9000017,s3,"At check out, I asked and they then told me 14 days but ""as a favour"" they could do it in 7 days"
c9000017,s4,I asked them to do a miscellaneous charge (which hotels can do and have done in the past) so that I could take cash instead which I was told they do not do and would have to wait a minimum of 7 days
c9000017,s5,Pay cash for your incidental deposit if you stay here
c9000018,s1,"Not a pleasant stay at all,  we would like to request to have quick look at swimming pool at 6pm as we just checked in and staff insisted cannot as pool is closed"
c9000018,s2,But then allow two foreigners to go in
c9000018,s3,We requested for late check out to 1pm but the reception lady said sorry you will need to pay for 1000hkd if check out at 1pm
c9000018,s4,"Thank you,  there are many hotels in macau and you are not the only one"
c9000018,s5,"I just stayed at studio city during mid autumn festival,  they allowed us late check out at 1pm with very nice smile,, by the way much bigger room!!!"
c9000019,s1,My family just returned home from our stay in JW Marriott for 3 days in Macau
c9000019,s2,Pros: Very spacious hotel room and very nice decoration  Cons: It is very obvious the staff in the hotel are not properly trained with very serious management issue
c9000019,s3,"From the service at the restaurant to room service (like the waiter was chewing gums while servicing customers in Urban Kitchen in the morning), water were not refilled on time, room service were not finished till 4pm despite our reminder in the morning"
c9000019,s4,We have stayed in many Marriott in the world but this is obviously the one with the worst customer service we have ever encountered
c9000020,s1,"Every time when I visited Macau, I was staying at Marriott since its opening"
c9000020,s2,"However during a recent stay in the last weekend, I found that the service level of Marriott has been deterioted"
c9000020,s3,I used to have lunch buffet at Urban Kitchen and this time I would like to try the buffet dinner
c9000020,s4,My little daughter was so excited and pulled me to the food counter right after we sat down
c9000020,s5,"When I approached the rice portridge area, I didn't recognize and misthought it was a cold cut counter"
c9000020,s6,I took two abalones and was immediately stopped by a staff named Tiger
c9000020,s7,"He gave me a lesson, saying that if the abalone could be eaten rightaway, it would be easily gone as every one would just take it away"
c9000020,s8,I was immediately saying sorry that I've mixed it up with the cold cut
c9000020,s9,But he then ordered…
c9000021,s1,We always favour Marriott as a Hotel brand but will definitely have a second thought after our poor experience with Marriott Macau
c9000021,s2,We have stayed with the hotel for one night a week ago
c9000021,s3,"When we did our booking, we thought we have paid to upgraded our room to executive package with access to lounge and free breakfast"
c9000021,s4,"However, this turned out to be a total disaster!   Everything was fine when we first arrived, check-in was ok and room was great! The main issue was with the executive lounge - Instead of a warm welcome,we encountered a very bad attitude staff (Cliff) who was terribly rude"
c9000021,s5,"He could not find our room (or name) on the executive list via their system and since, have dealt the issue with extreme bad manner! I have then asked to deal with his management and…"
c9000022,s1,We book the room at 3pm and was told and promised that the room will be available at 4pm
c9000022,s2,"By the time we are back to the hotel at 7pm, we were told that the room will be available in about 30 minutes later"
c9000022,s3,"At that time, my family were all wet and cold after finished swimming"
c9000022,s4,We had to borrow my friends' room to get change
c9000022,s5,Finally we got the room at around 8pm
c9000022,s6,"Next day, the manager apologized for letting us use the Executive Lounge and promised that everything will be well arranged, we can just go there in the afternoon"
c9000022,s7,"When we were at the Executive Lounge, our names is not on the list and they were not informed"
c9000022,s8,"Again, we were totally disappointed about the services we got"
c9000022,s9,This is the worst 5 Stars hotel that I had ever stay
c9000023,s1,Stayed at JW Marriott Macau for 2 nights
c9000023,s2,"While the hotel is new with great swimming pools, the crowds are astonishing"
c9000023,s3,"You are in constant race to get a table, find a chair at the pool, and line up for various things"
c9000023,s4,This is not what a holiday is supposed to be
c9000023,s5,"In addition, because most of the hotels are very large (easily 1000 rooms), staff are only trained to handle the masses of customers, and there is no service to speak about"
c9000024,s1,This is the first time we went to JW Marriott Macau but we have been to many other JW before
c9000024,s2,I have to say this is the worse experience I've ever had
c9000024,s3,We arrived at 3:40pm and the lobby was packed
c9000024,s4,Every single seat was occupied with over hundred of people waiting
c9000024,s5,We proceed to the check in counter and the queue was so long
c9000024,s6,"We were told by one of the staff that the minimum waiting time is 45 minutues!  My husband said we would like to go to the pool and the lady staff helped us to get the access card and when the lift landed on 3/F, we already saw over 30 people queuing to just enter the pool"
c9000024,s7,"I really thought this will only happened in the 3rd line cities in China, but we are in Macau yet a 5 stars hotel!  We decided to give up and just stroll around"
c9000024,s8,The mall is full…
c9000025,s1,"The hotel is new and location is nice, but I need to make a complaint about the customer service"
c9000025,s2,"I made the reservation for 05/20-05/22, through my credit card reward program which is pre-paid and can't be refunded"
c9000025,s3,"When I arrived, the hotel check-in worker requested my credit card for deposit which is understandable"
c9000025,s4,"After we left, it's been a nightmare"
c9000025,s5,"A week later, I found a more than $500 charge to my credit card from ""JW front desk"" (showed on statement)"
c9000025,s6,I made an international call to ask about it and they told me that was the deposit and I should see the refund on my statement in a couple days
c9000025,s7,A week later I still didn't see any refund so I made another international call again
c9000025,s8,A lady told me that they were processing the refund and it should be completed in…
c9000026,s1,I hardy write a review but Marriott really need to step up on their service!!! Came here to celebrate Father's Day over the weekend with family and friends and had to wait over ridiculous 50 mins standing at check in counter to check-in 5 rooms
c9000026,s2,The staff was staring at the screen all the time and at least 30 mins he was just gone
c9000026,s3,Seriously understaff and the staffs were clueless
c9000026,s4,We only got 4 rooms
c9000026,s5,"Previously requested non smoking floor, with two cots and none were noted"
c9000026,s6,One room smells very very smoky- eventhough on non smoking floor
c9000026,s7,We didn't get our last room until 1:15am as we expect the keys to arrive at the room we requested
c9000026,s8,We waited until 6:15pm and went out for dinner and it never came when we got back
c9000026,s9,"The night manager came out trying to ""do"" something by…"
c9000027,s1,"In JW Martiott Hotel Macau, waiting is only thing you can do! We spend over half an hour to check in and spend further hour to wait for a room card! Front desk staff not so helpful even very nice to tell me please wait, sorry! Never go to Marriott! For wait lover, please go to enjoy!"
c9000028,s1,I stayed at this hotel for over a week for business
c9000028,s2,The room is relatively new and the bed is comfortable
c9000028,s3,View from the room is good as it was facing the pool and the 2 large blocks of Galaxy Macau
c9000028,s4,"TV channel lineup was pathetic as there is no HBO, Disney Junior and English Premier League (they were showing Serie A / German League)"
c9000028,s5,"I rationalise that as this hotel was attached to a casino, maybe they wanted us to go gamble instead of staying in the room watching TV"
c9000028,s6,Ha ha
c9000028,s7,I previously stayed in Venetian a few years back and I thought their TV selection wasn't as bad as this
c9000028,s8,"I stayed on a non-smoking floor, but the lift lobby at a non-smoking floor had cigarette butts littered around and the foul stench of cigarette smoke permeating the entire floor"
c9000028,s9,This actually…
c9000029,s1,"Long queue at reception, customer service manager calculated wrong bill three times and delayed our check in for an hour and was extremely arrogant and rude, the pool boys were unhelpful and threw our personal belongings on the ground"
c9000029,s2,The whole experience was horrible given that this is a five stars branded hotel
c9000029,s3,"Mind you, the waterfall slide was extremely dangerous when swimmers exited, just be careful"
c9000029,s4,Good that there was a lifeguard there who acted quickly and saved my dad's life!
c9000030,s1,I ask for the hotel to check out my toilet when I was there
c9000030,s2,It took me two call to tell them to come and check it
c9000030,s3,How come they let the electric in the toilet underlook!? need to improve
c9000030,s4,Hope my next visit I would face this kind of problem again
c9000031,s1,"This is one of the newest hotels in Macau this year and I thought a new hotel will perform far better than all others, having learnt from the mistakes of all existing competitors"
c9000031,s2,"But no, there is this huge long line up at reception just for check in, even though we have requested online for early check in"
c9000031,s3,The staffs are new and not fluent with the service standard of Marriotts
c9000031,s4,A disappointment! Would not stay here again!
c9000032,s1,I stayed at a Deluxe room for 1 night at the end of March 2016
c9000032,s2,"As many other reviewers said, the design is excellent, an absolute 5star grade"
c9000032,s3,But the credit goes to the designer
c9000032,s4,The facilities and service are both less than that
c9000032,s5,"While checking in, the staff, holding my ID and credit card, didn't seem to be able to locate my record"
c9000032,s6,"He asked in what way I booked my room, and I said on the site of a travel agency"
c9000032,s7,"He phoned someone and finally, he found it"
c9000032,s8,"It doesn't take very long, but, as a 5star hotel, it looks like their guest records are a bit messy"
c9000032,s9,"Regarding facilities in the room, everything looks fine on surface"
c9000032,s10,"Yet, as you use them, problems may come out"
c9000032,s11,1
c9000032,s12,The water would not drain in the water basin! It took me some time to find where the control is located…

c9000034,s1,The hotel is stunning
c9000034,s2,Rooms are lovely and bright
c9000034,s3,The service is more 'serviced apartments' than hotel
c9000034,s4,The hotel checkin process is long and disgraceful
c9000034,s5,We have stayed twice
c9000034,s6,"On our first occasion we were told that we can only pre register to checkin after 12 30, we arrived at 12"
c9000034,s7,Fine
c9000034,s8,Then was told by the helpful Guest Relations that we could pre register earlier
c9000034,s9,She asked who had given us this information and I pointed the person out
c9000034,s10,To my disgust both of them were arguing with her that this was not the case
c9000034,s11,Appalling
c9000034,s12,"This is JW Marriot, a supposedly 5 Star hotel"
c9000034,s13,We than checked in on another date and this ordeal lasted 30 mins of trying to find our confirmed and paid for booking through a 3rd party
c9000034,s14,Same ordeal at check in
c9000034,s15,We had to ask for the manager as we were…
c9000035,s1,I stayed at room 25242 from 24 Nov to 26 Nov 2015
c9000035,s2,"In the first evening when I came back after dinner, I found the window curtains were closed"
c9000035,s3,I sure that I have not closed it when out and thought it maybe some hotel staff came to close when we were out
c9000035,s4,"On the second night, my wife and I went to the gym room at around 7pm"
c9000035,s5,My wife returned to the room by herself at about 8:30pm
c9000035,s6,"When she opened the room, she saw the curtains opening automatically"
c9000035,s7,She was frightened by this strange and sudden movement and rushed down to the lobby
c9000035,s8,She was shocking and told the front desk staff what had happened
c9000035,s9,The front desk staff not even trying to pacify her nor took a seat for her
c9000035,s10,But told my wife that they knew this problems in some the guest rooms
c9000035,s11,"To my surprise, how can your staff…"
c9000036,s1,Pros: 1) Free shuttle from Outer Harbour Ferry Terminal to hotel door
c9000036,s2,There are free shuttles from some other destinations
c9000036,s3,Not sure whether it is easy to get out from the hotel by free shuttle
c9000036,s4,"2)  Generally the room is clean and the view was fine  However, the hotel guide book was vandalized by some previous customers"
c9000036,s5,3)  The technician who visited my room twice at 4 to 5 a
c9000036,s6,m
c9000036,s7,was helpful and in good manner
c9000036,s8,4)  The buffet dinner at the hotel restaurant is reasonably priced with good variety of food
c9000036,s9,Cons: 1) I need to sleep in total darkness but this hotel could not offer me so
c9000036,s10,The night lights under the bed and under the toilet sink could not be switched off during my stay
c9000036,s11,"While the former was found to be a technical fault after I called the front desk at 4 am,…"
c9000037,s1,My husband and I stayed 4 nights but paid for 6 nights due to our strange flight time from the U
c9000037,s2,S
c9000037,s3,That wasn't an issue because that was our decision
c9000037,s4,We had to change our flights at the last minute to arrive a day early in Macau
c9000037,s5,so we ended up having two separate hotel reservations – one for the first night and second for the rest of our stay at Macau
c9000037,s6,"Prior our arrival at Macau, we had emailed the General Manager of the hotel, Brian Tong, asking him for assistance in combining the two reservations so we would not need to check-out after the first night stay just to check back in"
c9000037,s7,Mr
c9000037,s8,Tong never did respond to our email but we figured the hotel staff would be able to fix the issue at check-in
c9000037,s9,"To our disappointment, the gentleman that helped us check-in upon our…"
c9000038,s1,The rooms and facilities of the hotel itself is really good
c9000038,s2,But then the poor services from check-in to security
c9000038,s3,dramatically down graded the hotel
c9000038,s4,I am not saying all staffs are poor but if you happened to bump into more than 5 poor staffs in a 5 star hotel
c9000038,s5,"that's not a good percentage!  At the check-in counter, there were two different lines for check-in; there's no sign or what so ever to distinguish their differences"
c9000038,s6,We picked a shorter one and a friendly staff came immediately to ask if we have the booking document printed out
c9000038,s7,We had our hotel voucher printed out before so we said yes
c9000038,s8,"If fact, we found out later on that it was totally another thing, it's a ticket that was printed out from another counter"
c9000038,s9,so we go all the way to line up again
c9000038,s10,The room…
c9000039,s1,I booked a connecting room last Sept 13 to 14 and guess what?  I got the 1st room at 4 PM and then was informed to get back after one hour to get the 2nd room's key
c9000039,s2,"After 1 hour, the room is not yet ready and waited till 6 PM"
c9000039,s3,Few comments from the front desk and even the Manager Steven Jiang were not convincing and obviously inexperience
c9000039,s4,For example:- 1
c9000039,s5,"Our hotel property have only few connecting rooms, that's why you need to wait"
c9000039,s6,"Duh, the checkout time is 11 Am and don't give me such an excuse coz i don't really care? 2"
c9000039,s7,Mr
c9000039,s8,Jiang seems not serious in tackling my issue and then offered me a late checkout
c9000039,s9,"Duh, did i asked for the late checkout? 3"
c9000039,s10,"Sunday was very busy and full, that's why the room was not yet ready"
c9000039,s11,4
c9000039,s12,Still refilling the mini-bar section and…
c9000040,s1,We booked a breakfast + Galaxy deck special package for the weekend to try the new Galaxy pool facilities
c9000040,s2,Hugely disappointing
c9000040,s3,1
c9000040,s4,Check-in is normally at 15:00
c9000040,s5,"We showed up at 14:45 and our room wasn't ready, which is disappointing but understandable"
c9000040,s6,We went for late lunch and returned at 16:30
c9000040,s7,"The staff informed me that all non-smoking floor rooms were already fully booked, and asked me if I could accept a smoking-floor room, although I requested a baby cot during my booking"
c9000040,s8,2
c9000040,s9,"When we finally arrived at the room, a vacuum cleaner was blocking access to the door"
c9000040,s10,"We asked a cleaning staff if the room was ready, and he said that he didn't know"
c9000040,s11,3
c9000040,s12,"After clearing the vacuum cleaner, I noticed that the magnetic lock was broken"
c9000040,s13,I asked a staff and he replied that the lock…
c9000041,s1,"Attracted by the new facilities and opening hotel room package, I decided to stay at JW Marriot on my holiday on 15 August"
c9000041,s2,The rate was high - $3300 per night - perhaps because it was a Saturday
c9000041,s3,"However, what I got from JW Marriot was nothing comparable to the price I paid"
c9000041,s4,"Firstly, this visit to JW Marriot was intended to celebrate my partner's birthday"
c9000041,s5,"When I made my booking months ago, I specified that this was a visit to celebrate the occasion and was asking in the remarks if there were any arrangements that could be made prior to my arrival, be they a card or a pre-ordered birthday cake"
c9000041,s6,"However, I was not contacted by any means and unsurprisingly, no arrangements were made"
c9000041,s7,"More shockingly, it was not until I had entered my hotel room when the person at the check-in…"
c9000042,s1,We stayed 2 nights at retreat pool suite with private pool and it was absolutely disappointing
c9000042,s2,"The first pool was digusting, full of sticky moss at the bottom of pool"
c9000042,s3,The condition was basically not ready for any customers
c9000042,s4,This is a big concern esp
c9000042,s5,for a family with kids
c9000042,s6,"When I asked for a room change, the guy named Leo didn't know how to handle, kept saying to get someone to clean the pool with moss instead of a change, which means, I need to wait may be 3 hrs or up for them to clean up! And the funniest thing was, as I knew he was simply not capable to handle, and asked for a senior one to talk to, he rejected to provide his senior's name as well as he claimed that his senior was not responsible for this! Well, what a suprising answer"
c9000042,s7,"At the end, I spent 30 mins waiting…"
c9000043,s1,We had a family package and stayed for 2 nights in Mid August weekend
c9000043,s2,Overall experience is OK but the check-in & check out experience were very bad
c9000043,s3,They did had a separate member counter for check-in & out but the speed of service is extremely slow
c9000043,s4,Even slower than the normal counter
c9000043,s5,"My bad experience that when I was checking in, a mainland guy just stood next to me and watching my form"
c9000043,s6,"When I shout to him that these were my private information, the receptionist started to realize this and spoke to him"
c9000043,s7,"The room size is small, cleaning OK and nicely decorated"
c9000043,s8,The price is high and not worth with the services standard provided
c9000043,s9,I should trusted the other review that the poor services here
c9000044,s1,"Stay for a pool suite for 3 nights,  spoiled our mood in the 1st day started from check in"
c9000044,s2,And vert consistent thereafter
c9000044,s3,Staff are so inexperienced even in the executive lounge
c9000044,s4,Only the room itself is excellent but the credit goes to the designer
c9000044,s5,"Check in is wasting time,  they said they can locate my booking even I made their booking through their official website as their member"
c9000044,s6,"I have received several emails before my journey start, but that come to useless"
c9000044,s7,The staff even don't know what your package include
c9000044,s8,It will be better for them don't contact customer as things still ruined at the end
c9000044,s9,The pool inside the suite is dirty and we need to let them clean the pool using half a day and of course you still had to pay for that days room charge
c9000044,s10,Asking for ice need 1…
c9000045,s1,Without doubt the worst experience I have ever had at any hotel stay
c9000045,s2,"The hotel was only a week old and the staff were very friendly, but incredibly ill-equipped to deal with issues"
c9000045,s3,"Each issue stand alone is not the end of the world, but the complete disregard of my queries and after many repeated attempts to speak to management, I never once had the courtesy of a email of phone call"
c9000045,s4,"Even twice when I asked for a managers details, they would simply not provide them, rather took my phone and email saying I would be contacted"
c9000045,s5,The only contact I have had from Marriott Macau was a front desk manager sending a canned response to an automatic survey
c9000045,s6,"Even this was from a generic email, rather than written from the manager himself"
c9000045,s7,I have tried to give them the benefit of the…
c9000046,s1,To start this off there are some positives here
c9000046,s2,The rooms themselves are really nice and the Grand Resort Deck (common to all Galaxy hotels) is amazing for the kids
c9000046,s3,But sadly our experience in this hotel was far from great and certainly not the standard we'd expect from a JW Marriott hotel
c9000046,s4,The problems were numerous so best to just list them below:  - We arrived early before the 3:00pm check-in time
c9000046,s5,The reception were unsure what we should do
c9000046,s6,No advice
c9000046,s7,Just left sitting in the lobby with our luggage
c9000046,s8,- We booked a 'Family Package' that included breakfast for 2 and return ferry tickets for 2
c9000046,s9,When checking in they had us down for a single King bed room
c9000046,s10,"I'm not sure I class two adults as a family, perhaps this package should be termed as a 'Couple's package'"
c9000046,s11,- We were…
c9000047,s1,I've stay at JW marriott Macau at 7-9 June
c9000047,s2,It's great room but I want JW marriott improve breakfast and lounge
c9000047,s3,because I'm waiting queue for breakfast around half hour
c9000047,s4,It's too many people
c9000047,s5,"when I ate breakfast, It's only tomato juices"
c9000047,s6,ohh It's 5 stars hotel
c9000047,s7,"I didn't see water, I've must to ask staff"
c9000047,s8,I think It's should have more juices
c9000047,s9,the staff didn't serve coffee or tea
c9000047,s10,If you want coffee or tea
c9000047,s11,you must to queue in coffee bar
c9000047,s12,I think This hotel worst breakfast
c9000047,s13,It's have only cold beverage and coffee in lounge
c9000047,s14,It's have some sandwich and chocolate
c9000047,s15,It's not have cocktail or juices
c9000047,s16,I'm disappoint executive
c9000047,s17,but your staff was great
c9000047,s18,they're friendly
c9000048,s1,Checked in on the 3rd day of the Grand Opening
c9000048,s2,I booked an Executive Room but it was not available of some odd reasons
c9000048,s3,Upgraded to Premiere and kept the benefits of the Executive Room
c9000048,s4,Pros:-  1
c9000048,s5,The room is nicely decor with modern elegant touch
c9000048,s6,Very spacious and clean and with great pool view as well as the whole Galaxy property
c9000048,s7,2
c9000048,s8,Staffs are friendly and polite
c9000048,s9,Cons:- 1
c9000048,s10,A series of disappointing services during throughout my 2 nights stay
c9000048,s11,Even though I did expect the overall experience will not be the top since it's new
c9000048,s12,2
c9000048,s13,45 minutes wait for my order and food wasn't cook properly
c9000048,s14,Miscommunication of the floor and kitchen staff
c9000048,s15,3
c9000048,s16,Didn't deliver the newspaper to my room and had to asked twice to have it delivered 3
c9000048,s17,5 hours later
c9000048,s18,4
c9000048,s19,Called front desk for the…
c9000049,s1,This newly opened hotel needs to improve to meet JW Marriott standard
c9000049,s2,As usual we paid extra for the executive room in our booking
c9000049,s3,"Arriving at the hotel at 3:30pm on a quiet Monday, we did not get our room until 4:20pm"
c9000049,s4,The executive lounge was located on 2/F without any view
c9000049,s5,Food was fair and choice was limited
c9000049,s6,"After I got my room, I found out that they have many TV channels but not the important one - CNBC"
c9000049,s7,"My WIFI connection dropped to almost zero, then I realized that they DON'T have dedicated in-room WIFI"
c9000049,s8,I was using the general public Galaxy Macau WIFI
c9000049,s9,"When I  tried to dine at their restaurants, they told me that our Club Marriott card (preferred dining privilege membership) was NOT honored there, therefore, no discount at all"
c9000049,s10,"For the room, the quilt was too thick…"
c9000050,s1,"Booked the hotel via their website for the ""unlimited urban escape"" package"
c9000050,s2,The package includes complimentary access to JW kids club but my wife and the kid was denied access to the club just because our name was not on their list
c9000050,s3,Finally they have managed to find my booking details but my wife was stuck at the reception for almost 45 mins already
c9000050,s4,"Early check-in, baby crib are not available although requested when booking"
c9000050,s5,"The so-called ""welcoming gift"" also no-show"
c9000050,s6,The only thing good is the breakfast
c9000051,s1,I've always had great experiences with marriott and Ritz
c9000051,s2,"You can see my reviews for jw Marriott Beijing and ritz Kowloon, both amazing properties with great service"
c9000051,s3,Which is why the sheer horror when I stayed at the new jw in Macau
c9000051,s4,Simple things were messed up
c9000051,s5,Asked for a king non smoking
c9000051,s6,They gave me a twin ' non smoking' which still had cigarette smell
c9000051,s7,Non smoking and a freshened smoking room are different!    Asked for wall street journal but they said only Macau and south china morning post
c9000051,s8,Ok fine
c9000051,s9,The latter
c9000051,s10,It never came on both mornings!   Sent two shirts to laundry and clearly ticked 'fold'
c9000051,s11,Why wasn't I surprised when it came back on a hanger!  Called them about it and they gave me a shrug over the phone
c9000051,s12,Shocking
c9000051,s13,Why would Marriott put your…
c9000052,s1,Location - This hotel is newly opened in late May 2015 within the Galaxy complex
c9000052,s2,Reservation - I emailed the hotel and informed them our bed preference prior to our stay as the hotel did not respond to the request I gave to my online booking agent
c9000052,s3,"After over 48 hours, I was told that they could not find my booking"
c9000052,s4,"I called the reservation office, gave them my name and confirmation number but still no record was found"
c9000052,s5,The staff said they could not assist me at all and asked me to contact the booking agent
c9000052,s6,"At least, my booking agent was very helpful, gave them exactly the same information I have given and found my reservation and changed my bed preference to double rooms"
c9000052,s7,Check-in - we arrived at around half 3 and there were 2 groups of guests waiting in front of us
c9000052,s8,I…
