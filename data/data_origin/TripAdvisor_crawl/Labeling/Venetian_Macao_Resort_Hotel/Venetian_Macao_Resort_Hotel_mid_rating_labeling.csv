c2500360,s1,This is our first visit to Macao so we chose to stay at the Venetian,,,,,,,,
c2500360,s2,We arrived there by taking a jet boat from HK,,,,,,,,
c2500360,s3,It took a short trip from HK to Macao; quite convenient,,,,,,,,
c2500360,s4,The custom services did not keep us long,,,,,,,,
c2500360,s5,There was also a hotel bus to picking up and dropping off the hotel's guests,,,,,,,,
c2500360,s6,"When making an entering to the hotel, the lobby was amazing and it was one of the landmarks for photo shooting",,,,,,,,
c2500360,s7,"While waiting for the checking-in service, we were studying the directory of the hotel via a big touch screen machine assisting us to explore all the wings, shops and services offering at the Venetians",,,,,,,,
c2500360,s8,"We were staying in the Bella suite which was grand and huge, it comes with spacious bathroom, two glamorous queen beds, a small living  area and the outdoor space where we could_",,,,,,,,
c2500361,s1,I was rather disappointed with the hotel,,,,,,,,
c2500361,s2,"Stayed 2 nights, and wished i have chosen otherwise",,,,,,,,
c2500361,s3,"Some staff were friendly, but most staff were not, when asked for direction, they sounded so impatient",,,,,,,,
c2500361,s4,"The area is huge, we felt tired walking, after check-im, we have to go from  lobby to 3rd floor, walked like few hundred meter looking for the South Wing, and seems like not many staff around to help",,,,,,,,
c2500361,s5,"Room was slightly dated, bathroom does not have hand-held shower, thus making it very difficult to bath our young son",,,,,,,,
c2500361,s6,"Shuttle buses go to limited places, unlike the other one we stayed a night before",,,,,,,,
c2500361,s7,"When we opened our door room, a guy was doing maintenance work",,,,,,,,
c2500361,s8,"Next day, When we went back to the room after a tiring walk, the door lock was spoilt, and took an hour to fix",,,,,,,,
c2500361,s9,The_,,,,,,,,
c2500362,s1,I went to Macau for 1 day after a trip to Hong Kong and was very disappointed and wished I could have turned back and stayed in Hong Kong for 1 more day,,,,,,,,
c2500362,s2,"Macau is huge, hard to get around, especially in rainy, humid weather and the casinos smelled strongly of cigarette smoke",,,,,,,,
c2500362,s3,The Venecian is a huge resort and was a beautiful place to shop and explore but the rooms were disappointing,,,,,,,,
c2500362,s4,Our room was the cheapest of them all but it was still a GRAND room,,,,,,,,
c2500362,s5,I liked the spacious living areas and the bathroom was huge but everything just seemed run down and old,,,,,,,,
c2500362,s6,"While it was all cleaned well, it just all felt a little musty and overused to me and was not the modern resort I would have preferred",,,,,,,,
c2500362,s7,"If you're after a grand hotel, its great, but if you're after a nice, clean and modern hotel_",,,,,,,,
c2500363,s1,"room is comfy and spacious, facilities are abundant! events and shows are plenty",,,,,,,,
c2500363,s2,Food is okay,,,,,,,,
c2500363,s3,The place is huge and gave an impression that you could get easily lost or at least will be soo tired to walk from one point to the other,,,,,,,,
c2500363,s4,"I don't quite like the decoration and style that is a little too ""fake"" for me",,,,,,,,
c2500363,s5,"I mean, what's the point of riding a gondola inside a hotel?",,,,,,,,
c2500364,s1,Without doubt I have never stayed in a more luxurious room in my life,,,,,,,,
c2500364,s2,Shopping areas casino and food court are all fab,,,,,,,,
c2500364,s3,A few things missing 1) No one to pick up our luggage at the Macau ferry terminal in face we had to put the luggage in the bus our self,,,,,,,,
c2500364,s4,On reaching the hotel I had to go inside and ask for the bell boy to come out outside to the bus no one was there to receive us at the bus when it reached the hotel,,,,,,,,
c2500364,s5,I felt less then welcome on arrival,,,,,,,,
c2500364,s6,2) After breakfast the started arranging the lunch we were still there after our breakfast,,,,,,,,
c2500364,s7,A two year old kid was with us it saw a banana on the lunch buffet he wanted it so we requested the manager the can we please have 1 banana for the kid,,,,,,,,
c2500364,s8,I was shocked when she said no and when she said no she was not polite,,,,,,,,
c2500364,s9,Other_,,,,,,,,
c2500365,s1,We arrived at this Grand looking hotel,,,,,,,,
c2500365,s2,It is positively huge,,,,,,,,
c2500365,s3,We checked in and were given a map to find our room,,,,,,,,
c2500365,s4,We really struggled to find it as this hotel branches off all over the place,,,,,,,,
c2500365,s5,"Our room was nice,besides all the black mould all over our shower, which made me wonder how clean the rest of it was",,,,,,,,
c2500365,s6,We wanted to go out of the hotel and catch the shuttle,,,,,,,,
c2500365,s7,"We got so lost trying to get out, we just returned to our room",,,,,,,,
c2500365,s8,The casino is full of smoke,,,,,,,,
c2500365,s9,Even the non smoking areas stunk of it,,,,,,,,
c2500365,s10,The gambling was very expensive,,,,,,,,
c2500365,s11,The cheapest blackjack was $40 AUD a bet,,,,,,,,
c2500365,s12,We did not find the food hall until the second day,,,,,,,,
c2500365,s13,That was quite good,,,,,,,,
c2500365,s14,It was very beautiful and the false sky on the ceiling was impressive,,,,,,,,
c2500365,s15,Also the Winter light show was amazing,,,,,,,,
c2500365,s16,For breakfast we were told_,,,,,,,,
c2500366,s1,After we stayed for two nights at the Sofitel in Macau we wanted to experience the Venetian for a night,,,,,,,,
c2500366,s2,We booked the Titanic package as we heard it was good,,,,,,,,
c2500366,s3,When we arrived at the West Lobby confusion started immediately,,,,,,,,
c2500366,s4,It was literary swarming with people most of them from various touring companies,,,,,,,,
c2500366,s5,There was no staff to assist us in any way with our luggage,,,,,,,,
c2500366,s6,We entered the West lobby because that seemed to be the most logical approach to follow,,,,,,,,
c2500366,s7,We passed a luggage station and walked about 10 _ 15 minutes to the reception,,,,,,,,
c2500366,s8,This is a huge building,,,,,,,,
c2500366,s9,All that time no staff to assist us in any way,,,,,,,,
c2500366,s10,When we finally got to the West lobby we found out there was no way to check in early,,,,,,,,
c2500366,s11,We approached a staff member and with great difficulty we found out that even though there_,,,,,,,,
c2500367,s1,First impressision is the crowd! My wife literally said are we in a market! No such grand welcome or whatever!  But I had to say I was quite lucky to have a speedy check-in,,,,,,,,
c2500367,s2,"However, I couldn't believe  that I still need to give the Hotel a deposit (through credit card per-athorisation) as a security for the mini bar even I had paid all room rates in advance (obviously good credit standing) and considered that I justed stayed in 4 stars hotel that didn't even bother do the same! It seems the 5 stars hotel is more petty and small-hearted than the 4 stars!  I had to said the room is gorgeous! No complaint about the space, cleanliness & view",,,,,,,,
c2500367,s3,But,,,,,,,,
c2500367,s4,"the big big drawback is no free wifi or Internet connection in the room or hotel lobby! Again, I couldn't believe this considered_",,,,,,,,
c2500368,s1,I have selected this hotel based on recommendation of my friend,,,,,,,,
c2500368,s2,He mentioned that it is unique and good to stay for one night,,,,,,,,
c2500368,s3,"If you would like to go and enjoy Casino and like a gigantic size of hotels, then this may be the one",,,,,,,,
c2500368,s4,"For me and my mother, who usually prefer staying in a small scale hotel and enjoy exploring historic part of the city, it was too far from the main city center",,,,,,,,
c2500368,s5,"The shopping mall attached to this hotel also closed quite early and when we arrived in the hotel in the evening from Hong Kong, we were not able to enjoy shopping",,,,,,,,
c2500368,s6,There is nothing wrong with the hotel but it did not match my usual taste and serve the purpose of my visit to Macao,,,,,,,,
c2500369,s1,We spent a night here on a recent Asia vacation for a little R&R,,,,,,,,
c2500369,s2,"Huge disappointment for any Vegas fan - imagine a Vegas casino, which looks remarkably like its Vegas equivalent, especially in the lobby; but without any of the partying, drinking, noise making or general raucous fun",,,,,,,,
c2500369,s3,"The casino is quiet apart from the sounds of the machines, the gambling crowd is quiet and serious, and there was only one small bar in the entire casino floor",,,,,,,,
c2500369,s4,"The rooms are comfortable and clean, and again very similar to the Vegas ones",,,,,,,,
c2500369,s5,"The casino runs a bus from the Hong Kong ferry terminal, so its easy to get there",,,,,,,,
c2500369,s6,"It does have a Starbucks, thank goodness",,,,,,,,
c2500369,s7,"Better still, its open 24 hours if you have jet-lag",,,,,,,,
c2500369,s8,"Talking of jet-lag (or not), the gambling clientele apparently sleeps the night on_",,,,,,,,
c2500370,s1,"My husband brought me for a weekend birthday stay at the Venetian - we love the one in Vegas, and the Venetian Macau certainly is up to the mark",,,,,,,,
c2500370,s2,"We especially enjoyed the ""birthday surprise"" arranged by the Venetian - theymade us feel very special",,,,,,,,
c2500370,s3,no complaints as regards the room and the service,,,,,,,,
c2500370,s4,"My only complaint is that the room, pillows, duvet and sofa had a very stale smoke smell, which just wouldn't go away - even on a non-smoking floor",,,,,,,,
c2500370,s5,An air purifier would have been helpful,,,,,,,,
c2500370,s6,"The stale smoke smell in the rooms has slightly put us off the Venetian, and not sure whether we will perhaps try another hotel the next time we are there",,,,,,,,
c2500370,s7,"Other than that, or it you are a smoker, go for it!",,,,,,,,
c2500371,s1,My husband and I stayed here for part of our honeymoon,,,,,,,,
c2500371,s2,The place is absolutely enormous,,,,,,,,
c2500371,s3,"So big that we didn't even bother going down to the pools, they were just too far away",,,,,,,,
c2500371,s4,"Our room was large, with a huge bathroom, and a separate sitting room and a great view",,,,,,,,
c2500371,s5,"However, the service was somewhat lacking, it was almost as if the real interest of the hotel is the casino, and the hotel guests are just an afterthought",,,,,,,,
c2500371,s6,"We found the smoking in the casino quite off putting, as you often had to go through there to get to where you wanted to be",,,,,,,,
c2500371,s7,"Also, there is almost no natural light in the hotel lobby and other areas, which can be quiet disorienting",,,,,,,,
c2500371,s8,"There are numerous restaurants and food outlets, and a whole shopping mall in the centre",,,,,,,,
c2500371,s9,These were busy most of the time that we_,,,,,,,,
c2500372,s1,We stayed in Macau just to see how it had progressed as part of our honeymoon,,,,,,,,
c2500372,s2,We thought The Venetian would be a great place to stay based on TA reviews,,,,,,,,
c2500372,s3,"The hotel itself was fine, but as others have mentioned - a massive confusing rabbit warren",,,,,,,,
c2500372,s4,We tried to find the gym - walked about 800 metres and gave up,,,,,,,,
c2500372,s5,"If you're looking for night life and ease of getting around, this is not the place to stay",,,,,,,,
c2500372,s6,Macau is certainly no Vegas,,,,,,,,
c2500372,s7,"If you're more into seeing the city and wandering around at night (which we were) you are far better off staying over on the other side, near Nam Vang lake",,,,,,,,
c2500372,s8,The Venetian was only really accessible by taxi or shuttle bus,,,,,,,,
c2500372,s9,"If you do stay here, it is worth going to North - a fabulous restaurant",,,,,,,,
c2500373,s1,"We stayed at the Venetian for 1 night, just to experience the craziness of Macau and it's casinos as these huge hotels are not our style",,,,,,,,
c2500373,s2,"For such a huge hotel they are able to maintain very friendly and personal service, I was impressed",,,,,,,,
c2500373,s3,But for the rest you feel like cattle,,,,,,,,
c2500373,s4,It starts with the complimentary shuttle bus where you stand in line as cattle to be driven into the bus,,,,,,,,
c2500373,s5,At the hotel you are in line to check in,,,,,,,,
c2500373,s6,But they are very fast and efficient,,,,,,,,
c2500373,s7,"However they forgot to include our 6-year old in the reservation even though I made a note on the online booking form and when receiving the booking confo without the 6-yr old, sending another email",,,,,,,,
c2500373,s8,There was nothing in the system: amazing,,,,,,,,
c2500373,s9,"Anyway, the guy from reception fixed it within 10 minutes and we could proceed to_",,,,,,,,
c2500374,s1,I chose to stay at venetian hotel even though i have read about bad reviews bec i was traveling with 2 kids,,,,,,,,
c2500374,s2,the advantage is that the bella suite has 2 queen size beds that can easily accommodate a family of four,,,,,,,,
c2500374,s3,"my first tip is this, if u want to save money u can get the cotai room that has only 1 king size bed bec every room has a pull out  sofa bed that is queen in size, just ask them to prepare it for you, they will provide all the trimmings like pillows, bed sheets and blankets",,,,,,,,
c2500374,s4,"2nd tip is this, the food at cafe' deco is horrible, i can't believe a 5 star hotel serves that kind of food! yuck! anyway u have 3 restaurant options of free breakfast or lunch",,,,,,,,
c2500374,s5,so make sure u eat at Bambu restaurant,,,,,,,,
c2500374,s6,food there is delicious and clean,,,,,,,,
c2500374,s7,"just look it ask for direction, it's worth_",,,,,,,,
c2500375,s1,I never understood the hubbub surrounding The Venetian Macao until I finally stayed there a few days ago,,,,,,,,
c2500375,s2,"Upon entering the hotel, the first word that came to mind was ""excess",,,,,,,,
c2500375,s3,""" Everything was meant to be over the top",,,,,,,,
c2500375,s4,This is like a country in itself,,,,,,,,
c2500375,s5,"As another reviewer noted, once there, you never have to leave",,,,,,,,
c2500375,s6,"It is hard even if you tried, as you can literally get lost among the hallways, fake canals and endless shops here",,,,,,,,
c2500375,s7,"The place reminds me of a grand bus terminal, albeit a luxury one",,,,,,,,
c2500375,s8,"If you want peace and quiet, this place ain't it",,,,,,,,
c2500375,s9,"Actually, the whole of Macau ain't it",,,,,,,,
c2500375,s10,You need good walking shoes as you will do a fair amount of walking when at The Venetian,,,,,,,,
c2500375,s11,"The hotel side of the complex is nothing extraordinary, with decoration and architecture that are more_",,,,,,,,
c2500376,s1,A massive hotel,,,,,,,,
c2500376,s2,Huge long long walk from the elevator to your room,,,,,,,,
c2500376,s3,but the room was always spotless,,,,,,,,
c2500376,s4,They must have an army of staff,,,,,,,,
c2500376,s5,Shame the reception staff don't speak English,,,,,,,,
c2500376,s6,This hotel has everything you can imagine,,,,,,,,
c2500376,s7,If you stay here you will never have to leave,,,,,,,,
c2500376,s8,The shopping centre has not one but three indoor canals you can float down to look at the latest sales and if you have any money left you can go gamble in the world largest casino,,,,,,,,
c2500376,s9,Not the best hotel but always a great time,,,,,,,,
c2500376,s10,If you do want all the benefits of the Venetian but a far superior service stay at the four seasons which is connected to the Venetian development,,,,,,,,
c2500377,s1,Was there for sightseeing and window shopping,,,,,,,,
c2500377,s2,Did not stay@ the hotel,,,,,,,,
c2500377,s3,Free shuttle bus from the jetty,,,,,,,,
c2500377,s4,Remarkable design to have man-made canal,,,,,,,,
c2500377,s5,"Many shops along the canal, but mainly were high-end stuffs, There were singing performances on and off during certain timings",,,,,,,,
c2500377,s6,"Took a boat ride in the canal, and the boatman was entertaining, informative and friendly",,,,,,,,
c2500377,s7,He sang a couple of songs on the boat during the (appox?) 15 + boat ride,,,,,,,,
c2500377,s8,However the ticket purchasing process can be improved much better,,,,,,,,
c2500377,s9,"We were in front of the queue@ one of the booths stationed along the walking paths, but the staff allowed an English speaking person to purchase 1st? (spoke mandarin to the staff)",,,,,,,,
c2500377,s10,She ignored me after i told her we were ahead of the english speaking person (nothing against this_,,,,,,,,
c2500378,s1,"Hi,  I travelled to Macau with family during mid Nov '12 and had a pre-booking at The Venetian Hotel and Resort for 2 nights",,,,,,,,
c2500378,s2,"As I had read many reviews, I was looking forward to a grand hotel with excellent rooms and comparable service",,,,,,,,
c2500378,s3,While staying there for 2 days I realized that its more hype than actual experience you can get for such a pricey hotel,,,,,,,,
c2500378,s4,"Check in was quick with not much problems however, they do ask you for a large deposit at check in",,,,,,,,
c2500378,s5,"This was despite full payment already been made in advance! As it is a grand property, it takes you some time to figure out the way to your rooms",,,,,,,,
c2500378,s6,I was pleased to see a large room with two separated sections,,,,,,,,
c2500378,s7,"Though slightly disappointed that the room was called a ""suite""",,,,,,,,
c2500378,s8,It had all the key ingredients that you can expect_,,,,,,,,
c2500379,s1,Stayed at the Venetian recently as it was greatly recommended by our travel agent,,,,,,,,
c2500379,s2,"Very impressive hotel, but the bad service at the very start of our stay put us totally off",,,,,,,,
c2500379,s3,"We got to Macau from Hong Kong on the ferry, and took the free shuttle bus to the hotel",,,,,,,,
c2500379,s4,"There was no one to help us with the baggage at the bus, and we were dropped off at the west lobby, and had to lug out bags over the soft carpet for quite a bit to the check in counter",,,,,,,,
c2500379,s5,"Check in was pretty much ok, however when we asked for our bags to be sent to our room, we were informed that it would take over an hour for the same",,,,,,,,
c2500379,s6,We were allotted a suite in the north block and the check in for the same is at a fair bit of distance involving a long walk lugging your own luggage,,,,,,,,
c2500379,s7,"Rooms are well appointed, spacious,_",,,,,,,,
c2500380,s1,I was stayed in Venetian resort @ OCT 2012,,,,,,,,
c2500380,s2,it was very over crowded because there is a big shopping mall and very big casino also,,,,,,,,
c2500380,s3,I was booked one suit,,,,,,,,
c2500380,s4,"No breakfast include, no fruit basket, no complimentary drinking water",,,,,,,,
c2500380,s5,"Staff not helpful, Room is neat and tidy",,,,,,,,
c2500380,s6,Not proffered for family/ business,,,,,,,,
c2500380,s7,I cannot prefer this hotel,,,,,,,,
c2500381,s1,this hotel is landmark of macau but for family this hotel is not good,,,,,,,,
c2500381,s2,no indian breakfast,,,,,,,,
c2500381,s3,"as advertised, there was no entertainment activities",,,,,,,,
c2500381,s4,room service was very poor,,,,,,,,
c2500381,s5,rooms were excellent and spacious,,,,,,,,
c2500382,s1,Venetian is for sue a symbol of the new Strip in Macau,,,,,,,,
c2500382,s2,"The first to come and still proposing a very interesting integrated resort with a huge shopping center, nice casino (if you gamble, I don't) and nice rooms",,,,,,,,
c2500382,s3,"I've been at Venetian many times, but I've to say the place is getting old, and would need some more care and maintenance",,,,,,,,
c2500382,s4,"The rooms are still fit and nice, but the corridors have dirty carpets, scratches on the wall and are not really nicely lit",,,,,,,,
c2500382,s5,"Being an All-Suite hotel, the normal suite are very nice, and at reasonable price, but the options for something better are really limited",,,,,,,,
c2500382,s6,"The Rialto suite are large, but kind of empty, and while the normal rooms are classy, the others sway quickly into tacky",,,,,,,,
c2500382,s7,"Around, there are much better option for nicer_",,,,,,,,
c2500383,s1,Check in on 13 November 2012  The Macau ferry terminal had a nice free of charge bus pick up to the hotel which was a nice thought,,,,,,,,
c2500383,s2,The check in process was smooth and the staff assisted us well,,,,,,,,
c2500383,s3,One cannot pass the casino floors with the luggage and the other way to rooms is quite lousy,,,,,,,,
c2500383,s4,"Anyways, now its time for the grand moment 'enter the room' and its a beautiful paradise",,,,,,,,
c2500383,s5,Such nice and comfortable and elegant rooms - wow! I wish the same for my house room,,,,,,,,
c2500383,s6,"And the bathrooms, even more wonderful; excellent choice of fitting and colors",,,,,,,,
c2500383,s7,I HAD ONE OF THE BEST SLEEPS AT THIS HOTEL,,,,,,,,
c2500383,s8,As we checked in the afternoon 2 pm we dropped our bags and went for lunch finding something vegetarian to eat,,,,,,,,
c2500383,s9,There's a large food court on the 3rd floor and offers a nice variety,,,,,,,,
c2500383,s10,I normally_,,,,,,,,
c2500384,s1,"The people outside is speaking chinesse language or kongfu, soo its very difficult if you cant speak, although their face is western, they are totally cant speak english",,,,,,,,
c2500384,s2,"This place not a building, i think its other world",,,,,,,,
c2500384,s3,"Because its always sunny, they paint the sky just like the same blue sky",,,,,,,,
c2500384,s4,"You cant figure it out, where is the window of this building",,,,,,,,
c2500384,s5,"This place very suitable for honeymooners, because its soo romantic, the background for take a photo very amazing",,,,,,,,
c2500384,s6,"I think one week is not enough to explore, for the  first time, i think its soo confusing, because this hotel always crowded and they have two different side of reception, For group and family",,,,,,,,
c2500385,s1,I was there for the UFC fight,,,,,,,,
c2500385,s2,"The complex is gigantic, opulently designed with all sorts of fake murals, pseudo venice touches etc but has a distinct sort of fast food-ish touch",,,,,,,,
c2500385,s3,"Total overkill in terms of size and fake gold, very easy to get lost, you can probably spend a week in there not seeing a single ray of sunlight",,,,,,,,
c2500385,s4,"Size of rooms probably ok but overall I wouldn't consider this top end, it's a death star of a hotel but lacks all charm",,,,,,,,
c2500385,s5,"The restaurant we went (Old Neptune or something) was well below average, utterly westernized kind of Cantonese food, same as you get everywhere on the planet",,,,,,,,
c2500385,s6,"except in Guangdong, until I had a dinner there, and for premium price",,,,,,,,
c2500385,s7,"Any 5 star Hong Kong hotel's restaurant (and in fact, hotel, except maybe for room size) beats it by a_",,,,,,,,
c2500386,s1,the largest hotel in the world,,,,,,,,
c2500386,s2,"attended a conference, for the second time there",,,,,,,,
c2500386,s3,large suites with complete amenities; hotel has dozens of decent to good restaurants and bars,,,,,,,,
c2500386,s4,"it is just way too large to enjoy; walking from end to the other takes an hour, and signs are either non-existent or confusing",,,,,,,,
c2500387,s1,"We (family of 4 plus a toddler) stayed here for 2 nights in Nov 12 and loved our rooms very much! The bathroom is spacious, the room suite had a living area with separate TV, sofa and work desk",,,,,,,,
c2500387,s2,The only complaint we had was the detour we had to take everyday when we need to walk to the shuttle bus/taxi area,,,,,,,,
c2500387,s3,The shortest route was via the casino but they disallow my toddler entry,,,,,,,,
c2500387,s4,"Hence we had to walk a longer way that takes about 15mins-20mins, which is very tiring, especially at the end of the day",,,,,,,,
c2500387,s5,"We hope the next time we return to The Venetian, there is a direct access way to the taxi/bus area for families with kids",,,,,,,,
c2500388,s1,"i visited this place with family , My experience says never stay in such big hotel that reaching to room you have walk a lot , Good couples , Have nice bathroom and good interior",,,,,,,,
c2500388,s2,But so many people in hotel too crowded at food court,,,,,,,,
c2500388,s3,all things you see are artificial,,,,,,,,
c2500388,s4,for every activity need to pay,,,,,,,,
c2500388,s5,If you go in group then you might feel better,,,,,,,,
c2500389,s1,"Getting There  When we arrived at the Macau ferry terminal, the Venetian staff told us to cross over to the other side of the road to take the Venetian shuttle bus",,,,,,,,
c2500389,s2,No assistance was provided to help us with our luggage,,,,,,,,
c2500389,s3,"We had to take the lift to get to the underpass, cross the underpass and the take the lift up to street level again",,,,,,,,
c2500389,s4,The Venetian shuttle bus was parked right at the end of the other hotels' shuttle buses,,,,,,,,
c2500389,s5,My friend and I each had a luggage,,,,,,,,
c2500389,s6,Mine was a big one,,,,,,,,
c2500389,s7,"When we reached the Venetian shuttle bus, the staff at the counter did not offer to help us with the luggage until I asked him to",,,,,,,,
c2500389,s8,He gave us an unfriendly look,,,,,,,,
c2500389,s9,Check-In  We arrived at Venetian__ West Lobby,,,,,,,,
c2500389,s10,"The staff told us to go to another check-in lobby as the west lobby is expecting a big ""Indian""_",,,,,,,,
c2500390,s1,We stayed a day by hotel promotion,,,,,,,,
c2500390,s2,I have a lot of expectations in the first,,,,,,,,
c2500390,s3,"But we requested a non-smoking room when booking, but the cigarette smell in the room, then moved to the room",,,,,,,,
c2500390,s4,But it was same,,,,,,,,
c2500390,s5,"Noticed the floor is non-smoking, but a lot of the smell of cigarettes",,,,,,,,
c2500390,s6,The pool facilities were good,,,,,,,,
c2500390,s7,We played in the pool all afternoon,,,,,,,,
c2500390,s8,Gondola price was too expensive,,,,,,,,
c2500390,s9,The mini golf course was a lot of fun too,,,,,,,,
c2500390,s10,Go to one place only once,,,,,,,,
c2500390,s11,Venetian Macao hotel is well worth a visit,,,,,,,,
c2500390,s12,but only once!,,,,,,,,
c2500391,s1,The stay at the Venetian Macao was not what I expected,,,,,,,,
c2500391,s2,"The hotel is so huge, it is a small city in itself",,,,,,,,
c2500391,s3,There is a huge casino downstairs and it is very much Las Vegas style,,,,,,,,
c2500391,s4,I liked the Grande Canale Shopping center on the third floor with gondolas and lots of little boutiques to wander around,,,,,,,,
c2500391,s5,The suites are very nice and huge,,,,,,,,
c2500391,s6,"Just those little things are missing that makes it a real hight end hotel except for the price like laundry bags in the room, shoe shine and some other small stuff",,,,,,,,
c2500391,s7,Also that for such a big hotel you have to pay for the sauna/steam facilities as they are run by the attached clinic,,,,,,,,
c2500391,s8,The gym is actually in a suite room and therefore quite small,,,,,,,,
c2500391,s9,I also had some problems with the cardio machines as the bikes did not hold the resistance etc,,,,,,,,
c2500391,s10,Another_,,,,,,,,
c2500392,s1,It is humungous with 3000 rooms and great if you are a casino fan,,,,,,,,
c2500392,s2,Personally i did not like it much as it was fairly impersonal and lacked character,,,,,,,,
c2500392,s3,"But lets face it, if you are looking to gamble and stay at a property that is increasingly becoming iconic and representative of Macao, you must stay a night at the Venetian",,,,,,,,
c2500392,s4,Be careful of the ferry timings for HKIA as they are not as frequent as mainland ferries and i almost missed my flight,,,,,,,,
c2500393,s1,There was a big line at Check-In and Check-Out,,,,,,,,
c2500393,s2,The check-in was not comfortable,,,,,,,,
c2500393,s3,The rooms are very spacious,,,,,,,,
c2500393,s4,The Zaia Show is also good,,,,,,,,
c2500393,s5,The shopping experience and a lot other activities to do make it a must visit,,,,,,,,
c2500393,s6,The Casino is Huge,,,,,,,,
c2500393,s7,The Breakfast Buffet is not too wonderful as it also had a line,,,,,,,,
c2500393,s8,The Hotel can definitely do something about the Rush,,,,,,,,
c2500394,s1,"Me and my GF recently stayed at the Venetian Macao for two days during a trip to HK, Macao and China",,,,,,,,
c2500394,s2,"We took the ferry to the Macao Port and then got on one of the free shuttle buses that the hotel lay on - they do not appear to run on a time schedule, rather as soon as one is full this departs and then another one in the pool area they have at the ferry port comes to the boarding bay which works well - the buses are full size and luggage can be stored at the bottom of the bus",,,,,,,,
c2500394,s3,The bus then took the 20 min trip to the hotel,,,,,,,,
c2500394,s4,"On arrival which was 14:00 on a Monday afternoon we found the situation chaotic, there were people everywhere! I understand this is an extremely popular resort, but you could not move, especially with baggage! Anyhow after 10 minutes of stress we found_",,,,,,,,
c2500395,s1,I reserved this hotel via agoda,,,,,,,,
c2500395,s2,com and fully paid,,,,,,,,
c2500395,s3,"Though, at the arrival time, front desk insisted that I have to pay 3,000 hong kong dollars for deposit",,,,,,,,
c2500395,s4,"This was quite a awkward situation for me since I paid almost 7,000 HKD with agoda",,,,,,,,
c2500395,s5,com already,,,,,,,,
c2500395,s6,"However, the hotel facilities and rooms are impressive and huge",,,,,,,,
c2500395,s7,"The location is  near the Macau airport, and love that they have shuttle bus waiting for me there",,,,,,,,
c2500396,s1,"So, I got upgraded to Venetian Resort since Holiday Inn was overbooked (as they both belong to the same company)",,,,,,,,
c2500396,s2,"Well, in my opinion I kinda feel I was downgraded",,,,,,,,
c2500396,s3,Entering the hotel from the west lobby was just surprising,,,,,,,,
c2500396,s4,I have never seen such many people in hotel lobby in my life,,,,,,,,
c2500396,s5,"I understand that Venetian is also a tourists attraction, but the management needs to look into it as it was simply stressful",,,,,,,,
c2500396,s6,Luckily our check-in process went quite smooth,,,,,,,,
c2500396,s7,"The front desk staff, Jackson was really nice and did everything in a timely manner",,,,,,,,
c2500396,s8,"I asked for room on higher floor, however the only available high floor room at that time was located at the end of the corridor, which I agreed to take",,,,,,,,
c2500396,s9,"And believe me, it was a big mistake",,,,,,,,
c2500396,s10,I believe I walked more than 1 km to go to my_,,,,,,,,
c2500397,s1,"Spent four days here, the best part of this hotel is the size of the rooms, I feel this time the hotel is showing signs of not caring so much",,,,,,,,
c2500397,s2,"Check in was good, check out terrible",,,,,,,,
c2500397,s3,"Beakfast was good but expensive and if you want Wi Fi in your room they charge $20 a day, unrealistic and something they should look at",,,,,,,,
c2500397,s4,If you play the poker machines near the South lobby at night the place is full of prostitutes and pimps or you keep getting approached by people who want to put their promotions card in your machine,,,,,,,,
c2500397,s5,"Next time would stay somewhere else, which is a shame as this was a very nice hotel",,,,,,,,
c2500398,s1,Stayed in Venetian with wife and my one year old baby girl for 3 nights from 05 - 08 Aug,,,,,,,,
c2500398,s2,Not the first time staying in Venetian hence the wow factor was no longer there,,,,,,,,
c2500398,s3,"As I guest of the hotel, I did not really felt any personal services as the hotel is so big with thousand of rooms and we are just another customer",,,,,,,,
c2500398,s4,Nothing was complimentary in the hotel,,,,,,,,
c2500398,s5,"If you want internet, you pay HKD 160+ a day",,,,,,,,
c2500398,s6,"Room look clean when we checked in but once I start crawling with my baby on the carpet, I can feel that the carpet was dusty and can see black and dusty patch on my as well as my baby kneels",,,,,,,,
c2500398,s7,Facilities in the room also started to look old,,,,,,,,
c2500398,s8,LCD TV in front of the bed is only 37 inch and TV in front of the sofa was only 25 or 29 inch and was not even a LCD TV,,,,,,,,
c2500398,s9,Traveling in and out_,,,,,,,,
c2500399,s1,I have for the longest time reluctant to stay in this property because of I have heard numerous bad comments about it,,,,,,,,
c2500399,s2,This time we went with a big group hence no choice of us staying in another hotel,,,,,,,,
c2500399,s3,"As soon as you entered into the property, you will see long lines of people waiting for different free shuttles to different destination within the city",,,,,,,,
c2500399,s4,It is literally like a crowded bus station,,,,,,,,
c2500399,s5,"As expected, from then on, we encountered endless flow of people wherever we go",,,,,,,,
c2500399,s6,"I was pleasantly surprised that our suite is very spacious, nicely decorated in Venetian style, although not my cup of tea",,,,,,,,
c2500399,s7,I particularly like the dresser in the large bathroom,,,,,,,,
c2500399,s8,You got your hairdryer there and even a lighted mirror for putting on your make-up,,,,,,,,
c2500399,s9,It would be best to have a ventilation_,,,,,,,,
c2500400,s1,In Sept 2011 I was invited to stay in  this hotel on our trip from Taiwan to Hongkong and Macau,,,,,,,,
c2500400,s2,"Luxurious , but too crowded",,,,,,,,
c2500400,s3,We needed to  wait 30 min to check in,,,,,,,,
c2500400,s4,Food is average,,,,,,,,
c2500400,s5,Artifical made world for all who wish to throw money out of then window,,,,,,,,
c2500401,s1,This resort is pretty spacious,,,,,,,,
c2500401,s2,The main lobby is gorgeous,,,,,,,,
c2500401,s3,"You can do shopping from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm, and have meal until 11:30 pm",,,,,,,,
c2500401,s4,We booked a Bella suie to stay,,,,,,,,
c2500401,s5,The space of the room is also commodious and the view is nice,,,,,,,,
c2500401,s6,I booked a non-smoking room,,,,,,,,
c2500401,s7,"What a pity, the room is smoky",,,,,,,,
c2500401,s8,There are too many people smoke in this hotel,,,,,,,,
c2500401,s9,It makes me feel uncomfortable,,,,,,,,
c2500401,s10,And the staff service seems needs to be trained except staffs in the main lobby,,,,,,,,
c2500401,s11,I won't live in this hotel again if I go to Macau,,,,,,,,
c2500401,s12,You can have other better choices,,,,,,,,
c2500402,s1,"Please dont carry big bags to macau, leave big bags at HK hotel or at airport",,,,,,,,
c2500402,s2,the cotaijet ferry does not have provison to check in bags,,,,,,,,
c2500402,s3,Ferry pier staff is very rude compared to other hotel staff present there,,,,,,,,
c2500402,s4,conceirge was hesitating to take bags to room as was trying to disuade by saying will take 30min to reach room,,,,,,,,
c2500402,s5,check in took a long time,,,,,,,,
c2500402,s6,But the room was just amazing with great views,,,,,,,,
c2500402,s7,the size was also great,,,,,,,,
c2500402,s8,"The pool was outstanding, they had 4 different big pools",,,,,,,,
c2500402,s9,"the casino is fun but lots of machine games are in chinese, which is a problem",,,,,,,,
c2500402,s10,the food is very expensive in the hotel & even the hotel mall food court & restaraunts,,,,,,,,
c2500402,s11,Shoping is also killer expensive,,,,,,,,
c2500403,s1,Our family stayed in The Venetian early this month (July 2012) as my daughter watched a concert held in the hotel arena,,,,,,,,
c2500403,s2,"The check-in is pretty chaotic, the place was huge, I mean huge and for its worth, there is nowhere to sit while my husband do the necessities checking us in, can't understand this as the place is spacious and a few sofas around would not clutter the place, I've never seen a hotel lobby with nowhere to sit",,,,,,,,
c2500403,s3,"We are a bit strained for waiting about 20mins to be checked-in, and we're in our 40's, what would it be like for senior guests",,,,,,,,
c2500403,s4,"Checking was done, we need a map to find the lift lobby, and this is not exhageration as the place is massive",,,,,,,,
c2500403,s5,We have to wait one and half hour for our luggage to be sent to our room,,,,,,,,
c2500403,s6,"The room was impressive, spacious and_",,,,,,,,
c2500404,s1,I stayed one night in July 2012,,,,,,,,
c2500404,s2,It's my first time here,,,,,,,,
c2500404,s3,The hotel is getting old by ages,,,,,,,,
c2500404,s4,Room is spacious but bedsheet and blanket had bad smell and the hotel is too crowded,,,,,,,,
c2500404,s5,"However, their service is excellent with prompt action whenever we requested something",,,,,,,,
c2500404,s6,"Moreover, they gave a birthday cake to my firend because we checked in on her birthday",,,,,,,,
c2500404,s7,We were appreciated,,,,,,,,
c2500405,s1,This hotel was ok,,,,,,,,
c2500405,s2,To be honest I was expecting the same quality as the MGM grand in Vegas and I was disappointed with the Venetian,,,,,,,,
c2500405,s3,The hotel is so massive it takes you ages to get back to your room and it's so incredibly busy that it makes it hard to move around,,,,,,,,
c2500405,s4,The free shuttle bus from the Macau ferry terminal dropped us off at the back of the hotel and it took us 30 minutes to find the main lobby reception desk,,,,,,,,
c2500405,s5,It was very annoying,,,,,,,,
c2500405,s6,There is no real customer service here and you kind of feel like you are renting a room above a shopping centre,,,,,,,,
c2500405,s7,The island doesn't really have many attractions other than shopping and gambling so if you are interested in that then you will like it,,,,,,,,
c2500406,s1,"On our recent business trip to Australia and Hongkong , we had a weekend to spend , so thought of going to Macau",,,,,,,,
c2500406,s2,"Our travel agent booked a royal suite at Hotel Venetian as this seems to be the most popular hotel with people from India ! Ferry trip from Hongkong to Macau was average but the facilites are dated and one had to wait for quite a whle at the Macau ferry terminal to get the baggage ! Coach service to the hotel was good but the moment you enter the hotel , the size of the properry and the number of people at any point of time hits you",,,,,,,,
c2500406,s3,It was a long walk to the check in counters ( staff was efficient though  ) and another long walk to the room ! Royal sute was very spacious with a huge seperate sitting area and well designed and maintained,,,,,,,,
c2500406,s4,The hotel is a city by_,,,,,,,,
c2500407,s1,I stayed at the Venetian as part of a family holiday with my in-laws,,,,,,,,
c2500407,s2,We booked 5 rooms and requested that they were as close to each other as possible,,,,,,,,
c2500407,s3,"The staff requested that we wait an hour for them to arrange it, which we were ok with and went off to get lunch",,,,,,,,
c2500407,s4,An hour and half later they had nay 4 rooms ready out of which one had the wrong bed,,,,,,,,
c2500407,s5,When the bellboy came up with our bags he gave us attitude saying he would drop all our luggage to one room instead of to each of the 5 rooms even though we had said that we would accompany him to each room to help allocate the luggage,,,,,,,,
c2500407,s6,I have never seen such appalling service,,,,,,,,
c2500407,s7,We had requested for a late checkout which was fine by the hotel but then the bellboy came up at the time of normal checkout and took my parents-in law's_,,,,,,,,
c2500408,s1,The place was ridiculously huge and over the top,,,,,,,,
c2500408,s2,"The room was great, as expected",,,,,,,,
c2500408,s3,It's just too bad you won't get to spend a lot of time in your room except maybe to sleep,,,,,,,,
c2500408,s4,The shopping was awesome,,,,,,,,
c2500408,s5,"It was relatively cheaper than in SG, Malaysia or in the Philippines",,,,,,,,
c2500408,s6,But i can't say the same thing for the food,,,,,,,,
c2500408,s7,It was a lot more expensive than in other asian countries,,,,,,,,
c2500408,s8,There was definitely a lot of things you can do around the venetian and there's a lot of things to keep you busy - if you know where to go,,,,,,,,
c2500408,s9,That was our problem,,,,,,,,
c2500408,s10,We were busy alright,,,,,,,,
c2500408,s11,we spent almost half of the time navigating ourselves through the place,,,,,,,,
c2500408,s12,Can you imagine? We spent 3 days and 2 nights at the Venetian and I NEVER GOT TO SEE THE POOL BECAUSE WE COULDNT FIND IT,,,,,,,,
c2500408,s13,:(   No matter how hard we_,,,,,,,,
c2500409,s1,Huge and big Rooms,,,,,,,,
c2500409,s2,"we stayed in Cotai view Bella suite, which is in two level",,,,,,,,
c2500409,s3,The towels and toiletries are of inferior quality,,,,,,,,
c2500409,s4,The towels are worn out and are not of quality to use,,,,,,,,
c2500409,s5,Same goes for the bath robe,,,,,,,,
c2500409,s6,they are in pathetic state,,,,,,,,
c2500409,s7,"Its a colossal and gigantic hotel, with lots of shopping arcades, cafes, restaurants, and the biggest & best casino in macau",,,,,,,,
c2500409,s8,"You will definitely get lost atleast more than once during your stay, We got lost twice in 24Hrs",,,,,,,,
c2500409,s9,"Its in Taipa Island, you can take a evening stroll in the famous Cotai Strip and enjoy the views( My personal advice is to stay in Macau main Island )If this Hotel is Huge then GALAXY next Door is mountainous, astronomical and giant of a Hotel and deinitely more breathtaking",,,,,,,,
c2500409,s10,The work on the Ceilings in Venetian is a_,,,,,,,,
c2500410,s1,"Still great rooms but they miss maintenance, typical Chinese operation ?  service was good at the desk and the negative part was that several restaurants were closed, even during lunch time",,,,,,,,
c2500410,s2,next time other location,,,,,,,,
c2500411,s1,It was so many people and the hotel was so huge,,,,,,,,
c2500411,s2,"Everything quite good, but not recommended for those who don't like the environment full with crowd",,,,,,,,
c2500411,s3,The quality of staffs are quite good but I think can be better as a 5 stars grand hotel,,,,,,,,
c2500412,s1,It can best fall under the category 'attractions' and not a hotel,,,,,,,,
c2500412,s2,"Like any attraction, it takes over two days to explore the place, it is so huge",,,,,,,,
c2500412,s3,"Having stayed in Las Vegas; at MGM and Venetian in the past, this stay came with a fore warning that unlike any other hotel where you are treated like God, staying here will be at one's own peril so to say",,,,,,,,
c2500412,s4,"If one desires to use each of the facilities offered, even a weeks stay will not be enough",,,,,,,,
c2500412,s5,The suites are elegantly designed but upkeep is lacking,,,,,,,,
c2500412,s6,"The housekeeping is excellent, though",,,,,,,,
c2500412,s7,The bed is not comfortable and the Aircon seems to be under capacity as cooling was not good enough,,,,,,,,
c2500412,s8,Bathroom amenities are basic,,,,,,,,
c2500412,s9,"Has a fabulous shopping on the 3rd level, with dining options on 1st and 3rd levels",,,,,,,,
c2500412,s10,The staff is extremely_,,,,,,,,
c2500413,s1,Its sooooooo crowded and its like a fish market,,,,,,,,
c2500413,s2,The hotel is huge and there are attractions inside the hotel,,,,,,,,
c2500413,s3,The rooms are big,,,,,,,,
c2500413,s4,"But such a popular hotel, is so crowded",,,,,,,,
c2500413,s5,The casino is also crowded,,,,,,,,
c2500413,s6,Very expensive and branded stores inside,,,,,,,,
c2500413,s7,Take the gondola ride inside the hotel,,,,,,,,
c2500414,s1,Stayed for 2 nights earlier this month on my second visit to the Venetian Macau,,,,,,,,
c2500414,s2,The service seems to have detereoriated since my last visit in 2010,,,,,,,,
c2500414,s3,The hotel is as magnificient as I recall it to be with lots of eating and shopping choices,,,,,,,,
c2500414,s4,The suites are huge and one person in our party had a rialto suite which was awesome,,,,,,,,
c2500414,s5,We tried a few restaurants in the shopping area and also some at the hotel and at the four seasons attached to it and found food and service at the restaurants to be of a high standard,,,,,,,,
c2500414,s6,2 friends tried the spa and found the therapists to be very good; apparently all of them are qualified physiotherapy diploma holders,,,,,,,,
c2500414,s7,"However, the hotel service let us down",,,,,,,,
c2500414,s8,I found some dirt and dust in some lesser used corners of the suite,,,,,,,,
c2500414,s9,"Also, I found the drinking_",,,,,,,,
c2500415,s1,Stayed 2 nights during last weekend in the Venetian (or the Disney Land for gamblers!),,,,,,,,
c2500415,s2,Very mixed feelings,,,,,,,,
c2500415,s3,Many many good things but,,,,,,,,
c2500415,s4,"Anyway, in a nutshell:  Good things: - You feel like you are really in Venice",,,,,,,,
c2500415,s5,I've been twice to Venice and I must say it's very impressive with an incredible attention to details!!!!   - The Suite (there are no rooms plz!) is really WOW,,,,,,,,
c2500415,s6,Simply loved it!  - Location in the heart of the new strip of the future Las Vegas!  - Shopping Center: all the brands you could imagine are there! - Smoking (yes I am a smoker!): you can smoke almost anywhere in this huge hotel (3000Suites!) - Funny: I am not a gambler but it was a very funny experience,,,,,,,,
c2500415,s7,You sit on a table with lots of chinese,,,,,,,,
c2500415,s8,They are sooooooooooo serious and me I don't care_,,,,,,,,
c2500416,s1,My wife and I spent one night at the Venetian for our anniversary in April,,,,,,,,
c2500416,s2,The check-in was smooth,,,,,,,,
c2500416,s3,"The only complaint was that we were misinformed that pre-booked breakfasts could be consumed inside our room, but in fact, they could only be enjoyed at the restaurant",,,,,,,,
c2500416,s4,The hotel management had been informed of our anniversary a few days earlier and gave us a special flower and chocolate treat which was truely lovely,,,,,,,,
c2500416,s5,The Royal Suite (standard room in the hotel) was spacious and well-decorated as many mentioned,,,,,,,,
c2500416,s6,We loved it,,,,,,,,
c2500416,s7,"The view was unobstructed but not impressive -- no ocean, no beach, no trees but some low-lying buildings and structures with one other gigantic hotel across the street",,,,,,,,
c2500416,s8,The casino was not too noisy or crowded as I had expected,,,,,,,,
c2500416,s9,We didn't spend much time_,,,,,,,,
c2500417,s1,"For a hotel charging guests USD $300++/night, FREE INTERNET ACCESS SHOULD BE A GIVEN, NOT A PRIVILEGE",,,,,,,,
c2500417,s2,"Had to do some last minute changes to my flight and was shocked to see that wifi use, even for PAYING GUESTS had a corresponding charge per hour of use",,,,,,,,
c2500417,s3,All other hotels in the area provided people even just passing through with free WI-FI,,,,,,,,
c2500417,s4,"Very, very disappointed",,,,,,,,
c2500417,s5,Will explore other hotels when I go back to Macau,,,,,,,,
c2500418,s1,This hotel had a really amazing bathroom and very spacious rooms,,,,,,,,
c2500418,s2,However for $265 AUD it was a bit of a ripoff considering the vast amount of choices in Macau available,,,,,,,,
c2500418,s3,You will get all types of pretentiousness here and people who are just generally rude as they are there for one reason only,,,,,,,,
c2500418,s4,Not really my idea of comfort or luxury,,,,,,,,
c2500419,s1,We just got back from our 2 night stay at the Venetian and  it was quite an adventure,,,,,,,,
c2500419,s2,"First of all, it is soooooo big and easy to get lost",,,,,,,,
c2500419,s3,Now I'm not talking about the 1 or 2 minute out of your way lost but the 1/2 hour to 45 minutes lost,,,,,,,,
c2500419,s4,Much of the staff was unhelpful and often misdirected us which added more to our frustration,,,,,,,,
c2500419,s5,Signage was helpful up to a point and then would disappear on where to go next,,,,,,,,
c2500419,s6,On the plus side: rooms was one of the most beautiful we have ever stayed at,,,,,,,,
c2500419,s7,The Portofino Restaurant was fabulous!  Pools were nice and the property on the whole was meticulously taken care of,,,,,,,,
c2500419,s8,The casino was great but the minimum bets were too high for our budget,,,,,,,,
c2500419,s9,To sum it up; the Venetian is a beautiful property but only stay here if you want to be in a_,,,,,,,,
c2500420,s1,This was the 2nd time I stayed at this hotel,,,,,,,,
c2500420,s2,It was opened in 2007 or 2008,,,,,,,,
c2500420,s3,The mattress was considerably deteriorated,,,,,,,,
c2500420,s4,It was too soft without any back support,,,,,,,,
c2500420,s5,My back hurt and could not fall asleep,,,,,,,,
c2500420,s6,The pillow was too flat,,,,,,,,
c2500420,s7,There are many hotels in Macau,,,,,,,,
c2500420,s8,I will try another one next time,,,,,,,,
c2500421,s1,"Myself and my Wife stayed here for 4 nights at the back end of March this year, however as it was won as a competition prize here in the UK, this review is written with that in mind",,,,,,,,
c2500421,s2,Had we paid to stay here the review would be very different,,,,,,,,
c2500421,s3,"Having done our research before travelling, our experience upon arrival at the hotel was not a surprise",,,,,,,,
c2500421,s4,"We used the free shuttle bus from the ferry terminal and arrived at the west entrance to find it teeming with tourists and Chinese gamblers, as we expected",,,,,,,,
c2500421,s5,The check-in process was efficient and the staff were pleasant enough and most spoke good english,,,,,,,,
c2500421,s6,Our room on the 14th floor was nice enough if a little gaudy,,,,,,,,
c2500421,s7,"However, everything was clean, tidy and comfortable and of seemingly good quality",,,,,,,,
c2500421,s8,The big selection of tv channels_,,,,,,,,
c2500422,s1,"My husband and I spent a week in Hong Kong, and decided to take a side trip to Macau, and stay at the Venetian",,,,,,,,
c2500422,s2,"What a dissapointment, the hotel claims to be 5 stars, but it's so shabby, yes the rooms are big,but when you look closely around everything is second rate",,,,,,,,
c2500422,s3,"Even the shopping centre, has no luxury brand, for those you need to go to the Four Seasons which is attached to the Venetian",,,,,,,,
c2500422,s4,"They claim to be smoke free, but everywhere we went, everyone was happily puffing away",,,,,,,,
c2500422,s5,Will not stay there again,,,,,,,,
c2500423,s1,Nice resort but most great reviews come from other than Americans,,,,,,,,
c2500423,s2,Wade's review form Houston in 2011 sums it up nicely,,,,,,,,
c2500423,s3,"Too add, blackjack is dealt from 6 deck shoes in most places in Macau",,,,,,,,
c2500423,s4,"If you like baccarat, Macau is for you",,,,,,,,
c2500423,s5,If not stay in Las Vegas,,,,,,,,
c2500423,s6,Come for the Portugese food and history,,,,,,,,
c2500423,s7,"But, spend your nights in Hong Kong",,,,,,,,
c2500424,s1,This is a very nice looking hotel in Macao,,,,,,,,
c2500424,s2,Huge and amazing property with a lot of facilities,,,,,,,,
c2500424,s3,"However, it really lacks on 'service' aspect which makes it less than a 5 star!  Pros:  - large property - one can easily spend the whole day enjoying various aspects of the hotel - shopping, casino, live shows, mini golf, restaurants etc",,,,,,,,
c2500424,s4,A good play area for kids as well,,,,,,,,
c2500424,s5,"We watched 'Zee Cine Awards' and 'ZAIA', a modern circus - really marvellous",,,,,,,,
c2500424,s6,"- spacious rooms - large rooms (split level bed and drawing), large bathroom  Cons:  - poor service - housekeeping will take 30 minutes, sometimes you will have to call twice or thrice, poor check-in reception, staff is very rude at all the locations - check in, conceirge, restaurants, no one will try to resolve the issue or many times_",,,,,,,,
c2500425,s1,"Stayed in a 170m2 Rialto Suite for 2 nights, the room was huge and very well furnished, the room was very clean , the the poor standard of the fixtures and fittings was not something I was expecting , the room entrance  door had paint peeling off and looked like something I would expect in a 3 star hotel",,,,,,,,
c2500425,s2,"The Casino/Hotel has a good feel about it , many dinner and lunch options , nothing bad I can say really but nothing great either   One thing that needs to change is the attitude of the yellow coated security guys , they don't smile and make you feel like you've stayed in a prison or something, I know they have a job to do but its not hard to return a good morning ( in either mandarin or english)  One",,,,,,,,
c2500426,s1,This hotel is the most popular in Macau,,,,,,,,
c2500426,s2,When you arrive it looks amazing the lobby is magnificent and so are the shops with gondola rides,,,,,,,,
c2500426,s3,The rooms look pretty stunning also,,,,,,,,
c2500426,s4,However after staying here for almost one week there are flaws that make some facilities in the hotel rooms outdated,,,,,,,,
c2500426,s5,"After staying at the four seasons prior which had such modern facilities, i was quite unimpressed with the shower",,,,,,,,
c2500426,s6,The shower head is not detachable and is stuck in one position on the wall,,,,,,,,
c2500426,s7,The water either spurts out so fast onto your head only or trickles out in a sputtery mess,,,,,,,,
c2500426,s8,The t,,,,,,,,
c2500426,s9,vs are small compared to newer versions,,,,,,,,
c2500426,s10,The telephone by the bed was not working and a technician came to fix it but after that it still didn't work,,,,,,,,
c2500426,s11,Also another word of advice is if you don't want to_,,,,,,,,
c2500427,s1,"Second time I have stayed in Venetian Macau, the first being couple of years back",,,,,,,,
c2500427,s2,"Things were as the first time - nice rooms, ok service and so on",,,,,,,,
c2500427,s3,But it lacks the ooommppphhh ie the x factor to make it a fantastic hotel,,,,,,,,
c2500427,s4,There was no show or performance ongoig for Christmas or New Year unless you want to pay for the shows,,,,,,,,
c2500427,s5,"Cenetian relies too much on the gondola rides (done them last time), some expensive shops, the MU shop which was a disappointment this time and casino",,,,,,,,
c2500427,s6,"They should put on more street shows, make an effort to wow guests over Christmas and New Year and so on",,,,,,,,
c2500428,s1,The Venetian is one of the most luxurious hotels in the world,,,,,,,,
c2500428,s2,No doubt all the amenities here are amazing,,,,,,,,
c2500428,s3,Me and my family had a great time here,,,,,,,,
c2500428,s4,The problem is the amout of cigarette smoke here,,,,,,,,
c2500428,s5,"There are no regulations here for smoking, and people can be seen smoking everywhere, and there seems to be no efforts to curb this",,,,,,,,
c2500428,s6,"I guess that they need to cater for the Chinese gambling high rollers, but what about the families with children?",,,,,,,,
c2500429,s1,Booked here for two nights stay after The Langham (Hong Kong),,,,,,,,
c2500429,s2,"I've heard so much about Venetian Macau, how grand and great it is",,,,,,,,
c2500429,s3,BUT,,,,,,,,
c2500429,s4,"for me, it was ""so so""",,,,,,,,
c2500429,s5,"The shuttle bus from Macau ferry to hotel was convenient, but we were greeted by a large crowd at the lobby",,,,,,,,
c2500429,s6,They mentioned it's actually full house,,,,,,,,
c2500429,s7,"Just imagine a hotel with that amount of rooms, fullhouse? really? :) Check in took a while as they were fully booked, but finally she manage to get me two rooms (booked two rooms)   It was a long trek to our appointed room, i was lucky enough for not having a corner room",,,,,,,,
c2500429,s8,"The room honestly, it's grand enough to say, only that for those who had experienced a real luxury hotel knows the real thing about luxury hotels",,,,,,,,
c2500429,s9,"Perhaps, it's consider for like a casino hotel, so_",,,,,,,,
c2500430,s1,"To start the review off, I must say that the actual room itself was quite nice, especially the split level floor and the huge bathroom",,,,,,,,
c2500430,s2,"However something just felt lacking about our whole stay, maybe it's the fact we more often stay in smaller family run kind of places and the fact that this is a multi thousand room hotel?  We arrived in Macau at about 2230 after starting the day Chiang Rai, flying to Bangkok, Then to Hong Kong before finally using the Skypier facility at HKIA to make our way to Macau",,,,,,,,
c2500430,s3,The Venetian has a desk at the Porto Exterior ferry terminal and we easily found our way to the free shuttle bus,,,,,,,,
c2500430,s4,We arrived quite tired but found Check In to be quite Hassle Free and Friendly,,,,,,,,
c2500430,s5,The hotel itself is quite massive but easy to find you're way around after a couple_,,,,,,,,
c2500431,s1,Pro's We booked a one bedroom suite and the room was huge,,,,,,,,
c2500431,s2,Check in and check out was very efficient and friendly,,,,,,,,
c2500431,s3,"Lots to do in the complex, shopping, shows, casino, mini golf ect",,,,,,,,
c2500431,s4,Con's Service was very muddled and poor,,,,,,,,
c2500431,s5,Room service took an eternity to arrive,,,,,,,,
c2500431,s6,We had on two occasions service people try to enter our room to fix lights that were not broken (surely this could have been sorted prior to our check in?),,,,,,,,
c2500431,s7,The AC temp control did not work,,,,,,,,
c2500431,s8,We had to turn the unit off so we didn't freeze,,,,,,,,
c2500431,s9,The room was non-smoking but still had an odour of cigarettes,,,,,,,,
c2500431,s10,They were unable to organize babysitting for us,,,,,,,,
c2500431,s11,"We had no problem with this in France, London, Bangkok, HK or Koh Samui on our trip but the Venetian refused",,,,,,,,
c2500431,s12,This meant that my husband and I had to take turns sight_,,,,,,,,
c2500432,s1,"The hotel is very similar to that of Las Vegas' Venetian, except the properly is much larger",,,,,,,,
c2500432,s2,Service is what you would expect from a very large hotel casino - so 3-stars at best,,,,,,,,
c2500432,s3,"Dining options were good, albeit quite pricey",,,,,,,,
c2500432,s4,"My biggest issue is that the smell of cigarettes is throughout the hotel, including hotel rooms which are supposedly non-smoking rooms",,,,,,,,
c2500432,s5,I am allergic to cigarette smoke so I can pick it up quite easily - we switched rooms 2x to get a truly non-smoking room,,,,,,,,
c2500432,s6,"For my next Macau visit (perhaps once a year), I would likely try one of the newer, smaller hotels such as the Banyon Tree",,,,,,,,
c2500433,s1,"My family and I were looking forward to staying at the Venetian, after good reviews from friends and relatives",,,,,,,,
c2500433,s2,"The hotel is nicely done, with plenty of shops and food options",,,,,,,,
c2500433,s3,"The rooms are big too, and the washroom has a separate small room for the toilet",,,,,,,,
c2500433,s4,"However, what really bothered us was the VERY strong smell of cigarettes EVERYWHERE",,,,,,,,
c2500433,s5,We had a room in a non-smoking floor and even the hallway stank,,,,,,,,
c2500433,s6,I guess it's because the casino was packed and people were smoking and the smell sticks to your clothes everywhere you go,,,,,,,,
c2500433,s7,"We went to the other nearby hotels (Galaxy, City of Dreams) and they didn't stink as much",,,,,,,,
c2500434,s1,"It__ basically exact the same as its Las Vegas twin brother from lobby, casino, suite room, stores and restaurant",,,,,,,,
c2500434,s2,"Everything is big, good reception staff that speaks English well",,,,,,,,
c2500434,s3,A bit pricey now that Macau has mature with busload of mainland Chinese enjoying the place,,,,,,,,
c2500435,s1,I took two of my best friends to Macau which was their first time visit this city,,,,,,,,
c2500435,s2,We choose Venetian since they can have lots of option there,,,,,,,,
c2500435,s3,"No doubt it is huge and combine everythings- shopping, casion, all kind of restaurent and left you endless exploration",,,,,,,,
c2500435,s4,But we reached the hotel we were disappointed to find out we need to follow a long line to get checked in,,,,,,,,
c2500435,s5,"Also, when we got in at 11am, we were informed that we have to wait for hours since they are not open check in until 3pm",,,,,,,,
c2500435,s6,"We are so lucky to assigned a very nice receptionish, her name is Lovely, just like her name, she handel our complain professional and all of our frustration was gone with her lovely smile!    But the worst was when all these tourists (be in a group or not who are on for Venetian Excursion)_",,,,,,,,
c2500436,s1,There is no doubt this is a place at least worth a visit or seeing,,,,,,,,
c2500436,s2,"It is pretty amazing in terms of size, shopping around the canals and the scale of the place",,,,,,,,
c2500436,s3,However for me the service lets it down,,,,,,,,
c2500436,s4,It's not intimate nor is the service 5 star,,,,,,,,
c2500436,s5,The place has a very tour group feel to it and feels alot like a big cattle station,,,,,,,,
c2500436,s6,Rooms are well equipped but overall most of the fittings etc feel like they have had a fair amount of wear and tear and therefore feels the place hasn't been built to last,,,,,,,,
c2500436,s7,It feels a bit cheap for a 5 star hotel,,,,,,,,
c2500436,s8,The shops are quite expensive compared to Hong Kong and therefore window shopping would be the only thing you would do,,,,,,,,
c2500436,s9,The breakfast at Cafe Deco although buffet does not compare in terms of quality to 5 star hotels,,,,,,,,
c2500436,s10,It is certainly_,,,,,,,,
c2500437,s1,The Cotai strip is not quite built yet but no doubt will be great when it gets busier - anyone expecting Las Vegas will be in for a shock,,,,,,,,
c2500437,s2,"If you are there for the sites, better to stay in the original port area - Wynn/Lisboa area where there is more going on in the evening",,,,,,,,
c2500437,s3,"On the plus side the rooms are spotless, huge and comfortable",,,,,,,,
c2500437,s4,"You have to put up with some noisy Chinese in the corridors at night, otherwise, shops and canal area great and a mini Vegas experience",,,,,,,,
c2500438,s1,I was booked into the hotel for a conference,,,,,,,,
c2500438,s2,"It's a great hotel, but I hated it",,,,,,,,
c2500438,s3,"The good stuff:  Check-in, once I got there, was efficient",,,,,,,,
c2500438,s4,"The room, once you get to it, is huge, and well equipped, with a good size work desk, and a large sitting area separate from the bedroom",,,,,,,,
c2500438,s5,"The internet works well, and, intelligently, your login includes three devices for the same price",,,,,,,,
c2500438,s6,It was included in my room rate; otherwise it'll cost you US$20 per day,,,,,,,,
c2500438,s7,"The bathroom is well equipped, with a comfortable long bath",,,,,,,,
c2500438,s8,"There's a kettle for making tea and coffee, and a fairly well stocked minibar",,,,,,,,
c2500438,s9,"Lighting is good and controllable, and the aircon adjustable",,,,,,,,
c2500438,s10,"The outdoor pools are quite nice, although have steps at one end so swimming laps is marginally more frustrating than they_",,,,,,,,
c2500439,s1,we were so excited to have booked this property,,,,,,,,
c2500439,s2,its is a huge property with thousands of people at this hotel,,,,,,,,
c2500439,s3,literally,,,,,,,,
c2500439,s4,most of all coming here to try their luck at the casinos,,,,,,,,
c2500439,s5,the interiors were awesome with picaso's painting all over,,,,,,,,
c2500439,s6,checkin took time becoz of hoards of ppl waiting to check in,,,,,,,,
c2500439,s7,the suites were big actually good with a bedroom and a drawing room,,,,,,,,
c2500439,s8,the washroom was big too,,,,,,,,
c2500439,s9,the service was very average,,,,,,,,
c2500439,s10,the hotel has so much of staff but yet the service was okay,,,,,,,,
c2500439,s11,wat we didn't like was the presence of tooooooo many people( most of them had come to play at the casino) n bcoz of its size it was so confusing that even we wud often get confused locating our room,,,,,,,,
c2500439,s12,thr r plusses n minuses both,,,,,,,,
c2500439,s13,"minus being ,we cudn't njoy our property bcoz of the time spent at_",,,,,,,,
c2500440,s1,Booked a suite with a special lady for quite a decent price and we went for weekend to Macau,,,,,,,,
c2500440,s2,"We walked into sweet which looked amazing, I've had a bottle of champagne for this special occasion in my suit case and when I opened cupboard I found all glasses to be dirty and full of dust",,,,,,,,
c2500440,s3,"Called up room service, they send some inexperienced boy upstairs and it took him about 30 min",,,,,,,,
c2500440,s4,He took all the glasses in the cart without apology and then he came back after 15 min with only two water glasses,,,,,,,,
c2500440,s5,He did not apologize or anything,,,,,,,,
c2500440,s6,"We complained and in the morning when we were away maids sorted out the problem, however one small ""sorry"" from the management or anyone in the hotel would be highly appreciated and would not cost them loosing a client in the future",,,,,,,,
c2500441,s1,This hotel is huge,,,,,,,,
c2500441,s2,"For a family with kids that could not bypass the casino from the check in counter, it was a good 200metres from lobby to lift lobby",,,,,,,,
c2500441,s3,The Venetian theme was just a tad too much for me and the novelty wore thin as soon as we sat down for a meal at the food court,,,,,,,,
c2500441,s4,"The suite was generously appointed - two queen beds and a sofa bed, separate living and sleeping areas and a good sized toilet",,,,,,,,
c2500441,s5,"Other than the faux decor, it was a hotel",,,,,,,,
c2500441,s6,That's about it,,,,,,,,
c2500441,s7,Great if you're gonna hit the slots but no so if you had a young family in tow,,,,,,,,
c2500441,s8,"Pros  - 10minutes from the airport - Qube (a paying kids club) - Lots of buses to take you to other hotels, the Zhuhai border and downtown Macau  Cons - Sloppy room service - Cafe service staff were rather indifferent - No child friendly_",,,,,,,,
c2500442,s1,"Very very glitzy, everything is bathed in an orangey glow",,,,,,,,
c2500442,s2,"Suites are comfortable, but some distance from the main lobby",,,,,,,,
c2500442,s3,"Staff are friendly, professional, and efficient",,,,,,,,
c2500442,s4,A long queue formed outside the buffet breakfast venue after 8,,,,,,,,
c2500442,s5,"30am, so breakfast earlier if you abhor q-ing",,,,,,,,
c2500442,s6,"Breakfast food was so-so, but the same restaurant served up a fabulous dinner, so don't write it off",,,,,,,,
c2500442,s7,"Travel to and from the airport or ferry terminal is a breeze, but you need a taxi to get to and from the local sites",,,,,,,,
c2500443,s1,"You'll love the gondolas, the painted ceilings, the outstanding food hall with the meriod of choices to be had, and of course the shops, oh the shops",,,,,,,,
c2500443,s2,But the room was dated and falls far behind other hotels in Macau,,,,,,,,
c2500443,s3,"So bear in mind this very detail as it can leave you asking is it worth the price or should I have looked else where? The casino is great and everything else I have mentioned is worth a visit, but not the room",,,,,,,,
c2500444,s1,Huge hotel needed a map just to get to my room,,,,,,,,
c2500444,s2,I liked the room however for a casino property lack of food places open at late hours there was only one which stopped making many of its menu items,,,,,,,,
c2500444,s3,The pool was good outside three options and a jacuzzi,,,,,,,,
c2500444,s4,We were overcharged for mini bar items which they refunded immediately this worried me as it may be common practise,,,,,,,,
c2500444,s5,Lack of shops nearby only over priced shops within the casino,,,,,,,,
c2500444,s6,Didnt really meet any locals,,,,,,,,
c2500444,s7,However Bus service to nearby casinos was great been to las vegas and its exactly what is needed as casinos are huge and walking from one to another can be a very long walk,,,,,,,,
c2500444,s8,Also talked to staff member about local supermarket was told there were none in macau checked phone book and they were some in macau,,,,,,,,
c2500445,s1,The first room we were given had a bit of defect (i,,,,,,,,
c2500445,s2,e,,,,,,,,
c2500445,s3,brackish water was seeping out from the tiles in the bathroom area),,,,,,,,
c2500445,s4,They told us that they would provide us some towels to soak it up,,,,,,,,
c2500445,s5,"SIMPLY NOT ACCEPTABLE! We paid good money to stay here on a Saturday!  Since we had a child with us, it was just possible she might slip in there; we decided not to take the risk",,,,,,,,
c2500445,s6,It took them about 45 mins to assign us another room,,,,,,,,
c2500445,s7,The room and the bathroom was very ample in size,,,,,,,,
c2500445,s8,"The bed was luxurious! There is a sunken living room area, complete with another TV (though not flat screen), and the coffee/ tea amenities",,,,,,,,
c2500445,s9,The writing desk has a printer/ fax/ scanner (but i think you might need to pay to use it),,,,,,,,
c2500445,s10,"The view was facing City of Dreams (neon lights at night), and we could see_",,,,,,,,
c2500446,s1,This was my 4th stay at the Venetian Macao,,,,,,,,
c2500446,s2,"Stayed in the twin bed suite, which as always was nice and spacious",,,,,,,,
c2500446,s3,Requested a room near the elevators as i remembered from previous stays the walk could be gruesome from some of the further rooms,,,,,,,,
c2500446,s4,"Was put in the North wing, which meant a 400m power walk to the swimming pool each day, through the long corridor",,,,,,,,
c2500446,s5,"Although the hotel was very busy when i stayed, we usually had the pool (adult pool) to ourselves",,,,,,,,
c2500446,s6,The jacuzzi is nice for late afternoon soaks,,,,,,,,
c2500446,s7,The largest pool is heated,,,,,,,,
c2500446,s8,I did not try the kids pool and the fountain pool,,,,,,,,
c2500446,s9,Yes there are 5 pools in total (including jacuzzi),,,,,,,,
c2500446,s10,"Service was good, although not very personal, though one cannot really expect this from a hotel this size",,,,,,,,
c2500446,s11,"Breakfast at Cafe Deco is nothing special,_",,,,,,,,
c2500447,s1,Our stay on the one of the rooms changed to poor quality service,,,,,,,,
c2500447,s2,We were charged a bomb for a european plan and the hotel should atleast consider the they should give rooms with atleast breakfast,,,,,,,,
c2500447,s3,"next, we stayed in the macau strip facing rooms which was a great view",,,,,,,,
c2500447,s4,but the hotel should consider the rates they charge and dont mislead guest,,,,,,,,
c2500448,s1,Venetian is starting to lose its shine,,,,,,,,
c2500448,s2,"With the focus on catering to huge crowds, the focus on personal service is gone",,,,,,,,
c2500448,s3,"Rooms are large and well appointed, but its starting to have a tired look",,,,,,,,
c2500448,s4,"Seems to cater to much older crowds, so if you're looking for a young/hip crowd, look elsewhere",,,,,,,,
c2500448,s5,Very limited entertainment options on the premises,,,,,,,,
c2500448,s6,"Zaia the show is good, but The House of Dancing water is much better",,,,,,,,
c2500448,s7,"With new options popping up all the time, consider a back up option",,,,,,,,
c2500449,s1,This place looks nice but it is too busy,,,,,,,,
c2500449,s2,"This is not a five star hotel by western standard, you must make a booking for evening turndown and daily cleaning service",,,,,,,,
c2500449,s3,The staff is rude and lacking in English,,,,,,,,
c2500449,s4,"The rooms are big yet not cleaned very well, they have dust and you can tell the cleaning was rush",,,,,,,,
c2500449,s5,The towels and bathrobs had wrinkles and were not fully dry,,,,,,,,
c2500449,s6,The bath soaps are of very low quality as well,,,,,,,,
c2500449,s7,The bed is very  firm and not in a good way,,,,,,,,
c2500449,s8,The pool is lacking and Im not even sure where the spa is,,,,,,,,
c2500449,s9,"Everyone and their grandma from China is in this hotel and its a zoo, constant battles to get around and the hotel literally is split up so your always walking through the casino straight out of the elevator lift",,,,,,,,
c2500449,s10,"Point being, if you are Chinese and want to see_",,,,,,,,
c2500450,s1,We went to Macau for 1 night & stayed here because our friends told us it was great,,,,,,,,
c2500450,s2,Well the hotel is ENORMOUS and like a huge railway station,,,,,,,,
c2500450,s3,There is no service at the hotel,,,,,,,,
c2500450,s4,When you arrive there are no porters and no-one to direct you,,,,,,,,
c2500450,s5,The staff barely speak english and are very unhelpful,,,,,,,,
c2500450,s6,The rooms are big but a bit old fashioned,,,,,,,,
c2500450,s7,We found it overpriced and disappointing,,,,,,,,
c2500451,s1,This all suite resort hotel has everything with all rooms  beautifully appointed with every possible convenience BUT it is so big that it loses its appeal,,,,,,,,
c2500451,s2,To get to the swimming pool is at least a 10 minute walk down never ending corridors and thats after finding the right lift in the first place!  The rooms are accessed  through the casino - it is quite difficult to find the right lift and very easy to get lost,,,,,,,,
c2500451,s3,Smoking is still allowed (there is a small token non-smoking area in the casino) so after a night of gambling your clothes and hair reek - one night in there was enough for me,,,,,,,,
c2500451,s4,"The food hall, restaurants and shopping plaza are difficult to beat",,,,,,,,
c2500452,s1,"It's near enough a 10minutes walk from the front reception to the hotel rooms entrance lobby! You have to walk acrossed the main casino floor, gaming tables, slot machines, etc on either side of you, it was fascinating watching people gambling! The bedroom was huge, quiet glam but on a closer inspection, it's quite tired! The bed was comfortable enough with a lovely view acorss the city and looking out onto the other OTT hotels!",,,,,,,,
c2500453,s1,Fellow boarders are right about how huge and grand this property is but my point is that don't limit yourself inside Venetian alone,,,,,,,,
c2500453,s2,My advice to travelers to Macau on a short trip are as follows: 1,,,,,,,,
c2500453,s3,After check in next morning itself take a half day city tour,,,,,,,,
c2500453,s4,Booking for that is done in Venetian itself at Cotai travel desk,,,,,,,,
c2500453,s5,2,,,,,,,,
c2500453,s6,"See all places like Ma Temple, Macau towers etc",,,,,,,,
c2500453,s7,Last stoppage will be near St,,,,,,,,
c2500453,s8,Paul Cathedral where you get down and leave the guided tour and be on your own,,,,,,,,
c2500453,s9,3,,,,,,,,
c2500453,s10,Near cathedral there is a market where you can do shopping,,,,,,,,
c2500453,s11,Don't let the shopping for HK if u are going there next,,,,,,,,
c2500453,s12,"Spent some time in the market and you will find good deals for apperals, shoes etc",,,,,,,,
c2500453,s13,By thumb rule shopping in HK & Macau are expensive and if you like something reasonable in_,,,,,,,,
c2500454,s1,This hotel certainly looks impressive,,,,,,,,
c2500454,s2,It is huge,,,,,,,,
c2500454,s3,"The rooms are very big, in fact everything is big",,,,,,,,
c2500454,s4,But perhaps therein lies the problem,,,,,,,,
c2500454,s5,"It is impressive in a theme park sort of way, but it lacks soul",,,,,,,,
c2500454,s6,"With 3000 suits, the hotel was full when I was there and the manager told me that this year it has an average occupancy rate of 98%",,,,,,,,
c2500454,s7,"The hotel is centred around a (needless to say) massive casino, and a parade of the standard shops you find everywhere in Asia, with a canal down the middle, complete with gondola rides (with a singing host)",,,,,,,,
c2500454,s8,"I just found the whole place kitch and naff, and with it's size it was totally impersonal",,,,,,,,
c2500454,s9,"This is not meant as any criticism of the staff, who were very good and tried their best",,,,,,,,
c2500454,s10,"It just lacked any feeling of being a ""home from_",,,,,,,,
c2500455,s1,The place is huge,,,,,,,,
c2500455,s2,I got to walk 300m to get from my room to the swimming pool,,,,,,,,
c2500455,s3,"However, kids will love it as there was a inflated slide in one of the 3 pool",,,,,,,,
c2500455,s4,Not to sure if it is a constant feature as it was there on my first day,,,,,,,,
c2500455,s5,The casino  is huge and very crowded,,,,,,,,
c2500455,s6,Great if you are a shareholder but as a guest I prefer better services,,,,,,,,
c2500455,s7,The serving person for drinks is non-existence,,,,,,,,
c2500455,s8,"Overall, a good place to stay to have a feel of the chaotic and monsterity growth of Macao and China",,,,,,,,
c2500456,s1,We were impressed by the aesthetic look including the room layout but not the service,,,,,,,,
c2500456,s2,The staffs are not friendly nor helpful,,,,,,,,
c2500456,s3,"However, comfort of the room has made up the short coming",,,,,,,,
c2500456,s4,The room is beautiful and comfortable with 2 queen size bed,,,,,,,,
c2500456,s5,"Free Bus shuttle service to and from ferry terminal, China checkpoint and etc",,,,,,,,
c2500456,s6,Very convenient,,,,,,,,
c2500456,s7,Hugh shopping area,,,,,,,,
c2500456,s8,Romantic Gondola ride,,,,,,,,
c2500456,s9,Various eatery and restaurants,,,,,,,,
c2500456,s10,"In a nutshell, it is worth staying or a day trip",,,,,,,,
c2500457,s1,me and my wife stayed here for 2 nights,,,,,,,,
c2500457,s2,"we have taken ice world package so our ice world entry, zaia show entry, one way ferry tickets plus breakfast included in our stay",,,,,,,,
c2500457,s3,as so many people there it took bout 45 mins to check in and at one time i was lost and exhausted checking in and collecting my coupons and tickets,,,,,,,,
c2500457,s4,My suite was great and huge,,,,,,,,
c2500457,s5,bed quality was great,,,,,,,,
c2500457,s6,in bath room shower cabin and tub was good,,,,,,,,
c2500457,s7,"worst thing about hotel too many people long ques everywhere, Smoke every where in hotel u get that smoking feeling not good for non smoker, not enough space to sit in lobby area, no personal attention at all breakfast was not that great either",,,,,,,,
c2500457,s8,Good thing about hotel  Zaia show what a show it was worth every penny of it,,,,,,,,
c2500457,s9,Casinos are really alive and kicking,,,,,,,,
c2500457,s10,but i_,,,,,,,,
c2500458,s1,I brought my family here in July 2011 on an Ice World Package,,,,,,,,
c2500458,s2,Free shuttle bus from ferry terminal worked well,,,,,,,,
c2500458,s3,15 queue to check in,,,,,,,,
c2500458,s4,Room was large and the place is amazingly fitted out,,,,,,,,
c2500458,s5,There is plenty to do as a family,,,,,,,,
c2500458,s6,"The Ice World experience was excellent, however, wear warm clothes",,,,,,,,
c2500458,s7,Circ de Soleil show was excellent,,,,,,,,
c2500458,s8,Plenty of shopping and restuarants to choose from for all budgets,,,,,,,,
c2500458,s9,swimming pool and children's play room were fantastic,,,,,,,,
c2500458,s10,They charge $90HK per child for two hours in the play room,,,,,,,,
c2500458,s11,"The only problem I had was the air quaility throughout the whole premises, especially the casino floor",,,,,,,,
c2500458,s12,Even in a no smoking room I could smell the smoke and had difficultly sleeping,,,,,,,,
c2500458,s13,They also charge for internet usage,,,,,,,,
c2500459,s1,"Given the rates for Venetian one would expect a rather luxurious and exclusive property, but the experience was very different",,,,,,,,
c2500459,s2,Everywhere in the hotel it was crowded like anything,,,,,,,,
c2500459,s3,The rooms are large but look old and frayed,,,,,,,,
c2500459,s4,The breakfast experience was very average with a large spread but not great tasting,,,,,,,,
c2500459,s5,The advantage on this property is that there are a lot of shopping options and the actual Venetian scenery is done well,,,,,,,,
c2500459,s6,All in all not sure I would go again,,,,,,,,
c2500460,s1,Made a short trip to Macau and had lunch at the Venetian after a shopping spree,,,,,,,,
c2500460,s2,This was my 2nd patronage of Glorious BBQ King wnicn sells roasted meat,,,,,,,,
c2500460,s3,Now they demand that we pay MOP10 for a helping of chilli,,,,,,,,
c2500460,s4,No doublt this is not a big sum but where on earth except this outlet 104 in the Venetian that dare to blatantly do so,,,,,,,,
c2500460,s5,Please go elsewhere for your craving of roasted meat,,,,,,,,
c2500461,s1,Big & wide room wonderful casino,,,,,,,,
c2500461,s2,But it's all,,,,,,,,
c2500461,s3,There is no service,,,,,,,,
c2500461,s4,And so loudly,,,,,,,,
c2500461,s5,Busy,,,,,,,,
c2500461,s6,And so many visitor,,,,,,,,
c2500462,s1,"Mega-mall of a hotel, but it's well run",,,,,,,,
c2500462,s2,"24 hour service, plenty of staff and facilities",,,,,,,,
c2500462,s3,"However, because of size this makes it rather touristy",,,,,,,,
c2500462,s4,"Also, hotel allows smoking inside the premises which can get irritating after a while",,,,,,,,
c2500462,s5,Hotel design very similar to Las Vegas one and many options for dining,,,,,,,,
c2500462,s6,"While one can't complain, one can't feel that it was a very original experience either!",,,,,,,,
c2500463,s1,We (couple in middle 30) and a 2 year baby travelled to Macao and for first time we do this (we went often as we live in Hong Kong for 2 years) we decided to also book a hotel,,,,,,,,
c2500463,s2,As one of the most recommended everywhere we have chosen the Venetian Macao Resort,,,,,,,,
c2500463,s3,"Well, let me get back to details",,,,,,,,
c2500463,s4,"The good: -	Big rooms (huge); -	Separate shower cabin and WC room with door; -	Decent view (better at night when you can notice other resorts light shows; -	2 tv (one for sofa area, one for the bed); -	Good service at Check In desk (we got early check in even if hush hush as the personnel kept telling us 3PM is regular check in time; -	A quick check out, 2 minutes not considering the line which luckily we didn__ find; -	Many food options: a food court, a big multi-national restaurant Café_",,,,,,,,
c2500464,s1,We stayed at the resort for the new years with our parents,,,,,,,,
c2500464,s2,The resort has very opulently designed rooms,,,,,,,,
c2500464,s3,"Its a good destination for a family holiday for 2 - 3 days as it has multiple avenues for entertainment - some the best shopping and dining options, great theatre, casinos, gondola rides (which we found very novel)  However we were quite disappointed with the casino here",,,,,,,,
c2500464,s4,"We have been to various casinos around the world (Vegas, Atlantic City, Genting, London, etc) and found the casino at Venetian to be not up to the mark",,,,,,,,
c2500464,s5,The dealers don't understand English very well,,,,,,,,
c2500464,s6,Finally since the resort is quite huge you find lots of people milling around all the time,,,,,,,,
c2500464,s7,This can be quite disconcerting,,,,,,,,
c2500465,s1,We visited Macau for a night  and to have the real experience decided to stay at the Venetian,,,,,,,,
c2500465,s2,A place heard a lot about but not even near to the expectations a family may have in mind,,,,,,,,
c2500465,s3,"The rooms though are very spacious, but the staff is totally non-considerate",,,,,,,,
c2500465,s4,The elders in the family decided to take a visit to the casino and the children were heading to the play room but the staff at the plat room said that an adult shoulb be with the child over there,,,,,,,,
c2500465,s5,By listening to this a person would think that what was the people at the play room had to do any whats the use of it,,,,,,,,
c2500465,s6,Not a place to visit with family,,,,,,,,
c2500466,s1,Huge huge hotel with lots and lots of people,,,,,,,,
c2500466,s2,Fantastic spacious rooms with nice decorations,,,,,,,,
c2500466,s3,2 TVs in the room,,,,,,,,
c2500466,s4,The Grand Canal Shoppes is so big that makes it like a maze,,,,,,,,
c2500466,s5,Didn't have a chance to enjoy the fitness center and the pool,,,,,,,,
c2500466,s6,"The Zaia show was just so so in my opinion ( We have seen Allegria, which was way better",,,,,,,,
c2500466,s7,) It was not smoke-free in the Grand Canal Shoppes so you smell smoke odor everywhere in the public zone not only in the casino,,,,,,,,
c2500466,s8,"For those people like us who don't smoke and hate smoking odor, this you really have to know",,,,,,,,
c2500466,s9,"It was the first time we stayed at this world famous hotel, but I'd say I'd like to try some other hotels next time if I do come back to Macau again because there are lots of fantastic hotels out there",,,,,,,,
c2500467,s1,I went there during Easter holiday and it was soooo crowded that i hv to wait for an hr for check in,,,,,,,,
c2500467,s2,People re everywhere and u can hardly find a quiet place to sit and relax  The shopping mall is huge but I wonder if there is non smoking area in the hotel,,,,,,,,
c2500467,s3,"U can feel that the hotel is fill w cigarette smoke and this is no good for kid  The hotel room is not clean, there are stain on the sofa and on the floor",,,,,,,,
c2500467,s4,The only good thing is that the casino is Huge and clean,,,,,,,,
c2500467,s5,It is not worthy for what I paid for,,,,,,,,
c2500467,s6,The service only deserve a 3 star at most,,,,,,,,
c2500468,s1,Good place to stay for a night but very very crowded,,,,,,,,
c2500468,s2,not what you expect after looking at the hotel website,,,,,,,,
c2500469,s1,I was quite eager to visit the Venetian as I got a ZAIA package deal,,,,,,,,
c2500469,s2,"However the trip from Guangzhou to Macau dampens my spirit (My camera was stolen during the bus journey and all my previous photos are gone too, plus I had sit 2 hours in the Chinese police station for 2hrs just to lodge a report)",,,,,,,,
c2500469,s3,We only arrive at the hotel around 6,,,,,,,,
c2500469,s4,30pm and the check in service was efficient and the front desk staff was very polite and helpful,,,,,,,,
c2500469,s5,When she heard what a day we had she was speechless,,,,,,,,
c2500469,s6,"We've asked for a non-smoking room, however guests are smoking in the lifts, along the rooms hallway and everywhere in the entire Venetian complex, not to mention the Casino areas of cos",,,,,,,,
c2500469,s7,We even found ash in the toilets (You would think they mop the floor!),,,,,,,,
c2500469,s8,"There wasn't much time to spare, we_",,,,,,,,
c2500470,s1,Spend 2 nights at the hotel which is very crowed due to Easter and China labour day,,,,,,,,
c2500470,s2,The 1st day was nice as we do not have any request,,,,,,,,
c2500470,s3,The 2nd day once we asked for clean towels which had took the housekeeping an hour to bring it up,,,,,,,,
c2500470,s4,My kid fall asleep while waiting for it,,,,,,,,
c2500470,s5,The next morning the toliet clogged which another hour for them to fix,,,,,,,,
c2500470,s6,Every other guests in the hotel doesn't line up for anything,,,,,,,,
c2500470,s7,They just cut in the line where the staff still serves them so it's like a compatition to the desk,,,,,,,,
c2500470,s8,Even my kids at the Cubes slide were asking others to line up,,,,,,,,
c2500470,s9,It's meaningless to complain to the staffs as they all share the same mindset,,,,,,,,
c2500470,s10,I'll go back to Westin if I'm going with my kids,,,,,,,,
c2500471,s1,I spent a couple of nights in Macau as i was in Hong Kong for business and heard it was worth a look,,,,,,,,
c2500471,s2,"I was expecting Las Vegas but in China, and although the Venetian Resort here is pretty much the same as the one in Vegas, everything else just isn't",,,,,,,,
c2500471,s3,"The Venetian Resort is amazing, the rooms, service, shopping, casino etc is all as you would expect, and the detail in the architecture and sheer size of everything is unbelievable",,,,,,,,
c2500471,s4,"However once you've walked around the designer shops a couple of times, eaten in a few of the nice restaurants and exhausted the casino there isn't really much to do",,,,,,,,
c2500471,s5,"If there is it's hard to find out about it, i looked everywhere for a sort of tourist map/guide to Macau with info on what there is to do but i dont think there is one",,,,,,,,
c2500471,s6,Vegas just has_,,,,,,,,
c2500472,s1,Places full of rude mainland Chinese people,,,,,,,,
c2500472,s2,"Check in is fine but check out experience is poor, as if they want you out of the hotel after you have gambled your money",,,,,,,,
c2500472,s3,"People smoke everywhere, no non-smoking areas",,,,,,,,
c2500472,s4,Minimal facilities for children,,,,,,,,
c2500472,s5,Not children friendly,,,,,,,,
c2500472,s6,The only reason is for the Cirque de Soleil Zaia show,,,,,,,,
c2500472,s7,"If you want to gamble, you can find better casinos elsewhere too",,,,,,,,
c2500473,s1,This hotel had come with rave reviews but we left disappointed after booking three suites last week,,,,,,,,
c2500473,s2,Cleanliness of the room left much to be desired,,,,,,,,
c2500473,s3,My vanity mirror on checking in was caked underneath with water and someone elses hair,,,,,,,,
c2500473,s4,Maybe they are too busy for a complete clean,,,,,,,,
c2500473,s5,Dirty cups were left in the room after 2 days of cleaning,,,,,,,,
c2500473,s6,Ladies toilets near Coatai travel shop were discusting,,,,,,,,
c2500473,s7,Dirty used toilet paper was all over the floor in all cubicles,,,,,,,,
c2500473,s8,Toilets were unflushed,,,,,,,,
c2500473,s9,I left and went to the toilets in the check in area they were no better,,,,,,,,
c2500473,s10,Guests were smoking in the hallways on the non smoking floors and non smoking suites stank of stale cigarette smoke,,,,,,,,
c2500473,s11,Guests were spitting inside the hotel on the carpet I am a regular traveller to China however I was surprised_,,,,,,,,
c2500474,s1,"We arranged a car transfer from the ferry which took less than ten minutes (there were several transfer busses also waiting), part of our package was an express type check in which made the process very fast, the room was very large (they call them suites) which was good with two children",,,,,,,,
c2500474,s2,"It was well appointed (albeit a bit tacky) and clean, except for the windows which were filthy and detracted from the view",,,,,,,,
c2500474,s3,The complex is massive and once you have checked in don__ expect any service as you possibly won__ go near the reception or concierge in your wanders around the complex,,,,,,,,
c2500474,s4,"We had a small issue with our room which took seven phone calls over two days to rectify, when you do finally locate someone that can help you they are wonderful and there is clearly just some breakdown_",,,,,,,,
c2500475,s1,Took the airport shuttle and arrived at the Main Lobby,,,,,,,,
c2500475,s2,Check-in took about 15min and were told to make our way to the Northern Suites,,,,,,,,
c2500475,s3,can't cut thru the Casino area as were were travelling with kids,,,,,,,,
c2500475,s4,Bella Suite is exactly the same as Royal Suite except that the latter has a king bed as compared to 2 queen of the Bella Suite's,,,,,,,,
c2500475,s5,Found the place to be constantly crowded and there were not enough resting areas with benches or sofas which families with young children or elderlies would appreciate,,,,,,,,
c2500475,s6,Smoking was rampant which makes maneuvering  the common areas rather unpleasant,,,,,,,,
c2500475,s7,Common to find many sizeable tour groups moving around the hotel vicinity,,,,,,,,
c2500475,s8,Food Court was only average and most stalls were closed after 10,,,,,,,,
c2500475,s9,3opm,,,,,,,,
c2500475,s10,House-keeping deserves a mention for they were efficient_,,,,,,,,
c2500476,s1,My friends and I stayed at the Venetian recently,,,,,,,,
c2500476,s2,I got back with mixed feelings about the hotel,,,,,,,,
c2500476,s3,First to give the positives: The rooms are very large and spacious with a seperate living area,,,,,,,,
c2500476,s4,The bathrooms are huge and very spacious too,,,,,,,,
c2500476,s5,"The hotel has an unmatched offering in terms of places to eat, food courts, restaurants, great bars, lounges, different cuisines - it basically caters to EVERYONES tastes and requirement",,,,,,,,
c2500476,s6,I have yet to see such a large display any where in the world,,,,,,,,
c2500476,s7,There is a huge shopping complex and the whole look and feel of the Venetian is very very grand,,,,,,,,
c2500476,s8,The casino is the largest in Macau and definately the most popular,,,,,,,,
c2500476,s9,"The hotel has many shows and theatrical plays, concerts etc so can serve everyones entertainment apetite",,,,,,,,
c2500476,s10,Now the negatives: Due_,,,,,,,,
c2500477,s1,Lets start  with the free shuttle bus from the airport,,,,,,,,
c2500477,s2,"Wonderfull driver, waited for us as he can see us running to his direction, bus is comfortable",,,,,,,,
c2500477,s3,"Upon arrival at 10am, was given a tag saying we can't check in yet as rooms are not ready even on a thursday morning",,,,,,,,
c2500477,s4,Wow,,,,,,,,
c2500477,s5,must be very full! Request for early check in as traveling with my pop and mom which is both 75 and 74 years old,,,,,,,,
c2500477,s6,"Surprise that they say yes, they can assist",,,,,,,,
c2500477,s7,Great service,,,,,,,,
c2500477,s8,"We were given some vouchers and one of it is to Bamboo restaurant for a free buffet meal, given a number and waited more than 20minutes",,,,,,,,
c2500477,s9,"(on a weekday and in July? this place must be havoc) Food was good, plenty of chinese and western dishes including Indian selections too",,,,,,,,
c2500477,s10,Had a good meal there and so did many other customers_,,,,,,,,
