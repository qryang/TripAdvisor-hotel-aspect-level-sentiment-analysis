c2500000,s1,"We have been traveling Shenzhen,Hongkong & then Macao totaling 14 days"
c2500000,s2,We had an excellent stay at all our hotels
c2500000,s3,Our last stop was the Venetian in Macao
c2500000,s4,The hotel has 3000 plus rooms and was very busy
c2500000,s5,Since we step foot on the ferry when they picked us up on the shuttle bus at the ferry we where treated like kings & queens
c2500000,s6,Nothing was to small to make our stay WOW
c2500000,s7,#fyi The ferry price was 293HK$ for 2 people going & 800 HK$ coming back
c2500000,s8,BUT when we left
c2500000,s9,The hotel staff was great assisting us with luggage to West lobby for pickup
c2500000,s10,At the shuttle we came across to something that we just could not belief
c2500000,s11,The shuttle came and the staff member (which I think is appointed to assist quest to load the luggage) points and shout Load your luggage under the buss
c2500000,s12,…
c2500001,s1,I always staying here whenever i went to Macau days before
c2500001,s2,and surprised that the room was not too clean but still good and spacious with complete amenities
c2500001,s3,"The food in Macau is double than HK,  and it almost everywhere as that's the city of tourists"
c2500002,s1,Stayed 5 nights
c2500002,s2,"It’s a shame but this didn’t make the grade for us, having stayed at MGM and Banyon Tree beforehand on the same trip"
c2500002,s3,We have stayed at Venetian Las Vegas on numerous occasions and are used to big hotels
c2500002,s4,There are many positives but for us this Venetian Hotel is too big for its own good
c2500002,s5,We do not regret staying but in my view there are better alternative hotels in the area
c2500002,s6,Positives: Iconic hotel
c2500002,s7,Good location
c2500002,s8,"Easy to walk to the old town Taipa, Galaxy and to Wynn Palace"
c2500002,s9,Free shuttle buses to various destinations including other hotels in Cotai
c2500002,s10,Venetian canals and fun theme
c2500002,s11,Checked in 1pm and room was ready
c2500002,s12,Complimentary check out at 2pm which was very welcome
c2500002,s13,"Very efficient, friendly and complimentary luggage storage"
c2500002,s14,Large room with lounge…
c2500003,s1,Pros: Once we were able to check in it was very fast and they gave me a lower floor room as requested
c2500003,s2,Room/suite was the high point of the stay
c2500003,s3,Check out took about 45 seconds
c2500003,s4,Con's: From ferry to shuttle bus is a long walk with no signs
c2500003,s5,Denied early check in
c2500003,s6,No place to set at reception (I'm 74 years old
c2500003,s7,) Front desk wanted 2000MOP ($250us) on a credit card as a deposit
c2500003,s8,"Its a scam were the hotel gets to hold up to $70,000"
c2500003,s9,"in ""float money"" and you don't get your money back on your credit card for weeks"
c2500003,s10,"I declined and refused, and told them it was not advertised when I booked and prepaid, and they understood I knew the scam and they accepted the no payment"
c2500003,s11,After check in they sent us through the casino to get to our room and we had to show our passports(again) and the…
c2500004,s1,Venetian hotel is a perfect hotel and a little bit old
c2500004,s2,The room is very large and well equipped and the room service provides you with anything you want
c2500004,s3,Breakfast is very very normal and not a WOW comparing to other five star hotels and I suggest to take lunch in the asian restaurant and it was much better
c2500004,s4,Hotel is really big and from room to main lobby takes 20 mins
c2500004,s5,Very very crowded and to people who prefer quitter place I suggest to choose other smaller nearby hotels
c2500005,s1,The hotel itself is nice as the rooms are all suites
c2500005,s2,Check in at 1pm and not earlier even when rooms are available is not accommodating guests
c2500005,s3,"Coming from Living in Las Vegas for 9 years where there is fun and excitement at every corner, The Macau scene is built for no fun at all"
c2500005,s4,Its built around Baccarat games for old Chinese men and old Chinese working girls to follow you around and point to open tables as if you cant see them yourself
c2500005,s5,There are only two poker rooms in Macau and the Venetian being one of them
c2500005,s6,With waiting lists full and only 7 tables occupied they will cut down tables and make waits even longer
c2500005,s7,Going to the bathroom and having a line of Chinese drug dealers waiting for everyone is a show itself by the poker room
c2500005,s8,Looking for a bar on the casino floor is…
c2500006,s1,"Oh well, the most of staff are nice esp Ben at front office and Jamie at concierge were very nice and professional with great Eng skill but there was one lady whom were extremely rude"
c2500006,s2,I also work for international luxury brand hotel and could not believe what she was doing
c2500006,s3,"The very good thing abt this hotel, you can enjoy early check in and late check out service with min extra charge"
c2500006,s4,"I also have requested for this service and when I arrived at the lobby, I slowly approached the front desk then she stopped me and yelled at me saying I cant go to front desk"
c2500006,s5,I kindly yold her that I had booked for early check in service and it was around 9
c2500006,s6,30 am
c2500006,s7,Then she said I needed to come back after 12
c2500006,s8,30pm for that service even if I explained everything then forced me and my family to…
c2500007,s1,Stayed here for just one night as we were attending a concert
c2500007,s2,For this reason it was a good choice as our room was very close to the Cotai Arena
c2500007,s3,However rating the Venetian as a five star property is difficult
c2500007,s4,The property is huge and largely dominated by a massive amount of retail outlets
c2500007,s5,"When arriving in the main lobby it was completely chaotic, noisy and again not what I would expect from a five star property"
c2500007,s6,The Check in queue was long and took forever to be served
c2500007,s7,The rooms are big and comfortable albeit a little dated
c2500007,s8,Our so called “non-smoking” room had a strong smell of smoke and even had an ash tray
c2500007,s9,There is a good variety of f&b outlets which you would expect from such a large property
c2500007,s10,"However, prior to departure my wife had money stolen from her bag as we…"
c2500008,s1,"Well Check In process is too lengthy, but stay was average"
c2500008,s2,It has the Asia's Largest Casino floor which is functioning 24x7 (though not full)
c2500008,s3,"The hotel is very big, you need to keep the map with you to find the place"
c2500008,s4,The room sizes are also big enough for stay
c2500008,s5,"The service is not too fast, but acceptable, considering the size of hotel"
c2500008,s6,"If you do have plan to visit in Hotel area, must try Gondola ride"
c2500008,s7,You can find Indian restaurant The Golden Peacock
c2500008,s8,The test is totally Indian
c2500008,s9,"Those who want to try local food can pay visit to Food Court, you can find variety of food"
c2500009,s1,"The thing that struck me about this resort is its size and very efficient service, but still friendly staff"
c2500009,s2,However English skills were not great with the majority of staff aside from check-in
c2500009,s3,So learn some basic Cantonese before going
c2500009,s4,We spent 2 days here and due to the air pollution and not feeling well we did not venture outside and neither did we gamble
c2500009,s5,"We basically window shopped for2 days, walking in excess of 10km/day"
c2500009,s6,The resort is like a small self contained city
c2500009,s7,"There was a nice pool area, but due to illness was unable to make use of it"
c2500009,s8,"One thing to note, if you have coeliac disease, they are not very gluten aware"
c2500009,s9,"We chose to eat at the Golden peacock (Indian cuisine) that offered gluten free meals, but I wouldn’t say completely aware of the…"
c2500010,s1,Its a massive hotel you walk to Many corridor to arrive somewhere
c2500010,s2,I went in Vegas venetian and is really différent
c2500010,s3,This hôtel is Like Disneyland for chineuse adult
c2500010,s4,Breakfast was terrible
c2500010,s5,"Like 2 stars hotel bad quality food, poor choice better to go to starbuck than there"
c2500010,s6,"Room are gréât big suite, very Clean gréât bathroom and wonderful view"
c2500010,s7,To access in swimming pool you have to be courageous you have to walk 15 or 20 min in huge corridor to access in garden
c2500010,s8,Swimming pool are small but Many Like swimming in alcov Its more confidential
c2500010,s9,Bar on swimming was closed
c2500010,s10,The gambling decline table are full with no polite people
c2500010,s11,Mall inside hotel are gréât Like in Vegas beautiful place all brand only food court was horrible smell and too Many people
c2500010,s12,Connections with other hôtel…
c2500011,s1,I guess if the go to Macau you will want to experience the Venetian
c2500011,s2,"So many shops but when confronted by the fact that a soft drinks sells for nearly 10 times the cost in the supermarket, you know you’re not here for the bargains"
c2500011,s3,Just about every fashion shop is here and I guess it’s great to just take in the experience
c2500011,s4,We don’t gamble so the casino isn’t of any interest
c2500011,s5,Still go and see it but lots of better things to do in Macau
c2500012,s1,huge hotel
c2500012,s2,takes a week to sort out
c2500012,s3,with lots of shopping ( expensive) snd connected to other resorts
c2500012,s4,"however breakfast way below average, pool takes ages to reach and not much fun"
c2500012,s5,casino also quite expensive compared to Vegas
c2500012,s6,Macau itsrlf was a pleasure however
c2500013,s1,I only give this a 'fair' rating because I wasn't impressed by the bling and poor imitation
c2500013,s2,"Don't get me wrong, it is a fantastic spectacle, huge complex with something for almost everyone, a real eye opener"
c2500013,s3,"Even though it is fantastic, I felt cheap and dirty by walking through a faux St Marks Square, Grand Canal, Bridge of Sighs, gondolas etc, etc, etc"
c2500013,s4,"It is a masterpiece in architectural mimickery, but just a bit wrong"
c2500013,s5,You have to see it if you go to Taipa
c2500014,s1,The Venetian Macau can be summed up in two words - ‘Too busy’
c2500014,s2,Getting from the front door to our hotel room lift always involved a battle of managing our way for the long walk through hundreds of people in the casino
c2500014,s3,It is by far the busiest casino in the Cotai strip compared to all the other casinos we visited
c2500014,s4,On the positive note our room was very big and the room service excellent
c2500014,s5,However the bed was hard and we did what we could to make it softer
c2500014,s6,Also the while the Casinos/Hotels are newer on the Cotai Strip we found it difficult to navigate our way around and finding bars and restaurants on the street were virtually non existent
c2500014,s7,I much prefer the Las Vegas Strip for walking around and visiting the various Casinos and restaurants and bars
c2500014,s8,All in all while we still…
c2500015,s1,We stay 3 nights to experience area
c2500015,s2,Hotel is very large
c2500015,s3,3000 rooms
c2500015,s4,Suites are big and very clean and well maintained
c2500015,s5,We chose breakfast at Cafe Deco Restuarant
c2500015,s6,Unfortunately there was no variation of the breakfast for the 3 day stay
c2500015,s7,The restaurant didn’t cater for guests that don’t eat pork or beef
c2500015,s8,Food was prepared for large crowds and attention to detail was lacking
c2500015,s9,The hotel has a damp problem which smells bad
c2500015,s10,They are using machines to dry the carpets
c2500015,s11,We not sure if it’s working
c2500015,s12,Overall the hotel is very busy
c2500015,s13,I would avoid the hotel if you staying with family
c2500015,s14,The Parisian hotel seemed better
c2500016,s1,"The place was absolutely beautiful, wide range of places to eat at quite affordable prices"
c2500016,s2,Downside is that the service on the gaming floor is very poor
c2500016,s3,I had the service light on for over 15 minutes to get some water and no one ever came to me
c2500016,s4,At one point the machine malfunctioned and it took over 5 minutes for someone to come and fix it
c2500016,s5,"If we had not asked a lady carrying drinks about it, I think we would have been left in the same situation as above and been waiting indefinitely for someone to come by"
c2500016,s6,I visited about half a dozen casinos during my time here and this was the absolute worst in terms of service
c2500016,s7,It would be 2 stars if it weren't for the fact that the interior of the building is one of the most beautiful here
c2500017,s1,I had my 8 month old daughter with me during my stay and visit last year
c2500017,s2,"While walking through the Shoppes, my daughter has dirties her diaper"
c2500017,s3,I took her immediately to a (male) bathroom to find no changing table is available
c2500017,s4,"I walk back outside and locate a staff, who tells me there is a family room very far from where I am"
c2500017,s5,"He could not tell me the exactly location, only the direction"
c2500017,s6,"After walking a few minutes, holding a baby with dirty diaper"
c2500017,s7,The overhead signage does not show there is a family room
c2500017,s8,I find another staff who did not know the location of the family room
c2500017,s9,We walk some more and could not find another staff to ask directions to the family room
c2500017,s10,Fifteen minutes have passed and I don't want to risk moving around more and have the diaper overflow onto…
c2500018,s1,Yea it dose not worth it
c2500018,s2,the room are outdated
c2500018,s3,"old style , sure you can not compare it with the one in Vegas, very crowded and so noisy"
c2500018,s4,you can book with any 5 stars hotel in the neighborhood
c2500018,s5,very expensive compared with the quality of the hotel
c2500019,s1,Very high-end place
c2500019,s2,"Gondola is expensive, hence not really worth it"
c2500019,s3,"I have been to the Venetian in Las Vegas many years ago, so yeah more or less the same except for the crowd (like millions of people at night in Venetian Macau)"
c2500019,s4,"Overall, it was okay"
c2500020,s1,The Venetian Hotel in Macau is one of the oldest hotels and this you experience by the  smell of moist in the venue
c2500020,s2,"The rooms are extremely spacious but ""dated"""
c2500020,s3,The decoration is as it was 20 years ago
c2500020,s4,"The beds are huge and the mattresses are medium-hard, yet comfortable"
c2500020,s5,The pricing is a bit expensive for what you get
c2500020,s6,"If you prefer a more modern decoration and/ or prefer high level of cleanness, I recommend to look around at the other hotel, but if you like to have an extremely spacious room, The Venetian is offering you that"
c2500021,s1,The hotel room was comfortable and with good facilities
c2500021,s2,"However, the overall experience was rather overwhelming! The hotel morphed seamlessly between hotel, shopping centre and casino-great if you are into a Las Vegas experience, but maddening if you just want to find the breakfast room"
c2500021,s3,"If you want a bit of a surreal experience, with mock St Mark square and gondolas, this is the place for you!"
c2500022,s1,We stayed here for NYE as a 1 night trip from the rest of our trip in Hong Kong
c2500022,s2,"I think if you have been to Vegas, Macao will be pretty disappointing overall"
c2500022,s3,The Venetian is nice but nothing special
c2500022,s4,"Its a big hotel, the casino is crazy busy and trying to do anything or get out the hotel takes ALOT of time"
c2500022,s5,The rooms are nice an clean
c2500022,s6,We didn't get the view that we had booked which was disappointing
c2500022,s7,"Was it nice yes, would i return no!"
c2500023,s1,The Venetian was all that Ithought it would be
c2500023,s2,The suites are roomy and very comportable
c2500023,s3,Each hotel/casino that we visited was offered a different experience Macau however is void of the energy that one usually finds on the Las Vegas strip
c2500024,s1,We went to Macao for a few days and stayed around the hotels and casino area
c2500024,s2,"Venetian Resort is an astonishing and absolutely luxury hotel but looked very commercial and ""fake"" to us"
c2500024,s3,It looks like you are entering a giant shopping mall where you are sure you are going to waste your money
c2500024,s4,"Go to real Venice on Carnival, you will see that canals are a bit different and romance is another thing"
c2500025,s1,"we Had a suitem, place is extremely busy and very BIG, be prepared to walk many miles to get anywhere! Golden peacock Indian restaurant food and service is very good!!!! please book, tables are limited and gets v bust quickly shuts at 11pm"
c2500026,s1,We booked the Premio Bella Suite
c2500026,s2,"Overall the room is good,  we got  the 2 double beds and with a large sofa"
c2500026,s3,"The room is clean, we love the interior , bathroom has a vanity console table  and a separate bathtub and toilet"
c2500026,s4,We stayed at the Parisian Hotel for two nights and transferred to The Venetian on our third day in Macau
c2500026,s5,"The two hotels are just 5 to 10 minutes away, we just walked tru the connecting hallway going to the Venetian"
c2500026,s6,There is a shortcut way but must pass tru a casino
c2500026,s7,"Not advisable if you have children 21 years below, the guard wont let minors go in /pass tru"
c2500026,s8,Upon check in the line was so long
c2500026,s9,It was terrible
c2500026,s10,"While my family are waiting for me,  there was no place where they can sit or wait, so they are just standing at the lobby"
c2500026,s11,The whole lobby was…
c2500027,s1,I stayed there with family on the weekend
c2500027,s2,The queue for check in and check out is long but they handle it efficiently
c2500027,s3,The room is huge with 2 queen bed and living room
c2500027,s4,I lost my way many times to find the elevator to the room because the  entries blend with the mall
c2500027,s5,"However, I found it good thing so i could explore the mall"
c2500027,s6,I got option to have my international breakfast or chinese lunch and opted to have chinese lunch
c2500027,s7,Not a long queue in the chinese restaurant but had to wait 20 minutes because they didnt let my kids in while i explained them many times my reservation for 2 adults and 2 kids and got the confirmation when checked in that I entitle for 2 adult and 2 kids meal tickets
c2500027,s8,That just ruined my mood for this hotel
c2500027,s9,So my suggestion for the hotel is to provide…
c2500028,s1,Stayed in Venetian for two nights
c2500028,s2,The huge rooms are the only thing positive about the place
c2500028,s3,Check in took so long
c2500028,s4,"They are a 3,000 bedroom hotel so one can just imagine"
c2500028,s5,A lot of Chinese Mainlanders smoking and coughing without covering their mouth
c2500028,s6,Better wear a mask
c2500028,s7,Its just mayhem in the lobby
c2500028,s8,Shouting and talking loudly
c2500028,s9,Requested for non smoking room/floor
c2500028,s10,But still the smoke smell is evident
c2500028,s11,There's a food court and  nice shopping arcade all in one roof
c2500028,s12,But can get the feeling of being claustrophobic
c2500028,s13,"Again, too many people coughing around"
c2500028,s14,Was almost ripped off by a taxi who refused to use the meter
c2500028,s15,It was a good thing the Venetian staff warned us about such cons
c2500028,s16,"Thanks to all the Filipino staff, especially Rose of the concierge for being…"
c2500029,s1,This is definely a resort with great facilities and manmade art building and pieces
c2500029,s2,You can see a small Venice life style here
c2500029,s3,"Maybe the hotel is too big and staff is too many, the service average is under expectation, but you cannot say it's low"
c2500029,s4,We see the sands group brand so we expect more
c2500029,s5,"Anyway, this place is the one you must visit when you come to Macau"
c2500030,s1,I stayed at the Venetian for a weekend away in Macau and was disappointed
c2500030,s2,The location was nice and it was close to other resorts and shopping areas
c2500030,s3,The casino was huge and it was fun to gamble a bit
c2500030,s4,"The hotel in general was gigantic and it was hard to find my way around, even with a map"
c2500030,s5,"My friends and I booked a nonsmoking room, but our room smelled smoky when we were in it"
c2500030,s6,"I contacted hotel service so they could fix the problem, but they did nothing"
c2500030,s7,"All of our clothes, sheets, and towels smelled like cigarette smoke"
c2500030,s8,We ordered new towels and pillows to the room our second night because of the smell and it took over 45 minutes for an employee to bring us our new towels/pillows
c2500030,s9,"Though it was a nice hotel, I would chose a different place to stay at next time"
c2500031,s1,I know it wasn’t in the USA but apart from the building nothing was like the Venetian in Vegas
c2500031,s2,It was aimed definitely at the Asian market (no problem with that) but it didn’t really suit us
c2500031,s3,"Difficult to find a bar (one in the hotel) food court was a fast food heaven so good for the young people, and some restaurants (definitely recomend the Italian but you have to hunt for it"
c2500031,s4,"Casino disappointing, lots of people sitting on phones not really bothered with the casino aspect, again maybe an Asian focus on gambling here whereas Vegas is more fun"
c2500031,s5,Not sorry we went but nothing like the real thing
c2500031,s6,Think the disappointment with Macau itself may have biased our view of the hotel
c2500031,s7,Staff were friendly and mostly tried to help with problems we had
c2500032,s1,My trip was in October 2018 and have reserved a room for 3 people (1 king bed with sofa bed) for my family
c2500032,s2,"As the hotel has my reservation record of 3 guests name, and the staff in front desk also acknowledge the information, I expect the hotel should get ready 3 sets of all amenities (such as tooth brush, towel, pillow, water, & most important slippers!) in the room before assigning or even check in the hotel"
c2500032,s3,This is a little bit disappointed that a luxury hotel should not have such service
c2500032,s4,Should not let the guest ask for more if something that the hotel already knows
c2500032,s5,"Luckily, the housekeeping attendant in the corridor do a great help for us! Really appreciate her help!"
c2500033,s1,"Let’s start with the good things, check in was smooth, used express check in to avoid the wait reported by some"
c2500033,s2,Requests for non-smoking and a high floor were both met and a late check out was offered
c2500033,s3,"The hotel although very busy is well presented and clean, the facilities are excellent"
c2500033,s4,Everywhere we ate was to a good standard
c2500033,s5,"The room did however still smell of smoke a bit, we didn’t report it as it was only 2 nights and an effort to move, also the toilet wasn’t working but was fixed swiftly on request"
c2500033,s6,"Not a problem really  At this point I was happy with the stay, checkout however was very disappointing"
c2500033,s7,"First of all they couldn’t work out the bill, this carried on for over 10 minutes with a supervisor being called (it wasn’t complicated)"
c2500033,s8,Then it emerges that the…
c2500034,s1,The hotel is huge but overly crowded with many many tour groups
c2500034,s2,The lobby is very congested like a busy train station
c2500034,s3,"I booked directly on their website for one night, 2 queens beds that includes early 10am checkin and late 4pm check out"
c2500034,s4,"However when I arrived 11am at the West end lobby, the worker who guides visitors at the checkin desk informed me there’s no checkin allowed till 12pm and disallowed anyone approaching the checkin desk, even after I explained to him that I completed the online checkin registration with QR code and received email confirmation on the express checkin"
c2500034,s5,I still complied and returned to checkin in the afternoon instead
c2500034,s6,"During the checkin, they even tried to deny my late checkout privilege that was included in my booking because she explains…"
c2500035,s1,"Everything and more than we expected, was our room"
c2500035,s2,We'll be back
c2500035,s3,"The Venetian has so much to see and do, wide choice of restaurants, and entertainment options"
c2500035,s4,We were there for a concert and found the convenience and welcome most encouraging
c2500036,s1,Had a good stay here for around a week
c2500036,s2,"The room is spacious and mostly clean, except that the bed seems to have bed mites (I got two bites in my arm during my stay, asked the sheets to be changed twice but didn't happen), the room/curtains is a little dusty because it triggered my allergies, and the toilet doesn't seem to be cleaned that well because it doesn't smell so good even after housekeeping has supposed to be cleaned it"
c2500036,s3,The room service and housekeeping are responsive and polite
c2500036,s4,The gym is perfect with complete equipment and helpful staff
c2500036,s5,The pool is not that ok
c2500036,s6,"A large part is under renovation, while the rest of the pool areas has an unpleasant smell"
c2500036,s7,The shops and restaurants are excellent
c2500037,s1,Beautiful and nice hotel but the front desk person was not friendly when I made check in
c2500037,s2,The room  was big and clean
c2500037,s3,The bed was very comfortable and I had very good sleeps for two nights
c2500037,s4,The only drawback for the room facility was water pressure was pretty low for the shower
c2500038,s1,Perfect place to stay when you visit macau
c2500038,s2,The room is amazing and everything luxurious
c2500038,s3,We got north suite wing Easy to reach from ferry terminal
c2500038,s4,Varies of food from different country easy to find
c2500038,s5,"Discount from may brand of world best product must be interesting for shopaholic We haven't try the casino yet, i'm sure that must be as good as the other facility We'll be back someday👍👍👍"
c2500039,s1,Can’t figure out what’s so specially that people rave about this hotel
c2500039,s2,No complimentary water from 2nd day No door bell so can barely hear the door knock  Need to understand the reason why it’s so famous
c2500039,s3,You have to walk for a long time to search your room
c2500039,s4,to figure out your way through shops
c2500039,s5,Pool on one end which has a huge walking stretch
c2500039,s6,No proper sign board for how to reach the pool or gym   Room service takes very long maybe since the hotel is so spread out
c2500039,s7,No personal touch at all
c2500039,s8,Far from any hospitality   Only helpful staff was Ms Yo-yo who was kind enough to connect to front office and help us with express check out
c2500039,s9,If it was as not for her we would be struggling from north to south side and then to west side and would have missed our ferry  Luggage chaos and…
c2500040,s1,You need to make guests feel safer
c2500040,s2,"Security system should be upgraded, I think"
c2500040,s3,You know how the venetian in LV maintains his security and why don't you learn it? The casino is opened without fence but security guards do their works very well to keeps all the guests grounded
c2500041,s1,"A good hotel as it is, but not outstanding considering the value and price that I paid"
c2500041,s2,"The room was very nice, but again it fit with the price"
c2500041,s3,What let me down is the overall experience: the hotel did not make me feel that it is such a special privilege to be the hotel guest
c2500041,s4,I felt just like a mall/casino visitor spending the nights at the hotel with no-added value
c2500041,s5,Some bad points I experienced: 1
c2500041,s6,Long queue and time for check-in
c2500041,s7,It probably took more than 30mins to wait for the queue and the check-in process was no better
c2500041,s8,No place to seat when queuing and only bottled water provided
c2500041,s9,2
c2500041,s10,Average breakfast
c2500041,s11,"As a 5-star hotel where international people gathers plus the price, I expected much better breakfast buffet"
c2500041,s12,"It was not really bad, but should have more varieties"
c2500041,s13,I…
c2500042,s1,"good- service is good,staff is profession , room very clean,wifi well connection, check in e channel and wetsite cannot work in order , so I need to use time to check in at the counter complain - without free mini bar ,bad smell from the lift , too late for pick up the room"
c2500043,s1,Strong smell of repair's paint because there is no openable window
c2500043,s2,Not asking you need the take the locker key when you need to change in the pool
c2500043,s3,The price of the food court are too high
c2500043,s4,"However, the room is big and tidy"
c2500043,s5,Check in and out process is quick and nice
c2500044,s1,It's not a good experience in this hotel
c2500044,s2,The room is really really duty
c2500044,s3,There are obviously stains on the floor and the cleaner is careless the last customer underwear still in the toilet Disgusting
c2500045,s1,"Me and my friend had a 1 night stay at this hotel, and i can say we really enjoyed it"
c2500045,s2,"The staff are friendly and nice the room is really nice, easy to walk to the sights, good for shopping and eating but a bit pricey"
c2500046,s1,"Efficient check in and out, convenient for shopping and dining"
c2500046,s2,"Weak is too crowded, many tourists and luggage walk around you"
c2500046,s3,Ideal hotel for shopping and eating but not relaxing
c2500046,s4,Too noisy at the lobby
c2500047,s1,ok we stayed here for one night to get the experience and stay in a suite
c2500047,s2,the suite was nice
c2500047,s3,hotel nice
c2500047,s4,"but lets face it, with that many people and that many rooms you are really just another number through the door"
c2500047,s5,when your gaming its hard to find a waiter to bring you a drink
c2500047,s6,theres just so many people
c2500047,s7,"for the price, we could have stayed at the sheraton across the road in a suite and be recognized as gold members"
c2500047,s8,the hotel complex itself is MASSIVE
c2500047,s9,we went to watch a show and took about 20 mins to walk from the room to the show
c2500047,s10,they don't do last minute deals
c2500047,s11,only advance specials which is weird
c2500047,s12,was great to have the experience but will choose elsewhere next time
c2500048,s1,"Humongous, Luxurious and what not in terms of adjectives, but trust me it’s a OK experience being here"
c2500048,s2,"Check in starts at 1PM, and for the first time in my life stood in a queue for good 45 mins to get myself a room, the lobby resembles more to a railway station / bus terminal, people not staying around just roaming around with suitcases and luggage"
c2500048,s3,"Huge shopping complex and overcrowded, it looks more of a marketplace than a HOTEL"
c2500048,s4,Golden Peacock an Indian Restaurant was the only good experience at this place apart from the Spa
c2500048,s5,Not recommended due to the crowd
c2500049,s1,Stayed one night with my girlfriend for the Bruno Mars concert
c2500049,s2,We had a bit of an issue with our room when we arrived
c2500049,s3,There was hair from someone else on our bathroom floor which immediately dampened our excitement for the room as it makes you wonder how throughly the room has actually been cleaned
c2500049,s4,"Our toilet was also not working at first, but was fixed promptly after a call to the front desk"
c2500049,s5,Besides from that the rooms are very big and spacious
c2500049,s6,"The Resort was a bit too crowded and loud for our liking, and the experience with our room ruined it a bit for us"
c2500049,s7,"But if you don't mind the crowds, it is a well run resort with very friendly and helpful staff"
c2500049,s8,The resort is huge with lots of entertainment and shopping and is also located in a pretty good spot
c2500050,s1,I asked for a non smoking floor
c2500050,s2,"Once settled, the hallway suddely  filled with cigarette smoke"
c2500050,s3,Well what do you expect from uneducated Chinese people
c2500050,s4,"Don't get me wrong, i am chinese but there are still so much of us who don't seem to have any Emotional Quotient  nor care"
c2500050,s5,"I like their express check out, just put in your keycards in the box then off you go"
c2500050,s6,(If you do not have a deposit) Your breakfast can also be used as lunch on selected restos in case you wake up late
c2500050,s7,"I recommend buffet lunch at the ""Bambu""  Go to places with their free shuttle services from hotel to hotel"
c2500050,s8,Free Airport shuttle at the main lobby
c2500050,s9,Really saves you a lot on transpo expense!   Room was great and spacious!  Tip for a
c2500050,s10,great view and shorter walks to the room
c2500050,s11,Ask for higher floor & closer to…
c2500051,s1,The property probably needs reinventing
c2500051,s2,Needs to modernise in terms of technology as well as appeal in my opinion
c2500051,s3,Only impressionable feature remains the design at level 3
c2500051,s4,Rest of the hotel and staff seem bored and unenthusiastic
c2500052,s1,"Perhaps the mattress is some old, did not have a good sleep and feel tired in the next day"
c2500052,s2,The shampoo and bath shower were forgotten to change for the new room guests
c2500052,s3,Those bottles surface were some dirty and they are empty
c2500052,s4,That made me have a feelings of not clean and care the guest enough
c2500052,s5,Thanks!
c2500053,s1,Premio Bella Suite - Normal facilities and minibar - no espresso machine
c2500053,s2,"The property is overwhelming huge, which also draws huge crowds"
c2500053,s3,Feels almost overcrowded at times compared to its competitors
c2500053,s4,The room entrance (Hotel Suites North) is far from check-in location and you will need to bypass the casino
c2500053,s5,Rooms are okay and as expected - looks exactly like the photos
c2500053,s6,Would say that they are slightly dated/average for its price point
c2500053,s7,The level of English oriented service over the phone (house keeping/in-room dining) needs an overhaul unfortunately
c2500053,s8,Difficult to communicate with certain departments over the phone for normal services
c2500053,s9,As competitors along the strip offer a better overall package and service - it is unlikely for us to be making a return stay here
c2500054,s1,Stayed at the Venetian Macao in a Family Suite for one night visiting from Hong Kong
c2500054,s2,It was the Easter Weekend and hotel must have operated at high capacity
c2500054,s3,Check-in went smooth despite the huge crowds of people everywhere
c2500054,s4,The suite itself was indeed very nice
c2500054,s5,"Spacious, clean with very nice bathroom amenities"
c2500054,s6,Having booked a family suites we were positively surprised to see kids amenities like rubber ducks and small slippers
c2500054,s7,The value for money was not the best
c2500054,s8,"You already have to pay a high price for the room itself, all food outlets are ridiculously expensive for a casino resort"
c2500054,s9,They even try to charge for storage of baggage which I never ever saw at any hotel anywhere before
c2500054,s10,The staff was nice throughout
c2500054,s11,For my taste there were just too many guests and visitors…
c2500055,s1,One can try hard enough but this place won’t be able to match the original in Las Vegas
c2500055,s2,"The poor quality of the workmanship shows every where - from the driveway to the toilets, lobby, entrance, and the shops"
c2500056,s1,We planned a staycation and picked the Venetian since it was not bad according to our last stay
c2500056,s2,The property is not new and aged normally but good that the rooms are renovated
c2500056,s3,The new deco is more neutral in style
c2500056,s4,Two things disappointed us
c2500056,s5,"We book a non-smoking room but the corridor on our floor were full of smoking odor, indeed it happened on the corridor of 8th floor (the gym)"
c2500056,s6,The second thing is we were given late check out at 2pm as told when we checked in
c2500056,s7,"But then, on our check out day in the morning, a reminder phone call rang to tell us our check out time was 11am"
c2500056,s8,We simply ignored it as it was a recording that we thought it is some automatic thing
c2500056,s9,"At around 11am, someone tried to open our room door while we were still in our room"
c2500056,s10,I called the…
c2500057,s1,This is a nice 4-star class hotel
c2500057,s2,"We had a family suite which was a lot of fun for my daughter, but for the service aspect, it took over an hour to check in, then we were given keys that didn’t work"
c2500057,s3,Had problems constantly trying to charge things to the room
c2500057,s4,Had to call management up to the room after 3 phone calls to the front desk to rent a movie in room
c2500057,s5,"Not sure what the issue was and the staff tried to accommodate, but overall it seemed to lack great management—there needs to be a special staff dedicated to suite guests"
c2500057,s6,Hotel could also use renovation
c2500058,s1,"This is my experience as a Californian in Macau, so take it for what it's worth"
c2500058,s2,"If you are a gambler and find yourself in Hong Kong, it might be worth a quick trip over"
c2500058,s3,The ferry runs frequently from several locations including the airport
c2500058,s4,"Macau is a strange island that  is a bad recreation of Las Vegas - there, I said it"
c2500058,s5,"Now, the Las Vegas Venetian is a very bad imitation of Venice Italy, but it's done with a certain amount of care"
c2500058,s6,The Macau Venetian doesn't come close
c2500058,s7,"Again, if you like to gamble and want to experience a little bit of Las Vegas on the other side of the world - this may be for you"
c2500058,s8,Lots of tourist groups were headed there and looked thrilled
c2500058,s9,"The rooms were similar to the Venetian LV in terms of layout, but is was all a little on the cheap"
c2500058,s10,The…
c2500059,s1,"The Macau venetian is a replica from the Las Vegas Strip, owned by the same company (as in 2018) the Las Vegas Sands Group"
c2500059,s2,"The hotel is just a walk away from the historical centre of Taipa that is actually very surprising as I was not expected to visit the Venetian, but the direct escalator actually drove me though because I was very curious on the mall area with the venetian style and river-side"
c2500059,s3,"From the outside, the Venetian appeared to be much like one block though with a Venetian clock tower on the right side that may give a hint  on what you see inside"
c2500059,s4,I founded it -as not hotel visitor- relatively easy to get access to the Venetian as one part (the upper floor via the main lobby) is in fact a shopping mall and the rest is a casino and a hotel area with pools where…
c2500060,s1,Overall satisfactory except for room noise and ventilation
c2500060,s2,The size of the hotel is too big to find
c2500060,s3,I would like to have a more intuitive map
c2500060,s4,"I would like to praise the kindness of the staff, and the cleanliness of the rooms is satisfactory"
c2500061,s1,Booked the place online
c2500061,s2,This was our 3rd visit to the Venetian Macau
c2500061,s3,All good except the really long check in wait times  It will take you a good 1-1
c2500061,s4,5 hrs in line before you get to reception
c2500061,s5,Hotel simy does not have enough counters to handle the volume of guest that come in
c2500061,s6,For the premium pricing that you pay it does not feel like 5 star service  Property is still good however it's getting old
c2500061,s7,"Next time we might try one of the newer hotels at the strip - The Parisian , St Regis, etc  FYI - my experience was on a Sun-Mon so weekends could be worse"
c2500062,s1,I was check-in at the west lobby
c2500062,s2,"To family with toddler, the lobby and the concierge are not close"
c2500062,s3,And I'd like to get gondola discount ticket for hotel guest
c2500062,s4,A bed in the room is too small for family with a child
c2500063,s1,"there are room very cleaning but many furnitures are old Papa Dons - Good Pizza and Pasta dishes with something for all the family, you will usually have a couple of cats watching you eat here this is not a problem for us or most people"
c2500063,s2,"However one bratty teenager in another party freaked out whenever a cat went near her, was probably some sort of rodent in a previous life, she made enough noise that they gave her a wide berth"
c2500063,s3,But if this is an issue for you be aware
c2500064,s1,This location and hotel was always on bucket list
c2500064,s2,be careful what you wish for! What nobody tells you is that just getting there from HK is a mission in itself
c2500064,s3,From craziness of the terminus in HK and long waiting to the same at the other end
c2500064,s4,To be fair the 1 hour ferry ride was pretty smooth
c2500064,s5,Once you arrive at the venetian you have to walk 200 meters to a very disorganised and understaffed check-in
c2500064,s6,It took us 1 hour to check as the rooms were not ready and it was 4pm
c2500064,s7,The rooms however are exceptional and the only saving grace for this enormous and impersonal hotel
c2500064,s8,"The two restauarants we tried were good too, the Indian and the pub"
c2500064,s9,But in the hotel there is nobody to help you or guide you
c2500064,s10,The gondolas were closed every time we went and the shops are all overpriced
c2500064,s11,The…
c2500065,s1,The Venetian Macao Resort Hotel is one of a must to go when in Macao
c2500065,s2,"Everything you need is here; shopping, leisure, casino, park, hotel and many more"
c2500065,s3,Though the price is too costly but its Instagram worthy and very photogenic
c2500066,s1,It took us 45 minutes to check into the Hotel
c2500066,s2,We stayed for two nights
c2500066,s3,Other than that the stay was comfortable and the property is impressive
c2500066,s4,The room was luxurious
c2500066,s5,"There is only one Indian restaurant in the entire premises ""Golden Peacock "" which is highly priced! The food court has a large number of choices sans Indian food"
c2500066,s6,"The only other vegetarian option was ""Pizza Pizza"" which had a few vegetarian choices"
c2500066,s7,The Staff in the food court should be trained to treat tourists with respect
c2500066,s8,Most of the responses were curt and rude
c2500066,s9,The other Hotel staff is usually helpful
c2500066,s10,"The cleaning in the room was pathetic, the tables were left dirty and the Coffee cups were not cleaned the next day"
c2500066,s11,I guess it is time to start considering other options in Macau
c2500067,s1,"Spent two nights here in their Bella Deluxe Suite locates ar Hotel Suite South, the suite is rather generously sized, facilities were good enough"
c2500067,s2,"One of the TVs (at the sitting area) wasn’t working, we called in and the technician came within 10mins"
c2500067,s3,"The lady attending customers at the Lobby was quite helpful, but on the other hand, the lady assisting at the express checkout kiosk appeared to be rather impatient"
c2500067,s4,"Also it was quite common in HK that they will jot down the taxi’s registration number and hand it to you when they hail a taxi for you, just in case you need that information to file a complain or whatever"
c2500067,s5,"We got scammed by the taxi on our ride to the city, if only the hotel staffs had helped us jotted down those information, it would’ve become useful in this…"
c2500068,s1,"Rooms were huge, nice pool area but in room amenities and housekeeping sub standard"
c2500068,s2,Lack of attention to detail
c2500068,s3,There were 3 of us in a room and only 2 towels were provided
c2500068,s4,Housekeeping did not top up used amenities the following day
c2500068,s5,It does get crowded with lots of groups of tourists from China who are there for the Casino
c2500068,s6,Also I do not understand why it takes 1 month to release the deposit taken from credit card
c2500068,s7,Check in process took too long
c2500068,s8,Took nearly 30 mins to check in not counting the wait time in line
c2500068,s9,Checkout was a breeze though
c2500069,s1,We came early before the check-in and left our luggage to the lobby
c2500069,s2,The check-in was at 3 o’clock
c2500069,s3,We spend few hours gambling and shopping and then came back to the main lobby for the check-in
c2500069,s4,We had reserved a non-smoking room for 4 people
c2500069,s5,They asked if we would like a smoking room or non-smoking and ofcourse we wanted a non-smoking because that’s what we paid for
c2500069,s6,They only had smoking rooms ready at the time
c2500069,s7,(At 3 o’clock) They said that the non-smoking room will be ready for us within an hour and they would send us an SMS when it’s ready
c2500069,s8,The SMS never came
c2500069,s9,"We waited an hour and a half to get our room, still no SMS"
c2500069,s10,"We went back to the lobby to ask about it, got a room from a lover floor"
c2500069,s11,"We asked for a refund but they did not give us anything, not even a proper…"
c2500070,s1,"Though my first impression was bad as we paid for additional day so that even if we reach early morning, we don’t have to wait for check-in time which is 3 PM"
c2500070,s2,"But even though we paid, we were not allowed by them and were asked to wait"
c2500070,s3,"Apart from this inconvenience, our stay was really awesome as we booked suite rooms for all the guest ( north suite )"
c2500070,s4,"There are many restaurants to cater to all Kind of tastes but I would recommend to try Golden Peacock, cafe deco etc"
c2500070,s5,There is gandola ride on the first floor which will cost you around MOP 128 per person
c2500070,s6,Please keep a note of their check-in time otherwise you might have to experience same inconvenience which we experienced
c2500070,s7,My guests were really upset
c2500070,s8,Good luck
c2500071,s1,Weird hotel in a weird part of town
c2500071,s2,It’s a typical casino hotel so it’s cavernous
c2500071,s3,The casino feels strangely depressed and grim with a few half-hearted punters gathered silently around the tables
c2500071,s4,The suites are very large and very unimpressive
c2500071,s5,People seem to smoke in the rooms here
c2500071,s6,The corridors reek of nicotine despite the no smoking signs
c2500071,s7,The decor is supposed to replicate Venice
c2500071,s8,It does in a cheap and cheesy way
c2500071,s9,Save this place for the conferences and the hordes of Chinese tourists traipsing through the corridors
c2500072,s1,We stayed here for a mix of business and holiday trip and having stayed in many hotels around Macau in previous visits we decided to try somewhere new
c2500072,s2,"We weren’t very impressed with the 30 mins wait to check in and that even though we had one of the top suites, we weren’t allowed to use the VIP area"
c2500072,s3,"However after I complained about having to stand so long, we were eventually moved into the VIP area and checked in"
c2500072,s4,"The manager also gave us a complimentary meal in the local restaurant as an apology for having to stand so long, so that was sorted"
c2500072,s5,The room was an amazing size for the money and fitted our mixed us needs perfectly
c2500072,s6,Unfortunately there was building works going on and so we had to move to another floor but same layout room
c2500072,s7,After a few days we then had problems…
c2500073,s1,"As we heard if u r going macau,u must stay at venetian"
c2500073,s2,So we decided to stay there
c2500073,s3,Very first thing when we reached there
c2500073,s4,it was long almost an hour queue for check in
c2500073,s5,People in group were just sitting on the ground and eating their own food
c2500073,s6,no one offered water also
c2500073,s7,after a long wait we reached in our room
c2500073,s8,And luggage came after an hour
c2500073,s9,Very pathetic service
c2500073,s10,Rooms r big
c2500073,s11,Only few tv channels
c2500073,s12,Most of them advertising their own hotels
c2500073,s13,We saw many gujrati and indian people but food court dosent have any indian restaurants
c2500073,s14,golden peacock had 2 hour waiting
c2500073,s15,its very costly  too
c2500073,s16,Kids playing  area is small
c2500073,s17,they charge 130 HKD  for 2 hour
c2500073,s18,air hockey was not working there
c2500073,s19,staff is rude
c2500073,s20,After one hour they started asking my son how much time he has now?
c2500073,s21,House…
c2500074,s1,"Well, it was my first time to had vaca in Macau and we have stayed in Venetian"
c2500074,s2,Compare to the Venetian in Las Vegas
c2500074,s3,Venetian in Macau I do not feel that much comfortable
c2500074,s4,"First of all, Chinese people do not treasure this brand in whole world"
c2500074,s5,"They are making good money by the NAME of Venetian Second, the view of Venetian Macau, it is just normal, because outside is all the buildings, including St"
c2500074,s6,Regis and others
c2500074,s7,People barely to feel energy and passion in this city
c2500074,s8,"Third, inside facilities is just ok"
c2500074,s9,"Most of people go shopping and eating, to be honest"
c2500074,s10,"boring and so typical Asians!!! Of course, it is still well for some visitors but not for me"
c2500074,s11,"Because if you are looking for some quality vacation, this place just average"
c2500075,s1,It is a fake replica of Vegas one However the facilities are nice especially the pools Room is fine with good view  Breakfast is horrible
c2500075,s2,"Tried the yoghurt was acid, no western food only Chinese or Hindu type but always a step below the expectations  Definitely we will go somewhere else in Macao next time"
c2500076,s1,Unless you are into gambling or heavy shopping then this is not the resort for you
c2500076,s2,The venetian is part of the Sands complex in Macao which has 4 resort casinos all theme based
c2500076,s3,The Venetian as the name suggests is built around the design of venice with a grand canal on the 3rd floor that circumnavigates the building shopping complex and includes the mandatory gondolas with the singing gondaliers
c2500076,s4,Next door is the Parisian
c2500076,s5,Guess what
c2500076,s6,It has an Eifel tower
c2500076,s7,All very kitch and interesting for about an hour
c2500076,s8,Then there are the casinos
c2500076,s9,Bets start at 500HK dollars at the cheap tables and go up
c2500076,s10,Now to the rooms
c2500076,s11,First look they are great
c2500076,s12,Then you notice the mould in the bathrooms and the fish smell from the air conditioning and the stains in the carpets and the subtle…
c2500077,s1,"Whilst everything about the Venetian looks absolutely spectacular, staying there highlights that it is very avearage as a 5 star reaort"
c2500077,s2,"If you are orphaned in the North wing suites as we were, it is a ten minute walk to everywhere, all the services and facilities are in the South wing, and it is very frustrating tomhave to walk 800 mtrs to the pool, 800 metres to receprion, 800 metres to any restaurant etc etc etc"
c2500077,s3,"SO if you stay herw, demand the South suites, as the North suites are like the forgotten slums"
c2500077,s4,Other gripes including waiting for a shuttle from anpther Sands resort to the Venetian  for 45 minutes (when they supposedly run every 5-15 minutes)
c2500077,s5,"Booking a Sands linked show,  only to find they booked you into the wrong time (after being held 45 minutes waiting for…"
c2500078,s1,"There is no doubt that the Venetian is grand in every way - the sheer size of the rooms, bathrooms, lobby, etc"
c2500078,s2,looks magnificent
c2500078,s3,But there is a lot left to be desired
c2500078,s4,The check in process is extremely slow
c2500078,s5,"It takes forever to check in, when it should be a simple 5 min process"
c2500078,s6,"Although the check in time was 3pm, we didnt get a room until 5pm"
c2500078,s7,"It is extremely crowded in most public areas, specially the shopping complexes"
c2500078,s8,There are thousands of people who come in to see the hotel and play at the casinos
c2500078,s9,The one good thing is the free shuttle to and from the ferry
c2500078,s10,"All in all, the experience can certainly be improved"
c2500079,s1,I waited for an hour but still waiting for check-in
c2500079,s2,No seats and the staff just keep sending water to us
c2500079,s3,"The hotel Internet access to the wireless network often off the network, very unstable"
c2500079,s4,"In fact, the staff attitude Is very good, smiling and very polite! but really have too much ""waiting"""
c2500079,s5,"This is actually redundant, hoping to improve"
c2500080,s1,"Impressive kitch decoration, very nice lobby, large confortable rooms, charming pools, large choice of restaurants, it tastes like Vegas, but it s not the same"
c2500080,s2,"You will not find anyone to serve you a drink while playing, and if you want to smoke a cigaret, you are obliged to join the smoking room"
c2500080,s3,not very funny in a casino
c2500080,s4,"Finally, the check in was amazingly slow, not professional at all"
c2500081,s1,"We are a family of five, taking 2 rooms, 1 royal suite with a king bed, 1 same room with double queen beds"
c2500081,s2,"The rooms were both very beautiful and spacious, has a study table, medium sized sofa, and a small-medium sized dining table with 3 chairs"
c2500081,s3,"Overall, the rooms were both above average for the price we paid for"
c2500081,s4,"However, I wouldn't say the same for the overall service"
c2500081,s5,"During check-in, the staff who oversee the people going into the queue for check-in was quite rude, didn't explain to us nicely that only one person per room to check-in, and just mildly shove three out of five of the group to the side"
c2500081,s6,"The check-in staff was very nice and accommodation, so that's the good part of it"
c2500081,s7,Can't rate the checkout process as we used the express checkout
c2500081,s8,The worst part was the…
c2500082,s1,"The place is very beautiful , lavish"
c2500082,s2,It took us two days to cover the whole thing and yet I'm sure we've left parts of it unseen
c2500082,s3,It's big it's lavish
c2500082,s4,The casino is good  The Indian food at Golden peacock and cafe decor is very tasty
c2500082,s5,Cafe decor has and Indian cook and we were lucky to eat dal chawal so far away from India  We also saw the in house ice show which was amazing
c2500082,s6,There is a free shuttle to airport  There is fast a d free wifi every part of the hotel with admirable range  Now the bad things
c2500082,s7,There was a very long queue for check in
c2500082,s8,Took us almost an entire day
c2500082,s9,The staff there doesn't know English which was a huge problem
c2500082,s10,"They key cards to our rooms suddenly stopped working so everytime we went out, we weren't sure we would be able to enter back or not…"
c2500083,s1,The hotel itself is fabulous and clearly a lot of effort has been put into designing the place
c2500083,s2,"The family room is really nice, but the top bunk in the kids area was uncomfortable even with an extra mattress"
c2500083,s3,I had asked that the surprise cake for my hubby's birthday came to the room at a certain time but it was over 45min late and when it showed up I was told that they forgot?!!  The pools are ok but would be better if there was more efficient service and more than 4 Chinese snack options
c2500083,s4,"The breakfast buffet was basic, and did not feel like a 5 star at all, more like a large cafeteria"
c2500083,s5,"Overall, a bit of a hit and miss"
c2500083,s6,The room was great and wish I could take that room into a hotel with better service
c2500084,s1,I have stayed in this place for almost a dozen times now
c2500084,s2,This was perhaps the 1st time i felt not so great staying here
c2500084,s3,Some of the reasons : 1) I had booked online for the new refurbished bella suite rooms
c2500084,s4,When we checked in to the room we realised we were given the old set of rooms and they were really bad
c2500084,s5,There was a pungent odour in the room
c2500084,s6,Not sure how hotel missed on giving us the new room in the first instance 2) Water bottles (small ones) which were earlier provided as complimentary are now charged
c2500084,s7,"The toiletries (shampoo, gels etc) are provided very meagrely and quality seems to be a notch lower 3) The staff also seemed to be rude at times"
c2500084,s8,We saw this twice - once when we were to get our luggages into the room and also at time of checking   Positives :  1) In…
c2500085,s1,I will start with saying that I will not be coming back
c2500085,s2,For sure
c2500085,s3,"I was also staying in other 2 hotels in the same price range, one in the same group as Venetian, and the other one in another group, gave me good comparison"
c2500085,s4,"So here it is:  Pros: * Big room (70m2), clean, but nothing new/extraordinary (as it's almost 10 years old I guess) * Cheese cake for my anniversary! A very high quality one"
c2500085,s5,"Super creamy delicious Thanks for Zhanna for organizing it  * Huge mall beneath, if you're planning to do shopping"
c2500085,s6,with lots of food court
c2500085,s7,"(though, I chose to eat at mall in Parisian) * Lots of shuttle options to other places (though, due to walking time inside the hotel might be better by just walk or get a taxi)  Cons: * The hotel is toooo crowded"
c2500085,s8,"So many people, it's like your in…"
c2500086,s1,I stayed in one of the Royal Suites and the room was amazing! Could not fault the room and its amenities at all
c2500086,s2,There is a major problem around the resort at night with 'working girls' at all entrances trying to get in
c2500086,s3,This really cheapened the experience
c2500086,s4,"Macao casino strip was a little sad, no comparison to Las Vegas"
c2500086,s5,"As a westerner and solo female traveler, I found it at times confronting with all the staring and requests for photos"
c2500086,s6,Not in my top 10 of places to visit at all
c2500087,s1,"Here only for the shopping mall, which is incredibly huge but mostly filled with branded shops"
c2500087,s2,Be prepared to spend a lot when you're here
c2500087,s3,"Hotel is not as impressive as its sister Parisian, maybe because it's older in age"
c2500088,s1,"if you look for a caring hotel, definitely this is not the one"
c2500088,s2,they simply provide room and bed
c2500088,s3,just a standard service
c2500088,s4,they will only provide 2 free bottle's of water in room
c2500088,s5,"if you request more (reasonable quantity), they will claim it is their hotel's policy"
c2500088,s6,i can easily get those from casino
c2500088,s7,why not? i request for a kind of plastic laundry bag for keeping my used clothings
c2500088,s8,they said they don't have
c2500088,s9,i think it is quite common that hotel's usually provide
c2500088,s10,even you are not placed inside the room but i think can provide under request
c2500088,s11,maybe of the cost reason and if it is so that i find hotel is too mean then
c2500088,s12,only i praised for is the in room dining that staff are well prepared to set up my table for my breakfast
c2500088,s13,but the food quality is just so so
c2500089,s1,Very very average property
c2500089,s2,Over hyped! Don't go with high expectations! Looks very good in pictures but not so great otherwise
c2500089,s3,Very very crowded and chaos everywhere
c2500089,s4,Food very poor
c2500089,s5,Only Golden Peacock is somewhat bearable
c2500089,s6,Not at all recommended for luxury travellers
c2500089,s7,Only for masses!
c2500090,s1,"After our stay in Hong Kong, we were a little disappointed about the accommodation here"
c2500090,s2,The buffet breakfast that was included was ok at best and a lot of the hot dishes were cold
c2500090,s3,The shopping centre was by far the most amazing!
c2500091,s1,It is a nice hotel but a little crowded
c2500091,s2,Some of the staff are not willing to help
c2500091,s3,There'a lot of restaurants and shopping stores to choose from
c2500091,s4,"The hotel is near the airport, so you can easili get a cab, they also offer free shuttle bus"
c2500092,s1,It's a good hotel to stay during a visit to Macau but I must say it's pretty much over-hyped for the Indians who often stay here after watching IIFA awards
c2500092,s2,"The interiors are amazingly luxurious and artistic but the suites are pretty ordinary with its amenities, which are available in any mid-range 4-star or 5-star hotel"
c2500092,s3,The suites are really big but there is hardly any special facility which is top-notch
c2500092,s4,The toiletries provided by the hotel are a pretty 3-star hotel like even though the toilets are really impressive in size
c2500092,s5,We stayed there for one night and it was almost value for money
c2500092,s6,"However, every time we had to go out or return to our suite, we had to go through the casino and the impolite and rude security guards asked for my wife's passport even though we showed them…"
c2500093,s1,The room was huge and exact replica of the rooms in Las Vegas
c2500093,s2,There was plenty of space to lounge around in and the bed was big
c2500093,s3,The bathroom is big with plenty of space too
c2500093,s4,The service was surprisingly good considering it's size
c2500093,s5,Room service breakfast was adequate but the quality was just ok
c2500094,s1,This hotel is quite beautiful and clean inside
c2500094,s2,The beds are large and comfortable
c2500094,s3,Wifi is fast
c2500094,s4,The staff can be a bit surly
c2500094,s5,However our main gripe is we had a number of items stolen from our room
c2500094,s6,We had left our toiletries and cosmetics out during our 2 night stay and each night we would return to find something missing
c2500094,s7,If it wasn't stolen by the cleaners during the day it was stolen by the staff who came in to turn down the covers at night
c2500094,s8,"Make sure you lock up all of your belongings before you leave your room!  Whilst they offer a safe in the room, you can't fit much in there"
c2500094,s9,and we would never think about locking up toiletries and cosmetics
c2500094,s10,Luckily we did lock up all of our other bags every day prior to leaving
c2500095,s1,The hotel and the entire destination is based on gambling business
c2500095,s2,"Yes, why can't we get a decent breakfast as the same time"
c2500095,s3,The hotel is amazingly luxurious
c2500095,s4,From rooms to entrance to hallways
c2500095,s5,You name it
c2500095,s6,Lunch and dinner dining options were ok -just ok- Breakfst was a serious disaster for non Chinese person
c2500095,s7,"Shame, becasue this was my last impression"
c2500096,s1,"The sheer size and Venetian style decoration is mind-blowing!   The canal sections are iconic with gondola singing, and a wide array of shops and eateries"
c2500096,s2,"Despite not really being a gambler, it was definitely an experience to see the world's largest casino floor"
c2500096,s3,The hotel suites are clean and spacious with classical style decorations
c2500096,s4,"The main downsides of the hotel stay was the over one hour queue to check-in and the lingering smell of smoke in the suite, which is unfortunately sometimes unavoidable"
c2500096,s5,"Despite these points, I would definitely stay again as it is in the heart of an amazingly large entertainment complex"
c2500097,s1,Room is in a fair condition
c2500097,s2,TV reception was not acceptable in this HD era
c2500097,s3,Room service beverage is in a limited choices
c2500097,s4,"Spacious for family, a 10 min walk to town for access to street food and attractions"
c2500098,s1,This is a very busy place! Be prepared for a lot of pushy people
c2500098,s2,Check-in was straight forward enough
c2500098,s3,The hotel is humongous so the walk from check in to the north suites was long (not great when you're jet-lagged!)
c2500098,s4,"When we arrived at our room, the mini bar hadn't been stocked up, and there were dirty sheets left in our room"
c2500098,s5,"For the first hour of our stay, we continually had staff knocking on our door to either inspect or fix the errors"
c2500098,s6,"Not a great start! The casino and shops are unique, there's a Venetian style canal where you can ride a gondola"
c2500098,s7,"Heads up, the hotel/casino has a heavy floral smell all the way through"
c2500098,s8,Not something I liked
c2500099,s1,We stay in Venetian Hotel in Macau for 2 nights in February 2017
c2500099,s2,"Check-in was a nightmare! The moment we arrived at the check-in, we were told that only one person could queue up for check-in as it was extremely busy and there were over approximately 30 people were queuing up for check in"
c2500099,s3,My family have to wait at the check-in area
c2500099,s4,"To described the atmosphere at the check in area, it was like a 'night market'"
c2500099,s5,"There was no seating available for families (which most of the hotels have), those family members were standing and some were sitting on the floor nearby the check in area, it was a chaos!! After a long haul flight, you really don't want to be in that atmosphere"
c2500099,s6,"The moment we reached the hotel counter and witnessed all above, I was thinking of cancelling our…"
c2500100,s1,"Constructed by the same people who made the Las Vegas, but this is not as impressive"
c2500100,s2,"Also, the food court is below average, feeling very stuffy and worth low-quality food"
c2500100,s3,The outside of the building is pretty good though
c2500101,s1,It seems very strange going to a Portuguese founded city now under Chinese control and staying in a replica of a Las Vegas hotel which in turn is modelled on a city in Italy
c2500101,s2,"Amazingly, it all works out!  The hotel and rooms are very similar to that in Las Vegas"
c2500101,s3,The biggest difference though is the ambience of the hotel
c2500101,s4,Folks are here to seriously gamble
c2500101,s5,The vibe of energy and excitement you would find in the Las Vegas counterpart is missing here
c2500101,s6,Also missing are the numerous non-gambling entertainment options and bars you would find in the American counterpart
c2500101,s7,"Finally, I found the food choices lacking in quality"
c2500101,s8,"With some many other big hotel choices available in Macau, the Venetian did not really stand out"
c2500102,s1,It is such a fake replica of Venice that it becomes a place to see
c2500102,s2,"you will find fake facades in venetian style, a replica of Ponte di Rialto and Campanule di San Marco, a small indoor channel with gondolas and fame painted sky, painted ceilings in Italian style a shopping mall and a huge big casino where hundreds of people are gambling and testing their fortune or losing unreasonable amount of money"
c2500103,s1,"oK, so this is a carbon copy of the Venetian in Las Vegas"
c2500103,s2,"It is HUGE, largest casino in the world"
c2500103,s3,PROS: Smallest room is a SUITE in any other hotel in the world
c2500103,s4,Rooms are large
c2500103,s5,"Beds Comfy Pillows comfy Bathrooms have all amenities and are large  CONS: Just too large so it takes a while for everything, even answering phone"
c2500103,s6,"If you are English speaker, not many guides speak English as it caters to Chinese visitors, so not the easiest"
c2500103,s7,No liquor served in Casino
c2500104,s1,"We did not stay here but came just to see the gondolas and the canal, as well as the fake Eiffel Tower at The Parisian next door"
c2500104,s2,It was not a bad way to spend an hour en route to the ferry terminal after a day in historic Macau
c2500104,s3,You could do lots of shopping here if you like designer goods
c2500105,s1,"Good hotel, casino, shops, and food"
c2500105,s2,"Close to and with good connections to the Galaxy, Parisian, Broadway"
c2500105,s3,"They provide a  great bus service around Macau and access to other Casinos (Sands) and the Macau ferry - these buses are regular, modern, fast, and most have WiFi"
c2500105,s4,Staff are friendly and helpful
c2500105,s5,Good free WiFi throughout the hotel
c2500106,s1,The bathroom scales did not work at the beginning -- fortunately the staff changed the battery on the next day
c2500106,s2,The build quality and finish are not top notch
c2500106,s3,There are paint speckles on the bathroom lamp and there are speckles from the silicone joints in the shower cabin
c2500106,s4,The mixer tap of the shower and one towel holder are loose
c2500106,s5,"The hotel's own hair dryer cannot be used in the bathroom, as there are no compatible outlets -- British three-pin plugs for the hair dryer vs"
c2500106,s6,British two-pin shaver sockets in the bathroom
c2500106,s7,One has to go to the bedroom to use it and thus it is not possible to see oneself in a mirror
c2500106,s8,One cannot adjust the strength of the water from the shower head
c2500106,s9,As a man I prefer to clean some body regions more thoroughly than others
c2500106,s10,The toilet is not…
c2500107,s1,I believed it used to be one of the grandest hotel in Macau and fascinating casino with other entertainment sites
c2500107,s2,"However, time flies and refurbishment is required"
c2500107,s3,you can see all the touch up spots in the room
c2500107,s4,"With a lack of amenities, i would rather stay in other 4 stars hotel near by"
c2500108,s1,The hotel is conveniently located and has easy access to an array of restaurants
c2500108,s2,It's a short bus ride to the city centre and there are complimentary transfer services to the airport and ferry terminal to Hong Kong
c2500108,s3,"The rooms, however, are showing signs of wear"
c2500108,s4,"The shower heads are lose and barely functional, the floor reeks of cigarette smoke"
c2500108,s5,"Might be better to stay at one of the newer hotels in the area, since you don't have to stay at Venetian to walk around the hotel grounds"
c2500109,s1,I am writing this while I am still staying at the hotel
c2500109,s2,"Check-in was smooth with staff providing good service and information but I went to use the toilet, the toilet bowl was choked"
c2500109,s3,Called the operator to request them to send a plumber up
c2500109,s4,"After the plumber was done with clearing the toilet bowl, he used the bath towel to win the toilet bowl! How disgusting is that!"
c2500110,s1,Went to Venetian Macau in November 2016
c2500110,s2,Rooms are very old and worn and the shower blocked up after 1 minute
c2500110,s3,"We are gamblers, tables and poker machine and at least, if not more, than 50% of poker machines were out of service!!"
c2500111,s1,Stayed here for 3 nights and the sheer scale of the hotel is simply amazing! Check in was slow despite there having 6-7 front desk counters in service
c2500111,s2,There is limited seating area in the main lobby so our parents have to stand for an hour while waiting for us to check in
c2500111,s3,The front desk service was so so
c2500111,s4,We had 3 rooms and the hotel was quite full so they could not arrange for 3 rooms to be on the same floor
c2500111,s5,"As we were staying for 3 nights, we requested the front desk to check whether there will be any rooms available and they just brush us away saying they cannot check and asked us to call tomorrow morning"
c2500111,s6,Its quite a fair bit of walk to our rooms after check in due to the large size
c2500111,s7,"The rooms are huge with 2 queen beds, 2 tvs, 2 washing basins and a large sitting area"
c2500111,s8,…
c2500112,s1,Stayed 2 nights at the Venetian Hotel staying in the Royal Suite
c2500112,s2,The hotel tries hard to offer something resembling an Italian style experience but fails miserably and comes across as very tacky and not even close to 5 star establishment
c2500112,s3,"Macao in general is just not set up for western visitors, it is purely and simply a gambling mecca for newly enriched Chinese tourists"
c2500112,s4,"Taxi ride from ferry terminal OK, check in process was pleasant although very slow with evident language barriers"
c2500112,s5,The lobby is impressive and you are immediately overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the place
c2500112,s6,However try and find the way to your room and that's when the fun begins
c2500112,s7,You will need a compass and 3 different maps to try and find you way around firstly going through thee gigantic casino area with…
c2500113,s1,Venetian Hotel is very very big
c2500113,s2,Its a huge property with lots of activity
c2500113,s3,But a problem is with huge crowd pass through  the the hotel
c2500113,s4,So hotel or resort must have silent
c2500113,s5,For check in the hotel we have to stand more than one hour in  the quie
c2500113,s6,So its very tired
c2500113,s7,Rooms are very big and class
c2500114,s1,"If you like over the top gold and gilded decoration, decadent splurging on shops and roulette wheels, and walking a lot between parts of the hotel then The Venetian is for you!  The Pluses: The location is very central on the Cotai strip which is good"
c2500114,s2,It's a short taxi to the old town
c2500114,s3,Great nightclub
c2500114,s4,Rooms are very big
c2500114,s5,The Minuses: Most rooms smell of smoke even if they're 'non-smoking'
c2500114,s6,It's a long walk through the casino to get to the rooms
c2500114,s7,Breakfast food was fairly average and on one day the included breakfast was only open to 9am
c2500115,s1,stayed 1 night at bella suite on 24 September 2016
c2500115,s2,Check in process not flexible since cannot doing early check in
c2500115,s3,"We need to checked in on designated time with a long queue, which is not too convenient"
c2500115,s4,"The seating area in lobby is limited, made your accompany frustated while you waiting on queue to be checked in"
c2500115,s5,I stayed on room 19012
c2500115,s6,"the room smells not good, probably the carpet is not well maintained and need replacement"
c2500115,s7,I can see stains on the sofa
c2500115,s8,"Dust is everywhere, seems the room is not cleaned properly"
c2500115,s9,And be aware if you get out from your room at night as maybe you will get teased with hooker on the lift
c2500115,s10,Consider to choose different hotel if you will stay with children as I think this hotel environment is not suitable for family with children
c2500116,s1,This is a big hotel
c2500116,s2,"Not as big as the one in Vegas, but never the less"
c2500116,s3,We arrived here for a 3 night stay from main land China
c2500116,s4,Check in was a long process
c2500116,s5,Took almost 30+ minutes
c2500116,s6,After checking in the luggage took awhile to come to our room
c2500116,s7,I can understand that due to how busy this place is
c2500116,s8,Walking to your room from the reception takes about 10 minutes
c2500116,s9,"The room was nice bit dated but was nice, clean & spacious"
c2500116,s10,Couldn't really ask for more
c2500116,s11,What I would say is that everything in this hotel is expensive
c2500116,s12,"We went for a pub lunch at the bar, 3 burgers & A few beers came to almost £132 GBP"
c2500116,s13,"Not being a gambler I can't really comment, but from what the others told me the minimum hands start around $300 hkd"
c2500116,s14,Not for the faint hearted
c2500116,s15,You can walk to almost all the…
c2500117,s1,south lobby is the area that you need to be at if you are staying in this property
c2500117,s2,"breakfast option is ok, they just change 1 or 2 things in the menu"
c2500117,s3,staying at this property makes you feel like you are staying at a luxury mall
c2500117,s4,"didnt get a feel of hotel really, if you going with kids, you gotta walk more than usual, coz you cannot cross the casino to go to the other side"
c2500117,s5,"room serive is great, room size is good enough to accomodate 4 people"
c2500117,s6,we were taken to the Vip lounge checkin service from the regular que to check in
c2500117,s7,they gave a very sweet toy to my daughter
c2500117,s8,"room service staff is excellent, however people working in the west lobby reception area are a bit un proffesional"
c2500117,s9,"i asked them to make a call to my travel agency who was suppose to pick me up for my excursion, and…"
c2500118,s1,"The hotel is simply overwhelming and very easy to get lost! The decor is opulent and over the top and all directions take you back to the vile casino - funny that! The room was lovely and very comfortable, but the facilities are relatively small given the size of the hotel in terms of the pool and the gym, but they don't want you there, they want you spanking money in the casino!"
c2500119,s1,"I have stayed at 5 star hotels in Las Vegas, and this was nowhere near the standard of those hotels"
c2500119,s2,The room was nice but there was just a lot of the small details that were lacking
c2500119,s3,"For example, there were two TVs in the room, and the batteries were pretty much flat in both the remotes"
c2500119,s4,"As well as that, the shower door didn't close properly, and the shelf in the shower that had the bottles of shampoo etc on them, was concave as it was meant for soap, so as soon as you touched the bottles, they fell over"
c2500119,s5,"Check-in was quick and the member of staff was polite and efficient and the pools were lovely, but it just lacked the finishing touches you would get in a hotel of this class in Europe or the US"
c2500119,s6,The signage in the hotel and the casino was also poor and found myself lost on a…
c2500120,s1,We stayed for 2 nights with our kids (boys 5 and 1 years old)
c2500120,s2,"It was a quick weekend getaway to celebrate our 5 year old's birthday  Service is quite poor, not anywhere close to '5 star' and 'luxury' that this place purports to be: Details below"
c2500120,s3,"Check-in: Was fine, however, no one offered to escort us to our rooms"
c2500120,s4,"The lady at check-in did provide instructions by using a map, however, the hotel is huge and navigating is confusing - an escort to the room would certainly help"
c2500120,s5,Luggage delivery to room within 30 mins was fine though
c2500120,s6,The Royale room: We stayed in the Royale suite
c2500120,s7,By the time we got to our room it was evening and our kids were tired
c2500120,s8,"We ordered room service and the in-room dining staff member who came to set things up was very helpful, courteous and…"
c2500121,s1,Macau is an experience that perhaps is love or hate
c2500121,s2,Dubbed the Asian Las Vegas we found that the Cotai Sands strip was devoted to serious gambling
c2500121,s3,The Venetian is a very different experience to Western hotels but amazing in its grandiosity - this place is seriously big
c2500121,s4,"In fact we got lost a number of times! Our room was very luxurious (beds and pillows were really comfortable), large bathroom, big bath and separate toilet"
c2500121,s5,"Our daughter enjoyed room service and a movie on one of the two large screen tvs one night, but there are quite a few dining options"
c2500121,s6,We went to the casino and were lucky enough to come out ahead
c2500121,s7,"The gambling is serious business and word of warning, it is definitely not dressy"
c2500121,s8,"The shopping is pretty good and the canals and ""Venice"" style shopping mall is…"
c2500122,s1,Good location and lovely large room
c2500122,s2,All the amenities you could want
c2500122,s3,"But the check in queue was one of the longest I have ever experienced, and it's so tedious to have to walk through the casino every time to get back to the hotel"
c2500123,s1,We stayed here as we were attending an event in the hotel
c2500123,s2,"The room was big, comfortable and well furnished"
c2500123,s3,However the toilet blocked and we had to call for it to be repaired
c2500123,s4,At one point there was no hot water
c2500123,s5,The repair guy took a long time to fix the toilet
c2500123,s6,The check in staff were polite but slow and seemed overworked
c2500123,s7,"Given the increasing choice of hotels in Macau, I would choose to stay elsewhere"
c2500123,s8,The Venetian is overpriced
c2500124,s1,Nice hotel with spacious room and huge bathroom
c2500124,s2,Great facilities - great pool & gym
c2500124,s3,However encountered not very pleasant experience when using the lift
c2500124,s4,"imagine with 6 lifts, its take us almost 25mins to get down or long queue to get up"
c2500125,s1,Recently spent 2 nights at this hotel
c2500125,s2,It needs to be seen to be believed
c2500125,s3,When you enter the lobby you get an idea of how massive this place is
c2500125,s4,"But unfortunately that also means lots, and lots of people (but hey it is China)"
c2500125,s5,We queued for 45 minutes to check in and were then told our room wasn't ready
c2500125,s6,It was sorted quickly though and the room was worth the wait
c2500125,s7,"The rooms are huge by hotel room standards, so is the bathroom"
c2500125,s8,Very clean and reasonably maintained
c2500125,s9,"The shopping within the Hotel/Casino complex is fantastic, with everything from designer to chain stores"
c2500125,s10,"There are a couple of restaurants within the complex, and also a food court that is open most of the night if you get the late night munchies"
c2500126,s1,I went with my clients and book into total room of 3
c2500126,s2,"No doubt this is one huge hotel in Macau, room size no question ask big and comfort"
c2500126,s3,But it is getting a bit old fashion because there are so hotel new and nice hotel build up in Macau almost every 6 months
c2500126,s4,"The in room TV is still CRT and no flat LCD, but all that is not really a problem as we only stay for one night"
c2500126,s5,"The next morning breakfast is the biggest issue, the breakfast provided by hotel is located quite far to almost all hotel tower"
c2500126,s6,"The food is horrible, I would say total fit for most mainland Chinese style and not for foreigner"
c2500126,s7,"The cost is very seasonable in Macau, but if you look for slightly cheaper with huge size and little bit luxury, Venetian is still a choice"
c2500126,s8,But don’t ask the package with…
c2500127,s1,"Room is very big if you come with 4 peoples, it is perfect"
c2500127,s2,But feel the room is old decor by the old tv and carpet is thin already
c2500127,s3,The hotel rate is high now compare to many new hotels around there
c2500127,s4,You can have many choices
c2500127,s5,"Overall is still good, since they provide you many shuttle buses, you can go many places in Macau"
c2500128,s1,"We were there, my cousin and me to try our luck at the in-house casino"
c2500128,s2,The hotel is clean with many boutiques covering all the luxury goods you can imagine
c2500128,s3,There are also a few places to eat if you need a break from the cards and dices
c2500129,s1,Expected so much from this hotel from what I heard and read but it was a little disappointing when we got there
c2500129,s2,We entered through the shuttle bus parking entrance and it was super crowded and noisy with tourists from the mainland
c2500129,s3,"The comfort room in that area is a bit dirty and who can blame the cleaning lady, she might not be able to keep up with all the people coming and going"
c2500129,s4,"The shopping area was nice and I enjoyed the free entertainment, like the stilt walkers"
c2500129,s5,"The food court, dined once and didn't like the food at all"
c2500129,s6,The casino was also nice
c2500129,s7,"Overall,  would've enjoyed the place if it wasn't that crowded"
c2500130,s1,I stayed at the Venetian Macau from 18 till 20th April at their Bella Suite - anticipating enough room for my kid and both of us as a couple
c2500130,s2,Venetian is a huge property with various attractions
c2500130,s3,"We were perched at the 35th Floor, with a good view of The Galaxy Resort and flowing river in view"
c2500130,s4,The Furniture and Washrooms are bit old-style with obstructive large doors (it blocks your way as you enter the room)
c2500130,s5,Food is average and complimentary breakfast was a big joke
c2500130,s6,Once there was no ketchup and nobody was able to tell how long will it take to get that on the table/ counters
c2500130,s7,The Refills at the buffet were late and poorly done
c2500130,s8,Golden Peacock Restaurant is a must-visit as this is a Michelin-starred and lives upto its reputation
c2500131,s1,Beautiful recreation of venice within such an enclosed space
c2500131,s2,Simply beautiful architecture Love the casino and the ample shopping available within
c2500131,s3,Its like a whole city within a hotel
c2500131,s4,But thats where all the problems start
c2500131,s5,1st - the rooms are so far out
c2500131,s6,Beware of venturing within the hotel
c2500131,s7,It may take you years to reach your hotel room and you will probably end up sleeping in the common lounge or lobby areas (although one can never figure out which one is which)
c2500131,s8,2nd - you ll have to circle the entire hotel if you dont have ur id with u at all times
c2500131,s9,Since crossing the casino floor is the fastest way to reach far away points in the hotel and you cant enter the casino without an id
c2500131,s10,(Which is only fair from the security perspective)
c2500131,s11,But worse is that if you have…
c2500132,s1,When u stay at the Venetian you've got everything you need !! The food & the entire shopping mall!!! The room is spacious & the amenities were nice! You need to show your key in order for you to be able to approach the guest lift
c2500132,s2,The security should smile more though !
c2500133,s1,The most popular and one of the oldest hotels of Macao
c2500133,s2,Beautiful rooms but the bathroom had some broken shower fittings
c2500133,s3,Difficult to get adjoining rooms in case you travelling in group
c2500133,s4,We almost had to walk for 5-7 mins between the two rooms
c2500133,s5,Being a tourist attraction the hotel is over crowded and hence not much of privacy that one can expect
c2500133,s6,Only 1 restaurant in the entire resort that serves vegetarian food
c2500133,s7,The entire resort is so big that one can easily get lost in the property and definitely be prepared to walk walk n just walk for miles
c2500134,s1,If your vegetarian / vegan / Jain don't opt for breakfast/lunch/dinner in your booking
c2500134,s2,Golden peacock restaurant is great Indian cuisine
c2500134,s3,Staying is advisable only is you are here for gambling
c2500134,s4,otherwise staying at Macau Peninsula ( Wynn ) is preferred
c2500134,s5,the whole cotai strip can be explored in a day
c2500134,s6,most macau cultural things are located at the Peninsula
c2500134,s7,"Taipa is only great for its casinos (except Coloane and taipa village)  Otherwise rooms and hotel (property) is great in terms of its scale and its shopping offerings  Also, due to its popularity the hotel is always too crowded and at times its disturbing when one is on a leisure trip"
c2500135,s1,"Huge place, great casino (though hardly any low stakes tables)"
c2500135,s2,I guess it requires some maintenance since i had visited this place 8 years back as well when it really looked new
c2500135,s3,Not anymore
c2500135,s4,Check in / Check Out a huge issue though the staff is trying their best to make it quick and comfortable
c2500135,s5,Rooms are all suites and good
c2500135,s6,"However, no service whatsoever in the rooms (they claimed that they would charge 450$ just to come and empty my minibar!) All in all the rating is only for the property though it may be better to stay in another hotel which offers some services and maybe spent the day here"
c2500136,s1,This place is simply enormous - the rooms are huge which is great if you need to entertain 10 people (and with two TVs for some reason) but for me it was a bit over the top for a hotel of this standard
c2500136,s2,"To get from one side of the hotel to the other takes a long time, and it is very easy to get lost"
c2500136,s3,"The casino is massive as well, again not really my taste but if you're into that kind of thing you will enjoy it"
c2500136,s4,"The room service and mini bar were extremely expensive, and generally the decor rather erred on the side of tacky"
c2500136,s5,"The indoor gondola is a fun feature, but it is a bit like Las Vegas meets Disney"
c2500136,s6,"Overall if you want somewhere that isnt horribly expensive (by room rate) and has its own casino then it works, but I would look for something a bit smaller with more…"
c2500137,s1,"Depending on what you want out of our holiday, you will either love the Venetian or hate it"
c2500137,s2,It is a very high end hotel and it shows in the decor and scale of everything here
c2500137,s3,The rooms we got were relatively cheap for the type of hotel and the room we got (we paid approx 160USD for a nice fancy large room)
c2500137,s4,The problem is that this is the hotels business model
c2500137,s5,"give out rooms for cheap and get people into their shops/eateries and casinos, and make money off them there"
c2500137,s6,It's the typical Vegas business model and that's fine but it may not be the experience you're looking for
c2500137,s7,The hotel is insanely crowded
c2500137,s8,The check-in area was like a train station and it took us almost an hour to check in
c2500137,s9,The common areas of the hotel are mostly all open to the public and you will…
c2500138,s1,My review of this place is written from my own perspective and it is nothing to do with the resort by itself
c2500138,s2,One of my friend suggested this place and we booked one of the suites for a night stay
c2500138,s3,Pick up from Macau ferry point was very smooth
c2500138,s4,There is a lift one should take to go down to board the bus with your luggage
c2500138,s5,Arrival to the hotel was a big disappointment as we were dropped along with so many tourists from other hotels who come to visit this resort and we were lost
c2500138,s6,There was none to guide us from the bus drop area
c2500138,s7,"One guy came and gave us the luggage tags, Thats it"
c2500138,s8,"So we managed to go inside, pushing aside visitors and saw a line and joined them"
c2500138,s9,Later we realised it is for left luggage
c2500138,s10,Then we were directed to the reception which was quite far
c2500138,s11,Pleasant…
c2500139,s1,If i can remember you can go to the west lobby to hop on th free shuttle bus
c2500139,s2,"the line is so long, make sure to spare about 10-15 minute"
c2500139,s3,You can also store your luggage in the lobby hotel and have to pay 10 MCU for 24hours service (they will ask for your passport)
c2500140,s1,The Resort is a city within a city and is an Exact Replica of Venice and a Bigger Replica of Las Vegas
c2500140,s2,The Rooms are spacious and the hotel lobby is big (In fact they have 2)
c2500140,s3,The only downside is there are just too many people and very difficult to get attention from the staff at the resort
c2500140,s4,Not recommended for people who wants a quiet and luxurious time
c2500141,s1,"The rooms look nice and welcoming, but there was a lot of dust on the furniture"
c2500141,s2,"It's a convenient place to stay with lots of shops and a variety of food at the food court and it's near the Old Taipa Village, which is quite nice to walk around"
c2500141,s3,It is also located near to the other big hotels if you fancy window shopping or trying out different cuisine
c2500142,s1,"I hate to say this, but while it is very good by Macau standards, it is a pale imitation compared to the one in Vegas"
c2500142,s2,The vibe just feels wrong
c2500142,s3,somehow it ends up being tacky and kitschy when done here
c2500142,s4,"The other downside is that once you step out of the hotel, you're facing a hot empty dusty road that leads to nowhere"
c2500142,s5,Which is most definitely not the Strip
c2500142,s6,"Can't blame the hotel, but if you're looking to recreate the Vegas experience, this is most certainly not it"
c2500143,s1,We booked a two day stay in the Rialto Suite hoping for something special
c2500143,s2,They would do well to have a buggy to deliver you to the room as it is a LONG walk from reception
c2500143,s3,The amount of smoke in the hallways was a major put off before we even reached our room
c2500143,s4,"The suite was huge and in its day would have been wonderful, however the hotel badly needs a freshen up"
c2500143,s5,"The in room dining was great, beautifully setup and in good time"
c2500143,s6,The shopping was a real disappointment
c2500143,s7,"Even thought the labels were of a high rep, the sizing was definitely not on par with other major boutiques worldwide"
c2500143,s8,"We booked a room with views over the water, what we actually got was a very ugly aspect overlooking air conditioning units and industrial looking buildings"
c2500143,s9,"If you decide to visit, be prepared…"
c2500144,s1,"Stayed during the lunar new year period, overall a pleasant stay, however hotel is slightly  old but the rooms are huge and good shopping area"
c2500144,s2,Wifi is slow great walking distance to other shopping area
c2500145,s1,"its my 2nd stay at the hotel, the first one is 7 years ago, stayed here again last january when we went to macau and quite dissapointed with the hotel, the room is quite worn out,the furniture is shabby and need some of them need replacement, though we cannot complain about the cleanliness and service in the room, its marvelous! went to the shoppes at venetian and quite dissapointed its not as grand, there's no more carnival or entertainment, some of the shoppes is not well known, i prefer to shop at fourseason or sand's cotai"
c2500145,s2,"i think venetian macau already loose its charm to newer hotel and resort at macau, there's so many newer and more luxurious hotel in macau to choose"
c2500146,s1,Very luxurious big rooms
c2500146,s2,Fully self sufficient resort
c2500146,s3,Nice place to spend a couple of days even if you are not into gambling
c2500146,s4,Would have loved a better collection of pubs/bars
c2500146,s5,"Also, better guidance on navigating through the well spread out place"
c2500146,s6,"Personally, for me the total artificial light mall like atmosphere does depress me after some time"
c2500146,s7,But anyways if you are not using the casino in the basement - there is no point staying here for more than a couple of nights
c2500146,s8,The artificial Venice like shopping facade has good novelty value though some might find it a bit tacky
c2500146,s9,If Macau is your thing
c2500146,s10,Stay here !
c2500147,s1,Went here for a work trip and wouldnt ever pay to go there myself
c2500147,s2,"The hotel is massive and everything is fake, fake marble, fake decoration"
c2500147,s3,Its so big I got lost many times and no one speaks english so directions are useless
c2500147,s4,Food is very average and I was disappointed
c2500147,s5,Rooms are good very large and comfortable
c2500147,s6,Beds are comfortable and bathroom is large
c2500147,s7,"Not really anything on the TV as only 1 english speaking channel which was the ABC  Shopping was good, but expensive and again people dont really speak english so it was challenging"
c2500147,s8,There was only 1 coffee place Starbucks and line was out the door most times of the day
c2500147,s9,Taxi drivers speak no english to communicating where you want to go is also hard
c2500147,s10,Gambling area is huge and was always packed
c2500147,s11,There isnt really any…
c2500148,s1,Had to stay here for a business conference
c2500148,s2,"This is a huge sprawling complex with a casino and hundreds of shops, in addition to thousands of hotel rooms  The hotel is old and the age shows"
c2500148,s3,"Design is Venetian yes, but gaudy"
c2500148,s4,The room is huge and split level
c2500148,s5,"That's nice, but still old"
c2500148,s6,"The 2 TVs are still the obsolete cathode ray tube chunky boxes, which we've never seen in 10 years anywhere"
c2500148,s7,"The shower stall is what I prefer over the bathtub, but the brass shower head is rusty and noisy over 20-30 years' of use  The gym is average size and ok  The restaurants here are pretty average"
c2500148,s8,"The good and michelin restaurants in Macau are elsewhere   Conference facilities are ok, and the congress food ranges from average to poor  Shopping is ok and quite wide ranking from low to…"
c2500149,s1,This is a very large property that shows it's age
c2500149,s2,Rooms are quite large and the setup is very similar to the Venetian Las Vegas with beds on an upper level and a sitting room on a lower level
c2500149,s3,The furniture is on the older side and the hardware designs are also quite dated
c2500149,s4,"Large amours, projector TVs, and old plumbing hardware"
c2500149,s5,The beds were also terribly uncomfortable
c2500149,s6,hard mattress with very flat pillows
c2500149,s7,You really can't compare the Venetian Macau to the Venetian Las Vegas where things are just bigger and badder
c2500149,s8,"Overall, expect check-in and check-out to be similar to large properties"
c2500149,s9,Longer lines and more people
c2500149,s10,All the staff was very friendly and knowledgeable
c2500149,s11,"Most were able to speak Cantonese, Mandarin and English fairly well, although it is clear that…"
c2500150,s1,There are many lobbies and check in counters
c2500150,s2,We checked in at the main lobby
c2500150,s3,There were many people checking in
c2500150,s4,The staff were flat out but still many check ins
c2500150,s5,waited over 10 minutes in a line
c2500150,s6,We had made a reservation in one of the suites
c2500150,s7,After check in we were given the directions to go and we had to cart our own bags through the casino
c2500150,s8,The property is very big
c2500150,s9,Our suite was very big and very comfortable
c2500150,s10,Amenities were average
c2500150,s11,HK was good
c2500150,s12,The casino was very good
c2500150,s13,Security was a bit rude I thought with taking in their own language in front of the guests
c2500150,s14,We ate at the Deco restaurant
c2500150,s15,Average food and service
c2500150,s16,The peacock restaurant food was excellent and service very warm and efficient
c2500150,s17,Shopping is expensive
c2500150,s18,All the other facilities were ok
c2500150,s19,Check out was…
c2500151,s1,"Having gone to the Venetian twice a year since it opened, I'm very underwhelmed by the experience now"
c2500151,s2,"The checkin and walk to the room is fantastic, the rooms are spacious but because of the decor can be dusty, but look dated with the large old fashion tv and furniture"
c2500151,s3,"The staff beyond the reception can be lousy, with varying levels of service, some good and some bad"
c2500151,s4,"Had the worst breakfast experience of my life at McSorleys, it was just disgusting"
c2500151,s5,Yet had a fantastic dinner at Mortons and the staff in the Japanese restaurant are just down right rude
c2500151,s6,I still highly rate the Bellini lounge the live music is excellent and service is fantastic
c2500151,s7,"The elevators to the rooms are frequented by commercial ladies in the evening, but why are they allowed to do that when you…"
c2500152,s1,I could see why people would like it
c2500152,s2,Minimum bids on casino were pretty high so I couldn't bear to join in
c2500152,s3,More for experienced gamblers
c2500152,s4,"The grand receptions are all quite pretty and extravagant and the little Venice was a novelty but it was all a bit theme parky fakey cakey for me, but I wouldn't put anyone off going, if you like shopping and gambling then it's probably fab"
c2500153,s1,We were last here about 3 years ago and the resort is still of a high standard
c2500153,s2,but it has become extremely crowded throughout the Shoppes to the extent of being unpleasant
c2500153,s3,"Part casino and part shopping mall maze on the perimeter where the canals are, though much reduced congestion on the inner shopping area"
c2500153,s4,Definitely worth a visit
c2500154,s1,I did not stay at this hotel but visited the restaurants and other attractions within it
c2500154,s2,Painstaking effort to replicate the Venetian settings I must say
c2500154,s3,The false ceiling mimics the sky and is lit accordingly
c2500154,s4,"This means means it's always ""day"" inside"
c2500154,s5,It can get to you after a while
c2500154,s6,It’s a sprawling campus so the space inside is ample
c2500154,s7,There are all kinds of shops and attractions
c2500154,s8,Including the casino
c2500154,s9,The casinos I must admit are the most disappointing in Macau
c2500154,s10,It’s a farm of tables and slot machines
c2500154,s11,No drama anywhere
c2500154,s12,It reminded me of an open office with a zillion cubicles
c2500154,s13,I spent approximately 15 minutes looking around and made a quick exit
c2500154,s14,"Also everything was in Chinese, most has a minimum starting bet of 500$"
c2500154,s15,Didn't feel like throwing money away at stuff I…
c2500155,s1,The room was grand and had all the amenities one requires
c2500155,s2,"they are the biggest Casino in the world and you can imagine that it was quite crowded, however overall I had a pretty decent experience"
c2500155,s3,Have no comments on the Casino
c2500156,s1,This casino is the mirror image of Venetian in Las Vegas
c2500156,s2,Similar settings with gondolas with singing gondoliers
c2500156,s3,Lots of shopping with high ends shops and varieties of restaurants
c2500156,s4,Did not see any buffet restaurants like the Las Vegas Venetian
c2500157,s1,Ended up staying here one night after losing a passport
c2500157,s2,It was late when we checked in but the staff were pleasant
c2500157,s3,The rooms were massive and there was free wifi in the room which was an added bonus -- too bad it didn't work in the public areas of the casino
c2500157,s4,The grounds are HUGE and the food court has a very wide selection to choose from at very affordable prices
c2500158,s1,Here my compliment about this hotel
c2500158,s2,"Everything is well build its huge and everything canbe purchase here but theres not much signboard to show u where for food where to shop, and since its too big we are getting lost here for the first time"
c2500158,s3,"checkin in is smooth but i can say its a old hotel with carpet and dumpy smell on my room, the whole hotel smells too much of perfume everytime i return to lobby, we stayed in bella suite its four person room but they only provide 3 towels"
c2500158,s4,"And one little bottle shower and shampoo, and more worst is 11am we heard some renovation on going nearby, its not worth for a stay for 1900+\- hkd pernight, casino is very huge, low security, they dont even c your passport while u entering, evelator and escalator is link everywhere and there are more…"
c2500159,s1,Every1 knows about this hotel
c2500159,s2,But number of things are missing when u talk abt this hotel
c2500159,s3,The most important thing is that u don't get the feeling of being important
c2500159,s4,I mean to say when u stay at a lux star hotel one should get that feeling
c2500159,s5,Evwrytime u will see a different staff
c2500159,s6,Different Security
c2500159,s7,Rest all gud with this hotel
c2500159,s8,its a complete city
c2500159,s9,U need not to go outside for any other thing
c2500160,s1,Fantastic room layout
c2500160,s2,Unfortuately not very well maintained
c2500160,s3,Room was dirty and smelt of cigarette smoke and ours was meant to have been a non smoking room
c2500160,s4,There are other hotels within the same complex we stayed in after that were a lot cheaper and a lot nicer
c2500160,s5,The pool area at Venetian was a huge disappointment
c2500160,s6,Personally I'd stay elsewhere after experiencing other hotels
c2500161,s1,"Everyone hyped about the Venetian, so I finally decided to stay here for the weekend during one of my business trips"
c2500161,s2,"Originally, by looking at the photos and feedback from my friends, I was expecting an amazing suite with everything a modern hotel would offer and more"
c2500161,s3,"However, upon check-in, I realised that this is a hotel that hasn't been renovated for 10 years"
c2500161,s4,"One of the TV was a CRT TV!  I haven't seen one of those in years; shouldn't they donate the CRT TV to the Macau Museum?  The wall paper, the carpet, the renovation were all so dated; it did not feel like a luxury hotel that it's positioned itself to be"
c2500161,s5,It's time for the hotel management to gradually renovate and update the rooms
c2500161,s6,"Firstly, if guests are paying HK$3000 per night, you can surely afford to replace the…"
c2500162,s1,We had a small team meeting at the Venetian Macau and I was the organizer
c2500162,s2,"I fully understand it is not easy to manage a large hotel property, but never expect to be that chaotic"
c2500162,s3,I was happy to be checked-in at the VIP area but didn’t expect my room was unable to for accumulation of Sands Rewards Program Points (learned a few days after checked out)
c2500162,s4,"There was a long walk from there to my room, and it had to pass through the crowded casino with my entire luggage"
c2500162,s5,"The room did not disappoint, it was spacious, nice, and clean, with fruit basket waiting on my desk"
c2500162,s6,"On the other hand, the fixtures in the room can tell you it was due for an upgrade as the facilities were good say 7 years back"
c2500162,s7,"You would like to see a flat screen TV, you don’t expect a fax machine, and you would like…"
c2500163,s1,This hotel is just same as what you see in the pictures
c2500163,s2,"Especially, 'cause all the rooms is sweet room, the room looks quite luxurious and big"
c2500163,s3,Cotai View Room has quite good view
c2500163,s4,But it's too huge
c2500163,s5,Restaurants are not that much good
c2500163,s6,"(just big and nothing special) 'Cause it's too big and there're a lot of people(guests and visitors), I couldn't feel like being serviced"
c2500163,s7,"I think just one time experience is enough and if I visit again Macau, I will stay at another hotels which doesn't have Casino and not that much huge, but feel comfortable"
c2500164,s1,"This hotel has become a little more ""family friendly"" in recent years"
c2500164,s2,"The rooms are suite-only, spacious, but starting to look a bit dated"
c2500164,s3,There are several pools but they are small and all fairly shallow
c2500164,s4,"From our room, it took about 15 minutes of walking just to get to the pool area"
c2500164,s5,"The lobbies are fairly crowded, and check-in requires waiting in a ""queue"" to first drop off your luggage and a second line just to check-in"
c2500164,s6,There are certainly better options in Macau nowadays
c2500165,s1,The Venetian Macao is a mixed bag along a non-uniform spectrum of terrible to great
c2500165,s2,The Good: - The VIP level apartments are phenomenal
c2500165,s3,"High ceilings, excessive bathrooms and kitchens with quality fixtures and finish, cinema room and the like"
c2500165,s4,More than sufficient space
c2500165,s5,- The Golden Peacock
c2500165,s6,Great food at a great price featuring a Michelin Star
c2500165,s7,There is even a very well prepared lunch buffet
c2500165,s8,"- This might, equally, be a negative"
c2500165,s9,Every few metres you will find yourself running into a respectable watch brand boutique
c2500165,s10,"The bad:  - While the the Royal Suite is large and looks impressive, our room was tired and worn"
c2500165,s11,"Unfortunately, despite being marked non-smoking the room was drenched in cigarette stench and residue"
c2500165,s12,- The included buffet breakfast is not worth your time
c2500165,s13,-…
c2500166,s1,Stayed at the Venetian for a night
c2500166,s2,Rooms were huge (and so was the entire building! We stayed on the 33rf floor) however its like any typical hotel
c2500166,s3,They were kind to give longevity buns for my father's 76th birthday though :)  maybe casino hotels are not for me
c2500166,s4,Overall decent service and rooms
c2500167,s1,I was in Venetian Macau for a 2 Nights stay attending an international  conference held in Venetian
c2500167,s2,Given choice I would like to stay in a standard /deluxe room which Venetian could not offer
c2500167,s3,Venetian are all Suite room which I find it s too big
c2500167,s4,"Personally and also from my other counter parts, not only the rooms but everything else are very pricey"
c2500167,s5,"For the same amount we pay, we believe we could get other newer 5* hotel"
c2500167,s6,We also encounter problems with the reception
c2500167,s7,They asked for my credit card which they said 'for security & hold
c2500167,s8,"Will only be charged upon checking out"" To my surprise, my Bank messaged me to say that I have been charged for an amount so much higher than agreed"
c2500167,s9,"Level 3 where the food court, shops, Gondola  is interesting"
c2500167,s10,"The Hotel is huge, be…"
c2500168,s1,The room was great
c2500168,s2,about 650 square feet but there was no service
c2500168,s3,Luggage was delivered to the room 30 mins after check in
c2500168,s4,Free wifi never works and no one ever picks up the phone at the reception
c2500168,s5,Multiple people on the casino floors trying to run card scams
c2500168,s6,I am myself stuck in resolving one with my bank
c2500168,s7,DO NOT USE THE ATM IN THE HOTEL
c2500168,s8,"if you do, be ready to lose big money the day you are back"
c2500169,s1,Went across to see the Bon Jovi concert and spend the weekend
c2500169,s2,First thing that hits you is the sheer size and the walking to get anything done
c2500169,s3,The food at Cafe Decor was very average and probably had to do with the scale of things
c2500169,s4,I wish the casino had more English speaking folk and were a little more helpful in getting us around
c2500169,s5,In  room facilities and dining were super and if you need anything at all ask for Joanna at the Concierge - she is simply super !! At Cafe Decor ask for Judy she does her best !! Super weekend but don't expect greatly personalized service - for the price I would !!
c2500170,s1,"Yes, the rooms are definitely bigger than your average hotel room but the rest of the room is so average that I'd rather have less space and a bit more ""amenity"""
c2500170,s2,"But let's start with the check-in, which was efficient and professional, despite the fact that the hotel was running full that night and has more than 3,000 rooms"
c2500170,s3,"Very well done! Once upstairs, you will find a large room with a sitting area that can easily accommodate 3 for dinner, or even 4"
c2500170,s4,So that's what we did as we were in a rush and did not want to spend time looking for a restaurant and possibly having to queue  up
c2500170,s5,The food was quite ok and was served within 30 minutes
c2500170,s6,"Not so great is the bed, just your standard king, no pillow top, small(ish) pillows and a very thin sort of cover"
c2500170,s7,I've had better at many…
c2500171,s1,I am a student in Macau around 2 years and major in Hospitality Management
c2500171,s2,I know a lots of luxury and famous hotels in Macau according to my study courses
c2500171,s3,"However, I still remember when I first came to Macau and the first hotel I touched"
c2500171,s4,I didn't understand why my parents chosen The Venetian Macao Resort Hotel as for our hospice at that time
c2500171,s5,"My parents reserved family room, the whole room was big, clean, luxury,and excellent"
c2500171,s6,The bed was comfortable and bath was also amazing
c2500171,s7,"When we came into the hall of this hotel, all of us were surprised by golden decoration and meticulous service of reception"
c2500171,s8,It was what I see in the night of The Venetian Macao Resort Hotel
c2500171,s9,"The next day, we went to The grand canal shopping center"
c2500171,s10,The design of this shopping center was also unique
c2500171,s11,…
c2500172,s1,The Venetian Macau is one of the largest hotels in Macau which is connected to the mall and cotai strip shopping area
c2500172,s2,"the casino is always busy and hence, loads of people"
c2500172,s3,there are 4 pools at the ventian and it is well spread out which gives you some sort of privacy to a certain extent
c2500172,s4,a respite from the craziness on the main floors
c2500172,s5,"the rooms are old and dated, albiet very spacious"
c2500172,s6,but certainly not a luxury hotel or a romantic getaway
c2500172,s7,the TV channels in the room also do not have much selection
c2500172,s8,"i would not stay at the venetian again unless necessary,  this time it was a business trip so i did not have a choice"
c2500172,s9,the hotel dining options were also nothing to rave about
c2500172,s10,and i can never understand having to lug my luggage across the casino floors through snaking…
c2500173,s1,Being used to Vegas we found Macau to be a little disappointing when comparred to Las Vegas
c2500173,s2,"The casinos, infrastructure, etc"
c2500173,s3,in Macau is fantastic but the overall energy and soul that you find in Vegas is definitely something that's missing in Macau
c2500173,s4,The Venitian in Macau was where we stayed
c2500173,s5,Was particularly impressed with our suite which was huge and more than adequate for our needs
c2500173,s6,We did find that the casino was extremely busy and crowded but this was likely due to the weekend crowd and the international fireworks fesitval that was taking palce on the weekends
c2500173,s7,As mentioned before about the lack of soul and energy I found that this was particularly the case when playing in the casino there was just no excitement I was actually rather bored and didn't end up spending…
c2500174,s1,"I have went to Venetian a lot of times but my recent stay (sept 18,2015) was very disappointing"
c2500174,s2,My room Key Kept failing Every time I came back
c2500174,s3,I stayed in venetian for 3 days but I had my key changed 4x
c2500174,s4,When I called the lobby about my key problem they kept asking me to go to the main lobby so that they could change the key
c2500174,s5,The distance of my hotel room to the main lobby is far and they even asked my mom to be there - My mom just changed the key 2 hours before that and was enjoying herself in the casino and they were asking me to call her because it was only her who could request for a new key
c2500174,s6,After that we even found out the glasses were not washed in my room 😤 - we were very angry!
c2500175,s1,I've been coming here since 2008
c2500175,s2,The hotel was new then
c2500175,s3,"Now it's been almost 10 years, when I looked at the things I've been seeing for years and years, like the imitated Venetian Gondola ( rode by non-Italian ), the faked blue sky, the boisterous shopping malls round and round , not to forget the casino,I don't feel wonderful anymore"
c2500175,s4,"The room we stay is a suite, with a sitting room and a bed room separated by few steps down"
c2500175,s5,"At first look, the view is magnificent, room amenities are intact, even mini bar has been filled up with all varieties of drinks and snacks, but when I go to the bathroom, I find the toilet room wallpaper stained with brownish, or once reddish spots, skirting broads are dirty with soil and cobweb, the toilet flush suddenly stopped working and I am too…"
c2500176,s1,The building is amazing! It is easy to get lost in it and feel like a character from alice and wonderland
c2500176,s2,"The food is divine, the variety will leave you lost for choice"
c2500176,s3,"However, staff is both rude and unhelpful"
c2500176,s4,their isn't proper communication which makes finding things even more difficult
c2500176,s5,But none of this deters from the beauty of the property and the prime location
c2500177,s1,"Have a special offer on the hotel website, less than 2000 dollar to enjoy a room with 180 m"
c2500177,s2,"With a good sight of view, 2 washroom, one on the dining room and other one on master room"
c2500177,s3,Enjoy a buffet dinner with special offer and had a special discount for the jet tour
c2500177,s4,very enjoy the feeling of the room
c2500177,s5,will come back with such offer again
c2500178,s1,We've checked in into non-smoking suite on a non-smoking floor
c2500178,s2,The room smelled like an ashtray for the first 2 days of our stay
c2500178,s3,Even the bedding had a cigarette smell
c2500178,s4,Non-smoking rule was not applied anywhere including the corridors and lifts
c2500178,s5,Staff friendly
c2500178,s6,Big hotel so be ready for long distance walks within the hotel
c2500178,s7,It took us 20min to reach the pool from our suite
c2500179,s1,I have stayed at this hotel few times before BUT very disappointed on this trip (We have just returned back)
c2500179,s2,I traveled with my sister and our young teenage daughters for a Friday night getaway
c2500179,s3,When we pay top dollar for a 5*Hotel we expect 5*service too! Agreed that the rooms are large and what not but other than that it has nothing to offer
c2500179,s4,The restaurants are very pricey but so is the FoodCourt
c2500179,s5,The hotel looks more of a zoo than anything else
c2500179,s6,While we were walking / shopping around the on the hotel's famous 3/fl level Shoppes we had to make a visit to the bathroom
c2500179,s7,I really would like to bring this to the attention of the management
c2500179,s8,you will not believe how horrified we were
c2500179,s9,The bathrooms are filthy dirty and there is no one managing / cleaning / maintaining them
c2500179,s10,No…
c2500180,s1,"The hotel itself is amazing to visit but perhaps not stay, check in was ok the staff are nice and the room was very nice but the floor was meant to be none smoking and all we could smell was stale smoke on the way to our room with some whiffs of it coming into the room"
c2500180,s2,"House keeping decided to wake us up talking very loudly outside our room early in the morning then after been out for most of the day got back and our room still hadn't been serviced, we had to go out again so it could be done when all we wanted to do was relax and rest our feet"
c2500180,s3,Its just such a huge place and it seems like they put more time and effort into the casino and you really feel more like a piece of meat there for them to squeeze money out of
c2500180,s4,On check out they tried to charge us for wifi usage even…
c2500181,s1,"This resort hotel is massive, very easy to get lost"
c2500181,s2,It took me 20 mins walk from the rooms I stayed to the buffet breakfast
c2500181,s3,The room is full of smoking smell
c2500181,s4,Although the room is nicely decorated but the smell would put you off especially you are travelling with a baby
c2500181,s5,I phoned to the reception and they refused to change the room and said they were fully booked and every room would be the same
c2500181,s6,"Buffet breakfast was great, many selections and fresh"
c2500181,s7,Many shop and restaurants in the resort but very pricey as well
c2500182,s1,Beautiful hotel but very crowded
c2500182,s2,"If you're in macau for a day for sight seeing, ride the gondola and go to another hotel to relax and unwind"
c2500182,s3,"If you're in macau for shopping, this hotel is for you"
c2500182,s4,Not ideal for travellers with kids
c2500183,s1,What can I say
c2500183,s2,It's obvious that the Venetian cant cope with the influx of gamblers from you-know-where
c2500183,s3,"They have taken over, quite literally"
c2500183,s4,"If you enjoy being in the presence of serious, smoking, shouting, spitting, gamblers, then you will enjoy the Venetian"
c2500183,s5,"But if you are a civilized person and/or a family person, AVOID the Venetian at all costs"
c2500183,s6,"(by the way, and this is not specifically related to the hotel: Macau gets a ""D"" for diversification"
c2500183,s7,What percentage of the Macau economy depends on the gambling industry? Mmm it must be in the 90s
c2500183,s8,Good luck to Macau when the SSE crashes and the dirty money dries up)
c2500184,s1,We visited in August from Hongkong
c2500184,s2,There are quite a number of nice hotels in Macau but Venetian is always the one with a fuller shuttle buses
c2500184,s3,"Patience is required, albeit the warm weather"
c2500184,s4,"Going out of hotel is seldom required as it is a huge establishment, room was very nice, staff were helpful, the gondola ride at the mall were assisted with a very friendly rower, even sang an Indonesian song to us from Indonesia"
c2500184,s5,Tix for gondola can be purchased at the souvenir shops
c2500184,s6,"The swimming pool was under maintenance, not an infinity pool anways"
c2500184,s7,"The ride back with shuttle was painful, queing for shuttle for boat to HK, one of us suffers a loss wallet"
c2500184,s8,"Be very careful of pickpockets, esp in the casino area and waiting bays for shuttle"
c2500184,s9,You can never be too careful
c2500184,s10,Or vacationing…
c2500185,s1,"This is a majestic property and one can easily get lost finding one's way through the grand passages, the food courts, the shopping malls and, not to forget, the casino"
c2500185,s2,"Its spic and span, and all credit to the housekeeping department for the excellent upkeep"
c2500185,s3,"The suites are impressive, grand and simply wow"
c2500185,s4,"The service staff at reception and housekeeping were astoundingly efficient, prompt and courteous"
c2500185,s5,"Even friendly, if I may add, which is so rare in a city like Macau"
c2500185,s6,"But, is this a hotel one wants to enjoy a holiday in? No"
c2500185,s7,Its far too busy for that
c2500185,s8,"One is surrounded by rich Chinese millionaires out to lose a quick buck at the casinos, all of them looking serious, even tense"
c2500185,s9,"The food at the cafe deco was a huge let down, with exactly the same Indian menus repeated"
c2500185,s10,A…
c2500186,s1,"Mcsorleys pub very disappointing, the breakfast was awful"
c2500186,s2,Casino is far too large and impersonal with unfriendly croupiers
c2500186,s3,The whole place feels just like a process of shipping people in and shipping them out
c2500186,s4,the public areas are jammed full of people  all very noisy
c2500187,s1,"We arrived around midnight, there were staff around but nobody helped to move luggage out of taxi or anything"
c2500187,s2,We had a few suitcases as we were a couple of people including kids and nobody came to help
c2500187,s3,I put the suitcases on the luggage trolley and starting pushing it when finally somebody came to help us
c2500187,s4,The bellmen then said it would take min 30 to get luggage to room and we asked him to make it faster as we have a small child with us
c2500187,s5,His response was that rooms are far away
c2500187,s6,"Check in was ok, mass production as I call it"
c2500187,s7,Even around midnight there was quite a line at check in
c2500187,s8,"To get to the room it feels like a treasure hunt, go up, through the mall etc etc"
c2500187,s9,What a nightmare
c2500187,s10,"The rooms are spacious without a doubt, however there is this old room smell, they need…"
c2500188,s1,See it's a big hype! To check in wait in the cue for 45 mins and then while you're being checked in it takes another 30 mins
c2500188,s2,To order water in the room it takes them 30-60 mins to get water
c2500188,s3,You die of thirst
c2500188,s4,To check out another 30 mins
c2500188,s5,Breakfast which is with the room on CP basis is average
c2500188,s6,"Come on Venetian breakfast is average where you've spent ₹ 30,000 ($ 500) for a night"
c2500188,s7,It is nothing but an over hyped property
c2500188,s8,PS: the internet just doesn't work at all in the rooms which is 'supposedly free'
c2500189,s1,We stayed here for one night just to experience the biggest hotel in the world
c2500189,s2,All the staff were friendly and it's a huge well-oiled machine; the systems work well
c2500189,s3,"The rooms (suites) are huge and very comfortable, and we also liked the outside pool area which was quiet even on a weekend"
c2500189,s4,You can also easily walk into Taipa (10 minutes) and have a great Portuguese meal
c2500189,s5,Breakfast was included with our room and we opted to eat at Cafe Deco
c2500189,s6,"It was a hugely extensive buffet but most of the food was average (tiny glasses for juice, slightly stale pastries etc) for a 5 star hotel"
c2500189,s7,Bear in mind that this place is centred around its casino and is crowded with Chinese gamblers coming for the day
c2500189,s8,In this sense there are moments when it doesn't feel like the luxurious experience…
c2500190,s1,Luckily I manage only a day to stay here
c2500190,s2,"Holiday Inn is just a better hotel stay, this place is only famous since everyone who visit Macau will die to stop by here"
c2500190,s3,The place was so crowded with the shopping guests
c2500190,s4,Holiday Inn has better room space and better bedding compare to Venetian
c2500190,s5,"The only good about this place is the shuttle center, you won't need to move from one shuttle point to another since Venetian got it all"
c2500191,s1,We stayed here for one night whilst visiting Macau
c2500191,s2,The room (and hotel were massive) and it was brilliant fun and definitely worth a trip
c2500191,s3,You never have to leave the hotel but we did do a quick trip to the Hard Rock Casino opposite
c2500191,s4,The shops were a great addition
c2500191,s5,As a tip - book directly online with the company and you get free late check out and free wifi
c2500191,s6,This was great as it meant we had two days to explore Macau not just an evening
c2500192,s1,Stayed at the Venetian for 3 nights
c2500192,s2,My Experience:  The hotel is more like a circus
c2500192,s3,Very large and confusing with lots of people mostly Indians
c2500192,s4,Rooms are good but nothing very grand
c2500192,s5,While exploring Macao i found hotels which were much more grand and centrally located than the Venetian
c2500192,s6,Room service takes about 30 minutes
c2500192,s7,The restaurants are very good with excellent food at the hotel
c2500192,s8,There is also a large food court for budget meals
c2500192,s9,Would recommend to eat there
c2500192,s10,Special mention to the Indian and the Italian restaurants
c2500192,s11,Do try them
c2500192,s12,The casino at the hotel is the attraction
c2500192,s13,Very grand
c2500192,s14,You will love losing money at the place:)
c2500193,s1,This is the third time I have stayed here for a work event
c2500193,s2,No overall change since 12 months ago - large and characterless as there are huge crowds visiting the casino
c2500193,s3,Check can be very slow
c2500193,s4,Food was average
c2500193,s5,I've downgraded my rating one notch
c2500193,s6,Won't be back for a personal trip - there are much newer and nicer choices in Macau
c2500194,s1,Many plus points of the hotel have been mentioned already and I agree with most of them
c2500194,s2,But remember the following while choosing the hotel
c2500194,s3,1
c2500194,s4,It took us nearly one hour to check in at three 0' clock in the afternoon
c2500194,s5,There was no seating arrangement what so ever in the reception lounge or West lobby where the hotel guests have to wait for the vehicle pick up
c2500194,s6,2
c2500194,s7,No dairy creamer is  given to make coffee or tea in the room
c2500194,s8,3
c2500194,s9,While checking out one has to carry one's own luggage through a fairly long carpeted way
c2500195,s1,the hotel is famous for the shopping area and casino
c2500195,s2,"as for room, i have to say, i don't like it at all"
c2500195,s3,there is taint on the bath tub
c2500195,s4,the carpet not clean enough
c2500195,s5,"after the trip, i decided to book the hotel group room only, i will not choose this type of hotel"
c2500195,s6,"that is why in Singapore, I will not choose Sands"
c2500195,s7,"this type of hotel will focus on entertainment, rather than room biz"
c2500196,s1,"Stayed for 2 nights, rooms are large and fit a family of 4 nicely"
c2500196,s2,Wifi in room is intermittent
c2500196,s3,The swimming pool does not look as good as the pictures on the hotel website
c2500196,s4,"The resort is huge, so prepare to walk quite a bit"
c2500197,s1,"We visited the hotel in May 2015, we were amazed by size of the room it was big & very comfortable"
c2500197,s2,Hotel is all about luxury with very costly shopping mall on the third floor; we liked the Golf Course Which is on the 7th Floor
c2500197,s3,"Food is okay, swimming pool is not that great"
c2500197,s4,In all the hotel is good for Casino  players
c2500198,s1,I've visited the Venetian Macao many times ever since it opened as a hotel guest or to attend an event there
c2500198,s2,"But this is the first time I've reviewed the hotel, which has declined in terms of quality in customer service"
c2500198,s3,"Physically, the resort is pretty much the same"
c2500198,s4,Same big rooms with marble everywhere that can fit a large family if they camp out there
c2500198,s5,Same luxurious and expensive shopping in stores in the mall where I hardly ever see a customer
c2500198,s6,I still don't understand how they stay in business when I never see much foot traffic in the stores
c2500198,s7,Maybe the high rollers are the ones keeping the stores in business?  Gaming at Venetian Macao is more expensive than at other hotels in the same area
c2500198,s8,"For example, if you want to play Sic Bo, the minimum bet is three hundred…"
c2500199,s1,Macau's Cotai Strip is one of those must do things and tick the box
c2500199,s2,"We choose the Venetian for its apparent Glitz, Glamour and Kitsch"
c2500199,s3,"The place is so huge that the Hospitality's Industry quest for ""personal service"" doesn't even try at this place"
c2500199,s4,"With all the Stantions all over the place you just get in line, snake through and wait until you are being processed"
c2500199,s5,I guess it comes as close as it can on how animals get corralled through an Abatoir
c2500199,s6,agreed it is in nicer surroundings
c2500199,s7,Check-in is at 3:00pm and Check-out at 11:00am
c2500199,s8,There is no flexibility in that unless you pay of course
c2500199,s9,"I came with the family and as the kids are below 21 we can't walk through the Casino, the heart of this money and people churning Monster"
c2500199,s10,So you have to get to your room via the shopping…
c2500200,s1,"The rooms are huge and luxorious, but it's definitely too much! If you need room service, you will have to wait on the line for one minute"
c2500200,s2,"You must get a hotel map with you, unless you don't want wasting time on going from A to B"
c2500201,s1,"Venetian gets 3 stars because the rooms are just beautiful and so is the lobby, but the hotel is so huge that you have to walk for 20 to 30 mins to get inside or outside the hotel"
c2500201,s2,And god forbit if you are with kids under 21 like us you cannot walk through the casino so you'll have to walk through another area which adds 10 more mins
c2500201,s3,The foodcourt in the mall/hotel was also reallt nice as it had most of the cuisines one would look for
c2500201,s4,"Unless  you are only going for the casino, which is great you could stay in a different hotel suite which would be around the same price and visit the ventitian for a day trip"
c2500201,s5,(Mostly high end brands here so come with a full credit limit if u wish to shop)
c2500202,s1,"Having come from Vegas only 2 weeks ago it is an interesting back-to-back comparison and Vegas rocks! This is still impressive though although the rooms are a little shabby, detail is missing but staff helpful nonetheless - all quite young and keen to help"
c2500202,s2,"The hotel is on new area of Macau, not old town, so walking out at night requires a taxi hike of 10-15 mins and it gets busy"
c2500202,s3,Not much going on outside casino vicinity
c2500202,s4,Nice enough but should have stayed at Mandarin!
c2500203,s1,I was so excited about the night my friends and I were staying at The Venetian
c2500203,s2,"To say I was disappointed would be an understatement!  The beds were comfortable and the room was big, but that's the only good I can say for it"
c2500203,s3,"There were holes in the sheets on the bed I was sleeping in and when I went to take a bath, I luckily looked in first!  The bath had hair in it and looked like it hadn't been clean in awhile"
c2500203,s4,"I've stayed at motels that were cleaner than our room!  As for service, I will say that was a little better"
c2500203,s5,"When we called downstairs, the people were good (we had asked for ear plugs and the girl came up with a creative solution since they did not have any)"
c2500203,s6,"Still, the best staff in the world and a superficially beautiful hotel doesn't excuse holes in sheets and…"
c2500204,s1,"Didn't come here by choice, had booked tickets to Macau on the Cotai water jet from HK"
c2500204,s2,"The courtesy bus drops you here and you begin a journey of complete fantasy and make believe!  The hotel is enormous, has its own ground floor casino which was packed with people throwing their hard earned cash away"
c2500204,s3,Then their was the shopping mall with its designer stores and streams with gondolas! The food hall looks interesting but is well overpriced and not very good at all
c2500204,s4,All staff we encountered were very friendly
c2500204,s5,Recommend? I wouldn't but then I don't like things that are more a movie set than reality
c2500205,s1,"The hotel is great, beautiful, huge, and shopping mall is convenient, there is no doubt"
c2500205,s2,"However, there are too many people stay in this nice hotel, everything became disorder easily"
c2500205,s3,"No matter check-in or check-out, have a meal always wait in a long line or in crowded situation"
c2500205,s4,It takes a lot of time get out from the crowd
c2500206,s1,So we were a group of 5 adults and 2 kids staying at Venetian Macao for 2 nights after finishing half our holidays at hongkong
c2500206,s2,I have a very mixed review for the place
c2500206,s3,The first sight of the hotel definitely floors you because of the grandeur and magnificent architecture
c2500206,s4,"So if you ask me one word to describe the property I would respond with two, marvelous and magnificent"
c2500206,s5,It's just what you see of it in Google images
c2500206,s6,Cons-  The place is massive
c2500206,s7,It's huge
c2500206,s8,So you better carry your walking shoes to start your sprint from anywhere to anywhere
c2500206,s9,The main lobby is really far from the rooms
c2500206,s10,The rooms are far from other lobbies
c2500206,s11,(At times room to one of the lobbies 'west' for instance could take 20 mins)
c2500206,s12,The casino comes in between your walk and if you are with children…
c2500207,s1,"To get to Venetian, you can take the free shuttle coach from a number of locations including the ferry piers (we came from Macau Ferry Terminal)"
c2500207,s2,The shuttle coaches run every 5-15 mins
c2500207,s3,"Once we arrived at the hotel around 2pm, it was so chaotic!  Probably due to it's own success in that it is a tourist attraction in itself"
c2500207,s4,"However, there are barriers everywhere and the barriers try to force you down a particular route but it was narrow"
c2500207,s5,There was barging and shoving and it was not very pleasant
c2500207,s6,I could only imagined if we had large luggage or a pram
c2500207,s7,"The whole layout of the staging area where you arrive needs to be looked at before people could get hurt  Once inside, again very hectic, but more spacious than outside"
c2500207,s8,Signs are clear and pointed us to check-in
c2500207,s9,Note…
c2500208,s1,The Venetian is a well-kept hotel that buzzes with energy
c2500208,s2,The lobby and casinos stayed crowded even on a Sunday night
c2500208,s3,"The rooms are very spacious and well-stocked, although the faux grandeur decor isn't quite my style"
c2500208,s4,We were in for what seemed like a nice holiday
c2500208,s5,"Until our experience with the hotel's taxi service, that is"
c2500208,s6,"On our only evening there, my parents and I waited in line for a taxi and climbed into one at our turn"
c2500208,s7,But the taxi driver kicked us out because he didn't like our destination (Fernando's Macau)
c2500208,s8,"Fair enough, we thought"
c2500208,s9,This happens in other cities too
c2500208,s10,"But seeing this, the next few drivers also refused to let us into their taxis"
c2500208,s11,"As we were rejected by taxi after taxi (at least six), the taxi attendant did absolutely nothing"
c2500208,s12,He simply watched and kept…
c2500209,s1,by far this is the largest hotel in Macau
c2500209,s2,"It has everything in house; a huge shopping center, theaters, casino, a lot of restaurants and also very close to the Galaxy which is also a huge complex"
c2500209,s3,We had a very nice experience staying there for 2 nights
c2500209,s4,Actually we didn't face any major problems but its nessesory for us wi fi is not free
c2500209,s5,i call to the reception that i wanna use the paid wifi she was giving me a id and password but it doesnt work
c2500209,s6,i again call to the reception that wifi is not working
c2500209,s7,the person is coming after 4 hours in my room at 3am
c2500209,s8,when i was slept
c2500209,s9,So only problem with the services if you are staying in 5star property
c2500210,s1,The Venetian is the perfect example of what tourism has become
c2500210,s2,"Huge numbers of bused in Chinese tourists looking for luxury brands to show everyone at home, gambling tables to try luck, and a food court to eat as quickly as possible"
c2500210,s3,"The room is wonderful, as are the pools"
c2500210,s4,"Portofino is a fine restaurant, if expensive with tiny portions"
c2500210,s5,And so the hotel is certainly memorable
c2500210,s6,It represents the future of tourism
c2500210,s7,"If you are from the PRC, this is a good thing"
c2500210,s8,"If you are not, you might find the crowds less than enticing"
c2500210,s9,"The endless, soulless ""luxury"" bags, shoes and clothing might leave you empty"
c2500210,s10,The plastic representation of Italy might leave you wondering what the world will be like when 600 million + enter the middle class and want immediate conspicuous consumption along…
c2500211,s1,1
c2500211,s2,Most painful check-in We reached the property at 1
c2500211,s3,00 pm and were told that the check-in time is strictly 2
c2500211,s4,00 pm only and we should come later
c2500211,s5,"We went to see the property, did Gandola ride, etc (which had a long waiting) and came back at 2"
c2500211,s6,"10 pm and realised that there was a long queue for check-in, we had to wait for more than 1"
c2500211,s7,5 hrs for checking in
c2500211,s8,"Least I would have accepted from the Hotel Staff, if they had such a huge flow of guests coming in, they should have informed us that we wait at the check-in counter only till 2"
c2500211,s9,"00 pm and be the first one to check-in, 1 hour would have been a lesser wait than 2"
c2500211,s10,5 hours (one hour for check-in to start and additional 1
c2500211,s11,5 hours to get the check-in done)
c2500211,s12,2
c2500211,s13,SIM Cards Hotel provides two complimentary SIM Cards for the family…
c2500212,s1,Highly overrated
c2500212,s2,Have to walk long distances to reach the room Breakfast was the worst I have eaten in a 5 star in my life
c2500212,s3,"With Mall inside, it is like a bazar"
c2500212,s4,Need overhauling
c2500212,s5,"Mosquitoes in room, room service could not do anything"
c2500213,s1,"Overall speaking, this is a hotel that can satisfy what you need"
c2500213,s2,"Shuttle bus transfer from the pier to the hotel, hospitable service, spacious room with comfy bed, electrical water kettle, hair dryer, complimentary drinking water"
c2500213,s3,Yet it may not be the liking to successful / niche types
c2500213,s4,"Big old fashioned deco, old tv set, no shower but just a fixed shower head on the wall with unfriendly water temperature control"
c2500213,s5,"By far, there is one imperfection which actually makes me not coming back to this hotel - their toilet amenities"
c2500214,s1,Big and lots of everything - that can be a spoiltsport too! It gets a little boring if you are not the gambling type
c2500214,s2,Good place for the OTT (over the top) hotel experience
c2500214,s3,Awesome huge rooms which sort of makes up for everything - however the mattress quality not good
c2500214,s4,"There's a food court - best avoided I would say, few restaurants - sampled the fare in 3 - pretty average in terms of quality"
c2500214,s5,Endless number of branded stores which seem to have hardly any customers
c2500214,s6,The common areas are crowded giving the look of an ordinary market place!  The staff was helpful - special mention of the room cleaning staff who do an excellent job to keep the place (rooms) in a fantastic shape
c2500214,s7,Caution of the iffy WiFi - despite our package having it free
c2500214,s8,Was made to seek help several times to…
c2500215,s1,Stayed here as a group
c2500215,s2,"So, it wasn't my choice to pick this one"
c2500215,s3,Spacious room and bathroom
c2500215,s4,Gigantic casino
c2500215,s5,But I was looking for quality service
c2500215,s6,Robotic staff
c2500215,s7,I could not see the sincerity and passion
c2500215,s8,Maybe it's due to the numerous room which makes them cold
c2500215,s9,Pros:  Frequent free shuttle bus taking you to other parts of Macau
c2500215,s10,Luxurious spacious room
c2500215,s11,Fabulous dim sum restaurant near the casino
c2500215,s12,Cons: Very busy hotel
c2500215,s13,Not enough lifts to serve the guests
c2500215,s14,Especially during check-out time
c2500215,s15,Would I stay there again? Probably not
c2500216,s1,We stayed here from Feb 17th for s couple of nights with another family
c2500216,s2,We booked a suite and found they had lack amenities for our family of four
c2500216,s3,"It was a very busy hotel, we would probably not recommend it for families"
c2500216,s4,My husband had his birthday on the 17th but nothing special was done
c2500216,s5,Not even a card
c2500216,s6,We're probably use to management at other hotels noticing and doing something small
c2500216,s7,Good place to stay if you want to gamble but that's really about it
c2500217,s1,I was disappointed by what I found at The Venetian Macao
c2500217,s2,"Sure, it's clean, and sure, it has The Grand Canal Shoppes, but it really lacks an intangible something (pizazz, maybe?) that is found at most other casinos"
c2500217,s3,"In fact, I actually better enjoyed the time I spent at the Grand Lisboa, a locally-owned hotel and casino"
c2500217,s4,(It's forebear across the street is one of Macau's oldest
c2500217,s5,") While I suppose The Venetian is one of the finer choices in Macao, it left me blase"
c2500217,s6,"Oh, and wherever you go in Macao, expect dated slots"
c2500217,s7,"(Evidently they are not moneymakers in the region, and so there is little investment"
c2500217,s8,)
c2500218,s1,Spent 2 nights at the Venetian
c2500218,s2,The hotel is enormous
c2500218,s3,It takes a day to get your bearings - multiple lobbies and hundreds of shops/restaurants
c2500218,s4,My suite was large and quite comfortable
c2500218,s5,Hotel is highly trafficked - hallway rugs are slightly worn
c2500218,s6,My room smelled as though it had been occupied by a smoker recently
c2500218,s7,Overall - nicely appointed rooms were overwhelmed by crowds and time it takes to make your way around
c2500219,s1,We stayed in the Bella suite with strip views
c2500219,s2,All we could see was one hotel on the strip so it was not worth the extra $$$$$$
c2500219,s3,This place is massive and the staff were very impersonal
c2500219,s4,We paid $581 Aussie dollars for 1 night and this did not represent good value to us
c2500219,s5,We dined at one of the inhouse restaurants that was just average
c2500219,s6,The shopping area is huge and the gondolas are quite impressive
c2500219,s7,I am sure that you could find better value somewhere else
c2500219,s8,I wouldn't recommend this hotel as it was too expensive for us
c2500220,s1,Stayed at The Venetian Macau for a business coneference meeting
c2500220,s2,The check in process was pretty efficient
c2500220,s3,Very satisfied with the clean and spacious bedroom
c2500220,s4,Breakfast quality was so so and food replenishment was pretty slow
c2500220,s5,Need improve on this department
c2500220,s6,Overall a decent place to stay for a short trip
c2500221,s1,"Firstly, we were there a during the Christmas week"
c2500221,s2,"Secondly, casinos have no appeal for us"
c2500221,s3,"Also, we are vegetarian"
c2500221,s4,Hence the entire experience was a total disaster! The reception is like a railway station
c2500221,s5,One needs a map to reach anywhere
c2500221,s6,"That said, everything ran like clockwork"
c2500222,s1,Stayed at The Venetian over New Year 2014 and this was our 3rd stay at the hotel
c2500222,s2,"This is a great hotel to stay in if this is your first trip to Macau, as it embodies everything that you imagine the gambling mecca to be - large, loud, flashy, glitzy etc"
c2500222,s3,"Everything about the hotel is huge - the rooms, the casino, the shopping areas etc"
c2500222,s4,It was the perfect introduction to Macau for my parents who had never been
c2500222,s5,They are seasoned travellers but even they spent most of the time open mouthed in awe and wonder
c2500222,s6,The downsides to such a hotel is that the hotel/casino/shops/restaurants/food courts etc is that everything is PACKED
c2500222,s7,ALL THE TIME
c2500222,s8,The majority of the crowds are visitors to the hotel and not the actual residents
c2500222,s9,"Also because the hotel is so big and full all the time,…"
c2500223,s1,Room was nice
c2500223,s2,"And affordable, also free wifi is helping"
c2500223,s3,"BUT the breakfast food was SUCKS, anything i had is just not good"
c2500223,s4,The mall ambiance is ok
c2500223,s5,You better find the foodcourt there
c2500223,s6,And try macanesse food and also the milk pudding with red beans
c2500223,s7,It was bery nice !
c2500224,s1,After staying with 2 other couples in a one bedroom apartment the Venetian seemed amazing
c2500224,s2,Walking in its all very grand
c2500224,s3,Check in seemed to take a long time and then we were off to find our rooms
c2500224,s4,You could easily get lost in that place and never find your way out again
c2500224,s5,"On getting to our rooms, again they are very grand and first impressions are wow! But after a while the smell of cigarette smoke seems to seep in, maybe through the aircon? The bed was good but not the most comfortable thing I've ever slept in"
c2500224,s6,The bath was too shallow so you can't get your chest underwater
c2500224,s7,"But then there's the shower, worst water pressure!!! Pleased I don't have long hair or I might still be in there trying to wash it"
c2500224,s8,"I think staying here is more about the lovely building, the shops,…"
c2500225,s1,"The rooms are getting dated, given that it has been around awhile now"
c2500225,s2,We were able to sleep 3 people comfortably
c2500225,s3,All rooms have at least 2 queens and a sleeper sofa
c2500225,s4,Plus Macau has become Non-smoking
c2500225,s5,"Although, even with a non-smoking room, you can smell cigarette smoke from the vents from other rooms"
c2500225,s6,"The Good: Large room, Venetian standards, similar to Las Vegas"
c2500225,s7,"The Bad: The Shoppes are expensive for Almond Cookies and the like, go to town"
c2500225,s8,"The Canal is a Square, not as much character as Las Vegas"
c2500225,s9,Table Minimums:  Most tables are 500HKD
c2500225,s10,"You can find 300HKD for 3 Card Poker, Caribbean Stud, and Baccarat"
c2500225,s11,Roulette had minimums of 25HKD per bet
c2500225,s12,"If you are willing to play a recorded hand, you can find 100HKD minimums for Baccarat"
c2500225,s13,The mechanical table games also have…
c2500226,s1,The room is spacious but there are lots of chinese tours hurrying into the hotel
c2500226,s2,That makes the hotel too crowdy
c2500226,s3,And you may sometimes get lost when you need to go through the mall to find the hotel lifts
c2500226,s4,"Nevertheless, the hotel does provide many fascinating performance and this really makes our trip memorable"
c2500226,s5,"Besides, there are shuttle buses to several hot tourist spots and this is very user-friendly"
c2500227,s1,The hotel was decorated with golden color and marbles and the space is so big
c2500227,s2,It looks so luxurious and glorious
c2500227,s3,The room is very big that I have so much space to extend my suitcase and everything
c2500227,s4,The bed and pillows are so comfortable that I have no trouble sleeping
c2500227,s5,"However, I think the hotel is a bit too historical compared to other hotels in Macau"
c2500227,s6,"The shower water was sometimes warm, sometimes too hot, or sometimes strong, sometimes too weak, together with noise from the old pipes"
c2500227,s7,"The last night of stay, when I dried my hair, the hair dryer exploded and started to smoke"
c2500227,s8,I waited almost an hour to get a new hair dryer
c2500227,s9,"And for the house keeping, they don't always clean my room everyday"
c2500227,s10,They simply made the bed and left
c2500227,s11,They don't wash the used mugs or throw the…
c2500228,s1,Stayed for 4 nights and check-in speed and experience with the staff was good
c2500228,s2,"The room was gorgeously big with 2 TVs (1 in front of the beds and another at the living room area) however, it does shows signs of age"
c2500228,s3,"Room is clean with a huge bathroom that has a separate toilet, dressing table, two sinks, a bathtub and a shower area"
c2500228,s4,"For families travelling with kids, do take note that the shower head is immoveable and hence very inconvenient to bathe the kids"
c2500228,s5,The doors leading to the bathroom and toilet don't come with any locks - so if you just have to let every occupant know that you are inside to avoid embarrassing moments
c2500228,s6,"The bed comfort level is reasonable but the pillows are totally atrocious - to the extent that even after stacking 3 on top of each other, it still…"
c2500229,s1,"Checked in for 3 nights with 3 elders, 2 kids, and 3 adults, all in all, 8 pax"
c2500229,s2,"The receptionist was kind enough to provide us with connecting rooms, which was superb"
c2500229,s3,"Oh, forgot to mention, there was free shuttle to the hotel when we arrived so it was a plus"
c2500229,s4,"The room was super huge with 2 queen size beds and a nice sofa area, so all in all 2 TV in each rooms"
c2500229,s5,"The bathroom was huge with bath tub , separate standing shower, separate toilet"
c2500229,s6,There was a powder table which was excellent for me to do my make up and still have room for 2 adults brush up !  Totally love the rooms but here comes the down side
c2500229,s7,"We paid about SGD400 plus a night and sadly, because we booked via Agoda, we didn't get the free wfifi"
c2500229,s8,"Yes, I am sure this has been feedback countless times here in…"
c2500230,s1,"I stayed here once before, many years ago"
c2500230,s2,"I visit Macau once or twice a year and was able to secure one of the weekend rates here which included wifi and late check-out, so decided to stay here again and see what had changed"
c2500230,s3,"The Venetian is targeted specifically at the Asian market - in particular the Chinese tour market, who make up most visitors to Macau"
c2500230,s4,Everything is on an industrial scale and the place gets jam packed at peak times
c2500230,s5,"It's incredibly impersonal - we didn't speak to, or even see, any hotel staff members apart from checking in and checking out (although those staff members were friendly and helpful)"
c2500230,s6,Lines for check in and check out can get very long
c2500230,s7,"The rooms themselves are OK - decorated in a faux-Venetian style, the rooms and bathrooms are huge and…"
c2500231,s1,We really love the room
c2500231,s2,"Last but not least, the bathroom was big"
c2500232,s1,"The venetian is a must see and walk around when visiting cotai, one of the only big hotels there right now with lots of construction going on however we came across rude guards on one of the entrances to the casino, all the others were fine but these ones, always checking ID then making a fuss about where's the DOB or checking it again and again because its a UK id"
c2500232,s2,"Also not letting someone through because they had a camera when they said they weren't intending to take photos and even put it in their pocket, when they were asked about everyone carrying phones through with cameras they didn't know what to do or say but refused entry very rude! I guess all in all if you're there then its an experience but I guess not being interested in gambling doesn't really help"
c2500232,s3,Ive been to…
c2500233,s1,Stayed here for 1 night for business
c2500233,s2,"I expected this to be similar to the one in Vegas, and I wasn't too surprised"
c2500233,s3,"The room/suite itself was pretty spacious, with the living/desk area on a split level below the bedroom space"
c2500233,s4,"The room had 2 TVs, and I was a little surprised to see that the TV in the living area was a CRT and not a flat panel"
c2500233,s5,This meant that some programs had distorted display ratios
c2500233,s6,"The bathroom was likewise spacious, with a vanity table for ladies"
c2500233,s7,"The shower, however, was definitely showing its age - which is surprising given that the hotel is just 7 years' old"
c2500233,s8,I was happy with the free in-room Wifi that came with my package
c2500233,s9,The additional cost for the ferry ticket was reasonable
c2500233,s10,I was also happy to see that there was an iron and ironing…
c2500234,s1,We stayed at the Venetian to watch a fight hosted at the hotel
c2500234,s2,The sheer scale of the place is pretty hard to fathom and it's really easy to get lost in the bowels of the building
c2500234,s3,"On the whole the experience was ok - the rooms are plush and large, but I would choose a smaller hotel if I was in Macau for any period of time"
c2500234,s4,"Obviously, only having a small interest in gambling affected my view of the place, maybe I would have enjoyed it more if I had an interest in fighting through the throng of troglodytes on the gambling floor"
c2500234,s5,"All in all, it's good for a night or two if you're there for a show or fight, but not more"
c2500235,s1,I spent one night at Venetian last week for a concert because of the proximity that was enough for me
c2500235,s2,If you have been to the Venetian in Las Vegas the interior of the hotel is essentially the replica of the Venetian in Las Vegas
c2500235,s3,"I wouldn’t stay here again because it was very crowded, it didn’t feel as clean and new as it should be"
c2500235,s4,Walking through from one end to another constantly is a struggle
c2500235,s5,There seemed to be too many people that have never been to a hotel before as a lot of people were either strolling around in slow motion or constantly taking pictures or selfies
c2500235,s6,It got to a point where I wanted to just find a bar and sit down to avoid knocking anyone out! Truth to tell finding a bar was a real challenge
c2500235,s7,I have never been to a casino where locating a bar could be so…
c2500236,s1,This was our second visit to The Venetian Macao
c2500236,s2,Our first stay there was on 2009
c2500236,s3,"The hotel is still very nice and grandiose, but the time is quickly coming for a refurbishment"
c2500236,s4,"Carpets are now showing signs of wear, room locks and keys are not working well (once I had to walk a mile or more to the reception to have my key cards reprogrammed, and the bathroom fittings getting loose)"
c2500236,s5,We had room 23-027 with not a nice view at all
c2500236,s6,Breakfast at Cafe Deco is atrocious
c2500236,s7,"The hotel's excuse is that this is not part of the hotel and Cafe Deco is just a contractor, but I would expect much better offerings from a 5 star hotel"
c2500236,s8,The quality of the breakfast food and coffee was extremely poor
c2500236,s9,Will I be back at The Venetian
c2500236,s10,Most probably not
c2500236,s11,"With newer hotels around, I will definitely…"
c2500237,s1,"You get what you ask for, gigantic, easy to get lost, all rooms are suites, very spacious, bit old fashioned for my taste"
c2500237,s2,"They probably want to have it this way, italian look, i guess"
c2500237,s3,"All in all pleasant enough,for a few nights, my favorites at the hotel, the bellini bar, good live bands nightly"
c2500237,s4,"Morton steakhouse, fine service, good food, upscale priced"
c2500238,s1,Venetian is basically a casino with a hotel attached and every time you want to go somewhere you basically have to work your way through the casino which on a Sunday is a complete bear pit
c2500238,s2,"On arrival a guy dressed as a gondolier asked if he could take our bags - we were the only people on the shuttle bus from the ferry with bags, which should have been a warning; this is basically a casino"
c2500238,s3,We said no thanks as we only had carry-ons
c2500238,s4,"What HE should have said was "" No point going to reception as the line is only for checking out until 1pm"" (it was 12"
c2500238,s5,30)
c2500238,s6,"So we fought through the crowds of selfie taking Chinese to discover this, then had to queue to drop our bags and ""go for walk' as the rude sounding but probably sweet receptionist put it"
c2500238,s7,The fact that at 4
c2500238,s8,30pm when we…
c2500239,s1,"This hotel is huge and extravagant, like almost every hotel with casino with Macao"
c2500239,s2,But seriously
c2500239,s3,there's just too many unused spaces
c2500239,s4,"If you're staying in this hotel, make sure to wear comfy shoes"
c2500239,s5,You'll get plenty of walk to get anywhere in this place
c2500239,s6,It's like a one stop entertainmet
c2500239,s7,"You'll find casino, hotel, shopping mall, and even get on to gondola with singing rower crossing the miniature of venetian water way"
c2500239,s8,"And in this place, the sky is always blue and it's always daytime (they painted the high ceilings portraying daytime sky)"
c2500239,s9,"You could get a sense of venetia, when you see the design of the stores, along with the bridge across the water way, and of course the gondola"
c2500239,s10,And I thing the singing rower really know how to sing
c2500239,s11,"If you like grandeur, luxurious, over…"
c2500240,s1,"If you have found you way to Macau is was probably by mistake maybe you took a left turn at Hong Kong and figured since there were 7,000,000 Chinese running around it must be Hong Kong"
c2500240,s2,Macau exists for one reason and one reason only to suck as much money out of mug punters as quickly as possible
c2500240,s3,If you are not Chinese the Venetian will largely ignore you if you don't gamble and are just there to enjoy the hotel and play tourist in Macau you might as well have ebola you will be totally ignore as a paying customer
c2500240,s4,Sure the vision needed to create this masterpiece of  resort is to be widely admired spectacular lobbies gaming areas restaurants the rooms are huge and extremely comfortable except for the lack of TV channels and the 1975 Phillips TV's someone forgot to replace…
c2500241,s1,The Venetian truly blows you away from the instant you walk in
c2500241,s2,"Much like Las Vegas, it truly is 'jawdroppingly' stunning, with next to nowhere else like this in Asia"
c2500241,s3,"The rooms are high quality, everything is classical and elegant - and very much 'Grand'"
c2500241,s4,"For those looking to gamble, shop and act like royalty - this is your place"
c2500241,s5,"For the others who would like a mixture of the Macau/Cotai experience, this is probably not it"
c2500241,s6,Everything seemed to be a time consuming challenge in this hotel
c2500241,s7,The check-in experience is dated
c2500241,s8,No one wants to wait half an hour to check in
c2500241,s9,"The building is so large, that the walk to the hotel room takes close to 20 minutes from the lobby"
c2500241,s10,"There is only the one lift system, and if you happen to be at the end of the hallway, then bad luck"
c2500241,s11,We…
c2500242,s1,Was in Macau for a conference in September staying at  what initally seems to be still a very majestic hotel
c2500242,s2,the foyer / reception area is still very grand and the rooms are spacious  and it is in the happening part of Macau
c2500242,s3,The food court was disgusting the food was sub par and not what i expected from this type of hotel/resort/shopping complex
c2500242,s4,If shoppingnis your thing then there are lots of shops to choose from and the Venetian connects to the Cotai Shopping complex as well so you can basically shop until you drop
c2500242,s5,but dont expect any bargains
c2500242,s6,this is not for bargain hunters
c2500242,s7,Nightlife basically did not exist in the hotels bars
c2500242,s8,if it wasnt for the people from the conference the bars would have been empty
c2500242,s9,if you are looking for a great nightlife i would stick…
c2500243,s1,"The hype, grandeur and pure size make for a impressive and a must do stay"
c2500243,s2,But alas in truth the Venetian whilst amazing in architecture and size is a gamblers and shoppers heaven
c2500243,s3,It's rare for me to rate a hotel so low but my experience was less than memorable and quite disappointing
c2500243,s4,The check in service: I booked three suite at MOP3400+ each but found the check in process long and ardous with the staff trying it up sell a larger suite
c2500243,s5,Even after stating three times I wasn't interested I was again asked to look at photos on an iPad
c2500243,s6,It wasn't until I abruptly said no that the message seemed to get through
c2500243,s7,After 25 mins at the check in counter not adding the time to queue we got our keys and instructions to walked through the main gaming area and throng of visitors
c2500243,s8,The…
c2500244,s1,"This is a very nice hotel, we even got a free upgrade"
c2500244,s2,"Problem is there is just so many people here, a lot of them probably there just to see it or shop"
c2500244,s3,There are a lot of high end shops here
c2500244,s4,I saw many people taking selfies in front of them
c2500244,s5,Part of the reason I stayed here is because we wanted to go to Taipa Village and Colaone Village
c2500244,s6,"Colaone Village was a short cab ride away and if you go get the Egg Tart at Lord Stowe's, you will thank me"
c2500244,s7,"We never got to Taipa Village, we were just touring to hard and needed a break, but it looked like the Venetian had a foot bridge that led right to it"
c2500244,s8,That's if you can find it
c2500244,s9,This place is a monstrosity
c2500244,s10,Considering how many people were here I thought the staff did well
c2500244,s11,But If I had to do it over again I would stay at the Galaxy…
c2500245,s1,"For people staying here, this place is a mess"
c2500245,s2,"Firstly thousands of people throng in the lobby, shopping area and dinner places as a day visit"
c2500245,s3,It is more of a tourist destination (with free entry and shuttle services to everyone)
c2500245,s4,No special areas or services to guest staying here
c2500245,s5,That too after people paying more than 220 dollars per night ! ! !  The staff cannot distinguish between guest staying and day visitors
c2500245,s6,On the plus side the rooms were huge and spacious
c2500245,s7,"If you want a better hotel with privacy and want to feel a 5 star hotel, visit galaxy sands right opposite it"
c2500246,s1,This is a classic casino hotel
c2500246,s2,The room is big and comfortable
c2500246,s3,The bed is firm and well made
c2500246,s4,The room is well lit and well furnished
c2500246,s5,Everything is made to look luxurious however I am surprised to find a CRT TV in the living area
c2500246,s6,There is no free wifi to this hotel! And the funny thing is that they will hold your security deposit for a month! Everything is expected and good except for the cleanliness
c2500246,s7,We found stains on the bed sheet and cigarette burnt stains on the bath robe
c2500246,s8,"Thankfully, this hotel  has free shuttle service to many places, made touring around Macau a breeze for us"
c2500246,s9,Most of the counter staffs at the reception hardly speak proper English and they have so many rooms yet they make it so difficult to check in early
c2500246,s10,I find the sound proofing of the room…
c2500247,s1,Stayed at this property for 4 nights in May 2014
c2500247,s2,Fantastic property in terms of facilities and extremely comfortable and large rooms - suites
c2500247,s3,"Being large, walking from the room to get to any location of the lobby / restaurant / casinos can take a good 10 minutes"
c2500247,s4,Do not expect to be getting personalised service as in other Asian hotels
c2500247,s5,"One is just another ""number"" when checking in"
c2500247,s6,The staff are not very flexible
c2500247,s7,"For example, if one booked a four night stay but needed to change to a three night stay, one will still be charged for 4 nights"
c2500247,s8,The international practice is one would need to stay at least for a night otherwise a one charge would be implemented
c2500247,s9,"but for this Hotel, the rules are different"
c2500247,s10,"Then when one asks to speak to the manager, needless to say, the managers…"
c2500248,s1,Was there with our dealer body for an incentive trip
c2500248,s2,The hotel itself is really HUGE
c2500248,s3,Very easy to get lost while walking from the room to the lobby
c2500248,s4,The check-in experience was not the best
c2500248,s5,I paid my deposit in cash (USD)
c2500248,s6,"However, it is refunded in Macau Pattaca, which is useless once you leave Macau"
c2500248,s7,"So you have to change it in the bank in the hotel, losing out on the conversion"
c2500248,s8,"However for those coming from Hong Kong, the HKD works in Macau"
c2500248,s9,It is better to have HKD with you
c2500248,s10,"The rooms are big, spacious and clean"
c2500248,s11,Beds are very comfortable
c2500248,s12,The shopping is good
c2500248,s13,It has a great Venice themed river and boat rides
c2500248,s14,The sheer size of the property amazes you
c2500248,s15,However it is a good place for those that are casino crazy
c2500249,s1,"Last time I stayed at the Venetian in Las Vegas, everything was amazing"
c2500249,s2,From having L'occittane toiletries to the kind of service received
c2500249,s3,"So coming to the Venetian in Macao, I had high hopes that it would be as good"
c2500249,s4,"SO first for the good, rooms are exactly the same suite style and really I can't find any fault"
c2500249,s5,HUGE rooms with awesome beddings
c2500249,s6,We got a pretty awesome view of the cotai strip so that was a plus but definitely not the same as las vegas strip
c2500249,s7,Housekeeping service is really good and efficient
c2500249,s8,Food Court has a pretty good selection and for me having a Fatburger there was just amazing :) so a plus!  For the bad:  The shuttle service staff has some pretty rude workers
c2500249,s9,Again not what i expect from Venetian specially when you are paying at a premium
c2500249,s10,Food…
c2500250,s1,I stayed here a few months ago and that was my second time in this hotel
c2500250,s2,I was a bit disappointed because it became like a tourist spot already
c2500250,s3,It didn't seem to be as elegant as how I saw it the first time
c2500250,s4,"However, the room is still nice, Very spacious and the price is very affordable:)"
c2500251,s1,Booked a Royale and a Verona Suite
c2500251,s2,"It maintained a classy look, yet the furniture, carpet and whole feeling just felt too old and ancient"
c2500251,s3,"If that was the whole idea it did a great job, and seeing the TV in living room were still big CRT"
c2500251,s4,it felt too real and old
c2500251,s5,"The whole hotel is not enough for a 2 day stay, cos you will not have enough time to finish just walking around the hotel and to Four Seasons area which is just adjacent to the Hotel"
c2500251,s6,"BUT sleep was just great, pillow and mattress were of excellent quality"
c2500251,s7,Quiet and good darkness
c2500251,s8,"Full amenities, disappointing WiFi with only 2 users allowed and chargeable for the next device, didn't get the chance to try the breakfast cos Macau too have excellent Food Restaurant all over the place"
c2500252,s1,"The hotel is many ways  similar  to the hotel in Las Vegas, very stylish and well made"
c2500252,s2,"The hotel offers a lot of packages and one can visit the hotel website to get good deals , we got ours from there and indeed was a good deal"
c2500252,s3,The hotel offers free shuttle from the ferry terminal and it quite convenient for travellers to get to the hotel
c2500252,s4,"However, if you travelling from the Macau ferry pier to shuttle bus stand it's an ordeal for people travelling with children and strollers you have to go across the road by taking multiple lifts up and down"
c2500252,s5,The staff of the hotel waiting there are not helpful at all  even with children they don't help you at all for loading or unloading the strollers or luggage
c2500252,s6,On reaching the hotel it is even more chaos as you see multiple tour groups…
c2500253,s1,"We booked a room for three adults for a stay on 17th August, for a night"
c2500253,s2,It was a Sunday and I was told that some Chinese holidays were there during that week
c2500253,s3,It took more than 90 minutes to do the check in
c2500253,s4,"The hotel was fully crowded and we could see a long, long queue outside for taxi and shuttle buses! The checking in girls were not getting fresh rooms in the system to allot and therefore, the wait was eternal! They took more than 15 minutes to locate a room for us! It was just pathetic! Finally, when we reached our room, we saw a housekeeping lady and she helped us fix the third bed on the room and also other requirements of tea and coffee"
c2500253,s5,It is a casino hotel like the ones in Las Vegas where getting service is next to impossible! But this place was better! They answered…
c2500254,s1,My husband booked us three nights in a Royal Cotai View Suite as a romantic getaway
c2500254,s2,He also paid extra for express check in which required him to provide his credit card and passport by email
c2500254,s3,"When we arrived, he was required to present all documentation again which meant the process was actually like any other check in"
c2500254,s4,We're still perplexed as to what the benefit of the 'express' process is
c2500254,s5,"When we checked in, we asked about the view and was told we had a very good view of the lights"
c2500254,s6,Our room overlooked a car park come sandpit
c2500254,s7,"When we asked again later that night as we were confident we were meant to be on the other side of building,we were told our original room had not been available when we checked in, but was now it was 10"
c2500254,s8,30pm
c2500254,s9,This meant we had to pack everything up…
c2500255,s1,We have just gotten back from a 1 night stay at the Venetian hotel
c2500255,s2,We took the hotel shuttle bus to and from the ferry pier which was quick and efficient
c2500255,s3,"The hotel was very elegant, beautifully designed and grand"
c2500255,s4,Check-in was quick and smooth and we were lucky to get an early check
c2500255,s5,"We received all our requests: late check out, non smoking floor, high floor and a room near the lift"
c2500255,s6,"Room- The room was huge, clean and beautifully designed"
c2500255,s7,"Service- we requested for some extra towels, shampoo, slippers and they delivered it to our room straight away"
c2500255,s8,"While we were there, we dined at some of the restaurants, went on the gondola ride and visited the Transformers exhibition"
c2500255,s9,"Overall, we had fun"
c2500255,s10,"Our stay would have been perfect if it wasn't for the rude and pushy crowds,…"
c2500256,s1,"I don't think its fair to compare Macau to vegas, they'r completely different worlds"
c2500256,s2,"Macau is more ""raw"" lol and doesn't have the vibe Vegas has, but its enjoyable in its own way"
c2500256,s3,"The Venetian was a pleasant experience and fascinated us with a vibrant lounge and casino, a central location"
c2500256,s4,"Besides the gambling and few good restaurants, do not expect more"
c2500257,s1,I thought  I knew what to expect I was wrong
c2500257,s2,"the hotel is huge ,elegant but sooo noisy"
c2500257,s3,no vacation or relaxing to be expected we got lost looking for the room or the favorite shop or restaurant
c2500257,s4,the canal is beautiful
c2500257,s5,almost like in Las Vegas
c2500258,s1,We stayed here for just 1 night
c2500258,s2,"And as seen in pictures, the hotel is really grand, even their suites are very big"
c2500258,s3,One day won't be enough to roam around the resort
c2500258,s4,"However, I found it disappointing that when we arrived in our room, all the trash bins weren't empty, the room was clean though"
c2500258,s5,So I think the housekeeper who cleaned our room prior to our arrival forgot to empty the trash bins
c2500258,s6,"Another thing was the wifi, it's not for free"
c2500258,s7,"With the high rates for the room, we're hoping they could include the free use of wifi"
c2500258,s8,"They have free wifi in the lobby and I guess in other public areas, but in the guestrooms, you have to pay"
c2500259,s1,The Check-In took ages - inspite of so many counters it took us more than an hour and the best part was that there was no place to sit
c2500259,s2,While I waited in queue my wife and children were standing - all they did was offered us water and directed then to a few chairs somewhere else
c2500259,s3,The Check-out was quick and fast
c2500259,s4,The bell boys were nice and very helpful and very prompt with the luggage
c2500259,s5,Concierge was helpful but let down by the other floor staff who were too tired of directing people
c2500259,s6,The hotel is beautiful with lots of options but it is CROWDED
c2500259,s7,You could see hoards of people coming from all directions and one had to be careful about small children getting lost
c2500259,s8,The place seemed more like a fish market than a luxury resort
c2500259,s9,And be prepared to WALK
c2500259,s10,Rooms were nice and…
c2500260,s1,We stayed for one night and chose the Venetian because of the novelties
c2500260,s2,It is a huge hotel with shops and restaurants
c2500260,s3,You don't need to leave the hotel for anything
c2500260,s4,I think you would see more of Macau staying at our near the Grand Lisboa
c2500260,s5,Takes forever to walk to different areas abs the staff don't really help because there are so many visitors
c2500260,s6,The pools were nice
c2500261,s1,Came here for a brief gambling stint during our honeymoon
c2500261,s2,"My husband loves to gamble, and was dying to see macau"
c2500261,s3,"The venetian here is a mini carbon copy of the one in las vegas, so there wasnt much for us to see"
c2500261,s4,"The casino has the popular western games like roulette, slots, and blackjack- but they only take hong kong dollars"
c2500261,s5,"No where is this posted, and we got kind of shafted trading the macau money for the more legit hkd"
c2500262,s1,Very large suite style rooms with sunken living rooms
c2500262,s2,Being the largest casino in the world makes it a little difficult navigating to your wing
c2500262,s3,"Extensive attached shopping, but little in the way of entertainment (this isn't vegas!)"
c2500262,s4,Limited restaurant options
c2500262,s5,"No real bars, and the casino lacked any significant tables other than  baccarat"
c2500262,s6,Craps and blackjack players will have trouble gambling in macau
c2500262,s7,Had a good craps run on the table we finally found and they shut the table down
c2500262,s8,Wouldn't go back but overall for what Macau has to offer it was a nice spot
c2500263,s1,"The rooms at the Venetian are lovely, however this was overshadowed by the massive crowds of daytrippers in the casino and shopping arcade"
c2500263,s2,"We stayed for 2 nights and our first impressions were not great, we arrived from Hong Kong by ferry and caught the free shuttle bus to the hotel"
c2500263,s3,When we arrived we could not work out where to go - we were eventually helped with our bags and they were delivered to our room separately
c2500263,s4,Trying to find reception with an experience - it took a good 30 minutes to locate it
c2500263,s5,Whenever we asked staff members we were just pointed in a general direction and seemed to be going around in circles
c2500263,s6,"When we eventually checked in and found our room it was lovely - very spacious - however this place is huge - I think about 3,000 rooms - so to get…"
c2500264,s1,Recently arrived for a 2 night stay at the Venetian Macao
c2500264,s2,"I suppose that after having been to most Las Vegas hotels and resorts , especially  having experienced the top notch treatment  EVERY paying customer gets at the Venetian Las Vegas and the Palazzo , I had come to expect the same great service starting at the front desk"
c2500264,s3,Boy
c2500264,s4,oh
c2500264,s5,boy
c2500264,s6,I was in for a rude awakening
c2500264,s7,"During the registration process at the Venetian Macao, i asked the registration  clerk what room view we had at our Bella suite, another registration clerk butted in and said what we had was a standard view and the other view cost more money"
c2500264,s8,Whew!!! Talk about being insulted to your face
c2500264,s9,I simply asked what type of  view we had in our suite since i was not oriented yet to the place  ( Cotai  Strip )…
c2500265,s1,It is a very big hotel and very expensive also
c2500265,s2,The rooms are given antique look which might impress some and may not also
c2500265,s3,The check-in time is very long
c2500265,s4,it is more than 2 hours
c2500265,s5,It is far off from market but free shuttle bus service is available at connecting hotel
c2500266,s1,I spent a weekend staying in Macau and we stayed at the Venetian
c2500266,s2,"The room itself was great, huge and well appointed just like the sister property in Las Vegas"
c2500266,s3,"However, the resort itself was clearly a gambling den with high-end jewellery stores everywhere"
c2500266,s4,It is designed for the new rich of China to come and part with their money
c2500266,s5,Restaurant and bar options were not up to standard
c2500266,s6,It was disappointing to try to find a place for a quiet drink and thought it should be much easier in a place like this
c2500266,s7,The casino itself was the largest smoke filled environment I had ever been in and there was no atmosphere like the real Las Vegas
c2500266,s8,"On a positive note, the concierge service was very helpful and were able to help us find some great restaurants away from the casino"
c2500266,s9,If staying here…
c2500267,s1,Stayed three nights in two rooms for family of six
c2500267,s2,Opted for express check-in and the actual check-in at the counter was actually speedy
c2500267,s3,"However, when we got to our rooms we found that one of the rooms was occupied"
c2500267,s4,It took more than an hour for the confusion to be settled and for us to get our final room assignment
c2500267,s5,We received a fruit basket for our inconvenience
c2500267,s6,"Other than this incident, the stay was pleasant"
c2500267,s7,The room was spacious and comfortable
c2500267,s8,The bathroom was large with full amenities
c2500267,s9,The only incident with the room we had was when the toilet flush was stuck and we almost had to move a second time
c2500267,s10,But fortunately that was fixed
c2500267,s11,Being in a large complex was convenient for shopping and dinner not just within the Venetian but also other complexes like Sands Cotai and…
c2500268,s1,The hotel complex is huge and very lavish?  However to get to our room we were directed to go through the smoking area of the casino
c2500268,s2,We booked a room for three people and it took three requests to try to get the appropriate things needed such as glasses
c2500268,s3,To get ice to our room took two phone calls and a half hour wait
c2500268,s4,"The room itself is beautiful, but a long way from reception"
c2500268,s5,"While we were given a map, there was no directory of services in the room and the one on the TV said that it was still being developed and so it was only after we'd eaten in the crowded food court that we discovered the other restaurants within the complex"
c2500269,s1,In my opinion its a sort of over priced for a room that is not updated with its technology
c2500269,s2,Its obvious that the furniture in the room is getting old and not well maintained
c2500269,s3,Should not charge for the WIFI nowadays most hotels offer it for free
c2500269,s4,Looking forward to coming back to the casinos at least
c2500269,s5,By the way front desk gave my friend and I a hard time getting the deposit back upon check out
c2500269,s6,Front desk staff mumbled something to her colleague which I understood
c2500269,s7,Tsk tsk!
c2500270,s1,"I just arrived today, still stay here for the next few days"
c2500270,s2,"Ok, I understand it is a hotel with 3000 rooms, however the prices are not really ibis level"
c2500270,s3,"NO free wifi? Ok, I pay for it"
c2500270,s4,160HK $ / day no problem
c2500270,s5,"But then it only works in my room??? Not on the bar, the casino, the restaurants or the attached mall? Come on!!! That's ridiculous and really upsetting!   The rooms are huge & clean, but somehow technology is missing"
c2500270,s6,"No iPod doc, in room tv menu is outdated and very slow, English TV channels limited, and PAID wifi is not stable"
c2500270,s7,Would I stay here again??? Probably not
c2500270,s8,"I rather stay opposite at Hard Rock Hotel or any other hotel for half the price, funky rooms and still can come here to the Bellini bar which is vey cool by the way or walk through the all…"
c2500271,s1,I stayed at this Hotel during my trip for 2 days in Macau
c2500271,s2,This hotel located direct connect with the biggest casino and mall in Macau
c2500271,s3,"The hotel has a big room and bathroom, but the interior not artistic"
c2500271,s4,"They had 2 restaurant for breakfast, and since this hotel was so big, it's not easy to get the restaurant's location"
c2500271,s5,I think you can had trip in Macau without stay at hotel
c2500271,s6,"For me, it's better to spent the night in HK"
c2500272,s1,"Just returned for a stay at Venetian, Macau"
c2500272,s2,Pleasant experience overall but regretted choosing this property as there were limited activities to keep the children busy
c2500272,s3,Had to visit the kids play zone everyday to keep children entertained
c2500272,s4,The 4 pools were disproportionately small for such a huge property and pool users were not asked to shower before entry into the pools which was quite unhygienic
c2500272,s5,Showers in the room were too high and adults can't bathe kids without getting wet
c2500272,s6,And the exhaust in the toilet were not effective in removing the lingering stench
c2500273,s1,Hotel is good and have a very big casino but too much to walk
c2500273,s2,It takes lot of time to figure out what is where
c2500273,s3,They have food forum and excellent choice of food
c2500273,s4,If u looking for customer service where u treated well as soon as u enter then this is not the place
c2500273,s5,As soon as u enter the premises u are lost and do no where to check in and where to keep luggage
c2500273,s6,I feel they should give some importance to their hotel guests
c2500273,s7,At least by guiding them where are check in counters and where can we keep our luguage
c2500273,s8,Overall good experience if not looking for VIP treatment
c2500274,s1,We stayed at the Venetian in March for 3 nights
c2500274,s2,I was really surprised about this monstrous hotel
c2500274,s3,The entrance is great - we felled like in another world
c2500274,s4,After seeing our room we was surprised too
c2500274,s5,"Nice size, nice furniture but very shabby and dirty"
c2500274,s6,The service especially in the restaurants is very poor
c2500274,s7,Training is missing
c2500274,s8,Management just focus on gambling money
c2500274,s9,the shopping mall is great
c2500274,s10,Good value for money and nice atmosphere
c2500274,s11,Be careful if you want to order a cab to airport - we needed with USD 50 tip to the person in charge approx
c2500274,s12,30 minutes
c2500274,s13,Book in advance
c2500275,s1,"As expected the room was luxurious (well for 400 GBP a night, we weren't expecting less!) and the service was excellent (except for this Singaporean lady at the baggage service who was rude and rather judgemental)"
c2500275,s2,The downside of this hotel is that it is huge
c2500275,s3,"To get to anywhere, you have to walk about a kilometre through a crowd of chinese package tourists - it's like the whole of China descends on Macau at the same time! I have to say the staff handle them really well"
c2500275,s4,"But because of the sheer number of them, you will have to wait quite some time for everything from checking in to dining"
c2500275,s5,The other thing that I thought I should mention is the smokiness of the place
c2500275,s6,Because you are allow to smoke in the casino which is located right in the middle of the middle in the…
c2500276,s1,Rooms are quality but unfortunately the sound barriers between interconnecting doors are non existent
c2500276,s2,Why you would have a family on a smoking floor is beyond me
c2500276,s3,"Room service is excellent, they set up your table wonderfully"
c2500276,s4,"The casino is problematic, unfortunately you have locals not gambling constantly following you and trying to put either their loyalty card or phone into your machine"
c2500276,s5,I found it rather intimidating and had to tell a few where to go
c2500276,s6,"The fact that I was asked to pay 60 dollars in the casino for a beer was regrettable, should be free in my opinion"
c2500276,s7,A nice lady gave me her number for a free stay next time which was nice
c2500277,s1,"This is a grand hotel, incredibly large and busy"
c2500277,s2,"We thought checkin would take a while after reading other reviews, but we were able to complete checkin very quickly"
c2500277,s3,Finding your room can take some time as you need to walk through the casino floor to the wing where your room is located
c2500277,s4,"Unfortunately we were allocated a smoking room without the staff asking our preference, however they were able to find us an alternative after a few calls back and forth"
c2500277,s5,The rooms are large and well equipped
c2500277,s6,"They have a very classic feel, so don't expect anything very modern"
c2500277,s7,"The casino is massive, and can become quite smokey and even though they have designated smoking areas, it doesn't help"
c2500277,s8,"Minimum bets for most tables are 500 to 1000 HKD, so if you are a beginner who just wants to have…"
c2500278,s1,"I stayed at the Venetian, Macao for three nights for the Global Gaming Show"
c2500278,s2,The rooms are spacious but the service at the hotel needs to be improved
c2500278,s3,"Checkin took 45 minutes, king size bed was not available, and the service at restaurants was not at par"
c2500278,s4,"For instance no one asks for a coffee refill at Cafe Deco, wild berries are on the menu but they bring you cantaloupe (same price)"
c2500278,s5,On top of all this the wifi in my room did not work
c2500278,s6,The hotel is well appointed with finishes and decor similar to the one in Las Vegas
c2500279,s1,I brought my mum to have a luxury stay there
c2500279,s2,But many issues show that the money is not worthy: 1
c2500279,s3,"Over USD300 per night, the hotel don't offer free wifi 2"
c2500279,s4,"When asking the hotel staff how to go to a nearby location, the employee from Mainland just arbitary assign us to take taxi"
c2500279,s5,While another staff correct her and told us the distance is so close that no taxi driver will take the drive 3
c2500279,s6,The room offer 2 welcome drink at the bar downstair
c2500279,s7,"The table shows ""No smoking"" while the table next to us just smoke heavily"
c2500279,s8,"We want to sit on another table, the waitress stop us and yell"
c2500279,s9,"I say, u don't stop them from smoking but stop me to go to a more comfortable air? 4"
c2500279,s10,The >USD300 room still don't offer complimentary breakfast
c2500279,s11,We go for morning tea at the Chinese restaurant…
c2500280,s1,The Venetian is excellent and a luxury hotel
c2500280,s2,The rooms are amazing and huge with fantastic bathrooms and lounge rooms
c2500280,s3,Easily some of the nicest rooms around
c2500280,s4,The hotel has many things to do with a major shopping center with gondola rides
c2500280,s5,"The pools are great but one is currently being repaired, and there is a large gaming floor"
c2500280,s6,Other hotels and casinos around appear small and quiet compared to the Venetian
c2500280,s7,There are many restaurants and a food court to eat at
c2500280,s8,"The hotel itself is easily 5 stars, but our stay wasn't"
c2500280,s9,Our one night stay was pretty much ruined as both my girlfriend and I got food poisoning from the Italian restaurant Vergnano
c2500280,s10,We spent the night in the room being sick within 30 minutes of eating and didn't get to see Macua or the casino at night
c2500280,s11,Not good for…
c2500281,s1,The size of the Venetian is something to behold
c2500281,s2,The resort facilities are very comprehensive and well maintained
c2500281,s3,And of course the gaming floor is absolutely massive; Not at all my scene but certainly the atmosphere is well worth taking in
c2500281,s4,I was staying at the Venetian to watch the Manny Pacquiao fight
c2500281,s5,I'd definately recommend staying at the Venetian if you're there to watch an event like the boxing or UFC
c2500281,s6,It's the best way to take in the build up to the fights and often bumping into the fighters and commentators in the lifts or the restaurants
c2500281,s7,"But otherwise, if I return to Macau I'd prefer to stay at the Westin surrounded by nature"
c2500281,s8,"While the Venetian offers the best of a typical Macau trip, there were plenty of area's in which the service can be improved"
c2500281,s9,On…
c2500282,s1,We spent one night at The Venetian and were impressed with the size and the grandeur of it all
c2500282,s2,"Like other reviewers, we found it too busy and the sheer size of it made it quite tiring to walk around"
c2500282,s3,esp with two young children
c2500282,s4,The room was a great size and was clean and there is a great kids area (which you have to pay for)
c2500282,s5,The light show was amazing but very busy
c2500282,s6,"It was great to see The Venetian, but once is more than enough"
c2500283,s1,It goes without saying that the venue and the rooms are top notch
c2500283,s2,I don't need to comment on the room as they were as good as you would expect
c2500283,s3,I was a little disappointed with some of the service/interactions with staff and the long wait at check in
c2500283,s4,Eventually they had opened up VIP check in to help but by then the wait was already too long
c2500283,s5,"Rose at the concierge was great though, as was one of the male staff at the baggage service in the main lobby who's name I missed"
c2500283,s6,"When visiting two years ago, the Venetian still had a small poker room"
c2500283,s7,Unfortunately I was unable to find info before booking that it had closed and was forced to go play at City of Dreams
c2500283,s8,"Seeing as I came for poker, i'd likely stay at the Wynn next time"
c2500283,s9,The casino was extremely crowded and full of…
c2500284,s1,This hotel is a good place to go for people who loves to stay indoor
c2500284,s2,Everything you can find under one roof! You must have a good memory though because you can get lost inside! So make sure to have the hotel map with you otherwise you might really consume your energy going around looking for the place you want to go to
c2500284,s3,They succeeded in making you feel you're in a different place under one roof! You won't even feel the time because of their lighting! It gives that certain psychological feel that you can go on and on and on going around shop till you drop!
c2500285,s1,We visited the hotel not as residents but as tourists
c2500285,s2,"While the hotel interiors are definitely OTT, they are worth seeing once"
c2500285,s3,But the crowds - my God - they are so immense it is like walking through a forest
c2500285,s4,My friends who stayed there did not have great things to say about the service
c2500285,s5,"It is definitely a attraction to visit when in macau, but I would not stay there"
c2500286,s1,We visited Venetian in the month of Feb
c2500286,s2,The first impression i got was of a crowded railway station with people going here and there to i dont know where
c2500286,s3,"Anyways, checkin was swift but took a while to find the room"
c2500286,s4,The room was exemplary with each article taken care off
c2500286,s5,The shopping canal and the casino are the highlights of this place
c2500286,s6,Food was average including the buffet breakfast
c2500286,s7,It is ok to stay here to experience a different type of experience but beyond one or two days stay it is really wasting your money
c2500286,s8,So bullet points include: Pros 1
c2500286,s9,Huge place 2
c2500286,s10,Clean and nicely furnished rooms 3
c2500286,s11,Casino is USP of this place 4
c2500286,s12,The grand shopping canal is pretty awesome
c2500286,s13,Cons 1
c2500286,s14,Crowded like a Tokyo metro station 2
c2500286,s15,Food is not over the top 3
c2500286,s16,Since it is a huge place…
c2500287,s1,"We did not stay there just wandered  around - might be cool to see once, but definitely not more"
c2500287,s2,"This fake Venice thing is just boring, with cheap paintings all around the walls and ceilings and stupid blue sky"
c2500287,s3,But shops are good!) the building looks much more impressive externally than internally
c2500288,s1,Rooms are nice and large but its very old fashioned
c2500288,s2,For example there is no switch near the bed to charge mobile
c2500288,s3,Bathroom is nice and spacious
c2500288,s4,The hotel is too big and touch to go anywhere
c2500288,s5,Its a nice hotel but there is no feel of being important to the hotel staff
c2500288,s6,I would say its not worth the money paid
c2500289,s1,I was expecting a lot since I had been to the Venetian in Vegas
c2500289,s2,"However, the Venetian in Macau is too crowded"
c2500289,s3,"From the airport, there's a bus waiting for the guests and it's free but nobody's there to help you with your luggage"
c2500289,s4,"Upon arrival, check-in was fast and it was quite confusing going to the room because the hotel is huge"
c2500289,s5,Venetian has a lot of luxury shops and restaurants which is a good thing
c2500289,s6,"The hotel also has free shuttles going to other hotels and casinos, it's really convenient"
c2500289,s7,"For the room, it was huge and spacious, I requested a non-smoking room but we can still smell smoke from our room"
c2500290,s1,So maybe I went with high expectations but doesn't everyone go with high expectations to such a hotel! While the other things can still be situationally good bad bitter
c2500290,s2,hospitality of the staff shouldn't deviate
c2500290,s3,Unfortunately at this hotel the level of hospitality and friendliness displayed by the staff is really poor
c2500290,s4,They may have any number of guests checking in and out simultaneously but guests need to be treated with respect and warmth
c2500290,s5,So we checked in after a bit of hustle and then there was nobody to help with the luggage
c2500290,s6,We searched for help and were told to wait for the luggage to be dropped in the next 45 mins or so or better let the guest take it on his own
c2500290,s7,We opted for the latter one and took the luggage
c2500290,s8,Service overall was really slow
c2500290,s9,It took really long…
c2500291,s1,"This is a beautiful property, if you haven't seen it in Las Vegas then you must in Macau"
c2500291,s2,To stay maybe a day is fine or best to just visit this place for a whole day and stay at the other newer places as there is more service elsewhere and more international tourists in the other hotels
c2500291,s3,"This place is just focused on Asian tourists and gambling, smoking"
c2500291,s4,Also the casino is located in the middle of the hotel so you would have to walk into the casino and the bad atmosphere every time if you are trying to get anywhere
c2500291,s5,If with kids probably not a great place to stay
c2500291,s6,"Also service is not international standard, the reservation staff don't even know much about room types and they are incharge of advising rooms!"
c2500292,s1,My son and I stayed at the Venetian as part of our Macau experience
c2500292,s2,"The hotel was nice, rooms were clean, but you could tell there was some age to the hotel"
c2500292,s3,"I look at details, and in our room you could see some wear and tear in the carpet and in the bathroom"
c2500292,s4,"I noticed an ashtray in our non-smoking room, but I didn't smell any lingering smoke"
c2500292,s5,"The tv remote didn't work the best, but again just some of the details that make a good hotel or a great hotel"
c2500292,s6,Lots of shops just like the Vegas Venetian
c2500292,s7,I did like the fact you can walk from the Venetian via a skyway and get to the other side of the strip and check out the other casinos
c2500292,s8,The casino in the Venetian was smoky
c2500292,s9,Most of the paths through the casino go by the smoking section
c2500292,s10,Even the non smoking section was smoky
c2500292,s11,I…
c2500293,s1,I selected this hotel because I wanted to give my family (4) a special treat
c2500293,s2,Booked a suite
c2500293,s3,"Great room, opulent, fantastic view"
c2500293,s4,"The food court, the shopping mall, the streets of Venice (complete with river and gondolas) were all  very nice"
c2500293,s5,After the initial wow! we soon felt the coldness of the place
c2500293,s6,"Reception staff, baggage attendants, room attendants - very friendly"
c2500293,s7,"Security staff - long faces, grumpy look"
c2500293,s8,"Perhaps because it was a very big hotel, it lacked the personal touch, warmth, welcoming feel"
c2500293,s9,"You just became a face in the crowd of gamblers, day trip visitors etc"
c2500293,s10,"If you walked past a staff member anywhere else other than at their station, no smile, no greeting"
c2500293,s11,"For what it is, it should score a lot higher"
c2500293,s12,"If only it didnt lose the human personal touch factor, it…"
c2500294,s1,We stayed at the Venetian on the 1 January till the 3 2014 for 2 nights
c2500294,s2,We travelled to Hong Kong so decided to go to Macau as we have never been there
c2500294,s3,I looked up the hotels and thought that the Venetian was the nicest place to stay
c2500294,s4,We had problems with them when I made the booking for ourselves and our friends
c2500294,s5,"They sent me a cost which I agreed to, and then I was receiving other emails with other prices"
c2500294,s6,The price went up to almost double the amount for 2 nights
c2500294,s7,I started to get very frustrated and kept asking why the price was going up with every email I received
c2500294,s8,Then I agreed to take the second price
c2500294,s9,I thought we would sort that out when we got there
c2500294,s10,I was so wrong
c2500294,s11,"We checked in I told the girl and showed her the email with the correct price, she was in the…"
c2500295,s1,"We arrived the Macau Airport almost midnight and Hotel airport shuttle service were already close, but the staff of the Venetian Hotel were accomodating who requested Shuttle service to transfer us to the hotel"
c2500295,s2,Check in was pretty fast
c2500295,s3,"Since the hotel was big, we got lost on our way to our room"
c2500295,s4,The suite room was large for 2 people
c2500295,s5,"It could fit 5 persons as they have sitting room with office services, such as fax machine and outlets for your laptops"
c2500295,s6,The view from our room was magnificient
c2500295,s7,"The only drawback was that the free internet was lousy, maybe we were located at the far end of that floor"
c2500295,s8,The beds were soft and cozy
c2500295,s9,"The bathroom was clean, spacious and brightly lighted,towels were spotless clean"
c2500295,s10,"Since we were pressed for time, we were not able to explore the…"
c2500296,s1,I have stayed here because of the works that located in this hotel
c2500296,s2,1st impression when we arrived is that this is a very Huge & Luxurious Hotel
c2500296,s3,But it was very crowded with so many people walking around with a suitcase
c2500296,s4,"My group is 350 pax, and the venetian still have another hundreds groups to handle in the same time, no wonder the place is so packed full of peoples"
c2500296,s5,The room was big with luxury design
c2500296,s6,But too bad the Television was still using tube not LCD to LED
c2500296,s7,"There was a fax machine in each room, but they did not do the maintenance, so there was no ink in it or it was dry already"
c2500296,s8,"Maybe because the place was too big, the management could not control every detail of its property"
c2500296,s9,The Service & staff was very disappointing
c2500296,s10,"The service was slow, and much of the staff…"
c2500297,s1,A highly over rated hotel
c2500297,s2,It was over crowded and service was not particularly excellent
c2500297,s3,"Furthermore, did not enjoy the casino much due to lack of use of english language as chinese was more prevalent"
c2500297,s4,Rooms were decent sized but there was not anything exclusive as I expected
c2500298,s1,"Had a long flight from South Africa to Hong Kong ,then trip by ferry to Macau in transit"
c2500298,s2,Pre booked @ Venetian in November for family of 4
c2500298,s3,"Had to carry own luggage from the bus to reception,then have issues at reception regarding 2 separate rooms on different floors"
c2500298,s4,Then we had to carry the heavy luggage to our 22nd floor rooms
c2500298,s5,Utterly Ridiculous considering the price we paid
c2500298,s6,No personal touch!!Room is great though BUT experience here left wanting
c2500298,s7,BIG MISTAKE
c2500298,s8,Conrad bearer option
c2500299,s1,"The hotel has some impressive and well ornate common areas, grand casino, fantastic shopping mall simulating a Venice experience and exterior facade"
c2500299,s2,It is certainly a big draw for tourism and photo taking
c2500299,s3,"This also means that there are a lot of people which make it more a ""market"" feeling rather than ""exclusive"" as the room price would suggest"
c2500299,s4,"Due to size and large amount ofpeople, the service factor cannot really be felt"
c2500299,s5,Rooms are spacious and comfortable
c2500299,s6,Food inside the restaurants inside the complex are also outrageous
c2500299,s7,Location: besides the modern buildings and large hotel/casinos in the area there is not much else
c2500299,s8,"To enjoy the true ""Macau experience"" one must take taxi or shuttle for 15 mins"
c2500299,s9,And breakfast at Cafe Deco was very poor in comparison to other…
c2500300,s1,I stayed at the Venetian for a breezy touch and go 2 days this Nov
c2500300,s2,Macau is usually touch and go for most tourists - show me anyone who stays for a week or more in Macau
c2500300,s3,"With my Tripadvisor hat on, I found The Venetian to be too many things at the same time (Hotel, Casino, Shopping, Movies, Live Shows"
c2500300,s4,phew!)
c2500300,s5,Anyone entering the hotel from the West Gate will probably get a feeling that they are entering a trading floor on Wall Street than a Hotel lobby
c2500300,s6,Probably 200 buses and 200 taxis at any point in time fill this land mass called West Gate
c2500300,s7,I am reminded that the Venetian was build to handle epic proportions to scale
c2500300,s8,Epic proportion it is
c2500300,s9,Takes me 15 mins to walk to my room from the reception lobby; I needed to carry a map at all times to figure out how do I get…
c2500301,s1,Very excited to go to Venetian where we booked a Verona suite for 4 friends and enjoy a cheap (not so cheap actually) Vegas style experience
c2500301,s2,"Frankly, everything but the room was great"
c2500301,s3,But the room was a massive let-down
c2500301,s4,The suite is one room (which we knew)
c2500301,s5,But the site said we were supposed to have a garden and a decent view
c2500301,s6,We got views of pipes and no gardens
c2500301,s7,Kind of a let down when you pay 8800 HKD a night
c2500301,s8,Without included breakfast
c2500301,s9,"Otherwise, brilliant hotel, great casino, great options for food, entertainment and shopping"
c2500301,s10,And wonderful location in Cotai where you can walk down
c2500301,s11,Service was also very good and prompt
c2500301,s12,We were picked up from the airport
c2500301,s13,Special check-in for the suite
c2500301,s14,No other complaints but the room view and probably would expect at least one…
c2500302,s1,Everything was not cheap
c2500302,s2,I mean I was expecting the prices were beyond the average rates
c2500302,s3,"But I was actually hoping that for an overnight stay, the wifi could have been complimentary"
c2500302,s4,"Okay, I understood that it was booked thru a booking site and it wasn't free, yet the least they could have done was charge me for minutes of data usage"
c2500302,s5,"The connection was so slow, We couldn't connect easily too as we had to continuously log-in whenever we used it"
c2500302,s6,"In fairness, the room was huge, the bed was comfortable and the bathroom too had a tub and a separate shower glass cubicle"
c2500302,s7,The toilet however had no bidet
c2500302,s8,The room had a mini ref but everything consummable except the water was to be paid if one was to eat/drink anything from it
c2500302,s9,"However, for me luckily we were allowed to check in…"
c2500303,s1,I had a night stay at the Venetian macau
c2500303,s2,Was very impressed with the suites and the world largest casino
c2500303,s3,however check in was a big headache
c2500303,s4,As I had to wait in an extremely long queue as I would not had expected in a 5 star world class casino Resort under LVS Corp
c2500303,s5,Marina bay sands Singapore does not have this problem as it have almost the same number of rooms
c2500303,s6,Another problem I am facing is that when I need to have an early checkout
c2500303,s7,I realized that the west lobby front desk is closed
c2500303,s8,I am required to go to the south or main lobby to get my deposits back
c2500303,s9,As I was rushing to the airport
c2500303,s10,I had no choice but to give up my deposit HKD 1000 and drop my keys in express check out
c2500303,s11,"I would love to go back to the resort again, unless improvements are made"
c2500303,s12,Galaxy hotel resort…
c2500304,s1,We stayed at the Venetian Hotel when it first opened
c2500304,s2,it was going through some hitches then as it would be understandable for a hotel of this size
c2500304,s3,"Years later, we had expected that it has polished and ironed out all its failings on opening day but we were sadly mistaken"
c2500304,s4,The hotel still smells of smoke
c2500304,s5,The towels are far from white
c2500304,s6,"Is it not time to change these towels? When I requested for breakfast from In-Room Dining, I was told that I have to wait for 2 hours to get my breakfast"
c2500304,s7,I am sure they were deluged with orders on the day of the Pacquaio-Rios fight but did they not expect this? The design remains gaudy!! Management should realize that you could look Venetian and echo the elegance of old world Venice and not present it as cheap and tasteless!  The only selling…
c2500305,s1,Went to visit for a 2 days stay during the Clash in Cotai event in Macau
c2500305,s2,"The staffs seemed overwhelmed by the crowds, thus services were sloppy"
c2500305,s3,Has an awesome shopping centres and stadium though
c2500305,s4,Feels like a city by itself
c2500305,s5,"Plus the blue sky painting along mall is simply amazing!  But the room's cleanliness, ambience and slow service killed the experience"
c2500305,s6,Time for a renovation
c2500306,s1,"i was here on a weekend, stayed with my family for a couple of days in mid november"
c2500306,s2,"the hotel is too huge and you feel lost in a deluge of people everywhere, in the lobby, queues for check in, very long queues to meet the concierge, its a long walk to the room and takes for ever to reach places of interest within this massive resort"
c2500306,s3,the one thing that we specially disliked about the place was it did not seem like a happy resort
c2500306,s4,we found no one smiling or seemingly having a good time especially in the overcrowded casino
c2500306,s5,we witnessed two brawls in the casino
c2500306,s6,the one good bit was a live band playing at their nightclub bellini
c2500306,s7,the band was really good and the atmosphere relaxed
c2500306,s8,compared to the city of dreams this place has an old feel and i would not like to visit again
c2500306,s9,no…
c2500307,s1,We spent 4 days and 3 nights here
c2500307,s2,"This is our 3rd time at the  Venetian, over 5 years"
c2500307,s3,There are noticeable changes in policies over the years
c2500307,s4,"This time, we were asked to pay in advance the full amount for our rooms and on top of that, a further sum for deposit"
c2500307,s5,The hotel used to zap our credit cards but not pay in advance
c2500307,s6,"Eventually, this was sorted out"
c2500307,s7,"It didn't cross our mind at the time but when we reached our rooms, we began to understand the reason for their implementation of that policy"
c2500307,s8,There were noticeable wear and tear in the hotel room
c2500307,s9,We guessed that there must be many guests who have may damaged or removed items from the room
c2500307,s10,"Despite being non smoking rooms, we could smell cigarette smoke wafting in the air"
c2500307,s11,"The facilities in the room have ""diminished"""
c2500307,s12,…
c2500308,s1,"The room is spacious, but look old style decoration, not really worth the value"
c2500308,s2,"the fitness center is small, the toilet is terrible"
c2500308,s3,a very very small toilet
c2500308,s4,"advantage: has a big mall to shop, 4-5 pools"
c2500309,s1,Stayed at the Venetian Macao in September 2013
c2500309,s2,3 people staying in the Rialto Suite
c2500309,s3,Check in was quick
c2500309,s4,The staff were attentive and responsive to questions and requests
c2500309,s5,The room was huge with a view of the Galaxy Macao
c2500309,s6,"The room had a powder room, generous sitting area combined with a dining area and pantry"
c2500309,s7,"The master suite was very large with a walk a dressing area, king size bed and an enormous bathroom"
c2500309,s8,"While the house keeping staff did their best to keep the rooms neat and clean, it seemed obvious that the Venetian has gone through a lot of wear and tear"
c2500309,s9,"I would not recommend the Hotel breakfast, people are better off eating at the food court in the hotel or the neighbouring hotels"
c2500309,s10,"Being on the Cotai strip, it is connected to all the other resorts via a bus service so…"
c2500310,s1,"After hearing so many people talk about the Venetian and having visited it before, this time we decided to stay here"
c2500310,s2,The transfer from the airport was smooth but upon check-in we were asked for 2000HKD as deposit- now most hotels will keep a copy of your credit card but the Venetian wanted to bill us straight away and upon checkout they would credit our credit card and it would take up to 3 weeks
c2500310,s3,We opted to pay this deposit in cash-even if we paid in USD it would be returned to us in HKD
c2500310,s4,Very weird
c2500310,s5,"Our room- we had a lovely room, a suite i think, overlooking the mini golf course and other hotels"
c2500310,s6,The room had all amenities and was very spacious and the bed was very comfortable
c2500310,s7,Food- last time we visited the Venetian they had  strip of nice restaurants along the canal…
c2500311,s1,Stayed a week for business conference
c2500311,s2,This place is huge & even after 6 days struggled to find way around
c2500311,s3,Literally built around a central casino which you have to traverse one way or another to get anywhere
c2500311,s4,"Smoking is not permitted in much of the hotel but is in parts of casino & some bars, so you will get smoked, particularly in the casino"
c2500311,s5,"Some very impressive features like grand canal with gondolas (on third floor!), some excellent on-property restaurants, golf putting course (on 7th floor!) but all in all has a 'tacky' feel and I personally would recommend Vegas"
c2500312,s1,I was searching for a casino buffet for my day trip to Macao and chose Bambu
c2500312,s2,"My first impression was that the offerings were a bit limited; to be fair, I expected something of a grandiose Vegas-style spread"
c2500312,s3,"Instead, it was one row of heated foods, a seafood station, a steak station and a small dessert area"
c2500312,s4,My biggest gripe was that most of the food was geared towards the Mainland tourists
c2500312,s5,"I've never seen four types of congee at a buffet before! Most patrons gobbled it up, but I thought i cheapened the offerings"
c2500312,s6,"The king crab and sashimi/sushi were the two hit items, in my opinion, and offered a departure from Chinese fare"
c2500312,s7,"Sadly, desserts fell short of my expectations: the cakes and brownies were hardly sweet and clearly made by a Chinese baker (that dry, bread-y taste)…"
c2500313,s1,Stayed at the Venetian for 2 days / nights for a business meeting
c2500313,s2,Super long way to walk from entrance to reception - this already shows that this is not a hotel in classic sense
c2500313,s3,"Rooms are huge and supposed to be ""Venetian style"" or at least what non Europeans believe it is"
c2500313,s4,Breakfast in Café Deco shows the real character (or lack of) of this place (it is just meant to drive the masses into the casino): Mass treatment from all points of view - no personal touch
c2500313,s5,Best about the hotel (and Macau overall) is the high quality of shows: Watching the Dancing Waters which is just within walking distance is a must and costs you less than the minimum bet on many tables
c2500314,s1,"We went to the Venetian to play poker, and were very disappointed"
c2500314,s2,There's no self contained room
c2500314,s3,It's an area that is surrounded by slot machines and table games
c2500314,s4,It's very noisy
c2500314,s5,"The worst thing, though, is the smoking"
c2500314,s6,It seems everyone smokes! At the Wynn Macau poker room there is NO smoking
c2500314,s7,It's much more comfortable
c2500314,s8,And much quitet!
c2500315,s1,Its a good hotel but too big
c2500315,s2,You are sure to get lost in the hotel
c2500315,s3,The most annoying thing was the Casino which blocks the path and one has to take lift or escalator to get from one lobby to another (if u have child below 21 yrs of age)
c2500315,s4,The best part was the gondola street which had a sky like appearance painted on the ceiling
c2500315,s5,The rooms were big but not upto the standard one would expect
c2500315,s6,The pools were good
c2500315,s7,There was a heated swimming pool as well which was great but here also it takes 15 mins from your room to reach the swimming pool
c2500315,s8,I would suggest travellers to stay at Galaxy which is newly built and better than Venetian
c2500316,s1,The room and pols were very opulent but we got lost so many times in 2 days it was ridiculous
c2500316,s2,We got a map of the Hotel but it didnt help much
c2500316,s3,It is just too big
c2500316,s4,"The casino was average too compared to Australian casinos, no tis, sports betting or bars but went to 4 others in Macau and they were all the same ,breakfast also very averAge"
c2500317,s1,"Too crowded, too many non hotel guests parading almost in ever corners of this resort and  too noisy"
c2500317,s2,"Size wise,  this resort is much larger than the one in Las Vegas, but service and quality in general are lagging"
c2500317,s3,"Location is too far from Macau town centre, difficult to get taxi during late afternoon and early evening, we have waited almost one hour in the cue before we can get  one"
c2500317,s4,"Quality of foods and selection of the buffet breakfast at the Cafe Deco is poor, may be the Dim Sum serve in the Chinese restaurant could be better"
c2500318,s1,"Stayed here for four days (conference) , great beds , very comfortable large rooms with separate lounge area"
c2500318,s2,"Luxury shopping close by in a bizzare copy of the Grand Canal and St Marks Square, very surreal but a good copy of the real thing"
c2500318,s3,"If all you want is to gamble in the casino, spend time shopping for luxury goods and not see the real world then stay here, but be prepared for functional service without a smile and most staff who don't speak English"
c2500319,s1,The Venetian Macao has very nice decoration
c2500319,s2,You will feel like you're traveling in Venice in Italy
c2500319,s3,"A lot of shops to spend money, eg"
c2500319,s4,"luxury goods, gadgets, cosmetics and much more"
c2500319,s5,Don't forget to try some local dessert
c2500320,s1,I first stayed in this hotel back in 2009
c2500320,s2,"Because of my amazing experience then, I didn't even explore other options as I knew I wanted to go back to this hotel"
c2500320,s3,Sadly the luxury that I associated with this hotel has declined and the rooms now appear quite dated
c2500320,s4,They no longer have the L'Occitane products and nice extras such as loofahs in the bathroom
c2500320,s5,"The room that I found decadent, now appeared a bit run down"
c2500320,s6,We had the misfortune staying in a room that appeared to have bed bugs and we were moved to another room
c2500320,s7,"To be fair, I was very impressed with the way this was handled as the supervisors all attended to us quickly"
c2500320,s8,We did however lose a few hours moving rooms
c2500320,s9,The hotel is a major attraction in the area so expect the crowds to be crazy every day
c2500320,s10,The casino…
c2500321,s1,"An excellent hotel to stay - large spacious suits, good view, excellent amenities - the walk on first floor is fantastic"
c2500321,s2,And then there are gondola rides (bit expensive) where the boatmen sing to you
c2500321,s3,The food was good
c2500321,s4,"The only reason for giving an average rating was that when we reached the hotel, they could not manage giving out the room keys to about a group of 50 people which was surprising"
c2500321,s5,That part of the stay was poorly managed
c2500321,s6,"Also, we were given the Venetian passports late in the night which had a complimentary gondola ride or visit to the Titanic show - we could not use this as the passports were handed out after the rides had closed and we were checking out the next morning before the rides or show opened"
c2500321,s7,We felt let down by the hotel in handing out the…
c2500322,s1,The hotel itself is world class
c2500322,s2,"However the sheer volume of guests make for very unpersonalised service, not only during check in and out, but also at all of their outlets and shops"
c2500322,s3,"We boarded the free bus service to the hotel, and once we arrived, we got off to be immediately stampeded by dozens and dozens of guests all flocking to the counter for check in"
c2500322,s4,"Check in took almost an hour waiting in queue, and then being told our room wasnt paid for when it was"
c2500322,s5,The room itself though forgave a lot of the earlier upsets
c2500322,s6,The decor is to die for
c2500322,s7,However only look within your room: the views are of pretty much industrial spaces or desert
c2500322,s8,Nothing special
c2500322,s9,The other big downside to this hotel is that smoking is allowed everywhere due to it being a casino
c2500322,s10,Therefore it was not…
c2500323,s1,This is not the first time I have stayed at the Venetian
c2500323,s2,I have stayed twice earlier at the Venetian Las Vegas
c2500323,s3,"Everytime because of requests from friends, I get no choice than to stay here"
c2500323,s4,"The long lines for check-in, on top of that they had my reservation completely screwed up, it took about 30 minutes to check - in"
c2500323,s5,All the coupon offers requires you to go various counters for redemption which take additional time
c2500323,s6,"For the 400-500 dollars / night, you would expect better and premium service"
c2500323,s7,Forget Room service - you can as well make your own meal before they respond
c2500323,s8,Billing always has errors
c2500323,s9,I cannot believe people are so naive (including me) that we accept such awful service levels
c2500323,s10,The dinosaur exhibit that was offered gratis was ridiculously bad
c2500323,s11,My 7 year old…
c2500324,s1,"This hotel was old, I think because of hosting too many travel tour, the maintainence is not as good"
c2500324,s2,Don't bother asking for a non smoking room as you will smell smoke anywhere in the hotel
c2500324,s3,"If you are smoke sensitive, just don't stay here"
c2500324,s4,"The hotel is just too big, lack of personal service"
c2500324,s5,I will only rated a 3 star hotel
c2500325,s1,It is Large
c2500325,s2,VERY large and as a result difficult to navigate
c2500325,s3,It caters predominantly to its core customers being the Chinese and neighbors
c2500325,s4,One gets the impression that while everyone’s money is welcome Westerners are not high on the target market radar
c2500325,s5,The food court in this and the other hotels is very much authentic Asian as are a high proportion of the restaurants
c2500325,s6,"You can find a McD's or Starbucks scattered between the various linked hotels if you want a change from Asian fast food and there are a number of fine Italian, Portuguese and Indian restaurants to be found"
c2500325,s7,The staff are friendly and courteous but the language barrier can be an issue with more than a few of them
c2500325,s8,Service while in the Casino at a table or perched at a slot machine is mostly non existent but I…
c2500326,s1,Very spacious rooms = well equipped
c2500326,s2,Service is very good
c2500326,s3,Breakfast - quality and spread is not grand
c2500326,s4,The room rate seems to be very high for the value that you receive
c2500326,s5,A better hotel may be Hardrock with a package
c2500327,s1,The Venetian should out rightly state their hotel for casino patrons rather than pretending to be also a family hotel
c2500327,s2,The rooms are all big but please bear in mind the price you are paying per room
c2500327,s3,The general condition is slightly above average as it showed signs of wear and tear
c2500327,s4,The property is huge with something like 7000+ rooms but the children's play room is just about 3-4000 sq feet
c2500327,s5,The swimming pools are NOT all open and the adults have to share with the kid's pool
c2500327,s6,Smoking is allowed around the kid's swimming pool
c2500327,s7,There is NO lifeguard on duty
c2500327,s8,The property is habitually crowded because it is one of the tour group designation for mainlanders which lead to over-crowding
c2500327,s9,"Overall for the price paid for the room, there are better and value for money hotels in…"
c2500328,s1,"The rooms are as grand as they can get and i have never lived in a better room before! The spa and the 3 swimming pools with one of then being temperature controlled is amazing! But the service is nowhere of what you will expect! U have 2 pick ur own luggage till the check in counter and also it toook us 2 hours to check in since we had booked 10 rooms! Otherwise the casino, the shops the Fake Sky Illusion are all worth the watch"
c2500329,s1,"The grounds at the Venetian are awesome, including the Shoppes on the Canal"
c2500329,s2,"The room was spacious, but the amenities and fixtures were average"
c2500329,s3,I thought the rooms could be more luxurious given the price paid for the hotel ($180+)
c2500329,s4,"Also, at that price, you would think there would be complimentary internet--no!  Also, the food options in the hotel were quite pricy"
c2500329,s5,The free shuttle from the Taipa Ferry terminal was great though
c2500330,s1,"I travelled to this place with my wife first time and I had been to this place twice earlier and had a good experience earlier but this time the hotel room seemed over used and lacked the earlier luxury feel and worst happened when I tried to use my package Lunch at golden peacock Restaurant for which I Had paid extra at the time of booking room, It Was the most horrible experience of my life in a five star property"
c2500330,s2,We had to wait  for atleast one hour outside the restaurant in a line for our turn to come and I saw the manager sending guests out of turn at his whim and when our turn came and we started having the buffet lunch to my surprise the food was worst and it took another 30 minutes for the waiters to tell me that they cannot give me tandoori rotis etc
c2500330,s3,It was our last…
c2500331,s1,"Stayed in a suite in mid May 2013, for 2 and a half days"
c2500331,s2,A huge resort
c2500331,s3,My room was average
c2500331,s4,"clean, but had an over-used feel to it (price wasn't too bad)"
c2500331,s5,"In the hallway to my room, large stains in the carpet (that should be fixed/cleaned)"
c2500331,s6,"I got the feeling the place was simply too much after only one day of being there (too many people, too much of everything)"
c2500331,s7,"If I ever make it to Macao again, I'm staying at the Galaxy Resort Hotel just down the street"
c2500331,s8,Did a walk through it
c2500331,s9,very nice
c2500331,s10,"The Venetian was not great, but not bad either"
c2500331,s11,Average
c2500332,s1,Stayed for two nights felt like two weeks rooms are beautiful and hotel is exactly what the pictures show gorgeous but not good for family holiday I had teenage daughters and there were some undesirable people they that made our family feel very uncomfortable staff were very friendly and helpful and kind but this is a casino hotel and the atmosphere was exactly that
c2500333,s1,We stayed at the North Wing top floor room 115 with a great view and a huge bathroom
c2500333,s2,I would give the room a solid 5 stars
c2500333,s3,"However, the layout of the hotel complex is such that you find yourself constantly walking just to get by"
c2500333,s4,"It is a long walk from the lobby to the room, and from the room to the west wing where the shuttle buses are"
c2500333,s5,"We got lost a lot and wasted a lot of time wandering around, Looking at the map is not much use since there are 2 levels with the casino in the middle"
c2500333,s6,We have small children and so could not cut through the casino
c2500333,s7,"We have to go up and down around the casino, adding to the time and frustration"
c2500333,s8,My frustration meter was maxed out there
c2500333,s9,We ended up asking the security personnel to lead us the way
c2500333,s10,They always obliged
c2500333,s11,"Wonderful workers there,…"
c2500334,s1,"It is not suitable for kids and older people, the way get to room is a very long one, signage is very poor"
c2500334,s2,"My toilet didn't work, after the maintenance have gone the house keeping that was coming to clean up never show up until I call them"
c2500334,s3,The bell boy service is excellent
c2500335,s1,Arrived at Macau ferry on weekend and easily find big venetian's shuttle bus
c2500335,s2,It was weekend and the hotel was very crowded with people and many group of tours there
c2500335,s3,I got pretty dizzy with hundred of people around
c2500335,s4,"The room is in classic design, amazingly big with comfortable bed, living room with sofabed and very spacious bathroom with bathtub"
c2500335,s5,Young kids will love it there
c2500335,s6,The hotel has everything in there
c2500335,s7,"A place for gambling and shopping, nice foodcourt, kids playground etc"
c2500335,s8,The hotel is expensive but far from elite with so many tourist
c2500335,s9,It more like a big mall
c2500335,s10,And no free wifi in room
c2500335,s11,The securities there are not friendly
c2500335,s12,Probably stressed out too with so many people
c2500335,s13,The casino is too expensive with bet from 300hkd -1500hkd
c2500335,s14,One time is enough for me in here
c2500335,s15,…
c2500336,s1,"I do think this hotel has beautiful European styled decorations, but the thousands of tourists taking photographs everywhere must feel the same way too"
c2500336,s2,"This is the busiest hotel/casino along cotai strip, and the crowd gets too thick sometimes, almost resembling a circus"
c2500336,s3,"Other than the crowd, the room itself is quite spacious and nice, with beautiful decorations, no complains there"
c2500336,s4,"Staff can seem harassed sometimes, it is a massive hotel after all"
c2500336,s5,"All in all, this is not my first choice hotel in Macao"
c2500337,s1,"Their check in time, I believe is the longest among other hotels in Macau, you can hardly find a energetic staff"
c2500337,s2,"But their room is really huge, if you choose their Belle Suite, it's big enough for 6 peoples as there's three queen size bed"
c2500337,s3,"Breakfast at Cafe Deco is poor, dinner buffet at Bamboo restaurant is also below standard, also too crowded"
c2500338,s1,This is one gigantic hotel
c2500338,s2,Check in was chaotic and very slow
c2500338,s3,Can't see why this has to be like this
c2500338,s4,Quality of the room and venue is high but it is not going to ever match the friendliness and nice touches you get with smaller hotels
c2500338,s5,This place is built for the mass market
c2500338,s6,Food at Cafe Deco is below standard for a hotel of this type
c2500338,s7,Very disappointing
c2500338,s8,I will not ever eat there again
c2500338,s9,My overall rating of average is generous when you think of the effort that has gone into the design of this enormous place
c2500338,s10,A high point was the gym and pool
c2500338,s11,Very nice
c2500338,s12,The gym guy was very friendly and provided some good personal training
c2500339,s1,Stayed at Venetian for 3 nights recently
c2500339,s2,"Whilst it is an amazing complex unless you are a gambler or prepared to pay top price for excellent shopping, this not for you"
c2500339,s3,Due to size service is ordinary
c2500339,s4,The Bellini lounge was good value
c2500339,s5,A great band and great hostesses
c2500339,s6,"You will walk what seems an eternity, through the canal shoppes looking for the bargain that is not there"
c2500339,s7,"Best stay at Conrad or Sheraton not as big, better service and still access to casinos and across the road from Venetian"
c2500340,s1,Confusing Hotel - as difficult to locate Reception & further Room Free Breakfast Restaurant - Dirty & very poor Service
c2500340,s2,"Staff very haughty Hotel is like Exhibition hall - as many visitors roaming in Hotel with Flags, etc"
c2500340,s3,Always noise
c2500341,s1,"Payed a lot of money for the ""COTAI DISCOVERY PACKAGE"" and the ""BELLA SUITE"" received worst treatment than a 3 star"
c2500341,s2,We were offered complementary dinner at the rice empire which was to close at 2300hrs according to the pass
c2500341,s3,We were denied food/ our set meal since v reached 10 before the last order time which we never knew
c2500341,s4,"The room service never cleaned our rooms, only the beds were made and dustbins emptied"
c2500341,s5,Dirty plates on the table were never replaced
c2500341,s6,The towels in the bathroom were stinky and we missed locks in the bathroom
c2500341,s7,Also overall everything seemed very commercialized
c2500342,s1,"I had booked a 4 day stay at the hotel and taken the Cotai Discovery Package, which was nearly twice as expensive as the normal rates"
c2500342,s2,Obviously to expect much more than just the room and breakfast
c2500342,s3,At check in I was handed a Passport booklet which listed all that was included in the package and amongst that list was a free lunch / dinner
c2500342,s4,"I chose to use the set meal dinner at Rice Empire, which was located at Cotai Sands"
c2500342,s5,The time specified for the was until 11 pm
c2500342,s6,After walking a mile and reaching the restaurant by 10:40 pm I was told that the last order was until 10:30 and the chef had left and hence no food could be arranged
c2500342,s7,Most of the other restaurant were also closed
c2500342,s8,"When the matter was escalated with the restaurant duty manager and the front desk duty manager, all that…"
c2500343,s1,It's the third time I stayed with the Venetian
c2500343,s2,I really liked their spacious rooms/sitting area and two washbasins in the bathroom
c2500343,s3,"However, this time, a big no-no is the wifi"
c2500343,s4,"In my previous stays, wifi was not common"
c2500343,s5,"But now I would expect that they give provide free stable wifi for their guests, but unfortunately that did not happen"
c2500343,s6,We got charged MOP 200 for a TERRIBLY poor and unreliable network - and all I could do and did was to send a few whatspp messages
c2500343,s7,The bathroom was also not clean enough
c2500343,s8,I took baths but there was visible dust around the bathtub area
c2500343,s9,"Back to some good points, checking in and out was more convenient - more counters/better located"
c2500343,s10,"The bell boys also did a good job, but collecting the belongings which we left in the left luggage was AGAIN a…"
c2500344,s1,"Not really a hotel, more of a Casino, and shopping complex, with rooms attached"
c2500344,s2,"From reception to the hotel, we had to walk through the casino to the room lobby (~5minutes walk)"
c2500344,s3,"Room are generously sized, but already showing signs of ageing"
c2500344,s4,"- Showerhead would slid down by itself, mould coming up under wallpaper/paint in the bathroom"
c2500344,s5,- CRT TV in room
c2500344,s6,"Swimming pool was down endless corridors, there is a sense of fake everything"
c2500344,s7,"But thanks to the casino, the room price is good value"
c2500345,s1,The Venetian Macao is a monstrosity in glass & concrete with the glitz and razmattaz inside quite loud and gaudy
c2500345,s2,To call it a hotel or a resort would be wrong for it is a mini-town by itself and a tourist attraction for any visitor to Macau
c2500345,s3,"To be precise, this hotel is situated in the Cotai strip which is connected to downtown Macau by a sea-link bridge"
c2500345,s4,"The hotel has three massive entrances which open out into long shiny, bright corridors with hordes of residents, tourists and visitors thronging them"
c2500345,s5,"Holding price of place is the enormous main hall of the casino, where people keep gambling from early in the morning"
c2500345,s6,Allmajor shopping brands have outlets inside this mini-town
c2500345,s7,"One level modelled on Venice with its market square ,winding canals, bridges & gondola rides is…"
c2500346,s1,"second time staying here, rooms are spacious, still an air of past luxury to it but very smokey"
c2500346,s2,room service is ok
c2500346,s3,the mall within this resort and the mall connecting from four seasons hotel next door is good
c2500346,s4,"its ever changing in Macau, many more other newer luxury resorts sprouting along this Strip"
c2500346,s5,"enjoyed the pools this time, although bit small and scattered, lots of kids, crowded with deck chairs and minimal food & beverage options by the poolside at the time we were there"
c2500346,s6,"location is right by the Strip (similar to the Las Vegas Strip layout), good if you are planning to do a resort crawl and shop at the malls located within these resorts"
c2500346,s7,close to the cotai ferry and local airport
c2500346,s8,"if you are interested in local sites, they are mainly located on the Macau Island"
c2500346,s9,you…
c2500347,s1,Have stayed here 3 times now and have found the room prices steadily rising to the point that I doubt we'll stay again given lack of offers available
c2500347,s2,"We paid about £250 for 1 night room only - which for the experience is great - but how long do you really stay in your room and get vfm?   Don't get me wrong - we managed to get one of the few family suites which had great touches such as: - mini towelling bath robes hung in the wardrobe - plate of chocolate cookies and strawberries - Wii - double sized bright orange bunk beds - bright orange bean bags - FABULOUS touches in the bathroom including a family of 4 rubber ducks, baby toiletries, pink and green children's toothbrushes and toothpaste"
c2500347,s3,"The face clothes by the sinks and bath had been shaped into an elephant, bird and dog…"
c2500348,s1,Just a short break at Venetian & Glaxy during the last holiday
c2500348,s2,Huge of Chinese around the world
c2500348,s3,"The service ok la as for few thousand of rooms, especially  the ambassdor in lobby"
c2500348,s4,"I perfer the mattress & pillow in Vemetian more comfortable than Glaxy, also the bathroom well equiped"
c2500348,s5,Only need to take care the Maintance job in details
c2500348,s6,other were good condition
c2500348,s7,The swimming pool take a long walk
c2500348,s8,"ok la for vacation,  However I like the beach / pool in Galaxy more fun"
c2500348,s9,"Anyway, well dome keep up"
c2500349,s1,The Venetian Macao is a huge all-suite hotel complex situated on the progressing Cotai strip of Macau
c2500349,s2,It is very similar to their property in Las Vegas
c2500349,s3,It comes complete with the indoor canals and airconditioned shopping plazas
c2500349,s4,"Like any other mega-casino hotel, they are not able to provide the personalized service or guest recognition that an individual can expect in a Four seasons or a Fairmont hotel"
c2500349,s5,"After a few years of operation, rooms are still in fairly good shape"
c2500349,s6,The rooms we booked were clean and in order
c2500349,s7,"It was generous in size, and a fax - copier machine is also at every workdesk"
c2500349,s8,"Everything needed is within arm's reach to dining, shopping and gambling choices"
c2500349,s9,The place is very popular with the locals so expect these areas to get crowded during the day
c2500349,s10,The…
c2500350,s1,First of all the food is disastrous
c2500350,s2,"We decided to check in an realised that we had to drag our suitcases on carpets,which is not easy despite the wheel, to a long distant without any help"
c2500350,s3,the check in was fast
c2500350,s4,The rooms were great
c2500350,s5,What was pathetic was that a hotel as big as Venetian would charge its guest money to use the internet
c2500350,s6,We had stayed at a 3 star property in HK before this and internet was complimentary so were shocked at this money making dirty scheme of theres
c2500350,s7,then while having a bath the shower just fell off
c2500350,s8,Fortunately someone came and repaired it fast
c2500350,s9,The checkout takes a long time
c2500350,s10,It takes the bellboy half hour to come and get the luggage
c2500350,s11,We decided to have asian
c2500350,s12,food for lunch where a chef helped us choose vegetarian food
c2500350,s13,First they had only 3…
c2500351,s1,The reviews about the Venetian being smoky and huge are correct
c2500351,s2,"I haven't been to the Vegas property, so this was my first time in a hotel like this"
c2500351,s3,"I visited very recently with my husband, my mum, her partner and my aunties"
c2500351,s4,"It is located about a 5-10minute complimentary bus ride, from the airport"
c2500351,s5,You could technically walk in between the two
c2500351,s6,The reception area is huge and they also have a great bag drop service in case you check in too early or check out early before a late flight
c2500351,s7,"The ceilings, though pretty, are wall paper-prints!  The casino is in the centre of the hotel and you need to walk through it in order to access any food, suites or shops"
c2500351,s8,The casino is like any other casino
c2500351,s9,There is a smoking side and a non smoking side but it doesnt make much of a…
c2500352,s1,I have just returned from a conference which was held at the Venetian in Macau
c2500352,s2,The hotel is modelled on the one in vegas and in many respect is very similar and in many respects quite different
c2500352,s3,These places are a mecca for gambling
c2500352,s4,"Whereas the property in Vegas has a much more fun atmosphere about it, the Macau property is much more business with Chinese gamblers"
c2500352,s5,"Its a huge property, somewhat gaudy but i expected nothing less"
c2500352,s6,Some off the walkways in the hotel are like dual carriage ways
c2500352,s7,The decor on the ceiling in somewhat OTT
c2500352,s8,The upside away from the casinos is that it does have great shopping and if you want to take trips on the gondola's
c2500352,s9,Not somewhere i would visit or spend money but as it was a conference it seemed OK
c2500352,s10,I think 3 days in Macau and 3 days at the…
c2500353,s1,Stayed 2 nights at the Venetian Macau with the family
c2500353,s2,The hotel is just massive with a shopping mall and connected to few other hotels
c2500353,s3,You will get lost
c2500353,s4,Was very impressed with the rooms as they were very large with a sitting area and the bathroom was very large and clean
c2500353,s5,The casino is in the centre of the hotel so if you are intending to gamble then it is very handy as you can enter the casino from any direction
c2500353,s6,A bit of a maze and struggle if you are under 21 as you will not be allowed to enter the area
c2500353,s7,"It took ages for us to find our room when we checked in as wherever we end up, it's the entrance to the casino"
c2500353,s8,There are many places to eat but the food was nothing special
c2500353,s9,We decided to go out of the resort and went for a local Portuguese restaurant which was…
c2500354,s1,"This hotel looks really luxury and spacious, all rooms are suites, with a living area, window bay, sofa, 2 tvs, etc"
c2500354,s2,The room I was staying had 2 double beds too
c2500354,s3,"The bathroom is huge too, with 2 basins, a bath tub and shower room, a dresser, and another door to toilet"
c2500354,s4,"There's one thing that I dont like, the room is full of the smell of cigarette although it's not a smoking room"
c2500354,s5,"Since both of my husband and I dont smoke, we dont feel comfortable in that room, but I suppose it's ok for smokers"
c2500354,s6,The casino is just right next to the hotel as in Las Vegas etc
c2500354,s7,So you got casino and many shops there all in one roof
c2500354,s8,"Moreover, they build a artificial canal, with Gondola that you can pay and ride, it's about 110 HK dollars, around 10 pounds per person,  the gondoliers might…"
c2500355,s1,We spent one night at the Venetian Macau as part of a longer stay in Hong Kong and to see a particular show in town
c2500355,s2,We arrived on the Cotai Ferry and took the Hotel shuttle to the resort
c2500355,s3,Check in was quick and efficient and we were given an upgrade to a Cotai view room
c2500355,s4,"When we got to the lift to go to our room we thought we would be away from the cigarette smoke that overpowers the casino, we were wrong! Even though we were on a non smoking floor, the lift, corridors and our room smelt"
c2500355,s5,"The room however was really luxurious, with a huge bathroom and sitting area"
c2500355,s6,Although it does look a bit worn and I think it's themed décor has aged quickly
c2500355,s7,We had fun wandering through all the shops and the themed facade's look great
c2500355,s8,There was a lady singing opera from a first floor…
c2500356,s1,Stayed here for a 2 day conference (with my wife accompanying me)
c2500356,s2,GOOD BITS The room was very spacious with a lounge area
c2500356,s3,The bed was comfortable
c2500356,s4,Room was clean
c2500356,s5,BAD BITS Personally I found the hotel complex was just too large and cumbersome
c2500356,s6,For example - from the check in reception desk we had to walk about 300 metres through the casino area and out the other side to get to the hotel lifts which was pretty odd
c2500356,s7,If you wanted your luggage delivered to your room it was going to take 30 minutes - so we ended up wheeling ours through the casino ! Not a 5 star feeling at all
c2500356,s8,To leave the hotel by taxi - it seemed that you had to walk about 10 minutes to get to the taxi rank (although it was probably only 5 minutes) and it didnt feel convenient
c2500356,s9,The casino was inhabited by…
c2500357,s1,The hotel is huge and its very easy to get lost
c2500357,s2,When we arrived there was no-one to guide us through the almost 1km long front lobby
c2500357,s3,So we had to drag our own luggage through carpeted area to get to the check-in desk - where we were told the was a bell captain located at the entrance
c2500357,s4,We just couldnt see it due to the huge number of people there! The staff are not well trained in guiding guests to the locations asked about
c2500357,s5,"It didnt matter where we wanted to go we were always told ""go straight for 10m and turn left!!"" The restaurants had great buffets and the  casino was exciting"
c2500357,s6,The room and bathrooms are huge and the amenities are decent
c2500357,s7,However it was a let down when compared to the Las vegas property
c2500358,s1,i chose this hotel bec i've been heard about it for years besides the amazing photos i saw online
c2500358,s2,"yes the decoration is very luxurious, but the service is not"
c2500358,s3,"they charge $160 for 24hrs internet, however, on my  2nd nite there, i cannot log into the payment page! means that even i want to pay for internet, they don't give me the chance! the IT came to mend for the whole nite yet useless… besides the food is also plain…had 3breakfast, no comments"
c2500359,s1,"Every time I stay at the Venetian in a non smoking room, I can always smell smoke which probably deep into the wall and carpet"
c2500359,s2,The room is huge but I kept feeling its not clean
c2500359,s3,The Venetian in Las Vegas is 10 times cleaner
c2500359,s4,Always long line up to check in or check out
c2500359,s5,"The moment you go down the elevator to the mall, it's super crowded"
c2500359,s6,"We took our one year old and the room has nothing prepared for kid, which was the first time after we travel with our kid more than 10 times everywhere"
c2500359,s7,We have given enough chance to Venetian macau hoping they will improve but I think we will give up from now on
c2500360,s1,This is our first visit to Macao so we chose to stay at the Venetian
c2500360,s2,We arrived there by taking a jet boat from HK
c2500360,s3,It took a short trip from HK to Macao; quite convenient
c2500360,s4,The custom services did not keep us long
c2500360,s5,There was also a hotel bus to picking up and dropping off the hotel's guests
c2500360,s6,"When making an entering to the hotel, the lobby was amazing and it was one of the landmarks for photo shooting"
c2500360,s7,"While waiting for the checking-in service, we were studying the directory of the hotel via a big touch screen machine assisting us to explore all the wings, shops and services offering at the Venetians"
c2500360,s8,"We were staying in the Bella suite which was grand and huge, it comes with spacious bathroom, two glamorous queen beds, a small living  area and the outdoor space where we could…"
c2500361,s1,I was rather disappointed with the hotel
c2500361,s2,"Stayed 2 nights, and wished i have chosen otherwise"
c2500361,s3,"Some staff were friendly, but most staff were not, when asked for direction, they sounded so impatient"
c2500361,s4,"The area is huge, we felt tired walking, after check-im, we have to go from  lobby to 3rd floor, walked like few hundred meter looking for the South Wing, and seems like not many staff around to help"
c2500361,s5,"Room was slightly dated, bathroom does not have hand-held shower, thus making it very difficult to bath our young son"
c2500361,s6,"Shuttle buses go to limited places, unlike the other one we stayed a night before"
c2500361,s7,"When we opened our door room, a guy was doing maintenance work"
c2500361,s8,"Next day, When we went back to the room after a tiring walk, the door lock was spoilt, and took an hour to fix"
c2500361,s9,The…
c2500362,s1,I went to Macau for 1 day after a trip to Hong Kong and was very disappointed and wished I could have turned back and stayed in Hong Kong for 1 more day
c2500362,s2,"Macau is huge, hard to get around, especially in rainy, humid weather and the casinos smelled strongly of cigarette smoke"
c2500362,s3,The Venecian is a huge resort and was a beautiful place to shop and explore but the rooms were disappointing
c2500362,s4,Our room was the cheapest of them all but it was still a GRAND room
c2500362,s5,I liked the spacious living areas and the bathroom was huge but everything just seemed run down and old
c2500362,s6,"While it was all cleaned well, it just all felt a little musty and overused to me and was not the modern resort I would have preferred"
c2500362,s7,"If you're after a grand hotel, its great, but if you're after a nice, clean and modern hotel…"
c2500363,s1,"room is comfy and spacious, facilities are abundant! events and shows are plenty"
c2500363,s2,Food is okay
c2500363,s3,The place is huge and gave an impression that you could get easily lost or at least will be soo tired to walk from one point to the other
c2500363,s4,"I don't quite like the decoration and style that is a little too ""fake"" for me"
c2500363,s5,"I mean, what's the point of riding a gondola inside a hotel?"
c2500364,s1,Without doubt I have never stayed in a more luxurious room in my life
c2500364,s2,Shopping areas casino and food court are all fab
c2500364,s3,A few things missing 1) No one to pick up our luggage at the Macau ferry terminal in face we had to put the luggage in the bus our self
c2500364,s4,On reaching the hotel I had to go inside and ask for the bell boy to come out outside to the bus no one was there to receive us at the bus when it reached the hotel
c2500364,s5,I felt less then welcome on arrival
c2500364,s6,2) After breakfast the started arranging the lunch we were still there after our breakfast
c2500364,s7,A two year old kid was with us it saw a banana on the lunch buffet he wanted it so we requested the manager the can we please have 1 banana for the kid
c2500364,s8,I was shocked when she said no and when she said no she was not polite
c2500364,s9,Other…
c2500365,s1,We arrived at this Grand looking hotel
c2500365,s2,It is positively huge
c2500365,s3,We checked in and were given a map to find our room
c2500365,s4,We really struggled to find it as this hotel branches off all over the place
c2500365,s5,"Our room was nice,besides all the black mould all over our shower, which made me wonder how clean the rest of it was"
c2500365,s6,We wanted to go out of the hotel and catch the shuttle
c2500365,s7,"We got so lost trying to get out, we just returned to our room"
c2500365,s8,The casino is full of smoke
c2500365,s9,Even the non smoking areas stunk of it
c2500365,s10,The gambling was very expensive
c2500365,s11,The cheapest blackjack was $40 AUD a bet
c2500365,s12,We did not find the food hall until the second day
c2500365,s13,That was quite good
c2500365,s14,It was very beautiful and the false sky on the ceiling was impressive
c2500365,s15,Also the Winter light show was amazing
c2500365,s16,For breakfast we were told…
c2500366,s1,After we stayed for two nights at the Sofitel in Macau we wanted to experience the Venetian for a night
c2500366,s2,We booked the Titanic package as we heard it was good
c2500366,s3,When we arrived at the West Lobby confusion started immediately
c2500366,s4,It was literary swarming with people most of them from various touring companies
c2500366,s5,There was no staff to assist us in any way with our luggage
c2500366,s6,We entered the West lobby because that seemed to be the most logical approach to follow
c2500366,s7,We passed a luggage station and walked about 10 – 15 minutes to the reception
c2500366,s8,This is a huge building
c2500366,s9,All that time no staff to assist us in any way
c2500366,s10,When we finally got to the West lobby we found out there was no way to check in early
c2500366,s11,We approached a staff member and with great difficulty we found out that even though there…
c2500367,s1,First impressision is the crowd! My wife literally said are we in a market! No such grand welcome or whatever!  But I had to say I was quite lucky to have a speedy check-in
c2500367,s2,"However, I couldn't believe  that I still need to give the Hotel a deposit (through credit card per-athorisation) as a security for the mini bar even I had paid all room rates in advance (obviously good credit standing) and considered that I justed stayed in 4 stars hotel that didn't even bother do the same! It seems the 5 stars hotel is more petty and small-hearted than the 4 stars!  I had to said the room is gorgeous! No complaint about the space, cleanliness & view"
c2500367,s3,But
c2500367,s4,"the big big drawback is no free wifi or Internet connection in the room or hotel lobby! Again, I couldn't believe this considered…"
c2500368,s1,I have selected this hotel based on recommendation of my friend
c2500368,s2,He mentioned that it is unique and good to stay for one night
c2500368,s3,"If you would like to go and enjoy Casino and like a gigantic size of hotels, then this may be the one"
c2500368,s4,"For me and my mother, who usually prefer staying in a small scale hotel and enjoy exploring historic part of the city, it was too far from the main city center"
c2500368,s5,"The shopping mall attached to this hotel also closed quite early and when we arrived in the hotel in the evening from Hong Kong, we were not able to enjoy shopping"
c2500368,s6,There is nothing wrong with the hotel but it did not match my usual taste and serve the purpose of my visit to Macao
c2500369,s1,We spent a night here on a recent Asia vacation for a little R&R
c2500369,s2,"Huge disappointment for any Vegas fan - imagine a Vegas casino, which looks remarkably like its Vegas equivalent, especially in the lobby; but without any of the partying, drinking, noise making or general raucous fun"
c2500369,s3,"The casino is quiet apart from the sounds of the machines, the gambling crowd is quiet and serious, and there was only one small bar in the entire casino floor"
c2500369,s4,"The rooms are comfortable and clean, and again very similar to the Vegas ones"
c2500369,s5,"The casino runs a bus from the Hong Kong ferry terminal, so its easy to get there"
c2500369,s6,"It does have a Starbucks, thank goodness"
c2500369,s7,"Better still, its open 24 hours if you have jet-lag"
c2500369,s8,"Talking of jet-lag (or not), the gambling clientele apparently sleeps the night on…"
c2500370,s1,"My husband brought me for a weekend birthday stay at the Venetian - we love the one in Vegas, and the Venetian Macau certainly is up to the mark"
c2500370,s2,"We especially enjoyed the ""birthday surprise"" arranged by the Venetian - theymade us feel very special"
c2500370,s3,no complaints as regards the room and the service
c2500370,s4,"My only complaint is that the room, pillows, duvet and sofa had a very stale smoke smell, which just wouldn't go away - even on a non-smoking floor"
c2500370,s5,An air purifier would have been helpful
c2500370,s6,"The stale smoke smell in the rooms has slightly put us off the Venetian, and not sure whether we will perhaps try another hotel the next time we are there"
c2500370,s7,"Other than that, or it you are a smoker, go for it!"
c2500371,s1,My husband and I stayed here for part of our honeymoon
c2500371,s2,The place is absolutely enormous
c2500371,s3,"So big that we didn't even bother going down to the pools, they were just too far away"
c2500371,s4,"Our room was large, with a huge bathroom, and a separate sitting room and a great view"
c2500371,s5,"However, the service was somewhat lacking, it was almost as if the real interest of the hotel is the casino, and the hotel guests are just an afterthought"
c2500371,s6,"We found the smoking in the casino quite off putting, as you often had to go through there to get to where you wanted to be"
c2500371,s7,"Also, there is almost no natural light in the hotel lobby and other areas, which can be quiet disorienting"
c2500371,s8,"There are numerous restaurants and food outlets, and a whole shopping mall in the centre"
c2500371,s9,These were busy most of the time that we…
c2500372,s1,We stayed in Macau just to see how it had progressed as part of our honeymoon
c2500372,s2,We thought The Venetian would be a great place to stay based on TA reviews
c2500372,s3,"The hotel itself was fine, but as others have mentioned - a massive confusing rabbit warren"
c2500372,s4,We tried to find the gym - walked about 800 metres and gave up
c2500372,s5,"If you're looking for night life and ease of getting around, this is not the place to stay"
c2500372,s6,Macau is certainly no Vegas
c2500372,s7,"If you're more into seeing the city and wandering around at night (which we were) you are far better off staying over on the other side, near Nam Vang lake"
c2500372,s8,The Venetian was only really accessible by taxi or shuttle bus
c2500372,s9,"If you do stay here, it is worth going to North - a fabulous restaurant"
c2500373,s1,"We stayed at the Venetian for 1 night, just to experience the craziness of Macau and it's casinos as these huge hotels are not our style"
c2500373,s2,"For such a huge hotel they are able to maintain very friendly and personal service, I was impressed"
c2500373,s3,But for the rest you feel like cattle
c2500373,s4,It starts with the complimentary shuttle bus where you stand in line as cattle to be driven into the bus
c2500373,s5,At the hotel you are in line to check in
c2500373,s6,But they are very fast and efficient
c2500373,s7,"However they forgot to include our 6-year old in the reservation even though I made a note on the online booking form and when receiving the booking confo without the 6-yr old, sending another email"
c2500373,s8,There was nothing in the system: amazing
c2500373,s9,"Anyway, the guy from reception fixed it within 10 minutes and we could proceed to…"
c2500374,s1,I chose to stay at venetian hotel even though i have read about bad reviews bec i was traveling with 2 kids
c2500374,s2,the advantage is that the bella suite has 2 queen size beds that can easily accommodate a family of four
c2500374,s3,"my first tip is this, if u want to save money u can get the cotai room that has only 1 king size bed bec every room has a pull out  sofa bed that is queen in size, just ask them to prepare it for you, they will provide all the trimmings like pillows, bed sheets and blankets"
c2500374,s4,"2nd tip is this, the food at cafe' deco is horrible, i can't believe a 5 star hotel serves that kind of food! yuck! anyway u have 3 restaurant options of free breakfast or lunch"
c2500374,s5,so make sure u eat at Bambu restaurant
c2500374,s6,food there is delicious and clean
c2500374,s7,"just look it ask for direction, it's worth…"
c2500375,s1,I never understood the hubbub surrounding The Venetian Macao until I finally stayed there a few days ago
c2500375,s2,"Upon entering the hotel, the first word that came to mind was ""excess"
c2500375,s3,""" Everything was meant to be over the top"
c2500375,s4,This is like a country in itself
c2500375,s5,"As another reviewer noted, once there, you never have to leave"
c2500375,s6,"It is hard even if you tried, as you can literally get lost among the hallways, fake canals and endless shops here"
c2500375,s7,"The place reminds me of a grand bus terminal, albeit a luxury one"
c2500375,s8,"If you want peace and quiet, this place ain't it"
c2500375,s9,"Actually, the whole of Macau ain't it"
c2500375,s10,You need good walking shoes as you will do a fair amount of walking when at The Venetian
c2500375,s11,"The hotel side of the complex is nothing extraordinary, with decoration and architecture that are more…"
c2500376,s1,A massive hotel
c2500376,s2,Huge long long walk from the elevator to your room
c2500376,s3,but the room was always spotless
c2500376,s4,They must have an army of staff
c2500376,s5,Shame the reception staff don't speak English
c2500376,s6,This hotel has everything you can imagine
c2500376,s7,If you stay here you will never have to leave
c2500376,s8,The shopping centre has not one but three indoor canals you can float down to look at the latest sales and if you have any money left you can go gamble in the world largest casino
c2500376,s9,Not the best hotel but always a great time
c2500376,s10,If you do want all the benefits of the Venetian but a far superior service stay at the four seasons which is connected to the Venetian development
c2500377,s1,Was there for sightseeing and window shopping
c2500377,s2,Did not stay@ the hotel
c2500377,s3,Free shuttle bus from the jetty
c2500377,s4,Remarkable design to have man-made canal
c2500377,s5,"Many shops along the canal, but mainly were high-end stuffs, There were singing performances on and off during certain timings"
c2500377,s6,"Took a boat ride in the canal, and the boatman was entertaining, informative and friendly"
c2500377,s7,He sang a couple of songs on the boat during the (appox?) 15 + boat ride
c2500377,s8,However the ticket purchasing process can be improved much better
c2500377,s9,"We were in front of the queue@ one of the booths stationed along the walking paths, but the staff allowed an English speaking person to purchase 1st? (spoke mandarin to the staff)"
c2500377,s10,She ignored me after i told her we were ahead of the english speaking person (nothing against this…
c2500378,s1,"Hi,  I travelled to Macau with family during mid Nov '12 and had a pre-booking at The Venetian Hotel and Resort for 2 nights"
c2500378,s2,"As I had read many reviews, I was looking forward to a grand hotel with excellent rooms and comparable service"
c2500378,s3,While staying there for 2 days I realized that its more hype than actual experience you can get for such a pricey hotel
c2500378,s4,"Check in was quick with not much problems however, they do ask you for a large deposit at check in"
c2500378,s5,"This was despite full payment already been made in advance! As it is a grand property, it takes you some time to figure out the way to your rooms"
c2500378,s6,I was pleased to see a large room with two separated sections
c2500378,s7,"Though slightly disappointed that the room was called a ""suite"""
c2500378,s8,It had all the key ingredients that you can expect…
c2500379,s1,Stayed at the Venetian recently as it was greatly recommended by our travel agent
c2500379,s2,"Very impressive hotel, but the bad service at the very start of our stay put us totally off"
c2500379,s3,"We got to Macau from Hong Kong on the ferry, and took the free shuttle bus to the hotel"
c2500379,s4,"There was no one to help us with the baggage at the bus, and we were dropped off at the west lobby, and had to lug out bags over the soft carpet for quite a bit to the check in counter"
c2500379,s5,"Check in was pretty much ok, however when we asked for our bags to be sent to our room, we were informed that it would take over an hour for the same"
c2500379,s6,We were allotted a suite in the north block and the check in for the same is at a fair bit of distance involving a long walk lugging your own luggage
c2500379,s7,"Rooms are well appointed, spacious,…"
c2500380,s1,I was stayed in Venetian resort @ OCT 2012
c2500380,s2,it was very over crowded because there is a big shopping mall and very big casino also
c2500380,s3,I was booked one suit
c2500380,s4,"No breakfast include, no fruit basket, no complimentary drinking water"
c2500380,s5,"Staff not helpful, Room is neat and tidy"
c2500380,s6,Not proffered for family/ business
c2500380,s7,I cannot prefer this hotel
c2500381,s1,this hotel is landmark of macau but for family this hotel is not good
c2500381,s2,no indian breakfast
c2500381,s3,"as advertised, there was no entertainment activities"
c2500381,s4,room service was very poor
c2500381,s5,rooms were excellent and spacious
c2500382,s1,Venetian is for sue a symbol of the new Strip in Macau
c2500382,s2,"The first to come and still proposing a very interesting integrated resort with a huge shopping center, nice casino (if you gamble, I don't) and nice rooms"
c2500382,s3,"I've been at Venetian many times, but I've to say the place is getting old, and would need some more care and maintenance"
c2500382,s4,"The rooms are still fit and nice, but the corridors have dirty carpets, scratches on the wall and are not really nicely lit"
c2500382,s5,"Being an All-Suite hotel, the normal suite are very nice, and at reasonable price, but the options for something better are really limited"
c2500382,s6,"The Rialto suite are large, but kind of empty, and while the normal rooms are classy, the others sway quickly into tacky"
c2500382,s7,"Around, there are much better option for nicer…"
c2500383,s1,Check in on 13 November 2012  The Macau ferry terminal had a nice free of charge bus pick up to the hotel which was a nice thought
c2500383,s2,The check in process was smooth and the staff assisted us well
c2500383,s3,One cannot pass the casino floors with the luggage and the other way to rooms is quite lousy
c2500383,s4,"Anyways, now its time for the grand moment 'enter the room' and its a beautiful paradise"
c2500383,s5,Such nice and comfortable and elegant rooms - wow! I wish the same for my house room
c2500383,s6,"And the bathrooms, even more wonderful; excellent choice of fitting and colors"
c2500383,s7,I HAD ONE OF THE BEST SLEEPS AT THIS HOTEL
c2500383,s8,As we checked in the afternoon 2 pm we dropped our bags and went for lunch finding something vegetarian to eat
c2500383,s9,There's a large food court on the 3rd floor and offers a nice variety
c2500383,s10,I normally…
c2500384,s1,"The people outside is speaking chinesse language or kongfu, soo its very difficult if you cant speak, although their face is western, they are totally cant speak english"
c2500384,s2,"This place not a building, i think its other world"
c2500384,s3,"Because its always sunny, they paint the sky just like the same blue sky"
c2500384,s4,"You cant figure it out, where is the window of this building"
c2500384,s5,"This place very suitable for honeymooners, because its soo romantic, the background for take a photo very amazing"
c2500384,s6,"I think one week is not enough to explore, for the  first time, i think its soo confusing, because this hotel always crowded and they have two different side of reception, For group and family"
c2500385,s1,I was there for the UFC fight
c2500385,s2,"The complex is gigantic, opulently designed with all sorts of fake murals, pseudo venice touches etc but has a distinct sort of fast food-ish touch"
c2500385,s3,"Total overkill in terms of size and fake gold, very easy to get lost, you can probably spend a week in there not seeing a single ray of sunlight"
c2500385,s4,"Size of rooms probably ok but overall I wouldn't consider this top end, it's a death star of a hotel but lacks all charm"
c2500385,s5,"The restaurant we went (Old Neptune or something) was well below average, utterly westernized kind of Cantonese food, same as you get everywhere on the planet"
c2500385,s6,"except in Guangdong, until I had a dinner there, and for premium price"
c2500385,s7,"Any 5 star Hong Kong hotel's restaurant (and in fact, hotel, except maybe for room size) beats it by a…"
c2500386,s1,the largest hotel in the world
c2500386,s2,"attended a conference, for the second time there"
c2500386,s3,large suites with complete amenities; hotel has dozens of decent to good restaurants and bars
c2500386,s4,"it is just way too large to enjoy; walking from end to the other takes an hour, and signs are either non-existent or confusing"
c2500387,s1,"We (family of 4 plus a toddler) stayed here for 2 nights in Nov 12 and loved our rooms very much! The bathroom is spacious, the room suite had a living area with separate TV, sofa and work desk"
c2500387,s2,The only complaint we had was the detour we had to take everyday when we need to walk to the shuttle bus/taxi area
c2500387,s3,The shortest route was via the casino but they disallow my toddler entry
c2500387,s4,"Hence we had to walk a longer way that takes about 15mins-20mins, which is very tiring, especially at the end of the day"
c2500387,s5,"We hope the next time we return to The Venetian, there is a direct access way to the taxi/bus area for families with kids"
c2500388,s1,"i visited this place with family , My experience says never stay in such big hotel that reaching to room you have walk a lot , Good couples , Have nice bathroom and good interior"
c2500388,s2,But so many people in hotel too crowded at food court
c2500388,s3,all things you see are artificial
c2500388,s4,for every activity need to pay
c2500388,s5,If you go in group then you might feel better
c2500389,s1,"Getting There  When we arrived at the Macau ferry terminal, the Venetian staff told us to cross over to the other side of the road to take the Venetian shuttle bus"
c2500389,s2,No assistance was provided to help us with our luggage
c2500389,s3,"We had to take the lift to get to the underpass, cross the underpass and the take the lift up to street level again"
c2500389,s4,The Venetian shuttle bus was parked right at the end of the other hotels' shuttle buses
c2500389,s5,My friend and I each had a luggage
c2500389,s6,Mine was a big one
c2500389,s7,"When we reached the Venetian shuttle bus, the staff at the counter did not offer to help us with the luggage until I asked him to"
c2500389,s8,He gave us an unfriendly look
c2500389,s9,Check-In  We arrived at Venetian’s West Lobby
c2500389,s10,"The staff told us to go to another check-in lobby as the west lobby is expecting a big ""Indian""…"
c2500390,s1,We stayed a day by hotel promotion
c2500390,s2,I have a lot of expectations in the first
c2500390,s3,"But we requested a non-smoking room when booking, but the cigarette smell in the room, then moved to the room"
c2500390,s4,But it was same
c2500390,s5,"Noticed the floor is non-smoking, but a lot of the smell of cigarettes"
c2500390,s6,The pool facilities were good
c2500390,s7,We played in the pool all afternoon
c2500390,s8,Gondola price was too expensive
c2500390,s9,The mini golf course was a lot of fun too
c2500390,s10,Go to one place only once
c2500390,s11,Venetian Macao hotel is well worth a visit
c2500390,s12,but only once!
c2500391,s1,The stay at the Venetian Macao was not what I expected
c2500391,s2,"The hotel is so huge, it is a small city in itself"
c2500391,s3,There is a huge casino downstairs and it is very much Las Vegas style
c2500391,s4,I liked the Grande Canale Shopping center on the third floor with gondolas and lots of little boutiques to wander around
c2500391,s5,The suites are very nice and huge
c2500391,s6,"Just those little things are missing that makes it a real hight end hotel except for the price like laundry bags in the room, shoe shine and some other small stuff"
c2500391,s7,Also that for such a big hotel you have to pay for the sauna/steam facilities as they are run by the attached clinic
c2500391,s8,The gym is actually in a suite room and therefore quite small
c2500391,s9,I also had some problems with the cardio machines as the bikes did not hold the resistance etc
c2500391,s10,Another…
c2500392,s1,It is humungous with 3000 rooms and great if you are a casino fan
c2500392,s2,Personally i did not like it much as it was fairly impersonal and lacked character
c2500392,s3,"But lets face it, if you are looking to gamble and stay at a property that is increasingly becoming iconic and representative of Macao, you must stay a night at the Venetian"
c2500392,s4,Be careful of the ferry timings for HKIA as they are not as frequent as mainland ferries and i almost missed my flight
c2500393,s1,There was a big line at Check-In and Check-Out
c2500393,s2,The check-in was not comfortable
c2500393,s3,The rooms are very spacious
c2500393,s4,The Zaia Show is also good
c2500393,s5,The shopping experience and a lot other activities to do make it a must visit
c2500393,s6,The Casino is Huge
c2500393,s7,The Breakfast Buffet is not too wonderful as it also had a line
c2500393,s8,The Hotel can definitely do something about the Rush
c2500394,s1,"Me and my GF recently stayed at the Venetian Macao for two days during a trip to HK, Macao and China"
c2500394,s2,"We took the ferry to the Macao Port and then got on one of the free shuttle buses that the hotel lay on - they do not appear to run on a time schedule, rather as soon as one is full this departs and then another one in the pool area they have at the ferry port comes to the boarding bay which works well - the buses are full size and luggage can be stored at the bottom of the bus"
c2500394,s3,The bus then took the 20 min trip to the hotel
c2500394,s4,"On arrival which was 14:00 on a Monday afternoon we found the situation chaotic, there were people everywhere! I understand this is an extremely popular resort, but you could not move, especially with baggage! Anyhow after 10 minutes of stress we found…"
c2500395,s1,I reserved this hotel via agoda
c2500395,s2,com and fully paid
c2500395,s3,"Though, at the arrival time, front desk insisted that I have to pay 3,000 hong kong dollars for deposit"
c2500395,s4,"This was quite a awkward situation for me since I paid almost 7,000 HKD with agoda"
c2500395,s5,com already
c2500395,s6,"However, the hotel facilities and rooms are impressive and huge"
c2500395,s7,"The location is  near the Macau airport, and love that they have shuttle bus waiting for me there"
c2500396,s1,"So, I got upgraded to Venetian Resort since Holiday Inn was overbooked (as they both belong to the same company)"
c2500396,s2,"Well, in my opinion I kinda feel I was downgraded"
c2500396,s3,Entering the hotel from the west lobby was just surprising
c2500396,s4,I have never seen such many people in hotel lobby in my life
c2500396,s5,"I understand that Venetian is also a tourists attraction, but the management needs to look into it as it was simply stressful"
c2500396,s6,Luckily our check-in process went quite smooth
c2500396,s7,"The front desk staff, Jackson was really nice and did everything in a timely manner"
c2500396,s8,"I asked for room on higher floor, however the only available high floor room at that time was located at the end of the corridor, which I agreed to take"
c2500396,s9,"And believe me, it was a big mistake"
c2500396,s10,I believe I walked more than 1 km to go to my…
c2500397,s1,"Spent four days here, the best part of this hotel is the size of the rooms, I feel this time the hotel is showing signs of not caring so much"
c2500397,s2,"Check in was good, check out terrible"
c2500397,s3,"Beakfast was good but expensive and if you want Wi Fi in your room they charge $20 a day, unrealistic and something they should look at"
c2500397,s4,If you play the poker machines near the South lobby at night the place is full of prostitutes and pimps or you keep getting approached by people who want to put their promotions card in your machine
c2500397,s5,"Next time would stay somewhere else, which is a shame as this was a very nice hotel"
c2500398,s1,Stayed in Venetian with wife and my one year old baby girl for 3 nights from 05 - 08 Aug
c2500398,s2,Not the first time staying in Venetian hence the wow factor was no longer there
c2500398,s3,"As I guest of the hotel, I did not really felt any personal services as the hotel is so big with thousand of rooms and we are just another customer"
c2500398,s4,Nothing was complimentary in the hotel
c2500398,s5,"If you want internet, you pay HKD 160+ a day"
c2500398,s6,"Room look clean when we checked in but once I start crawling with my baby on the carpet, I can feel that the carpet was dusty and can see black and dusty patch on my as well as my baby kneels"
c2500398,s7,Facilities in the room also started to look old
c2500398,s8,LCD TV in front of the bed is only 37 inch and TV in front of the sofa was only 25 or 29 inch and was not even a LCD TV
c2500398,s9,Traveling in and out…
c2500399,s1,I have for the longest time reluctant to stay in this property because of I have heard numerous bad comments about it
c2500399,s2,This time we went with a big group hence no choice of us staying in another hotel
c2500399,s3,"As soon as you entered into the property, you will see long lines of people waiting for different free shuttles to different destination within the city"
c2500399,s4,It is literally like a crowded bus station
c2500399,s5,"As expected, from then on, we encountered endless flow of people wherever we go"
c2500399,s6,"I was pleasantly surprised that our suite is very spacious, nicely decorated in Venetian style, although not my cup of tea"
c2500399,s7,I particularly like the dresser in the large bathroom
c2500399,s8,You got your hairdryer there and even a lighted mirror for putting on your make-up
c2500399,s9,It would be best to have a ventilation…
c2500400,s1,In Sept 2011 I was invited to stay in  this hotel on our trip from Taiwan to Hongkong and Macau
c2500400,s2,"Luxurious , but too crowded"
c2500400,s3,We needed to  wait 30 min to check in
c2500400,s4,Food is average
c2500400,s5,Artifical made world for all who wish to throw money out of then window
c2500401,s1,This resort is pretty spacious
c2500401,s2,The main lobby is gorgeous
c2500401,s3,"You can do shopping from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm, and have meal until 11:30 pm"
c2500401,s4,We booked a Bella suie to stay
c2500401,s5,The space of the room is also commodious and the view is nice
c2500401,s6,I booked a non-smoking room
c2500401,s7,"What a pity, the room is smoky"
c2500401,s8,There are too many people smoke in this hotel
c2500401,s9,It makes me feel uncomfortable
c2500401,s10,And the staff service seems needs to be trained except staffs in the main lobby
c2500401,s11,I won't live in this hotel again if I go to Macau
c2500401,s12,You can have other better choices
c2500402,s1,"Please dont carry big bags to macau, leave big bags at HK hotel or at airport"
c2500402,s2,the cotaijet ferry does not have provison to check in bags
c2500402,s3,Ferry pier staff is very rude compared to other hotel staff present there
c2500402,s4,conceirge was hesitating to take bags to room as was trying to disuade by saying will take 30min to reach room
c2500402,s5,check in took a long time
c2500402,s6,But the room was just amazing with great views
c2500402,s7,the size was also great
c2500402,s8,"The pool was outstanding, they had 4 different big pools"
c2500402,s9,"the casino is fun but lots of machine games are in chinese, which is a problem"
c2500402,s10,the food is very expensive in the hotel & even the hotel mall food court & restaraunts
c2500402,s11,Shoping is also killer expensive
c2500403,s1,Our family stayed in The Venetian early this month (July 2012) as my daughter watched a concert held in the hotel arena
c2500403,s2,"The check-in is pretty chaotic, the place was huge, I mean huge and for its worth, there is nowhere to sit while my husband do the necessities checking us in, can't understand this as the place is spacious and a few sofas around would not clutter the place, I've never seen a hotel lobby with nowhere to sit"
c2500403,s3,"We are a bit strained for waiting about 20mins to be checked-in, and we're in our 40's, what would it be like for senior guests"
c2500403,s4,"Checking was done, we need a map to find the lift lobby, and this is not exhageration as the place is massive"
c2500403,s5,We have to wait one and half hour for our luggage to be sent to our room
c2500403,s6,"The room was impressive, spacious and…"
c2500404,s1,I stayed one night in July 2012
c2500404,s2,It's my first time here
c2500404,s3,The hotel is getting old by ages
c2500404,s4,Room is spacious but bedsheet and blanket had bad smell and the hotel is too crowded
c2500404,s5,"However, their service is excellent with prompt action whenever we requested something"
c2500404,s6,"Moreover, they gave a birthday cake to my firend because we checked in on her birthday"
c2500404,s7,We were appreciated
c2500405,s1,This hotel was ok
c2500405,s2,To be honest I was expecting the same quality as the MGM grand in Vegas and I was disappointed with the Venetian
c2500405,s3,The hotel is so massive it takes you ages to get back to your room and it's so incredibly busy that it makes it hard to move around
c2500405,s4,The free shuttle bus from the Macau ferry terminal dropped us off at the back of the hotel and it took us 30 minutes to find the main lobby reception desk
c2500405,s5,It was very annoying
c2500405,s6,There is no real customer service here and you kind of feel like you are renting a room above a shopping centre
c2500405,s7,The island doesn't really have many attractions other than shopping and gambling so if you are interested in that then you will like it
c2500406,s1,"On our recent business trip to Australia and Hongkong , we had a weekend to spend , so thought of going to Macau"
c2500406,s2,"Our travel agent booked a royal suite at Hotel Venetian as this seems to be the most popular hotel with people from India ! Ferry trip from Hongkong to Macau was average but the facilites are dated and one had to wait for quite a whle at the Macau ferry terminal to get the baggage ! Coach service to the hotel was good but the moment you enter the hotel , the size of the properry and the number of people at any point of time hits you"
c2500406,s3,It was a long walk to the check in counters ( staff was efficient though  ) and another long walk to the room ! Royal sute was very spacious with a huge seperate sitting area and well designed and maintained
c2500406,s4,The hotel is a city by…
c2500407,s1,I stayed at the Venetian as part of a family holiday with my in-laws
c2500407,s2,We booked 5 rooms and requested that they were as close to each other as possible
c2500407,s3,"The staff requested that we wait an hour for them to arrange it, which we were ok with and went off to get lunch"
c2500407,s4,An hour and half later they had nay 4 rooms ready out of which one had the wrong bed
c2500407,s5,When the bellboy came up with our bags he gave us attitude saying he would drop all our luggage to one room instead of to each of the 5 rooms even though we had said that we would accompany him to each room to help allocate the luggage
c2500407,s6,I have never seen such appalling service
c2500407,s7,We had requested for a late checkout which was fine by the hotel but then the bellboy came up at the time of normal checkout and took my parents-in law's…
c2500408,s1,The place was ridiculously huge and over the top
c2500408,s2,"The room was great, as expected"
c2500408,s3,It's just too bad you won't get to spend a lot of time in your room except maybe to sleep
c2500408,s4,The shopping was awesome
c2500408,s5,"It was relatively cheaper than in SG, Malaysia or in the Philippines"
c2500408,s6,But i can't say the same thing for the food
c2500408,s7,It was a lot more expensive than in other asian countries
c2500408,s8,There was definitely a lot of things you can do around the venetian and there's a lot of things to keep you busy - if you know where to go
c2500408,s9,That was our problem
c2500408,s10,We were busy alright
c2500408,s11,we spent almost half of the time navigating ourselves through the place
c2500408,s12,Can you imagine? We spent 3 days and 2 nights at the Venetian and I NEVER GOT TO SEE THE POOL BECAUSE WE COULDNT FIND IT
c2500408,s13,:(   No matter how hard we…
c2500409,s1,Huge and big Rooms
c2500409,s2,"we stayed in Cotai view Bella suite, which is in two level"
c2500409,s3,The towels and toiletries are of inferior quality
c2500409,s4,The towels are worn out and are not of quality to use
c2500409,s5,Same goes for the bath robe
c2500409,s6,they are in pathetic state
c2500409,s7,"Its a colossal and gigantic hotel, with lots of shopping arcades, cafes, restaurants, and the biggest & best casino in macau"
c2500409,s8,"You will definitely get lost atleast more than once during your stay, We got lost twice in 24Hrs"
c2500409,s9,"Its in Taipa Island, you can take a evening stroll in the famous Cotai Strip and enjoy the views( My personal advice is to stay in Macau main Island )If this Hotel is Huge then GALAXY next Door is mountainous, astronomical and giant of a Hotel and deinitely more breathtaking"
c2500409,s10,The work on the Ceilings in Venetian is a…
c2500410,s1,"Still great rooms but they miss maintenance, typical Chinese operation ?  service was good at the desk and the negative part was that several restaurants were closed, even during lunch time"
c2500410,s2,next time other location
c2500411,s1,It was so many people and the hotel was so huge
c2500411,s2,"Everything quite good, but not recommended for those who don't like the environment full with crowd"
c2500411,s3,The quality of staffs are quite good but I think can be better as a 5 stars grand hotel
c2500412,s1,It can best fall under the category 'attractions' and not a hotel
c2500412,s2,"Like any attraction, it takes over two days to explore the place, it is so huge"
c2500412,s3,"Having stayed in Las Vegas; at MGM and Venetian in the past, this stay came with a fore warning that unlike any other hotel where you are treated like God, staying here will be at one's own peril so to say"
c2500412,s4,"If one desires to use each of the facilities offered, even a weeks stay will not be enough"
c2500412,s5,The suites are elegantly designed but upkeep is lacking
c2500412,s6,"The housekeeping is excellent, though"
c2500412,s7,The bed is not comfortable and the Aircon seems to be under capacity as cooling was not good enough
c2500412,s8,Bathroom amenities are basic
c2500412,s9,"Has a fabulous shopping on the 3rd level, with dining options on 1st and 3rd levels"
c2500412,s10,The staff is extremely…
c2500413,s1,Its sooooooo crowded and its like a fish market
c2500413,s2,The hotel is huge and there are attractions inside the hotel
c2500413,s3,The rooms are big
c2500413,s4,"But such a popular hotel, is so crowded"
c2500413,s5,The casino is also crowded
c2500413,s6,Very expensive and branded stores inside
c2500413,s7,Take the gondola ride inside the hotel
c2500414,s1,Stayed for 2 nights earlier this month on my second visit to the Venetian Macau
c2500414,s2,The service seems to have detereoriated since my last visit in 2010
c2500414,s3,The hotel is as magnificient as I recall it to be with lots of eating and shopping choices
c2500414,s4,The suites are huge and one person in our party had a rialto suite which was awesome
c2500414,s5,We tried a few restaurants in the shopping area and also some at the hotel and at the four seasons attached to it and found food and service at the restaurants to be of a high standard
c2500414,s6,2 friends tried the spa and found the therapists to be very good; apparently all of them are qualified physiotherapy diploma holders
c2500414,s7,"However, the hotel service let us down"
c2500414,s8,I found some dirt and dust in some lesser used corners of the suite
c2500414,s9,"Also, I found the drinking…"
c2500415,s1,Stayed 2 nights during last weekend in the Venetian (or the Disney Land for gamblers!)
c2500415,s2,Very mixed feelings
c2500415,s3,Many many good things but
c2500415,s4,"Anyway, in a nutshell:  Good things: - You feel like you are really in Venice"
c2500415,s5,I've been twice to Venice and I must say it's very impressive with an incredible attention to details!!!!   - The Suite (there are no rooms plz!) is really WOW
c2500415,s6,Simply loved it!  - Location in the heart of the new strip of the future Las Vegas!  - Shopping Center: all the brands you could imagine are there! - Smoking (yes I am a smoker!): you can smoke almost anywhere in this huge hotel (3000Suites!) - Funny: I am not a gambler but it was a very funny experience
c2500415,s7,You sit on a table with lots of chinese
c2500415,s8,They are sooooooooooo serious and me I don't care…
c2500416,s1,My wife and I spent one night at the Venetian for our anniversary in April
c2500416,s2,The check-in was smooth
c2500416,s3,"The only complaint was that we were misinformed that pre-booked breakfasts could be consumed inside our room, but in fact, they could only be enjoyed at the restaurant"
c2500416,s4,The hotel management had been informed of our anniversary a few days earlier and gave us a special flower and chocolate treat which was truely lovely
c2500416,s5,The Royal Suite (standard room in the hotel) was spacious and well-decorated as many mentioned
c2500416,s6,We loved it
c2500416,s7,"The view was unobstructed but not impressive -- no ocean, no beach, no trees but some low-lying buildings and structures with one other gigantic hotel across the street"
c2500416,s8,The casino was not too noisy or crowded as I had expected
c2500416,s9,We didn't spend much time…
c2500417,s1,"For a hotel charging guests USD $300++/night, FREE INTERNET ACCESS SHOULD BE A GIVEN, NOT A PRIVILEGE"
c2500417,s2,"Had to do some last minute changes to my flight and was shocked to see that wifi use, even for PAYING GUESTS had a corresponding charge per hour of use"
c2500417,s3,All other hotels in the area provided people even just passing through with free WI-FI
c2500417,s4,"Very, very disappointed"
c2500417,s5,Will explore other hotels when I go back to Macau
c2500418,s1,This hotel had a really amazing bathroom and very spacious rooms
c2500418,s2,However for $265 AUD it was a bit of a ripoff considering the vast amount of choices in Macau available
c2500418,s3,You will get all types of pretentiousness here and people who are just generally rude as they are there for one reason only
c2500418,s4,Not really my idea of comfort or luxury
c2500419,s1,We just got back from our 2 night stay at the Venetian and  it was quite an adventure
c2500419,s2,"First of all, it is soooooo big and easy to get lost"
c2500419,s3,Now I'm not talking about the 1 or 2 minute out of your way lost but the 1/2 hour to 45 minutes lost
c2500419,s4,Much of the staff was unhelpful and often misdirected us which added more to our frustration
c2500419,s5,Signage was helpful up to a point and then would disappear on where to go next
c2500419,s6,On the plus side: rooms was one of the most beautiful we have ever stayed at
c2500419,s7,The Portofino Restaurant was fabulous!  Pools were nice and the property on the whole was meticulously taken care of
c2500419,s8,The casino was great but the minimum bets were too high for our budget
c2500419,s9,To sum it up; the Venetian is a beautiful property but only stay here if you want to be in a…
c2500420,s1,This was the 2nd time I stayed at this hotel
c2500420,s2,It was opened in 2007 or 2008
c2500420,s3,The mattress was considerably deteriorated
c2500420,s4,It was too soft without any back support
c2500420,s5,My back hurt and could not fall asleep
c2500420,s6,The pillow was too flat
c2500420,s7,There are many hotels in Macau
c2500420,s8,I will try another one next time
c2500421,s1,"Myself and my Wife stayed here for 4 nights at the back end of March this year, however as it was won as a competition prize here in the UK, this review is written with that in mind"
c2500421,s2,Had we paid to stay here the review would be very different
c2500421,s3,"Having done our research before travelling, our experience upon arrival at the hotel was not a surprise"
c2500421,s4,"We used the free shuttle bus from the ferry terminal and arrived at the west entrance to find it teeming with tourists and Chinese gamblers, as we expected"
c2500421,s5,The check-in process was efficient and the staff were pleasant enough and most spoke good english
c2500421,s6,Our room on the 14th floor was nice enough if a little gaudy
c2500421,s7,"However, everything was clean, tidy and comfortable and of seemingly good quality"
c2500421,s8,The big selection of tv channels…
c2500422,s1,"My husband and I spent a week in Hong Kong, and decided to take a side trip to Macau, and stay at the Venetian"
c2500422,s2,"What a dissapointment, the hotel claims to be 5 stars, but it's so shabby, yes the rooms are big,but when you look closely around everything is second rate"
c2500422,s3,"Even the shopping centre, has no luxury brand, for those you need to go to the Four Seasons which is attached to the Venetian"
c2500422,s4,"They claim to be smoke free, but everywhere we went, everyone was happily puffing away"
c2500422,s5,Will not stay there again
c2500423,s1,Nice resort but most great reviews come from other than Americans
c2500423,s2,Wade's review form Houston in 2011 sums it up nicely
c2500423,s3,"Too add, blackjack is dealt from 6 deck shoes in most places in Macau"
c2500423,s4,"If you like baccarat, Macau is for you"
c2500423,s5,If not stay in Las Vegas
c2500423,s6,Come for the Portugese food and history
c2500423,s7,"But, spend your nights in Hong Kong"
c2500424,s1,This is a very nice looking hotel in Macao
c2500424,s2,Huge and amazing property with a lot of facilities
c2500424,s3,"However, it really lacks on 'service' aspect which makes it less than a 5 star!  Pros:  - large property - one can easily spend the whole day enjoying various aspects of the hotel - shopping, casino, live shows, mini golf, restaurants etc"
c2500424,s4,A good play area for kids as well
c2500424,s5,"We watched 'Zee Cine Awards' and 'ZAIA', a modern circus - really marvellous"
c2500424,s6,"- spacious rooms - large rooms (split level bed and drawing), large bathroom  Cons:  - poor service - housekeeping will take 30 minutes, sometimes you will have to call twice or thrice, poor check-in reception, staff is very rude at all the locations - check in, conceirge, restaurants, no one will try to resolve the issue or many times…"
c2500425,s1,"Stayed in a 170m2 Rialto Suite for 2 nights, the room was huge and very well furnished, the room was very clean , the the poor standard of the fixtures and fittings was not something I was expecting , the room entrance  door had paint peeling off and looked like something I would expect in a 3 star hotel"
c2500425,s2,"The Casino/Hotel has a good feel about it , many dinner and lunch options , nothing bad I can say really but nothing great either   One thing that needs to change is the attitude of the yellow coated security guys , they don't smile and make you feel like you've stayed in a prison or something, I know they have a job to do but its not hard to return a good morning ( in either mandarin or english)  One"
c2500426,s1,This hotel is the most popular in Macau
c2500426,s2,When you arrive it looks amazing the lobby is magnificent and so are the shops with gondola rides
c2500426,s3,The rooms look pretty stunning also
c2500426,s4,However after staying here for almost one week there are flaws that make some facilities in the hotel rooms outdated
c2500426,s5,"After staying at the four seasons prior which had such modern facilities, i was quite unimpressed with the shower"
c2500426,s6,The shower head is not detachable and is stuck in one position on the wall
c2500426,s7,The water either spurts out so fast onto your head only or trickles out in a sputtery mess
c2500426,s8,The t
c2500426,s9,vs are small compared to newer versions
c2500426,s10,The telephone by the bed was not working and a technician came to fix it but after that it still didn't work
c2500426,s11,Also another word of advice is if you don't want to…
c2500427,s1,"Second time I have stayed in Venetian Macau, the first being couple of years back"
c2500427,s2,"Things were as the first time - nice rooms, ok service and so on"
c2500427,s3,But it lacks the ooommppphhh ie the x factor to make it a fantastic hotel
c2500427,s4,There was no show or performance ongoig for Christmas or New Year unless you want to pay for the shows
c2500427,s5,"Cenetian relies too much on the gondola rides (done them last time), some expensive shops, the MU shop which was a disappointment this time and casino"
c2500427,s6,"They should put on more street shows, make an effort to wow guests over Christmas and New Year and so on"
c2500428,s1,The Venetian is one of the most luxurious hotels in the world
c2500428,s2,No doubt all the amenities here are amazing
c2500428,s3,Me and my family had a great time here
c2500428,s4,The problem is the amout of cigarette smoke here
c2500428,s5,"There are no regulations here for smoking, and people can be seen smoking everywhere, and there seems to be no efforts to curb this"
c2500428,s6,"I guess that they need to cater for the Chinese gambling high rollers, but what about the families with children?"
c2500429,s1,Booked here for two nights stay after The Langham (Hong Kong)
c2500429,s2,"I've heard so much about Venetian Macau, how grand and great it is"
c2500429,s3,BUT
c2500429,s4,"for me, it was ""so so"""
c2500429,s5,"The shuttle bus from Macau ferry to hotel was convenient, but we were greeted by a large crowd at the lobby"
c2500429,s6,They mentioned it's actually full house
c2500429,s7,"Just imagine a hotel with that amount of rooms, fullhouse? really? :) Check in took a while as they were fully booked, but finally she manage to get me two rooms (booked two rooms)   It was a long trek to our appointed room, i was lucky enough for not having a corner room"
c2500429,s8,"The room honestly, it's grand enough to say, only that for those who had experienced a real luxury hotel knows the real thing about luxury hotels"
c2500429,s9,"Perhaps, it's consider for like a casino hotel, so…"
c2500430,s1,"To start the review off, I must say that the actual room itself was quite nice, especially the split level floor and the huge bathroom"
c2500430,s2,"However something just felt lacking about our whole stay, maybe it's the fact we more often stay in smaller family run kind of places and the fact that this is a multi thousand room hotel?  We arrived in Macau at about 2230 after starting the day Chiang Rai, flying to Bangkok, Then to Hong Kong before finally using the Skypier facility at HKIA to make our way to Macau"
c2500430,s3,The Venetian has a desk at the Porto Exterior ferry terminal and we easily found our way to the free shuttle bus
c2500430,s4,We arrived quite tired but found Check In to be quite Hassle Free and Friendly
c2500430,s5,The hotel itself is quite massive but easy to find you're way around after a couple…
c2500431,s1,Pro's We booked a one bedroom suite and the room was huge
c2500431,s2,Check in and check out was very efficient and friendly
c2500431,s3,"Lots to do in the complex, shopping, shows, casino, mini golf ect"
c2500431,s4,Con's Service was very muddled and poor
c2500431,s5,Room service took an eternity to arrive
c2500431,s6,We had on two occasions service people try to enter our room to fix lights that were not broken (surely this could have been sorted prior to our check in?)
c2500431,s7,The AC temp control did not work
c2500431,s8,We had to turn the unit off so we didn't freeze
c2500431,s9,The room was non-smoking but still had an odour of cigarettes
c2500431,s10,They were unable to organize babysitting for us
c2500431,s11,"We had no problem with this in France, London, Bangkok, HK or Koh Samui on our trip but the Venetian refused"
c2500431,s12,This meant that my husband and I had to take turns sight…
c2500432,s1,"The hotel is very similar to that of Las Vegas' Venetian, except the properly is much larger"
c2500432,s2,Service is what you would expect from a very large hotel casino - so 3-stars at best
c2500432,s3,"Dining options were good, albeit quite pricey"
c2500432,s4,"My biggest issue is that the smell of cigarettes is throughout the hotel, including hotel rooms which are supposedly non-smoking rooms"
c2500432,s5,I am allergic to cigarette smoke so I can pick it up quite easily - we switched rooms 2x to get a truly non-smoking room
c2500432,s6,"For my next Macau visit (perhaps once a year), I would likely try one of the newer, smaller hotels such as the Banyon Tree"
c2500433,s1,"My family and I were looking forward to staying at the Venetian, after good reviews from friends and relatives"
c2500433,s2,"The hotel is nicely done, with plenty of shops and food options"
c2500433,s3,"The rooms are big too, and the washroom has a separate small room for the toilet"
c2500433,s4,"However, what really bothered us was the VERY strong smell of cigarettes EVERYWHERE"
c2500433,s5,We had a room in a non-smoking floor and even the hallway stank
c2500433,s6,I guess it's because the casino was packed and people were smoking and the smell sticks to your clothes everywhere you go
c2500433,s7,"We went to the other nearby hotels (Galaxy, City of Dreams) and they didn't stink as much"
c2500434,s1,"It’s basically exact the same as its Las Vegas twin brother from lobby, casino, suite room, stores and restaurant"
c2500434,s2,"Everything is big, good reception staff that speaks English well"
c2500434,s3,A bit pricey now that Macau has mature with busload of mainland Chinese enjoying the place
c2500435,s1,I took two of my best friends to Macau which was their first time visit this city
c2500435,s2,We choose Venetian since they can have lots of option there
c2500435,s3,"No doubt it is huge and combine everythings- shopping, casion, all kind of restaurent and left you endless exploration"
c2500435,s4,But we reached the hotel we were disappointed to find out we need to follow a long line to get checked in
c2500435,s5,"Also, when we got in at 11am, we were informed that we have to wait for hours since they are not open check in until 3pm"
c2500435,s6,"We are so lucky to assigned a very nice receptionish, her name is Lovely, just like her name, she handel our complain professional and all of our frustration was gone with her lovely smile!    But the worst was when all these tourists (be in a group or not who are on for Venetian Excursion)…"
c2500436,s1,There is no doubt this is a place at least worth a visit or seeing
c2500436,s2,"It is pretty amazing in terms of size, shopping around the canals and the scale of the place"
c2500436,s3,However for me the service lets it down
c2500436,s4,It's not intimate nor is the service 5 star
c2500436,s5,The place has a very tour group feel to it and feels alot like a big cattle station
c2500436,s6,Rooms are well equipped but overall most of the fittings etc feel like they have had a fair amount of wear and tear and therefore feels the place hasn't been built to last
c2500436,s7,It feels a bit cheap for a 5 star hotel
c2500436,s8,The shops are quite expensive compared to Hong Kong and therefore window shopping would be the only thing you would do
c2500436,s9,The breakfast at Cafe Deco although buffet does not compare in terms of quality to 5 star hotels
c2500436,s10,It is certainly…
c2500437,s1,The Cotai strip is not quite built yet but no doubt will be great when it gets busier - anyone expecting Las Vegas will be in for a shock
c2500437,s2,"If you are there for the sites, better to stay in the original port area - Wynn/Lisboa area where there is more going on in the evening"
c2500437,s3,"On the plus side the rooms are spotless, huge and comfortable"
c2500437,s4,"You have to put up with some noisy Chinese in the corridors at night, otherwise, shops and canal area great and a mini Vegas experience"
c2500438,s1,I was booked into the hotel for a conference
c2500438,s2,"It's a great hotel, but I hated it"
c2500438,s3,"The good stuff:  Check-in, once I got there, was efficient"
c2500438,s4,"The room, once you get to it, is huge, and well equipped, with a good size work desk, and a large sitting area separate from the bedroom"
c2500438,s5,"The internet works well, and, intelligently, your login includes three devices for the same price"
c2500438,s6,It was included in my room rate; otherwise it'll cost you US$20 per day
c2500438,s7,"The bathroom is well equipped, with a comfortable long bath"
c2500438,s8,"There's a kettle for making tea and coffee, and a fairly well stocked minibar"
c2500438,s9,"Lighting is good and controllable, and the aircon adjustable"
c2500438,s10,"The outdoor pools are quite nice, although have steps at one end so swimming laps is marginally more frustrating than they…"
c2500439,s1,we were so excited to have booked this property
c2500439,s2,its is a huge property with thousands of people at this hotel
c2500439,s3,literally
c2500439,s4,most of all coming here to try their luck at the casinos
c2500439,s5,the interiors were awesome with picaso's painting all over
c2500439,s6,checkin took time becoz of hoards of ppl waiting to check in
c2500439,s7,the suites were big actually good with a bedroom and a drawing room
c2500439,s8,the washroom was big too
c2500439,s9,the service was very average
c2500439,s10,the hotel has so much of staff but yet the service was okay
c2500439,s11,wat we didn't like was the presence of tooooooo many people( most of them had come to play at the casino) n bcoz of its size it was so confusing that even we wud often get confused locating our room
c2500439,s12,thr r plusses n minuses both
c2500439,s13,"minus being ,we cudn't njoy our property bcoz of the time spent at…"
c2500440,s1,Booked a suite with a special lady for quite a decent price and we went for weekend to Macau
c2500440,s2,"We walked into sweet which looked amazing, I've had a bottle of champagne for this special occasion in my suit case and when I opened cupboard I found all glasses to be dirty and full of dust"
c2500440,s3,"Called up room service, they send some inexperienced boy upstairs and it took him about 30 min"
c2500440,s4,He took all the glasses in the cart without apology and then he came back after 15 min with only two water glasses
c2500440,s5,He did not apologize or anything
c2500440,s6,"We complained and in the morning when we were away maids sorted out the problem, however one small ""sorry"" from the management or anyone in the hotel would be highly appreciated and would not cost them loosing a client in the future"
c2500441,s1,This hotel is huge
c2500441,s2,"For a family with kids that could not bypass the casino from the check in counter, it was a good 200metres from lobby to lift lobby"
c2500441,s3,The Venetian theme was just a tad too much for me and the novelty wore thin as soon as we sat down for a meal at the food court
c2500441,s4,"The suite was generously appointed - two queen beds and a sofa bed, separate living and sleeping areas and a good sized toilet"
c2500441,s5,"Other than the faux decor, it was a hotel"
c2500441,s6,That's about it
c2500441,s7,Great if you're gonna hit the slots but no so if you had a young family in tow
c2500441,s8,"Pros  - 10minutes from the airport - Qube (a paying kids club) - Lots of buses to take you to other hotels, the Zhuhai border and downtown Macau  Cons - Sloppy room service - Cafe service staff were rather indifferent - No child friendly…"
c2500442,s1,"Very very glitzy, everything is bathed in an orangey glow"
c2500442,s2,"Suites are comfortable, but some distance from the main lobby"
c2500442,s3,"Staff are friendly, professional, and efficient"
c2500442,s4,A long queue formed outside the buffet breakfast venue after 8
c2500442,s5,"30am, so breakfast earlier if you abhor q-ing"
c2500442,s6,"Breakfast food was so-so, but the same restaurant served up a fabulous dinner, so don't write it off"
c2500442,s7,"Travel to and from the airport or ferry terminal is a breeze, but you need a taxi to get to and from the local sites"
c2500443,s1,"You'll love the gondolas, the painted ceilings, the outstanding food hall with the meriod of choices to be had, and of course the shops, oh the shops"
c2500443,s2,But the room was dated and falls far behind other hotels in Macau
c2500443,s3,"So bear in mind this very detail as it can leave you asking is it worth the price or should I have looked else where? The casino is great and everything else I have mentioned is worth a visit, but not the room"
c2500444,s1,Huge hotel needed a map just to get to my room
c2500444,s2,I liked the room however for a casino property lack of food places open at late hours there was only one which stopped making many of its menu items
c2500444,s3,The pool was good outside three options and a jacuzzi
c2500444,s4,We were overcharged for mini bar items which they refunded immediately this worried me as it may be common practise
c2500444,s5,Lack of shops nearby only over priced shops within the casino
c2500444,s6,Didnt really meet any locals
c2500444,s7,However Bus service to nearby casinos was great been to las vegas and its exactly what is needed as casinos are huge and walking from one to another can be a very long walk
c2500444,s8,Also talked to staff member about local supermarket was told there were none in macau checked phone book and they were some in macau
c2500445,s1,The first room we were given had a bit of defect (i
c2500445,s2,e
c2500445,s3,brackish water was seeping out from the tiles in the bathroom area)
c2500445,s4,They told us that they would provide us some towels to soak it up
c2500445,s5,"SIMPLY NOT ACCEPTABLE! We paid good money to stay here on a Saturday!  Since we had a child with us, it was just possible she might slip in there; we decided not to take the risk"
c2500445,s6,It took them about 45 mins to assign us another room
c2500445,s7,The room and the bathroom was very ample in size
c2500445,s8,"The bed was luxurious! There is a sunken living room area, complete with another TV (though not flat screen), and the coffee/ tea amenities"
c2500445,s9,The writing desk has a printer/ fax/ scanner (but i think you might need to pay to use it)
c2500445,s10,"The view was facing City of Dreams (neon lights at night), and we could see…"
c2500446,s1,This was my 4th stay at the Venetian Macao
c2500446,s2,"Stayed in the twin bed suite, which as always was nice and spacious"
c2500446,s3,Requested a room near the elevators as i remembered from previous stays the walk could be gruesome from some of the further rooms
c2500446,s4,"Was put in the North wing, which meant a 400m power walk to the swimming pool each day, through the long corridor"
c2500446,s5,"Although the hotel was very busy when i stayed, we usually had the pool (adult pool) to ourselves"
c2500446,s6,The jacuzzi is nice for late afternoon soaks
c2500446,s7,The largest pool is heated
c2500446,s8,I did not try the kids pool and the fountain pool
c2500446,s9,Yes there are 5 pools in total (including jacuzzi)
c2500446,s10,"Service was good, although not very personal, though one cannot really expect this from a hotel this size"
c2500446,s11,"Breakfast at Cafe Deco is nothing special,…"
c2500447,s1,Our stay on the one of the rooms changed to poor quality service
c2500447,s2,We were charged a bomb for a european plan and the hotel should atleast consider the they should give rooms with atleast breakfast
c2500447,s3,"next, we stayed in the macau strip facing rooms which was a great view"
c2500447,s4,but the hotel should consider the rates they charge and dont mislead guest
c2500448,s1,Venetian is starting to lose its shine
c2500448,s2,"With the focus on catering to huge crowds, the focus on personal service is gone"
c2500448,s3,"Rooms are large and well appointed, but its starting to have a tired look"
c2500448,s4,"Seems to cater to much older crowds, so if you're looking for a young/hip crowd, look elsewhere"
c2500448,s5,Very limited entertainment options on the premises
c2500448,s6,"Zaia the show is good, but The House of Dancing water is much better"
c2500448,s7,"With new options popping up all the time, consider a back up option"
c2500449,s1,This place looks nice but it is too busy
c2500449,s2,"This is not a five star hotel by western standard, you must make a booking for evening turndown and daily cleaning service"
c2500449,s3,The staff is rude and lacking in English
c2500449,s4,"The rooms are big yet not cleaned very well, they have dust and you can tell the cleaning was rush"
c2500449,s5,The towels and bathrobs had wrinkles and were not fully dry
c2500449,s6,The bath soaps are of very low quality as well
c2500449,s7,The bed is very  firm and not in a good way
c2500449,s8,The pool is lacking and Im not even sure where the spa is
c2500449,s9,"Everyone and their grandma from China is in this hotel and its a zoo, constant battles to get around and the hotel literally is split up so your always walking through the casino straight out of the elevator lift"
c2500449,s10,"Point being, if you are Chinese and want to see…"
c2500450,s1,We went to Macau for 1 night & stayed here because our friends told us it was great
c2500450,s2,Well the hotel is ENORMOUS and like a huge railway station
c2500450,s3,There is no service at the hotel
c2500450,s4,When you arrive there are no porters and no-one to direct you
c2500450,s5,The staff barely speak english and are very unhelpful
c2500450,s6,The rooms are big but a bit old fashioned
c2500450,s7,We found it overpriced and disappointing
c2500451,s1,This all suite resort hotel has everything with all rooms  beautifully appointed with every possible convenience BUT it is so big that it loses its appeal
c2500451,s2,To get to the swimming pool is at least a 10 minute walk down never ending corridors and thats after finding the right lift in the first place!  The rooms are accessed  through the casino - it is quite difficult to find the right lift and very easy to get lost
c2500451,s3,Smoking is still allowed (there is a small token non-smoking area in the casino) so after a night of gambling your clothes and hair reek - one night in there was enough for me
c2500451,s4,"The food hall, restaurants and shopping plaza are difficult to beat"
c2500452,s1,"It's near enough a 10minutes walk from the front reception to the hotel rooms entrance lobby! You have to walk acrossed the main casino floor, gaming tables, slot machines, etc on either side of you, it was fascinating watching people gambling! The bedroom was huge, quiet glam but on a closer inspection, it's quite tired! The bed was comfortable enough with a lovely view acorss the city and looking out onto the other OTT hotels!"
c2500453,s1,Fellow boarders are right about how huge and grand this property is but my point is that don't limit yourself inside Venetian alone
c2500453,s2,My advice to travelers to Macau on a short trip are as follows: 1
c2500453,s3,After check in next morning itself take a half day city tour
c2500453,s4,Booking for that is done in Venetian itself at Cotai travel desk
c2500453,s5,2
c2500453,s6,"See all places like Ma Temple, Macau towers etc"
c2500453,s7,Last stoppage will be near St
c2500453,s8,Paul Cathedral where you get down and leave the guided tour and be on your own
c2500453,s9,3
c2500453,s10,Near cathedral there is a market where you can do shopping
c2500453,s11,Don't let the shopping for HK if u are going there next
c2500453,s12,"Spent some time in the market and you will find good deals for apperals, shoes etc"
c2500453,s13,By thumb rule shopping in HK & Macau are expensive and if you like something reasonable in…
c2500454,s1,This hotel certainly looks impressive
c2500454,s2,It is huge
c2500454,s3,"The rooms are very big, in fact everything is big"
c2500454,s4,But perhaps therein lies the problem
c2500454,s5,"It is impressive in a theme park sort of way, but it lacks soul"
c2500454,s6,"With 3000 suits, the hotel was full when I was there and the manager told me that this year it has an average occupancy rate of 98%"
c2500454,s7,"The hotel is centred around a (needless to say) massive casino, and a parade of the standard shops you find everywhere in Asia, with a canal down the middle, complete with gondola rides (with a singing host)"
c2500454,s8,"I just found the whole place kitch and naff, and with it's size it was totally impersonal"
c2500454,s9,"This is not meant as any criticism of the staff, who were very good and tried their best"
c2500454,s10,"It just lacked any feeling of being a ""home from…"
c2500455,s1,The place is huge
c2500455,s2,I got to walk 300m to get from my room to the swimming pool
c2500455,s3,"However, kids will love it as there was a inflated slide in one of the 3 pool"
c2500455,s4,Not to sure if it is a constant feature as it was there on my first day
c2500455,s5,The casino  is huge and very crowded
c2500455,s6,Great if you are a shareholder but as a guest I prefer better services
c2500455,s7,The serving person for drinks is non-existence
c2500455,s8,"Overall, a good place to stay to have a feel of the chaotic and monsterity growth of Macao and China"
c2500456,s1,We were impressed by the aesthetic look including the room layout but not the service
c2500456,s2,The staffs are not friendly nor helpful
c2500456,s3,"However, comfort of the room has made up the short coming"
c2500456,s4,The room is beautiful and comfortable with 2 queen size bed
c2500456,s5,"Free Bus shuttle service to and from ferry terminal, China checkpoint and etc"
c2500456,s6,Very convenient
c2500456,s7,Hugh shopping area
c2500456,s8,Romantic Gondola ride
c2500456,s9,Various eatery and restaurants
c2500456,s10,"In a nutshell, it is worth staying or a day trip"
c2500457,s1,me and my wife stayed here for 2 nights
c2500457,s2,"we have taken ice world package so our ice world entry, zaia show entry, one way ferry tickets plus breakfast included in our stay"
c2500457,s3,as so many people there it took bout 45 mins to check in and at one time i was lost and exhausted checking in and collecting my coupons and tickets
c2500457,s4,My suite was great and huge
c2500457,s5,bed quality was great
c2500457,s6,in bath room shower cabin and tub was good
c2500457,s7,"worst thing about hotel too many people long ques everywhere, Smoke every where in hotel u get that smoking feeling not good for non smoker, not enough space to sit in lobby area, no personal attention at all breakfast was not that great either"
c2500457,s8,Good thing about hotel  Zaia show what a show it was worth every penny of it
c2500457,s9,Casinos are really alive and kicking
c2500457,s10,but i…
c2500458,s1,I brought my family here in July 2011 on an Ice World Package
c2500458,s2,Free shuttle bus from ferry terminal worked well
c2500458,s3,15 queue to check in
c2500458,s4,Room was large and the place is amazingly fitted out
c2500458,s5,There is plenty to do as a family
c2500458,s6,"The Ice World experience was excellent, however, wear warm clothes"
c2500458,s7,Circ de Soleil show was excellent
c2500458,s8,Plenty of shopping and restuarants to choose from for all budgets
c2500458,s9,swimming pool and children's play room were fantastic
c2500458,s10,They charge $90HK per child for two hours in the play room
c2500458,s11,"The only problem I had was the air quaility throughout the whole premises, especially the casino floor"
c2500458,s12,Even in a no smoking room I could smell the smoke and had difficultly sleeping
c2500458,s13,They also charge for internet usage
c2500459,s1,"Given the rates for Venetian one would expect a rather luxurious and exclusive property, but the experience was very different"
c2500459,s2,Everywhere in the hotel it was crowded like anything
c2500459,s3,The rooms are large but look old and frayed
c2500459,s4,The breakfast experience was very average with a large spread but not great tasting
c2500459,s5,The advantage on this property is that there are a lot of shopping options and the actual Venetian scenery is done well
c2500459,s6,All in all not sure I would go again
c2500460,s1,Made a short trip to Macau and had lunch at the Venetian after a shopping spree
c2500460,s2,This was my 2nd patronage of Glorious BBQ King wnicn sells roasted meat
c2500460,s3,Now they demand that we pay MOP10 for a helping of chilli
c2500460,s4,No doublt this is not a big sum but where on earth except this outlet 104 in the Venetian that dare to blatantly do so
c2500460,s5,Please go elsewhere for your craving of roasted meat
c2500461,s1,Big & wide room wonderful casino
c2500461,s2,But it's all
c2500461,s3,There is no service
c2500461,s4,And so loudly
c2500461,s5,Busy
c2500461,s6,And so many visitor
c2500462,s1,"Mega-mall of a hotel, but it's well run"
c2500462,s2,"24 hour service, plenty of staff and facilities"
c2500462,s3,"However, because of size this makes it rather touristy"
c2500462,s4,"Also, hotel allows smoking inside the premises which can get irritating after a while"
c2500462,s5,Hotel design very similar to Las Vegas one and many options for dining
c2500462,s6,"While one can't complain, one can't feel that it was a very original experience either!"
c2500463,s1,We (couple in middle 30) and a 2 year baby travelled to Macao and for first time we do this (we went often as we live in Hong Kong for 2 years) we decided to also book a hotel
c2500463,s2,As one of the most recommended everywhere we have chosen the Venetian Macao Resort
c2500463,s3,"Well, let me get back to details"
c2500463,s4,"The good: -	Big rooms (huge); -	Separate shower cabin and WC room with door; -	Decent view (better at night when you can notice other resorts light shows; -	2 tv (one for sofa area, one for the bed); -	Good service at Check In desk (we got early check in even if hush hush as the personnel kept telling us 3PM is regular check in time; -	A quick check out, 2 minutes not considering the line which luckily we didn’t find; -	Many food options: a food court, a big multi-national restaurant Café…"
c2500464,s1,We stayed at the resort for the new years with our parents
c2500464,s2,The resort has very opulently designed rooms
c2500464,s3,"Its a good destination for a family holiday for 2 - 3 days as it has multiple avenues for entertainment - some the best shopping and dining options, great theatre, casinos, gondola rides (which we found very novel)  However we were quite disappointed with the casino here"
c2500464,s4,"We have been to various casinos around the world (Vegas, Atlantic City, Genting, London, etc) and found the casino at Venetian to be not up to the mark"
c2500464,s5,The dealers don't understand English very well
c2500464,s6,Finally since the resort is quite huge you find lots of people milling around all the time
c2500464,s7,This can be quite disconcerting
c2500465,s1,We visited Macau for a night  and to have the real experience decided to stay at the Venetian
c2500465,s2,A place heard a lot about but not even near to the expectations a family may have in mind
c2500465,s3,"The rooms though are very spacious, but the staff is totally non-considerate"
c2500465,s4,The elders in the family decided to take a visit to the casino and the children were heading to the play room but the staff at the plat room said that an adult shoulb be with the child over there
c2500465,s5,By listening to this a person would think that what was the people at the play room had to do any whats the use of it
c2500465,s6,Not a place to visit with family
c2500466,s1,Huge huge hotel with lots and lots of people
c2500466,s2,Fantastic spacious rooms with nice decorations
c2500466,s3,2 TVs in the room
c2500466,s4,The Grand Canal Shoppes is so big that makes it like a maze
c2500466,s5,Didn't have a chance to enjoy the fitness center and the pool
c2500466,s6,"The Zaia show was just so so in my opinion ( We have seen Allegria, which was way better"
c2500466,s7,) It was not smoke-free in the Grand Canal Shoppes so you smell smoke odor everywhere in the public zone not only in the casino
c2500466,s8,"For those people like us who don't smoke and hate smoking odor, this you really have to know"
c2500466,s9,"It was the first time we stayed at this world famous hotel, but I'd say I'd like to try some other hotels next time if I do come back to Macau again because there are lots of fantastic hotels out there"
c2500467,s1,I went there during Easter holiday and it was soooo crowded that i hv to wait for an hr for check in
c2500467,s2,People re everywhere and u can hardly find a quiet place to sit and relax  The shopping mall is huge but I wonder if there is non smoking area in the hotel
c2500467,s3,"U can feel that the hotel is fill w cigarette smoke and this is no good for kid  The hotel room is not clean, there are stain on the sofa and on the floor"
c2500467,s4,The only good thing is that the casino is Huge and clean
c2500467,s5,It is not worthy for what I paid for
c2500467,s6,The service only deserve a 3 star at most
c2500468,s1,Good place to stay for a night but very very crowded
c2500468,s2,not what you expect after looking at the hotel website
c2500469,s1,I was quite eager to visit the Venetian as I got a ZAIA package deal
c2500469,s2,"However the trip from Guangzhou to Macau dampens my spirit (My camera was stolen during the bus journey and all my previous photos are gone too, plus I had sit 2 hours in the Chinese police station for 2hrs just to lodge a report)"
c2500469,s3,We only arrive at the hotel around 6
c2500469,s4,30pm and the check in service was efficient and the front desk staff was very polite and helpful
c2500469,s5,When she heard what a day we had she was speechless
c2500469,s6,"We've asked for a non-smoking room, however guests are smoking in the lifts, along the rooms hallway and everywhere in the entire Venetian complex, not to mention the Casino areas of cos"
c2500469,s7,We even found ash in the toilets (You would think they mop the floor!)
c2500469,s8,"There wasn't much time to spare, we…"
c2500470,s1,Spend 2 nights at the hotel which is very crowed due to Easter and China labour day
c2500470,s2,The 1st day was nice as we do not have any request
c2500470,s3,The 2nd day once we asked for clean towels which had took the housekeeping an hour to bring it up
c2500470,s4,My kid fall asleep while waiting for it
c2500470,s5,The next morning the toliet clogged which another hour for them to fix
c2500470,s6,Every other guests in the hotel doesn't line up for anything
c2500470,s7,They just cut in the line where the staff still serves them so it's like a compatition to the desk
c2500470,s8,Even my kids at the Cubes slide were asking others to line up
c2500470,s9,It's meaningless to complain to the staffs as they all share the same mindset
c2500470,s10,I'll go back to Westin if I'm going with my kids
c2500471,s1,I spent a couple of nights in Macau as i was in Hong Kong for business and heard it was worth a look
c2500471,s2,"I was expecting Las Vegas but in China, and although the Venetian Resort here is pretty much the same as the one in Vegas, everything else just isn't"
c2500471,s3,"The Venetian Resort is amazing, the rooms, service, shopping, casino etc is all as you would expect, and the detail in the architecture and sheer size of everything is unbelievable"
c2500471,s4,"However once you've walked around the designer shops a couple of times, eaten in a few of the nice restaurants and exhausted the casino there isn't really much to do"
c2500471,s5,"If there is it's hard to find out about it, i looked everywhere for a sort of tourist map/guide to Macau with info on what there is to do but i dont think there is one"
c2500471,s6,Vegas just has…
c2500472,s1,Places full of rude mainland Chinese people
c2500472,s2,"Check in is fine but check out experience is poor, as if they want you out of the hotel after you have gambled your money"
c2500472,s3,"People smoke everywhere, no non-smoking areas"
c2500472,s4,Minimal facilities for children
c2500472,s5,Not children friendly
c2500472,s6,The only reason is for the Cirque de Soleil Zaia show
c2500472,s7,"If you want to gamble, you can find better casinos elsewhere too"
c2500473,s1,This hotel had come with rave reviews but we left disappointed after booking three suites last week
c2500473,s2,Cleanliness of the room left much to be desired
c2500473,s3,My vanity mirror on checking in was caked underneath with water and someone elses hair
c2500473,s4,Maybe they are too busy for a complete clean
c2500473,s5,Dirty cups were left in the room after 2 days of cleaning
c2500473,s6,Ladies toilets near Coatai travel shop were discusting
c2500473,s7,Dirty used toilet paper was all over the floor in all cubicles
c2500473,s8,Toilets were unflushed
c2500473,s9,I left and went to the toilets in the check in area they were no better
c2500473,s10,Guests were smoking in the hallways on the non smoking floors and non smoking suites stank of stale cigarette smoke
c2500473,s11,Guests were spitting inside the hotel on the carpet I am a regular traveller to China however I was surprised…
c2500474,s1,"We arranged a car transfer from the ferry which took less than ten minutes (there were several transfer busses also waiting), part of our package was an express type check in which made the process very fast, the room was very large (they call them suites) which was good with two children"
c2500474,s2,"It was well appointed (albeit a bit tacky) and clean, except for the windows which were filthy and detracted from the view"
c2500474,s3,The complex is massive and once you have checked in don’t expect any service as you possibly won’t go near the reception or concierge in your wanders around the complex
c2500474,s4,"We had a small issue with our room which took seven phone calls over two days to rectify, when you do finally locate someone that can help you they are wonderful and there is clearly just some breakdown…"
c2500475,s1,Took the airport shuttle and arrived at the Main Lobby
c2500475,s2,Check-in took about 15min and were told to make our way to the Northern Suites
c2500475,s3,can't cut thru the Casino area as were were travelling with kids
c2500475,s4,Bella Suite is exactly the same as Royal Suite except that the latter has a king bed as compared to 2 queen of the Bella Suite's
c2500475,s5,Found the place to be constantly crowded and there were not enough resting areas with benches or sofas which families with young children or elderlies would appreciate
c2500475,s6,Smoking was rampant which makes maneuvering  the common areas rather unpleasant
c2500475,s7,Common to find many sizeable tour groups moving around the hotel vicinity
c2500475,s8,Food Court was only average and most stalls were closed after 10
c2500475,s9,3opm
c2500475,s10,House-keeping deserves a mention for they were efficient…
c2500476,s1,My friends and I stayed at the Venetian recently
c2500476,s2,I got back with mixed feelings about the hotel
c2500476,s3,First to give the positives: The rooms are very large and spacious with a seperate living area
c2500476,s4,The bathrooms are huge and very spacious too
c2500476,s5,"The hotel has an unmatched offering in terms of places to eat, food courts, restaurants, great bars, lounges, different cuisines - it basically caters to EVERYONES tastes and requirement"
c2500476,s6,I have yet to see such a large display any where in the world
c2500476,s7,There is a huge shopping complex and the whole look and feel of the Venetian is very very grand
c2500476,s8,The casino is the largest in Macau and definately the most popular
c2500476,s9,"The hotel has many shows and theatrical plays, concerts etc so can serve everyones entertainment apetite"
c2500476,s10,Now the negatives: Due…
c2500477,s1,Lets start  with the free shuttle bus from the airport
c2500477,s2,"Wonderfull driver, waited for us as he can see us running to his direction, bus is comfortable"
c2500477,s3,"Upon arrival at 10am, was given a tag saying we can't check in yet as rooms are not ready even on a thursday morning"
c2500477,s4,Wow
c2500477,s5,must be very full! Request for early check in as traveling with my pop and mom which is both 75 and 74 years old
c2500477,s6,"Surprise that they say yes, they can assist"
c2500477,s7,Great service
c2500477,s8,"We were given some vouchers and one of it is to Bamboo restaurant for a free buffet meal, given a number and waited more than 20minutes"
c2500477,s9,"(on a weekday and in July? this place must be havoc) Food was good, plenty of chinese and western dishes including Indian selections too"
c2500477,s10,Had a good meal there and so did many other customers…
