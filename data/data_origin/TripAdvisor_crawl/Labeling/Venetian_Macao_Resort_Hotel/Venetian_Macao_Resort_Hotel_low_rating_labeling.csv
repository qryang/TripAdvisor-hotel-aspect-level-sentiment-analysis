c25000000,s1,So far our worst hotel experience
c25000000,s2,"My wife have been to very embarrassing and humiliating discriminatory selection process every time we need to go through the casino, and going through the casino is the best way from the main lobby to our elevators to access our room, so it’s pretty much every day and a few times a day the same thing"
c25000000,s3,"If you are black, south asian and young, avoid this hotel"
c25000000,s4,The hotel itself is up to the Venetian standards
c25000001,s1,They cancelled my reservation because we arrived late
c25000001,s2,We stuck in traffic and had busy travel schedule
c25000001,s3,But why did they cancel my reservation when they had plenty of rooms available? They gave me a room but charged me a higher rate
c25000001,s4,But what was worse was a reeking “100% non-smoking room” with stale smoke! And we had toddler and elder
c25000001,s5,"After some wait, we got another room which they seemed to spray it with febreze"
c25000001,s6,"Next day, the room could still clearly smelled of smoke"
c25000001,s7,Was it from before but covered by febreze or due to the air filtering system? And the bedroom TV wasn’t working
c25000001,s8,Anyway awful 2- night stay!  Later I couldn’t check out on TV and called twice for a bill
c25000001,s9,The staff seemed to try hard to satisfy the guest
c25000001,s10,But the hotel management seemed to focus on pleasing…
c25000002,s1,This is my first night at Venetian
c25000002,s2,The hotel is place and spacious
c25000002,s3,"However, the service of the employees are terrible and money-seeking"
c25000002,s4,"We asked for additional room key temporarily due to the nature of our work on business trip, but they were not understanding and continued to require extra absurd payments"
c25000002,s5,The way they explained was not only rude but clearly money-seeking
c25000002,s6,Would not recommend due to poor service
c25000003,s1,"I like the hotel appearance, it is grand, beautiful and worth to visit"
c25000003,s2,"But with the rude staff, I am wonder how can they get the title of 5 stars ? Spending few thousands here with such services, I rather not staying here"
c25000003,s3,"There are several nice hotels nearby with good altitude, recommend you guys to go there"
c25000004,s1,Very very loud construction noise right on top of our room
c25000004,s2,I have an 11 month old baby who suffered badly because this
c25000004,s3,I begged them to stop the noise for only 2 hours while the baby is asleep and they refused
c25000004,s4,Why do you even accept guests in this room that is like a war zone??? Why do you charge me for this hell hole??? If you have construction planned for so many days you should NOT give the adjacent or nearby rooms to guests! I should NOT be paying for a room that traumatises my 11 month old baby
c25000004,s5,Other problems: staff do not speak English
c25000004,s6,Inconvenient elevators
c25000004,s7,All public hallways smell like cigarette smoke which made me nauseous
c25000004,s8,Terrible mattress for baby crib
c25000004,s9,And so on
c25000004,s10,Please for the sake of your health and sanity AVOID THIS HOTEL
c25000005,s1,We stayed here one night before a conference and it was the most expensive room of the trip; granted it was huge (70 sq m) 'cos there were 3 of us
c25000005,s2,"But, the whole place was completely overwhelming"
c25000005,s3,"Imagine a giant mall, plonked on top of 4 separate casinos, topped off with a conference centre and several 1000 rooms"
c25000005,s4,"Oh, and there is a facsimilie of Venice interwoven with it all, complete with bridges and gondolas"
c25000005,s5,The whole place has massive corridors and 1000s of people (many being locals coming just to see the place as a tourist venue in itself)
c25000005,s6,We hated it (will never visit Vegas either)
c25000005,s7,Restaurants were very pricey (like poor ones charging  a lot) and obviously the designer   shops are too
c25000005,s8,You practically needed a bus to get to your room from reception
c25000005,s9,we…
c25000006,s1,"This is definitely one of the worse experience that I ever had so far in  my life !  The hotel is massive! It have 3700 rooms and because of the big shopping mall under it , it’s alway in a height occupancy !  When we arrived the lobby was like a train station! Almost the 1000 people queueing for check in and check out and only 20 front office staff !!  It took us a very long time for check in !  After they give the key to us they give us a map and asked us take the escalator and go the 3rd floor which one the biggest shopping mall in Macau located their and find North east entrance! The shopping mall is very huge and very busy , we couldn’t find the entrance if we accidentally didn’t met a Filipino staff !  The room is average nothing like a Macau 5 diamond ! The worse part…"
c25000007,s1,"Too many chain smoking mainland  tourists taking over the hotel complex, pick pockets, just too far to walk around to and from the rooms unless walk through the noisy smokey unsafe Casino, so loud noisy 24/7 and personal safety is quite unsettling as full of gamblers lurking near shoppers"
c25000008,s1,"Room was amazing, big, spacious and newly renovated"
c25000008,s2,All was great except one thing
c25000008,s3,"One guy from FRONT OFFICE, Mr"
c25000008,s4,Kenneth he’s attitude towards us is not good
c25000008,s5,"Also check in time should be 3pm, we arrive at the hotel almost 5pm"
c25000008,s6,He ask us to wait for more than 1 hour
c25000009,s1,"First of all, I want to point out that I had previously spent 6 nights at the Venetian resort in Las Vegas and it had been the best hotel I've ever stayed in"
c25000009,s2,"So this time, I couldn't help to hold the same high expectation when I took my family (4 of us) to check in the Venetian (Macau) hotel"
c25000009,s3,"We booked 2 rooms with the ""Cotai view"" on the 26th floor and were staying there for 1 night"
c25000009,s4,"Unfortunately, the Venetian in Macau was nowhere near as good as its sibling's branch in Vegas"
c25000009,s5,Here below were some of the reasons:  1) Cleanliness: Got 2 huge problems in the bathroom:  i) We found faeces/ poo marks on the handlebar of the toilet flush and also on the toilet wall
c25000009,s6,(Please see my pictures)
c25000009,s7,"ii) There were a few small dead fleas on the bathtub and the bathtub was very dirty, it…"
c25000010,s1,まずここに泊まりたいならチエックインにどれだけ並んでもいいし、自分の部屋を探すのも移動するのも全く急いでいない余裕たっぷりの元気な人でないとイライラする事間違いなしです。チエックイン手続きには一組15分以かかりスタッフはたったの２人！どこに移動するにもホテル内をずっと移動で本当に疲れました。　そして何よりもチエックアウトの日に早朝フライトでバスもない時間だったのでタクシー移動だったのですが、タクシーがずらっと並んでいる中スーツケースを持っている私たちにスタッフは一切案内もなく外で立っているだけ　仕方なく先頭のタクシーに空港まで行きたい旨伝えると200ドルと（通常空港までは35ドルくらい）　話にならないと次のタクシーと話すとそれも２００ドルと　こんな白タクまがいのタクシーばかりを常駐させておいてスタッフはもめているのに知らんぷり　多分毎日の事なんでしょうね　気づくと警察官がいました。警察官に注意されて３度目くらいでしぶしぶメーターで行く事を了承　※この間ドライバー　警官ともすべてやりとりは英語です 空港まで５分程度なのですが100ｋｍ超えの超ハイスピードに急カーブも減速なし 空港に着いてもトランクから荷物も降ろさず「F〇〇〇you !」と捨て台詞 女子３人旅でしたが命の危険を感じる大変怖い目にあいましたし、旅行最終日を台無しにされました。もしあなたのフライトがシャトルバスがない時間なら、もし英語で交渉できないなら　空港目の前のホテルかきちんとしたタクシーのあるホテルをおすすめします。私たちは二度と泊まりません。  When we left your hotel the bellboy did not do anything to help with the luggage or even getting a taxi
c25000010,s2,He was  just…
c25000011,s1,"For an amazing hotel overall stay in the wyn, not here! Over crowded, horrible service"
c25000011,s2,Do not care about the customers at all   An amazing hotel but the most horrible customer service
c25000011,s3,"Can’t even check in as a couple if you want, are told to wait for ages with your bags in a massive crowd"
c25000011,s4,Also we left a key in our room and told to wait 30 mins to be let in our room even though we were able to provide all the details we needed
c25000011,s5,3am and having to wait half an hour
c25000011,s6,For a luxury hotel you are ripper off for your money
c25000012,s1,Book The Venetian online
c25000012,s2,Raise some request and ask about where the nearest attraction we can visit
c25000012,s3,"The first reply was negative, ask us to call their office direct, overseas call"
c25000012,s4,that was done by a staff call kevin  which on 8/Jan
c25000012,s5,First impression of this hotel service standard gone
c25000012,s6,"(that how the overall rating was lower)   Then get another reply from Choi Perales , Guest Relation Officer, Concierge, Hotel Operations"
c25000012,s7,"His reply was about 3-4 pages long , with lot of interesting recommendation and good idea inside"
c25000012,s8,Well train staff and make us look forward the stay
c25000012,s9,"I Thank Choi Perales for the sharing!   On the day of check in, was handle by Mr Luie , he explain clearly how the procedure and help us to take away unnecessary cost that may add on"
c25000012,s10,"we are given level 19,…"
c25000013,s1,I have checked in this evening
c25000013,s2,I’m yet to use my bed
c25000013,s3,The pillows are stinking
c25000013,s4,There is a layer of dust on everything in the room
c25000013,s5,I guess sands is finding it difficult to maintain such a huge property
c25000013,s6,Just so disappointed
c25000013,s7,Will post dust laden room pics tomorrow
c25000014,s1,We ordered a bread basket for breakfast in room
c25000014,s2,Staff on the phone said it would take around 15-20 mins
c25000014,s3,Food arrived after 45 mins
c25000014,s4,"As we chose to pay on the spot, we did not check every thing served on the table, partly also because we did not expect anything so disappointing would happen in this 5-star hotel"
c25000014,s5,"To my horror, I then found that one of the jam they served was already opened and consumed by half"
c25000014,s6,My husband in bed could not believe what I said I had to repeat 3 times to him
c25000014,s7,We always like ordering breakfast in room in 5-star hotels and this is the first time something so disgusting happened
c25000014,s8,Another reason we chose to pay on the spot is that we don’t need to line up again for check out
c25000014,s9,The checking in alone took us more than 30 mins lining up
c25000014,s10,The taxi line…
c25000015,s1,"having booked 4 rooms ,i checked in this property on first day of new year with my family"
c25000015,s2,the check in area had longest queues and there was absolute NO sitting available anywhere near site for hundreds of guest waiting to be checked in! it felt like waiting for a train on a busy railway platform
c25000015,s3,"but all was quickly forgotten once we were alloted the most beautiful rooms with the best view of cotai strip!  the rooms service for food and other supplies was too slow that most of the times we forgot what we had requested for in the first place( 45 mins-1 hr , even for smallest thing like a empty cup or bath towel)"
c25000015,s4,"But the worst experience was at casino , where a very rude hotel staff mr"
c25000015,s5,trump ( hope i read the name correctly on the badge)stopped our group at the entry gate to…
c25000016,s1,It is very confusing hotel and very crowded and you have to go a complete round to go to a place if you have a kids as in between Casino is present so nice place to visit but not for stay
c25000016,s2,Even they do t give any discount if we stay there like the other hotel like City of Dreams they give u a card for free even though u dont stay in there hotel with 10 percent discount on many of restaurant and show present in there hotel and around
c25000017,s1,We were 2 families
c25000017,s2,4 adults 4 kids
c25000017,s3,Never visit during indian vacation time
c25000017,s4,in lobby u feel like u r at railway station in India
c25000017,s5,there was 2 hrs waiting for check in
c25000017,s6,all restaurants also have 1 hr waiting atleast during rush hrs
c25000017,s7,nd there are really some very good options in macau
c25000018,s1,Fairly Hyped and an extremely crowded venue
c25000018,s2,Place is not well maintained and not at all pleasant
c25000018,s3,Minimal spoken English so brush up on your mandarin
c25000018,s4,Head out of the venue to the traditional shops for a more realistic experience of Macau
c25000019,s1,"The hotel room type was incorrectly reserved, but the Venetian did not modify it"
c25000019,s2,They didn't even adjust the number of people or change the guest name
c25000019,s3,Even though there was an error in my reservation which was not my mistake
c25000019,s4,The following is what has happened in the last five days
c25000019,s5,I'm planning a family trip to celebrate my father's 60th birthday
c25000019,s6,(This is a very important day in our country because it is a blessing for longevity
c25000019,s7,That's why I'm even more upset about the problem
c25000019,s8,")     I booked a hotel through 3rd party channel, but when I saw the voucher after the payment, the reservation details in the voucher were different from the information they posted on the website"
c25000019,s9,I asked the agency about the matter and they asked me for time to check it
c25000019,s10,Because the answer…
c25000020,s1,This is a horrible hotel
c25000020,s2,Stay anywhere else
c25000020,s3,You will even have to pay for water
c25000020,s4,The hotel is too big and they cannot bring service levels up to a decent acceptable level even after ten years
c25000020,s5,It took me a super long time to check in while my elderly father stood in the lobby
c25000020,s6,No courtesy chairs for your family while they wait while you take a super long time to check in
c25000020,s7,"And they routinely allow other newcomers to cut the line because they paid to check,in more quickly"
c25000020,s8,I was already paying almost $1000usd  a night for my room
c25000020,s9,and I need to pay to check in quickly? We were given three miserable bottles of water after which we were asked to pay
c25000020,s10,We were staying at Wynn on the Taipa side the night before
c25000020,s11,Much better service and as much water as you like
c25000020,s12,Finally the operator…
c25000021,s1,This is an expensive hotel but remember it's a casino
c25000021,s2,That means prostitutes
c25000021,s3,It's not a place to bring kids
c25000021,s4,"We had a room full of prostitutes next door to our room, customers going in and out"
c25000021,s5,We did not expect this
c25000021,s6,They position themselves as a family destination in the summer- NOT
c25000022,s1,Firstly I hate to leave negative reviews and very rarely do but it is always this hotel and their stuck up guards which force me to
c25000022,s2,I love Macau but I try to now avoid this hotel when I can
c25000022,s3,Every hotel I never have a problem but there's always one guard who wants to make life difficult
c25000022,s4,Apparently they cannot accept a UK drivers license for a 28 year old yet 2 members of staff in the same place previously did and many more didn't even ask
c25000022,s5,"When asked to ask their manager to check they refused to, they then told me they know I'm old enough but need a passport to get in"
c25000022,s6,If they know I'm old enough then why are they asking for ID? I walked straight to the next entrance and went straight in and was only cutting through the casino anyway
c25000022,s7,There's always one guard here who makes it…
c25000023,s1,not enjoyed
c25000023,s2,Very long queue at check in
c25000023,s3,"Slow work at the reption, no one able to guide correctly"
c25000023,s4,Everyone in their own world and does not care about others
c25000023,s5,Will not recommend anyone for this hotel
c25000023,s6,Very bad
c25000024,s1,"Hotel Venetian is beautiful, they have lovely restaurants, amazing interiors, comfortable rooms but the only horrible thing about venetian is their staff"
c25000024,s2,they are a nightmare to deal with
c25000024,s3,firstly when you reach macau ferry terminal and have to catch a bus to venetian no trolleys are allowed for some lame reason
c25000024,s4,due to which my family including 4 senior citizens were struggling to take our bags
c25000024,s5,we were 6 people and only me and my husband could lift bags rest everyone could not
c25000024,s6,now there were 10 bags and just two of us
c25000024,s7,in order to help us my dad tried to hold 1 heavy bag due to which he slipped and fell on the escalator
c25000024,s8,he rolled down luckily we held him before anything major happened but that was the most frightening moment of my life
c25000024,s9,his head was bleeding due to…
c25000025,s1,First visited this hotel in 2008 when we stayed for only 1 night but had a pretty good recollection of the visit then
c25000025,s2,"Thus was excited to visit the hotel again, booking a family suite for my young family for 2 nights this time"
c25000025,s3,Unfortunately the experience we had were much less impressive this time round
c25000025,s4,First impression was that the hotel has gotten really old
c25000025,s5,It seems they have done little or no improvements or proper maintenance for the last 10 years
c25000025,s6,"Compared to their sister hotel at The Parisan, The Venetian looks and feel ancient"
c25000025,s7,"Next thing to hit you is how crowded and chaotic it is, with most of the guests coming from India and China"
c25000025,s8,The main hall has a distinct budget feel as a result with all the shouting and pushing going around
c25000025,s9,The restaurants and food courts…
c25000026,s1,This hotel feels worn
c25000026,s2,"The carpets are worn, the fixtures are worn, the rooms smell old and worn"
c25000026,s3,Not sure when they plan on renovating this entire hotel but they should really start doing it by phases
c25000026,s4,starting yesterday
c25000026,s5,lots of low end tourists staying here
c25000026,s6,"I guess if you get a good deal it's ok, but I wouldnt stay here by choice"
c25000027,s1,there are too many clients and bookings  there's no distinction between group bookings and individual bookings overbooking leading to chaos and definitely not capable of handling such large volume of business
c25000028,s1,not my cup of tea
c25000028,s2,"if you like crowded places, to walk long distance to eat or shop or find a toilet , or you like to wait for lifts to take you  this is the place for you"
c25000028,s3,food is of big viaraity but bad taste
c25000028,s4,staff are very friendly and helpful
c25000029,s1,"I am a Japanese, I don't recommend any Japanese visitors from Japan, but, there is an exception if you are casino players"
c25000029,s2,"Most of Concirge does NOT speak English well, one of them gave me the wrong information on the famous restaurant"
c25000030,s1,"The hotel is nice, and the rooms are big and beautiful"
c25000030,s2,But the restaurants and the service in general is terrible
c25000030,s3,"No good restaurants, the room service takes one hour for a standard breakfast, and people have many difficulties to speak English and to communicate in case of problems"
c25000030,s4,Next time in Macao I will go to another hotel
c25000030,s5,This hotel is for families and not for business
c25000031,s1,Booked Premier Bella Suite for a 3 nights stay with family
c25000031,s2,Sent email to request for transportation arrangement from Macau airport to the hotel
c25000031,s3,First the limousine officer replied and said that they couldn't find the booking number
c25000031,s4,Replied by attaching the booking confirmation email screenshot
c25000031,s5,Then received another mail asking me to fill in the booking form and credit card authorization form where I've specifically asked them to charge to the room
c25000031,s6,"Too much hassle, too troublesome"
c25000031,s7,The worst transportation arrangement experience I had
c25000032,s1,"First, the hotel looks amazing with the canal and the great casino"
c25000032,s2,"As for the casino, if you want to have a drink it's impossible to find the staff"
c25000032,s3,"If you want service, the reception never answers, so you need to walk all the way down to the lobby which very very far because the hotel is big"
c25000032,s4,Almost nobody speaks english and aren't nice of helpful
c25000032,s5,"After gambling in MGM, i realized that the venetian is not that good"
c25000032,s6,The room itself was amazing
c25000033,s1,The buses to the ferry are not clearly marked
c25000033,s2,Caused me to miss my Ferry
c25000033,s3,There are actually 2 different ferry terminals and was not explained properly by the staff
c25000033,s4,"When I went back to see if I can get my prepaid ferry ticket redeemed for another time slot, they were very unhelpful and refused"
c25000033,s5,Customer service is very bad
c25000033,s6,Different lobbies and concierge gives you different answers
c25000034,s1,The toilet is not working during my stay
c25000034,s2,The water go through very slow in the shower area
c25000034,s3,"Every time I call the services, it take couple minutes for me to be connected"
c25000034,s4,"Comparing to the price and the experience I received, the value is not very good"
c25000035,s1,"I booked a Royal Suite for a night and, while the room was quite nice, it was s little too cold in the room for my girlfriend even after I turned the A/C off"
c25000035,s2,"The room amenities are all great, however the tv does not notify you that movies are pay-per-view nor did I notice any information about the price before we turned one on"
c25000035,s3,"Maybe I didn't notice it on the screen, but you would think they would make it obvious since it is an additional charge"
c25000035,s4,"However, this was not what made the stay a disaster"
c25000035,s5,One of the ATM machines on the casino floor just inside the casino entrance closest to the elevators to the North Suites owned by BNU stole my bank card and I was unable to retrieve it
c25000035,s6,The machine operating system re-started while I was in the middle of a transaction and I was…
c25000036,s1,"So yeah this hotel’s rooms are just amazing! I love it, but that is all"
c25000036,s2,Then what about this Hotel? I am not Chinese so cannot understand any Chinese but can speak English
c25000036,s3,"However stuff’ English levels are too poor here, and they are not educated"
c25000036,s4,I have never had this experience like here before
c25000036,s5,"At a breakfast restaurant here, they did not let me eat even though i already paid for the breakfast"
c25000036,s6,They just said “ you don’t charge money for today
c25000036,s7,” And they took my wealthy time for long
c25000036,s8,"after that, i went to Front desk, and stuff who were also not really smart took my time again and gave me back the money in the end"
c25000036,s9,I dont think that is nice for customers
c25000036,s10,"How dare are they to customers?  At 3rd floor, one poor woman at L'Occitane ripped off from me"
c25000036,s11,She took fee from…
c25000037,s1,Booked the cotai ferry package tog which includes a night stay and 2 pax return ferry tickets (good for value)
c25000037,s2,As i took the 3
c25000037,s3,"30pm ferry to macau, there wasn’t any queue when i arrived at the hotel for check in"
c25000037,s4,The guy (whom i guess was a new staff) and his mentor was assisting me were both very nice
c25000037,s5,Could see that the guy was trying his best to help us however it would be good if he mentioned the check out time and go through the registration card before asking me to sign on the paper
c25000037,s6,"Getting to the room: 6/10 My room was allocated at the north wing (25-119) and luckily for us, we are able to cut through the casino (above 21) if not we will have to detour a big round"
c25000037,s7,the way the hotel was designed was not great at all
c25000037,s8,Room outlook: 8/10 Booked the normal king…
c25000038,s1,"My purpose of visit is to celebrate my girl friend's Birthday, who I have dated for 6 years"
c25000038,s2,"After reading some review from tripadvisor, I chosen The Venetian Macao Resort Hotel as the place we spend our special day"
c25000038,s3,"From previous reviews from tripadvisor, I notice that hotel will send a Birthday Cake and Card as a gift"
c25000038,s4,"After I made my reservation, I was told that hotel do not have any free special arrangement service"
c25000038,s5,OK! Fine
c25000038,s6,"I ordered 1 pound Cheese Cake and a Birthday Card from the hotel, although it is a little overprice, but for my girlfriend I am willing to spend more for our precious memory"
c25000038,s7,"I believe that service from a grand 5 stars hotel, that is something that we can count on"
c25000038,s8,"However, after I arrived I regret to choose this hotel to spend my special day on"
c25000038,s9,…
c25000039,s1,This report is so bad constructed that the whao factor never comes to life
c25000039,s2,Everywhere the is a lack for details
c25000039,s3,Very disappointing
c25000039,s4,But guess for Chinese guest who is there for a cheap photo opportunity and access to the gambling tables it does not matter
c25000040,s1,Presently In venetian macau
c25000040,s2,but dissapointing  as compared to 3 years back
c25000040,s3,not giving even required amount of complimentary drinking water for 4 persons 2 adults 1 child 1 infant
c25000040,s4,empty plates ordered from in house dining room took more than a hour
c25000040,s5,bad bad
c25000040,s6,at the time of check in the staff making a que was very rude
c25000040,s7,very bad experience
c25000040,s8,Hope they do something
c25000040,s9,time of travel 27 to 30th Dec 2017
c25000041,s1,"If you are not there to gamble, and your main motive is to shop, good for you cos the shopping mall has loads of branded goods but all a tad more expensive imo"
c25000041,s2,"Of course, if you are there to gamble, there's a whole lot of difference as there are tons of casinos and types of games to choose from"
c25000041,s3,The only place i love about Venetian is the food court
c25000041,s4,Loads of choices and their food's pretty decent
c25000042,s1,don't get suckered by the room size/suite layout
c25000042,s2,the venetian is a tired old hotel and the rooms in need of refurbishment/a thorough scrub and chemical wash
c25000042,s3,the room smells of stale cigarette smoke and the baked-in sweat of the thousand sweaty old uncle gamblers who have stayed there before you
c25000042,s4,"the parisian rooms are newer, in better condition, and smell nice"
c25000042,s5,"sure they are smaller, but do you really need two TVs in the room?  the room service food was also not great and BTW we called 2x for someone to come clear the dishes - gave up after nearly an hour and just went to sleep with the leftover food and dishes in the room"
c25000042,s6,"i suppose that's one advantage of a big room, you can banish the dirty dishes to the far end of the room and not smell them"
c25000043,s1,A true representation of the worst of Macau
c25000043,s2,"Cheap on the exterior, so worn and tacky with bland colours that do little justice to the architecture of Venice"
c25000043,s3,The tacky imitations that you literally can't escape from is a horrendous reminder of how disillusioned the tourism industry in Macau is
c25000043,s4,"Ugly replicas of paintings on the ceilings and walls an insult to renaissance art, a mockery of artwork"
c25000043,s5,"Everything in the building oozes cheap, commercial mass tourism with drone-like service from the front desk, ignorant tourists photographing every corner and the laughable ""canals"""
c25000043,s6,"The signage in the complex is a joke, with the information kiosks outdated and glitchy"
c25000043,s7,"What an embarrassment to European culture, I would be so offended if I was Italian"
c25000043,s8,A terrible offering of…
c25000044,s1,"Around about 2 hours for checkin no arrangements customer sitting, customer waiting on floors with luggage"
c25000044,s2,Appx
c25000044,s3,300 usd for room & not as per booking details
c25000044,s4,No welcome drink
c25000044,s5,Don’t book
c25000044,s6,Less staff at Reception to welcome guest
c25000045,s1,From first impression was terrible
c25000045,s2,When i arrived door wth 4 bags
c25000045,s3,No one help me
c25000045,s4,"Even i asked woman who was infront of door ,she told me took myself  bags to front desk"
c25000045,s5,The way to front desk was so crowded like a market
c25000045,s6,And i was waiting  almost one hour for check in
c25000045,s7,And i asked  delivery service to  my bags
c25000045,s8,It took 30 minutes
c25000045,s9,So i took my self
c25000045,s10,And i asked them bath tub room
c25000045,s11,cause i was  so exhausted
c25000045,s12,But It took 90 minutes more!!!!! (Even it was over 4pm)  All staff are unkind
c25000045,s13,Ill never visit here again
c25000046,s1,Everything about the hotel is unorganized
c25000046,s2,It really surprises me that this hotel has such high ratings
c25000046,s3,Check in is a mess
c25000046,s4,It takes an hour to check in and the receptionist could not speak english properly
c25000046,s5,Slow room service
c25000046,s6,No veg options
c25000046,s7,And highly highly expensive
c25000046,s8,We paid 20 k a room per night
c25000046,s9,This hotel is crowded worse than cst station mumbai
c25000046,s10,The only plus point is the room size
c25000046,s11,Which is actually pretty huge
c25000047,s1,We arrived at 4pm and check in was 3
c25000047,s2,After over an hour lined up we finally got up to the counter
c25000047,s3,By now our two small children were very upset
c25000047,s4,Then to top it all off our rooms were not ready til 7pm
c25000047,s5,They gave us another room to sit in til then but was very annoying
c25000047,s6,The manager Sam was so good helping us with the complications and a credit for a lovely dinner and limo back to the ferry terminal
c25000047,s7,He was amazing and for this reason alone is why my rating is not lower
c25000047,s8,Now the casino is huge but we could not get a drink
c25000047,s9,Everyone we spoke to hardly understood English and apparently we had to go out of casino to a bar then bring drinks in again
c25000047,s10,So pathetic
c25000047,s11,Same with the Parisian
c25000047,s12,The Plaza Casino had a bar and an amazing barman
c25000047,s13,The games weren't very good but
c25000047,s14,Las Vegas is a…
c25000048,s1,"Badly run and layout hotel that is not suitable for guests to stay! Stayed in a room with constantly construction noise 10am-6pm, no lights in the bedroom, hot water for shower didn't work! It also takes nearly 20 mins to go from the room to lobby! I will not come back to this hotel or recommend to any of my friends!"
c25000049,s1,"Everything that can be wrong in a hotel exists at the Venetian, Macao"
c25000049,s2,"It is void of any personality, charm or warmth"
c25000049,s3,It is a factory for Chinese gamblers who are too drunk to notice the setting of their rooms when they leave the casino
c25000049,s4,"It is expensive, the interior designer has the worse taste in the world if your view of luxury is not golden faucets"
c25000050,s1,Since 12h30 that delay the checkin
c25000050,s2,At 2h they announce a computer system issue
c25000050,s3,and that they should be able to check in at 3h
c25000050,s4,"And then it s 3 or 4 hours of queue !! NEVER seen that in any hotel in the world !!! I m pretty sure that you can find better in Macau SAR !! Last advice, never pay in advance for this hotel !! (Don't do like me !!) The picture is here to certify the reality of this situation the 31th July 2017, you can recognize the main hotel reception on it"
c25000051,s1,"After visiting lots of 5 star hotels internationally for various purposes, this hotel degrades 5 star"
c25000051,s2,I am standing in a check in queue for the last 1 hour 15 mins and only quarter way in the line ahead to the counter
c25000051,s3,We arrived here at noon and told that hotel will check us in at 12
c25000051,s4,30
c25000051,s5,We waited in line ( first to line up) from noon till 12
c25000051,s6,50 and then got told that the system wasn't working to check us in till 2pm or later
c25000051,s7,We arrived at the 3pm and still waiting
c25000051,s8,The management of this hotel need to take responsibility of such situation and assist
c25000051,s9,Nobody seems to care and families are totally exhausted with kids
c25000051,s10,We are only here for 24 hours and the people behind me for 10 hours
c25000051,s11,We will spend at 20% of our time here checking in and out
c25000051,s12,The hotel is poorly managed and…
c25000052,s1,Stay at the The Venetian if you're a Mainland tourist who is part of a tour group
c25000052,s2,Otherwise - don't bother
c25000052,s3,"This is supposedly a five star hotel, but it's shabby and is being destroyed on a daily basis by the hordes of tour groups passing through"
c25000052,s4,"Despite billing itself as 5-star the following are all true here:  - Tattered rooms that reek of cigarette smoke and have broken TV sets - Prostitutes roaming the corridors waiting to scream ""MASSAGE?"" and try to get into your room - Neighbours guaranteed to be screaming all night - NO complimentary bus service to town (you have to find your own way to the public bus) - NO complimentary business centre - it's a whopping 60 MOP per half-hour even for guests - Empty soulless corridors leading to nowhere - Unfriendly and lengthy…"
c25000053,s1,I arrived early 12pm
c25000053,s2,Concierge approached me saying that reception doesn't take any early check ins
c25000053,s3,Told us with no empathy to return after 1pm
c25000053,s4,"At that time, the check- in queue was 50 people long"
c25000053,s5,Felt like an airport queue
c25000053,s6,"Looks like long waits are the norm, as they have barriers to control the queue line"
c25000053,s7,Once you get to the reception the check in process takes way longer than I've ever experienced
c25000053,s8,There were plenty of FO staff -8 in fact
c25000053,s9,Don't understand the lengthy process
c25000053,s10,"I booked the room under hubby's name for tax purposes, but used my credit card to pay it on 'booking"
c25000053,s11,com'
c25000053,s12,"The receptionist refused my check in, since hubby was still at his conference until 9pm"
c25000053,s13,"They told me, that my two little girls and  I needed to wait 8 hours for dad to come do the…"
c25000054,s1,"As much as the staff is friendly and trying there best, again we were disappointed by our stay"
c25000054,s2,"Check in always takes ages, why does this take so long? The poor receptionist, no idea what she had to 'register' but its like booking a room instead of just checking in"
c25000054,s3,"The room was as always, super pretty but the smell"
c25000054,s4,terrible smoke smell
c25000054,s5,really awful
c25000054,s6,We woke up in the morning feeling disgusted by the smell of sigarets we have been inhaling the whole night
c25000054,s7,"Small thing, there weren't even bottles of water in the room, so weird no? We checked with our friends and they didn't have any neither"
c25000054,s8,"For the rest, bravo for the team, very friendly and trying their best!"
c25000055,s1,The Venetian hotel located at the great location
c25000055,s2,Close to airport and City Centre
c25000055,s3,I was staying the Venetian from May 1st until 4th of May
c25000055,s4,When I checked in the receptionist did not explained any kind of facilities so there's no 'Welcome'
c25000055,s5,And I ordered some of dishes to my room however the room service staff didn't speak English therefore they brought wrong a dish
c25000055,s6,"I usually request special food regards my health situation but, one of the customer service told me they couldn't handle my request even I was explained the others hotel did it"
c25000055,s7,Second day I was woke up early because of the under the construction in the hotel
c25000055,s8,There was crazy annoying  sounds from upstairs
c25000055,s9,After that Duty manager Sam transfer and upgrade our room but their was nose also at the room number 21047…
c25000056,s1,"You can get in the hotel, but you can not get out, if you want to go somewhere else, all service personnel pretend they don't know what you are saying, even taxi will not take you from Venetian to another hotel"
c25000056,s2,"Smelly room, bad service, shady operation"
c25000056,s3,Will not ever set foot in that place again
c25000057,s1,Spent 2 nights in a mid-range room
c25000057,s2,The room was excellent
c25000057,s3,"large, very comfortable bed, extremely well appointed and clean"
c25000057,s4,Wifi was good
c25000057,s5,"Breakfast was also good, but is very very busy"
c25000057,s6,It's an efficient hotel but everything about this hotel is busy
c25000057,s7,Far too many people spoil an exclusive experience
c25000057,s8,"Queues, delays and waiting are normal"
c25000057,s9,"Facilities at the hotel are endless, so much to see and do, revolving around the casino"
c25000057,s10,Shuttle buses to and from the airport and port are smooth
c25000057,s11,"Because it's a big and busy hotel, waiting times can be long"
c25000057,s12,On 2 separate occasions my room key failed
c25000057,s13,This required a trip to reception
c25000057,s14,"20 minutes for the lift each time/each direction, plus about 10 minutes waiting at reception (50 minutes in total)"
c25000057,s15,At 11pm this was unacceptable
c25000057,s16,…
c25000058,s1,"I have been staying in this hotel since its opening, usually once a year or two"
c25000058,s2,Sadly I have seen the hotel continuously going down in both service and facilities
c25000058,s3,Here are several observations and I hope the management will take these comments seriously in their future plans
c25000058,s4,a
c25000058,s5,The room looks really tired
c25000058,s6,Some of the furniture looks aged and not properly maintained
c25000058,s7,One of the two TV sets in the room is an old “tube type” Philipps TV (which can be only found in a museum I suppose)
c25000058,s8,b
c25000058,s9,The customer mix has really changed over the years
c25000058,s10,"I was totally annoyed by group tourists who were lousy and loud, yelling to each other in the hallways"
c25000058,s11,c
c25000058,s12,Breakfast was a total chaos
c25000058,s13,It took me a while to get a cup of coffee (which by the way tasted awful) so I had to run to a Starbucks…
c25000059,s1,"Unfortunately, as I stayed in the Studio City, I can only base this review on what I saw the few hours I was here; however, this hotel was incredibly boring"
c25000059,s2,"The service was very slow and rushed where we did go, and it is very easy to get lost without knowing where to go"
c25000059,s3,"The model Venice itself was just shops, and felt very unrealistic and over the top"
c25000059,s4,"It was just the same after the same, and the gondolas were clearly a very boring experience as the water stretched for about 20m"
c25000059,s5,Too commercial
c25000059,s6,"Limited options of where to eat and drink, and no affordable cafes for a small coffee"
c25000059,s7,"Overall, I think I'll stick to the less grand but overall much, much better Studio City"
c25000060,s1,I can finally appreciate the word 'mass luxury'
c25000060,s2,"This hotel is lovely in terms of size, has ample food options, casino, free shuttle everywhere, shopping, et al"
c25000060,s3,"What you can't expect is great service, given the size, about 3000 rooms, of the property"
c25000060,s4,"They have good staff, but the queues are check-in, shuttle service, even food court somehow don't go well with the premium prices"
c25000060,s5,Guess my opinion is different from the rest of the reviews here but I'm sticking to it
c25000061,s1,Was told at check-in by hotel staff that my original payment was a credit authorisation and can't be processed unless I have my foreign card with me
c25000061,s2,So I paid on the day of arrival in cash
c25000061,s3,Then contacted my bank regarding this and was informed I had in fact been double charged
c25000061,s4,And now the hotel is saying the original debit charge would take 2-3 weeks to refund
c25000061,s5,Wasted 2 hours on customer service line and still no result
c25000061,s6,Shocking !
c25000062,s1,"We had a really average experience at this Hotel and wished we had have booked one of the hotels opposite this property, such as the Crown, Conrad or Sheraton"
c25000062,s2,Luckily we were only there for a night
c25000062,s3,Once we had checked in (which was very efficient and attentive) we then had to wait in a que for 15 minutes to get into a lift
c25000062,s4,It felt like they were herding cattle into a feed lot
c25000062,s5,This seemed to be a common occurance for us as the south wing of the Hotel in which were allocated a room was seriously under lifted
c25000062,s6,We decided to eat all of our meals outside of the Venetian as  the ambiance was not conducive
c25000062,s7,The rooms are very spacious but jeez the beds are rock hard and the a/c kept on fluctuating temperatire all night
c25000062,s8,We just couldn't wait to leave
c25000063,s1,unless you like waiting in queues and walking long distances for everything
c25000063,s2,"The hotel was a disappointment from the beginning: when we arrived by shuttle bus from the ferry, it took us 10 minutes to find the right counter to  check-in"
c25000063,s3,"There was hardly any staff to tell us the way and, of course, no one to help us with the luggage"
c25000063,s4,We had to queue up to check in which took  us around half an hour (!)
c25000063,s5,"The queue line was prepared to hold twice the people than what were there when we came, so prepare to wait up to an hour for checkin (see photos)"
c25000063,s6,"The rooms are big, yes, but also need a renovation"
c25000063,s7,Whether it's the old-style TV or the stained floors - you can see that this place is worn out for sure
c25000063,s8,"There are queues for everything, and so for the breakfast"
c25000063,s9,The breakfast…
c25000064,s1,Had a problem every single day of my stay
c25000064,s2,Day 1 started with waiting 45min to check in because of the massive lines (I got in at 9pm
c25000064,s3,) then my tvs don't work in my room so I had to wait around for 5 different people to figure out what the problem was and then they ended up replacing them because they couldn't figure it out
c25000064,s4,This took about 4 hours
c25000064,s5,Day 2 I was rudely woken up at 4am by the occupant in the adjoining room (which is the hotels problem because the walls must be paper thin)
c25000064,s6,I ended up moving rooms to avoid this happening the next day
c25000064,s7,"So now in a new room, the new problem is that there was no hot water in the shower"
c25000064,s8,Day 3 I leave my room around 10am and return at 6pm the room wasn't cleaned and the cleaner show up at 7:30pm wanting to clean
c25000064,s9,so I tell them I'm…
c25000065,s1,It was our first trip to Macau via Hong Kong
c25000065,s2,We heard so much about the Venetian Macao and though to give it a try
c25000065,s3,"To our dismay, the room was so old and the bathtub was spoilt and typically, we didn't shower for a day as the tap was not working well and the water was super hot and can boil an egg!  Front desk was not able to communicate in English and the breakfast was disastrous and totally in the mess in terms of food presentation"
c25000065,s4,The whole stay was totally bad and I would not recommend anyone to even consider this hotel until they rectify all the issue 360 degree
c25000065,s5,It was so bad until i fell so sick and have to cut short my stay
c25000065,s6,I regretted so much for the amount paid to suffer in this hotel which i could use the money to pay to my preferred hotels
c25000065,s7,"Obviously, we have…"
c25000066,s1,Over 25 million visitors a year and 6x more sales of casinos compared to Las Vegas that’s Macau
c25000066,s2,"Unfortunately the former fisherman's village cannot meet this onslaught of visitors and I understand, because the infrastructures have not grown at the same pace"
c25000066,s3,"Arriving with the ferry from HK an unbelievable chaos, departure is even worse"
c25000066,s4,It has taken us 40 minutes to wait for the hotel shuttle bus
c25000066,s5,"Waiting outside under the sun for an 8 minutes Bus ride to the Hotel Venetian, an absolute no go"
c25000066,s6,"The story continues: after arriving at the lobby an endless queue, i"
c25000066,s7,e
c25000066,s8,waiting time 45 minutes
c25000066,s9,"The Venetian Macao Resort Hotel claims to have 3000 suites and 12,000 employees but I experienced no customer service at the check in"
c25000066,s10,After successful managed the arrival problems followed by…
c25000067,s1,"Understaffed hotel for checking in, I suppose all their staff are assigned to the empty casino tables"
c25000067,s2,"Otherwise an OK stay, wifi is free although you might need to reconnect from time to time"
c25000067,s3,Breakfast is average
c25000067,s4,"The shopping areas and the mini-canal is well maintained and full of shops, not sure how their prices play out compared to Hong Kong shops"
c25000067,s5,"All in all not a bad place to stay except for the poor check in service area, good thing they have express checkout so I dont have to experience their ""reception attraction"" again"
c25000068,s1,Suites were lovely but check in took 2 hours of queueing! Not what you'd expect from such an expensive hotel
c25000068,s2,"Furthermore, they mixed up our booking and tried to charge us for an extra guest that we'd already paid for"
c25000068,s3,"Even when we managed to pull up the emails from the venetian booking team, they were unapologetic"
c25000068,s4,Awful
c25000069,s1,Used to be a top choice for Macau
c25000069,s2,But NOT anymore
c25000069,s3,Rooms are smelly (even for non-smoking room)
c25000069,s4,Fixture and furnitures are all worn out
c25000069,s5,like a 3-Stars hotel
c25000069,s6,Definately need a MAJOR renovation for guest rooms
c25000069,s7,but no doubt the room size is huge
c25000070,s1,Don't stay here
c25000070,s2,The rooms are dirty and smell of smoke
c25000070,s3,We booked a suite but it was barely larger than a single bedroom in other hotels
c25000070,s4,Breakfast is like feeding time at the zoo
c25000070,s5,Staff are rude
c25000070,s6,The pool area is nice - the only nice thing about this hotel
c25000070,s7,There are much better hotels nearby
c25000070,s8,"The location is convenient, and good restaurants downstairs, but I still recommend staying elsewhere"
c25000071,s1,avoid this property especially if you are going with children
c25000071,s2,Huge casino right in the center
c25000071,s3,The shortest route to go anywhere in the hotel is always through the casino
c25000071,s4,And kids are obviously not allowed to enter the casino
c25000071,s5,"Hence, it generally take a half a kilometer walk to go from one place to other along with kids"
c25000071,s6,The rooms are old and nothing to talk about
c25000071,s7,"After paying 18000 HKD for a room you are made to stand in half an hour in the check in queue, while look at your family sitting on the lobby floor along with other guests"
c25000071,s8,I am sure one will get way better service at this rate in another property
c25000071,s9,Most of the hotels in cotai strip are nearby
c25000071,s10,one can take free shuttle buses to visit these properties
c25000071,s11,Advisable to stay else where and visit the property to see its…
c25000072,s1,"Count 1-2 hours waiting in line for checking!!! If you want to waste your holidays standing up in queue, choose this hotel! Else try another one"
c25000072,s2,Never seen this
c25000072,s3,Most of the check-in counters are unattended and the few staff taking care of clients take their sweet time
c25000072,s4,What's the point of treating clients like this?!!! Does the management think clients are to be treated like cattle?  DONT GO THERE!!!
c25000073,s1,"I booked a bella suite, the second tier from all the choices, and apparently all bella suites are double bed, no king size bed"
c25000073,s2,"So when we requested a king size bed, the receptionist told us that it will be a downgrade to the king size bed suite and if that is okay"
c25000073,s3,"So we said, yes that is fine, we just need one bed"
c25000073,s4,"Then after working on checking in about 3 mins, she said she found a room and upgrade us to a royale suite"
c25000073,s5,So we were happy
c25000073,s6,"And we even commented, that's very nice, we are now upgraded not downgrade anymore"
c25000073,s7,"Apparently, we were not upgraded as what the receptionist told us"
c25000073,s8,Royale suite is the lowest and our room smells like fresh paint
c25000073,s9,"I mean, we already said it's okay of the king size bed is lower price, and we accept that"
c25000073,s10,So they don't have to pretend…
c25000074,s1,Went as a group of 5 to stay one night
c25000074,s2,Check-in didn't open until 3 which is very late
c25000074,s3,"We weren't allow to queue for check in together, so one of our party had to stand on her own in a line for an HOUR AND A HALF whilst the rest of our party waited at the side with our bags"
c25000074,s4,"Once we reached the counters, the hotel had our booking down incorrectly - 2 suites for 4 people instead of 5 - and tried to charge us an extra fee"
c25000074,s5,"Luckily we had evidence in the form of emails from the Venetian discussing the booking and cost, however regardless of this the check-in staff needed to send for a manager, and then manager said that she would need to make phonecalls to verify this"
c25000074,s6,"By this point we were hungry, annoyed and completely fed up of waiting, so told the staff we would just pay the…"
c25000075,s1,"If you are going here with children or the elderly, BEWARE!  As the children cannot go through the casino, there was miles of walking up and down escalators, around shopping malls to get back to our lift lobby"
c25000075,s2,There are also long queues for everything
c25000075,s3,It started at check-in where they rudely informed us that only one person could be in the check-in line as the queues were too long
c25000075,s4,The wait there was a good half hour
c25000075,s5,"Then came the trek up to the room located on the North wing, another good 15 minutes from the main lobby"
c25000075,s6,"Then the breakfast queue at Cafe Deco, another good 30 minutes even though there were empty tables"
c25000075,s7,"As for the connecting rooms we received, one smelled so badly, probably of vomit or paint"
c25000075,s8,Couldn't and didn't want to tell
c25000075,s9,After many telephone…
c25000076,s1,"I' m so disappointed to this hotel service , i spent my time just to waiting for check in , I Wait for 2 HOURS just for check in to the room ,and there is no CHAIRS for the old people to rest ,very worst service"
c25000077,s1,I have stayed several times at the sister properties in Vegas and Singapore but to my disbelief the Macau property is horrifying
c25000077,s2,Don't stay here if you are sensitive to mold
c25000077,s3,The hallways and rooms need paint
c25000077,s4,Old and crusty
c25000077,s5,I left the A/C off to keep the mold from blowing into our room
c25000077,s6,Staff laughed at me when I complained
c25000077,s7,Key didn't work the 2nd and last night
c25000077,s8,A nightmare
c25000077,s9,Save your money and stay elsewhere
c25000077,s10,I'm selling my stock in the morning too
c25000078,s1,I stayed last friday for 1 night
c25000078,s2,Its Too Big and Too Busy for me
c25000078,s3,I can live with that for 1 night but…
c25000078,s4,When I returned to my room $700 was missing from my Travel wallet which was inside my bag
c25000078,s5,If thats not bad enough when I reported it The Hotel GM really didn't care one little bit
c25000078,s6,Be warned !!!  :(
c25000079,s1,"Well, very disappointing, but it saved me money, I couldn't wait to get out"
c25000079,s2,"In the middle of the shopping mall you walk into the Casino, there was no sense of excitement, fun or anticipation"
c25000079,s3,"I'm use to laughing and excitement,  people drinking and having fun, but nothing not even talking"
c25000079,s4,All very serious
c25000079,s5,The only good thing was there was no smoking
c25000080,s1,Great place with everything under one roof
c25000080,s2,Hotel rooms hundreds if metres away from reception and you must go through tbe casino to get anywhere
c25000080,s3,On 12 September 2p16 the hotel had a conference and there were literally hundreds if not thousands of guests trying to get in the lifts to go to their room
c25000080,s4,It took me more than 2 hours to get to the lifts
c25000080,s5,This is unacceptable when it should only take 1-2 minutes to do so  Staff and security most unhelpful and were herding guests as if they were cattle
c25000080,s6,Could bot recommend this hotel to anyone
c25000081,s1,"If you're thinking of visiting Macau with your family, never stay in this stupidly built hotel! It's absolutely designed for casino gambling, not families with kids"
c25000081,s2,"The minute you arrive to the hotel if you have kids, you need to go up the escalator or take the elevator to a mall and walk 10 minutes just to see another hotel entrance and take the elevator or escalator again to the hotel"
c25000081,s3,"This of course providing that your kids wouldn't stop at all of the mall shops while searching for the hotel entrance so you can go to your room! This's very annoying especially when you're tired and wants to go to your room! It's basically designed for gamblers and never thought, not even 1% about families with kids when they designed it"
c25000081,s4,"Oh, it's normal to see the security guards at the…"
c25000082,s1,At $ 350 a night and considering the Venetian in Las Vegas one has big expectations  from this hotel
c25000082,s2,"But beware !!!!!!!!!!! You'll be terribly disappointed  The rooms are old, dirty and need refurbishing badly  The rooms have old bulky TVs not flat screen The sofas in the room are filthy and worn out   The hotel claims to have 39 restaurants they forget to write that 20 are fast food outlets in the food court like a cheap mall   There's only 2 bar which isn't even a proper bar"
c25000082,s3,No live entertainment no live music no lounge no daily shows nothing When you step outside the hotel there is no shop no restaurant nothing to see The Italian restaurant serves the worst pizza I ever had and at US$30 it's a rip off ! When I asked the receptionist what's there for entertainment her answer…
c25000083,s1,I have been at venetian for several times since its openning on 2007 and it just becoming worse and worse
c25000083,s2,"- no enough counter for checkin, average waiting time is about 1h for taking the queue  - room is old, used"
c25000083,s3,"Need definitely renovation  - no gym  - too many night workers and mafia in the casino, always a stranger asking you when you gamble  - lot of ppl sleeping at the bench and security guard don't care  - lot of female night workers  - shops are useless inside  There are so many other hotels in Macau, much better with the same price, don't go to this place"
c25000084,s1,rude staff
c25000084,s2,"first impression was checking in when some guy just walks up to reception and starts screaming and abusing people, staff just let him scream for 5mins"
c25000084,s3,no one cared
c25000084,s4,Room
c25000084,s5,large yes but tired and low quality worn furniture
c25000084,s6,The writing desk next to the window looked like someone had taken an axe to it with random chunks missing
c25000084,s7,The toilet seat too had cracks taken out
c25000084,s8,Maybe the same axe man
c25000084,s9,We watched a One FC event at the Cotai Arena
c25000084,s10,After we walked around for 45mins asking where a bar was
c25000084,s11,No bars open at 11pm
c25000084,s12,Saturday night
c25000084,s13,Great! Next day my friends mobile ran out of battery and he asked concierge to help charge the phone with his charger
c25000084,s14,"No we dont do that, you have to go to the business center"
c25000084,s15,Front desk the same
c25000084,s16,After an hour trying to get…
c25000085,s1,"Before choosing the hotel for my visit, I checked through almost all 4 to 5 star hotels in Macao"
c25000085,s2,end up choosing Venetian Macao thinking the environment looks good and convenient and had booked for 4nights
c25000085,s3,"Well, I was wrong"
c25000085,s4,Really regrets booked total 4 nights there
c25000085,s5,The premises is quite big and easily lost your way and don't really see any hotel service staff around nor security
c25000085,s6,All security are only standing at the entrance of the casino
c25000085,s7,The food court food are all over priced
c25000085,s8,Before visiting I made a few calls to the hotel and was told the currency used in hotel are in HKD
c25000085,s9,BUT
c25000085,s10,98% of the stores at the food court only give you the change in MOP (macao currency) even you pay by HKD and same for the shopping outlets too
c25000085,s11,"The best part it, all the outlets don't…"
c25000086,s1,"We made the trip from Hong Kong to Macau especially to visit The Venetian, what a waste of time! The staff in the food court were rude and the whole place was dated"
c25000086,s2,If I had my time again I would not bother with it at all
c25000087,s1,"On a positive note, the room was great, the service was good and the quality of the room service food was good but for me the negatives far outweighed the positives"
c25000087,s2,The layout of this hotel is the worst I've ever seen
c25000087,s3,There is a huge casino between the lobby and the elevator to the rooms
c25000087,s4,You need to walk about 250metres from the lobby to the elevators
c25000087,s5,If you have persons under 21 years who aren't allowed in the casino then you need to navigate through a maze of shopping arcades and canals adding to that already inconvenient walk
c25000087,s6,One wrong turn could add 5 minutes of extra walking
c25000087,s7,The pool is over 300metres from the elevators and the gym about 200
c25000087,s8,The place is also very crowded with loud and sometimes obnoxious guests with very little concept of social etiquette
c25000087,s9,Finding a…
c25000088,s1,We have visited Macau several times before and have always dreamed of staying at the Venetian
c25000088,s2,"However, little did we know that the rooms were very dated"
c25000088,s3,"and not like the photos!! We still got lost finding our hotel room after we stayed there for 4 nights, it is like they built the shopping mall and casino and then thought, 'we are a hotel and have to put in guest rooms'"
c25000088,s4,The check in staff were not very welcoming and the pool was hard to find- a 10 minute trek
c25000088,s5,The carpet felt dirty and we could hear the lift from the first room they gave us before moving
c25000088,s6,The pool area was very nice and the only place were we felt as though we were staying in a hotel
c25000088,s7,We will not be staying there again
c25000089,s1,I booked this hotel from hotels
c25000089,s2,"com and stayed there for 2 night, 6/13 and 6/14/2016"
c25000089,s3,"In the first night, my son got flea bites all over his 2 legs, around 80+ bite marks; my wife also got 20-30 flea bites"
c25000089,s4,I will attach some pictures
c25000089,s5,I tried to talk to that hotel but they said they can't find flea from that room
c25000089,s6,"But the truth is, my son and my wife got flea bite there"
c25000089,s7,It's a very crazy experience and we have to throw away all of our clothes and luggage
c25000089,s8,"We never got such flea bites before, and we thought it's caused by mosquito; but the 2nd day those bites become much worse so we send pictures to our US pediatrician, he reviewed those pictures and he told us most likely they are flea bites"
c25000089,s9,"I attached pictures, you can see if that's flea bites or not"
c25000089,s10,It's a very upset…
c25000090,s1,the security guards were very rude and the staff were not helpful when they saw we're coming with our bikes
c25000090,s2,even yelled to us!!! the service is not like a 5-star hotel
c25000090,s3,it made me very disappointed and wasted my precious holiday
c25000090,s4,(P
c25000090,s5,"S i've sent my feedback to the CS of The Venetian Macao, but no reply until now!)"
c25000091,s1,We booked two Bella Suite to celebrate my daughter's Birthday
c25000091,s2,We came with two seniors who are over 70 years old and 3 young children
c25000091,s3,"1) Shuttle bus	 Upon arrival to Taipa Ferry Terminal, there were zero signs pointing to the Venetian bus"
c25000091,s4,"While the other hotels have well marked buses, the Venetian left us lost and going in circles"
c25000091,s5,We waited for 45 minutes under the sun (35 degrees) for the shuttle bus
c25000091,s6,2) Check-in  I came at the official check-in time: 3 pm
c25000091,s7,"Room was not ready, the staff promised to be ready by 4 pm"
c25000091,s8,Didn't get the room until 5:45 pm
c25000091,s9,"Came back at 7:30pm, another room was still NOT ready"
c25000091,s10,"15 mins later, I received another text message saying the room was ready and the keys will be left at room 1"
c25000091,s11,"By the time I returned the hotel at 9:30 pm, I was still…"
c25000092,s1,Very very poor customer service
c25000092,s2,Looking at customer service it is not even 1 star
c25000092,s3,Went with family and I had two small kids with me
c25000092,s4,Fun started as soon as I entered into this property I had 4 luggage and two kids with one in stroller
c25000092,s5,It was middle of night when I arrived there and no one from concierge helped me to checkin and luggage guys were there and nobody helped me until I gone to reception which was very far from concierge and then I had to go back to front to give luggage tag to luggage claim and then they picked up my stuff
c25000092,s6,And they give you coupon for food and then when you go for dining resturent will say it's not valid here even though it's mention in that discount book
c25000092,s7,Not recommended to anyone
c25000093,s1,This is a BIG hotel with 4000 rooms! and it blows your mind
c25000093,s2,You need atleast 4 days to cover this hotel
c25000093,s3,The first two levels is just food and shopping
c25000093,s4,It also has a Venetian style boating which is very charming
c25000093,s5,It has a artificial sky which looks very real
c25000093,s6,"Express checkout is a breeze, if you dont use the in room bar, just drop your keys in a box on your floor and walk away - simple"
c25000093,s7,The biggest pain is the checkin
c25000093,s8,We stood in line for almost 2 hours which was worst than any airport immigration
c25000093,s9,This was the most disappointing aspect of our stay which is why I give it 2 stars
c25000094,s1,"The Venetian is a fantastic hotel, no doubt"
c25000094,s2,"From the rooms to hotel interiors, they have got everything going to their credit"
c25000094,s3,"However, the sheer scale at which they operate makes the whole experience for the guest less personalized, special and sometimes pure hassle! Unfortunately, that was the case for me"
c25000094,s4,"I was travelling with my mom, who is about 60"
c25000094,s5,"Given her age, she needed rest after the travel but we were made to wait 1"
c25000094,s6,5 hours in the queue for check-in
c25000094,s7,"The front-desk asked if we needed assistance with the baggage to be taken to the room, I said yes but i was told it would take upto 45 minutes to reach the room"
c25000094,s8,"Tired of waiting for so long already, i just dragged my luggage up on my own"
c25000094,s9,"Once we got to the suite, we were tired and hungry, and ordered room service"
c25000094,s10,…
c25000095,s1,There are always crowds of people in the hotel lobby level
c25000095,s2,Very hard to walk in
c25000095,s3,Not tranquil and not relaxing at all
c25000095,s4,"If you are having a baby like me, the casino would block some of the way to the lift lobby and you need to go to the mall level to get around"
c25000095,s5,"Very inconvenient!  The whole building is big, it could take you long time to get to the right lift lobby to go up your room and then to take you another long walk from the lift lobby to your room on your floor"
c25000095,s6,Rooms are big which is the only thing I think I could appreciate
c25000095,s7,"But the room is very smelly, I am sure lots of previous guests smoked in the room"
c25000095,s8,"The carpet, the sofa, the bed, the wall"
c25000095,s9,basically everything is full of third hand smoking
c25000095,s10,I have hanged my own towel in the living room during the day and when…
c25000096,s1,I visited Venetian Macau in May with my family
c25000096,s2,The place is overall decent but being huge has its own disadvantages
c25000096,s3,The breakfast tables saw huge queues
c25000096,s4,Overall food was average
c25000096,s5,Besides that there are no activities except for pool and Golf club
c25000096,s6,The mall on the first few floors are unattended and expensive
c25000096,s7,Too many people moving around aimlessly add to the overall crowd
c25000097,s1,"I am staying at a lot of casinos for work, lived in Las Vegas, but this was my worst casino experience by far:  1"
c25000097,s2,"Reception did not take my credit card details at check-in, so I had to pay everything in cash"
c25000097,s3,Found out I was not the only one
c25000097,s4,2
c25000097,s5,Therefore paid room service in cash
c25000097,s6,Change was only returned after calling
c25000097,s7,3
c25000097,s8,Rooms are very moist smelly and you can actually taste the fungus 4
c25000097,s9,Ready for the gym? Get prepared to walk past the smoking rooms first!  5
c25000097,s10,"Food: If you are not a Chinese food aficionado, forget it"
c25000097,s11,Even the spaghetti Vongole have one organ too many
c25000097,s12,6
c25000097,s13,Internet access was on and off
c25000097,s14,"Moreover, no international calls possible! When I called upon customer service they told me to buy a phone card!   All in all, a casino resort aimed at the Chinese market…"
c25000098,s1,"As the title implies, it has some redeeming features but overall I was just disappointed"
c25000098,s2,"I called to book the room on the day (was catching the ferry from HK), and booked a Rialto Suite for a rewards club rate (free to join, can sign up at the casino)"
c25000098,s3,The lady on the other end of the line spoke very broken English but we got there
c25000098,s4,"So, you can imagine my surprise when we arrived at the hotel two hours later (3"
c25000098,s5,30pm) and were told (after a 35 minute queue) that the room type we booked wasn't available
c25000098,s6,The receptionist and I couldn't really communicate properly so she called someone on the phone
c25000098,s7,I was then told the same thing; they wanted to put us in a lower level of room for basically the same cost I had negotiated over the phone for the better room
c25000098,s8,At this point…
c25000099,s1,Booked the room for 3 pax but everything in the room was only for 2 pax
c25000099,s2,"The toilet is huge, but bath tub was dirty"
c25000099,s3,the shower head is spoil!  I guessed this hotel has no maintenance on their room
c25000099,s4,I will not stay in this hotel again
c25000099,s5,Try Galaxy Hotel the next round
c25000100,s1,this hotel is very tired and of need of a renovation urgently it is a huge property with rooms based on the edges of the casino there is no service for your room Staff are not interested and from the time you arrive you ar eon your own Breakfast is of poor quality
c25000101,s1,I went to Macao to dicover this beautiful place and to have an experince here
c25000101,s2,It was memorable and I will always remind this place
c25000101,s3,Macao out of the hotels is beautiful
c25000101,s4,"However, I will tell you what is going on within Venetian hotel"
c25000101,s5,I noticed that the turnover of this hotel is enormous
c25000101,s6,I will leave my opinion just focused in the service provided to me
c25000101,s7,Who is managing this hotel has forgot what is a personal service and highly professional attencion
c25000101,s8,As a hotel 5* should recognize their guests and to look after them
c25000101,s9,Attention!!! If you need something you will have to find the way by your own
c25000101,s10,The staff is not tarined to ask you before your needs
c25000101,s11,"Venetian Hotel is beutiful outside but when you go in, It turns terribly"
c25000101,s12,Room too old fashioned with a thick carpet
c25000101,s13,The…
c25000102,s1,Spent my birthday at Venetian
c25000102,s2,Underwhelming service from impolite and slow front desk and disappointing lack of care given they knew it was my birthday
c25000102,s3,"Overall rooms were decent, shopping options were better in city of dreams, dining options was better at Galaxy and accessibility was best at Galaxy"
c25000102,s4,Venetian had the busiest casino if that is your purpose of visit
c25000102,s5,"With so many better options in Macau, not returning to this establishment again"
c25000103,s1,Great hotel in terms of looks and opulance but service stank and so did the rooms and hallways
c25000103,s2,Staff weren't very attentive the only staff member I can commend is Melrose at check-in really tried to look after us and dealt with our complaint on check-out
c25000103,s3,"We stayed 5 nights as it was the last leg of our honeymoon trip and can say Vegas Venetian is twice as good as this one, service and cleanliness"
c25000103,s4,Majority of staff also couldn't speak english or seemed like they didn't want to speak english
c25000103,s5,Had a really bad incident on the last night which ruined our stay and the way it was handled
c25000103,s6,Purchased some keyrings with my Sands Rewards Card and got double charged once on my card with points and then staff member Fan at Shop 88 said it didn't go through and made me pay cash
c25000103,s7,…
c25000104,s1,Be warned if you stay at this hotel
c25000104,s2,"Formerly a smoking casino the rooms are not always used and can be musty, smelly and have dirty air"
c25000104,s3,If you are lucky your floor may have air purifiers
c25000104,s4,Hotel facilities and shops good but not at the cost of waking up every morning with a headache
c25000104,s5,Would not recommend with children unless you are booking the top floors
c25000104,s6,This is certainly not Vegas style and wouldn't make my 5 star rating
c25000105,s1,Unless you are coming to shop or gamble (basically play Baccarat) then stay elsewhere
c25000105,s2,This place is massive and pretty much a maze
c25000105,s3,We ended up lost and frustrated most of the time
c25000105,s4,In spite of the size of this place the options for meals and drinks was extremely limited and the quality of food and service was awful and overpriced
c25000105,s5,Staff were mediocre at best and the rooms are tired and dated
c25000105,s6,"Jens Busch, the front desk Directory was very good however"
c25000105,s7,Stay elsewhere if possible
c25000106,s1,We stayed at the Venetian Macao on the 1st of December
c25000106,s2,We stayed for 2 nights in the Bella Suite
c25000106,s3,We left with nothing owing on the room !!!!!!! We arrived back into Australia and I checked my credit card to find that the Venetian Macao had charged us $320 Pataca ($55 Aud) !!!  I have just rang them to be told that we used the NON - FREE WI-FI   My advice to ANYONE that stays at this cheating resort to NOT use the WI -FI as you will be charged and unbelievable amount
c25000106,s4,They also fail to inform you of this until you get home so you cannot question the excessive amount
c25000107,s1,Stayed here without a choice for work
c25000107,s2,"Having stayed there, I know I would have preferred any other hotel"
c25000107,s3,Growing up in Vegas I do my best to avoid fake facade or theme hotels
c25000107,s4,"As our limo pulled up, I immediately was haunted by memories of Vegas, but I could not really see the hotel through the thick haze"
c25000107,s5,"Once inside, the noise of the casino, the gaudy artwork and architecture and the shops made me feel back at home and not in a good way"
c25000107,s6,I could not avoid passing through the noisy casino to get to my room and each morning I had to politely decline the many prostitutes hanging in the casino awaiting their prey
c25000107,s7,The room was very clean however and the room staff was friendly
c25000107,s8,There was a huge foodcourt with many dining options as well as a few restaurants
c25000107,s9,Best of all…
c25000108,s1,The Positives:  The Suite itself was huge; all amenities provided for and you could not complain about the Suite - total value for money
c25000108,s2,and some
c25000108,s3,Wifi was VERY fast in the Suite
c25000108,s4,The Negatives:  This ranks as one of the biggest disappointments in the last 20 years for us
c25000108,s5,a
c25000108,s6,35 Minutes to check in
c25000108,s7,We were herded like cattle into a queuing system that combined 'check-out' with 'check-in' and the 'check-out' line was highly favoured
c25000108,s8,b
c25000108,s9,North Suites - 10 minutes' walk from the check-in desk
c25000108,s10,c
c25000108,s11,"Room service food was terrible - cold, flavourless and to use a single word, 'disgusting'!  d"
c25000108,s12,Shuttle-Bus queue to go back to the Macau Ferry Terminal again like a cattle-herding
c25000108,s13,e
c25000108,s14,"One single beauty-salon, cost 800 HKD for a shampoo and blow-dry for my wife - ridiculous…"
c25000109,s1,We stayed here right after they opened and then again this month several years later
c25000109,s2,WOW!!! They have gone waaaaay down hill
c25000109,s3,1st off i have lived in hong kong for 16 and visit Macau often
c25000109,s4,Upon arrival to Macau by ferry there are zero signs pointing to the  entian bus
c25000109,s5,While the other hotels have well marked buses -the venitian leaves you lost and going in circles
c25000109,s6,The bus line was full of Chinese shoppers in massive tour groups
c25000109,s7,When the bus came it looked like an old dilapidated unmarked shenzhen rental
c25000109,s8,"Check in was good, but doesnt matter if you ask for smoking or not"
c25000109,s9,"Every room, including our non-smoking room smelled like a mildew ash tray"
c25000109,s10,"Mildew stained carpets, scuffed walls, wallpaper peeling bubbles, 1980s TV, and unwashed smokey windows are the new decor…"
c25000110,s1,We stayed at the Venetian's Bella suite for one night and it was horrid
c25000110,s2,"The room was in the North suite and was dated with one of those big boxy televisions, rubbish kettle and a fax machine sitting on the desk"
c25000110,s3,The room was large with a good view but the place was dusty and not very clean
c25000110,s4,There was no bath tub even though the bathroom was massive!  The worst thing about this hotel was the checkin which took almost an hour (and this was on a Monday which should be quieter)
c25000110,s5,The hotel itself was massive
c25000110,s6,"Absolute maze with no clear directions on how to get from A to B (obviously they want you to keep getting lost so that you can't escape the casino and shops), so be warned!!!  The security guards around the hotel were useless and couldn't tell you how to get around, plus…"
c25000111,s1,"Staff rude, very little English spoken, ATMs not working and loan sharps try to lend you money of the casino floor"
c25000111,s2,"Raised the problem to the hotel, but they did not respond"
c25000111,s3,I suggest you stay far away from this place
c25000112,s1,Dated room - at least the basic suites
c25000112,s2,"Things falling off, cracks, broken things, didn't feel like a clean room at all"
c25000112,s3,Also had a bit of a stench
c25000112,s4,Overall experience was that of a mass scale hotel with 0 five star services - except for an occasional smiling staff
c25000112,s5,Staff was average - the front desk person put us into the worst possible room in spite of asking for a better view
c25000112,s6,The breakfast was the worst I have seen in a 5-star
c25000112,s7,Felt like a shop floor of factory workers queuing up and the staff and everyone around all over the place to pick up food
c25000112,s8,Some of the food (e
c25000112,s9,g
c25000112,s10,cheeses) were stale
c25000112,s11,Its a beautifully made hotel - pity they don't know how to maintain this property and more importantly give the guests a five star experience in spite of the scale of operations
c25000112,s12,You…
c25000113,s1,"While the shuttle bad of other hotels are waiting for the clients, we, as client of Venetian are welcomed by a long queue with very infrequent shuttle schedule, just a harsh experience for us taking 2 young kids there"
c25000113,s2,I suppose this should not be the quality of such for a 5-star hotel!
c25000114,s1,"The room was very huge and luxurious, but there is no shop that sell baby clothes"
c25000114,s2,"And i hope the venetian can provide more children playground (like QUBE), so when parents spend their time at the casino, children can play too"
c25000115,s1,"Only big room, buffet lunch and breskfast expensive and no food to select and low quality, the decoration is same as ten year before, nothing change and old feeling, no amazing, Galaxy or Holiday inn or intercontential would be better"
c25000116,s1,What a real shame as I took a large suite in the North Tower and requested a non smoking room which stank of cigarettes
c25000116,s2,Clearly the management do not monitor guests behavior within these rooms
c25000116,s3,The place is huge and it is a nightmare to navigate around without requesting the assistance of staff members
c25000116,s4,"The hotel appears to be majority Chinese staff whom are rude, rarely smile, do not know how to great customers and speak little if NO English at all"
c25000116,s5,"As a white westerner I was so thankful to the Filipino and Indian staffs assistance, friendly smiles and great English"
c25000116,s6,I did being this matter up with reception whom was Chinese and all I was told it's the law to employ majority Chinese in which I appreciate and accept BUT BUT put these Chinese staff on a course to learn the…
c25000117,s1,"After staying previously at the Venetian in Vegas and not particularly liking it I should have known better, but the rest of my family quite enjoyed the former and persuaded me to book"
c25000117,s2,"However, none of us particularly enjoyed the Venetian in Macau"
c25000117,s3,"Rooms are large and well appointed but he "" non smoking"" room stank of stale smoke- we changed rooms to a slightly less smelly one but the air never really felt fresh"
c25000117,s4,"If you have kids the only way out is to walk through the huge, confusing and crowded shopping centre"
c25000117,s5,I felt trapped and it didn't make for a relaxing stay at all
c25000117,s6,Pools were fine but long walk to get to them
c25000117,s7,"Even if you want to spend your holiday in a shopping centre the prices are high by UK standards, especially food items ( including £5 for a bottle of water and…"
c25000118,s1,"The hotel is so nice , the room very good price/ qualities  But when you almost of the staff with no smile even not answering when you said hi"
c25000118,s2,You just feel they are not happy and you bore them   They must get Philippino staff that's will make a wonderful place
c25000119,s1,"This was the  third hotel I stayed in, during my three week vacation in August 2015, after a visit to Singapore and Malaysia"
c25000119,s2,"We always wanted to stay in the Venetian ever since it opened, but have been put off by its teething problems, reports of long queues etc"
c25000119,s3,I eventually booked here to try out for a night as I got a reasonable rate compared to other 5 star hotels on the Cotai Strip
c25000119,s4,I visited with two of my daughters as my wife had work commitments back in Hong Kong
c25000119,s5,I was concerned about check in but it was  generally painless in the queue system
c25000119,s6,"We arrived about 2pm, the peak check in time"
c25000119,s7,"I was asked if I wanted a non smoking or smoking room, I answered non smoking room"
c25000119,s8,"Although the queue was long, the line moved very quickly and considered efficient as the hotel…"
c25000120,s1,"To begin with, the T"
c25000120,s2,V
c25000120,s3,in the room are still living in the 80s
c25000120,s4,Complimentary tea & coffee are Nescafe & Dilmar whereby their Sands Hotel in Singapore is giving you Nespresso & TWG
c25000120,s5,"Too much PRC tourist, loud & rowdy"
c25000120,s6,"Hotel staff are just as rude especially the day we check in, 1 staff just brush us off saying ""no English!""  I am sure a front office staff welcoming a checking in guest could get a English speaking staff to assist us"
c25000120,s7,The only good & helpful staffs are the concierge in the Main & West Lobby
c25000120,s8,Very professional & helpful
c25000120,s9,The are the reason this review is not rated terrible
c25000120,s10,"The priority staff, when we request for 2 boxes of bath salt, 2 bath foam,1 shower cap"
c25000120,s11,They send the housekeeping with 1 set of amenities
c25000120,s12,We have to call again & they send a bagful of…
c25000121,s1,1) I have to queued / waited 45 mins+ just to check-in  2) We requested a no smoking room
c25000121,s2,"When we open the door to our room, it smells like 10 people had been chain-smoked in this room for 10 hours before 3) There is a layer of dust on most of the things, e"
c25000121,s3,g
c25000121,s4,"lamp, curtains, TV, printer on the table, etc  4) Might be due to point number 3, I ""subjectively felt"" the carpet and bed were dirty 5) Paints were peeling off 6) The shower head is not designed for someone short like me (I'm 160)"
c25000122,s1,my wife chose to stay here for the mere reason that the musical we were watching was staged there also
c25000122,s2,I stayed here once 7-8 years ago and the decor (& all) are the same
c25000122,s3,"guest they've kept a high maintenance standards, but it's becoming old (others have a more modern feel)"
c25000122,s4,just picture the Venetian room's in Vegas
c25000122,s5,"check-in queue was long (weekend) and staff was slow; and what a disappointment and inconveniences: Our hotel package, included room, breakfast, show-tickets and ferry to HK"
c25000122,s6,"For us to collect them, we had to go to 3 different counters (where one was at the other side of the hotel)"
c25000122,s7,"Venetian's room are typically good size, but what I don't understand is why the sitting area is near the window and the bed is closer to the door"
c25000122,s8,it makes no sense at…
c25000123,s1,"The whole hotel was full of cigarette smell, including non-smoking rooms"
c25000123,s2,Even bed linen and duvet smelled awful
c25000123,s3,A hell for non-smokers
c25000123,s4,"Also not a place for senior persons, as there was no place to sit at all at the lobby while waiting an hour just to check in!  Extremely tardy reception check-in"
c25000123,s5,Concierge was a failure
c25000123,s6,"Booked and paid for an hour's limousine service, but the driver did not show up until after 40 minutes (leaving only 20 minutes' ride)"
c25000123,s7,"The concierge did not apologise, nor offered any compensation"
c25000123,s8,Absolutely disgraceful
c25000123,s9,Failure on all accounts
c25000124,s1,"I was told there's free wifi in the room , but since day 1 I've been complaining the wifi is not stable , keep disconnecting , they'll just tell me to restart the router and try again without offering any help"
c25000124,s2,"on the second day , we couldn't stand it anymore, so they send 2 technicians to our room but the technicians just came and restart the router , just like what I did ! So I can be technician also huh ? They didnt solve my problem , they only restart the router"
c25000124,s3,"Today is the 3rd day and they send technician here again , to RESTART !   This morning , we booked a car at 11"
c25000124,s4,30am and its HKD$900 per hour
c25000124,s5,We left our room at 11
c25000124,s6,25am thinking walking to lobby is just 5minutes walk
c25000124,s7,Who knows we waited for the lift outside our room for 20minutes !!!! Every lift that reach our…
c25000125,s1,While visiting Hong Kong my husband and I took the fast jet boat from to Macau for an overnight stay at the Venetian Hotel
c25000125,s2,"We always stay at the Venetian Hotel when in Las Vegas, Nevada and thought this one would be just as nice"
c25000125,s3,"Wrong!  No matter where you stay in Macau, when you arrive there expect crowds of people around you being herded to the bus with your hotel's name on it"
c25000125,s4,Once we arrived at the hotel we waited in a long line to get inside the hotel and to the registration desks
c25000125,s5,"Once inside the hotel it did not look at all like the ornate over-the- top Las Vegas Venetian, disappointingly"
c25000125,s6,While checking in the man assisting us offered me a choice of one of the several cards he was holding in his hands
c25000125,s7,"The one I chose turned out to be a free night at the Venetian, so…"
c25000126,s1,"Dear Travelers!  If you are looking to spend your time trying to push through hordes of tourist groups, then the Venetian is the place to be"
c25000126,s2,"Its loud, crowded, the rooms are old and stale, while the carpets have stains in the lobby so you have to tip toe about!  The check in queue is so long, that it took us ONE HOUR to get our keys"
c25000126,s3,Another 15 min later we were standing at the door with two keys that did not work! 15 min later a staff was able to let us in
c25000126,s4,What hotel that claims to be a 4 or 5 star has front door to room time of 1
c25000126,s5,"5 hours?  Breakfast is included, but does not even have simple basics like Fresh orange juice"
c25000126,s6,"Instead, there's powdered juice, very cold food, and even the eggs are pre-made for you at the ""live"" counter!  We went there on the Beauty and Beast…"
c25000127,s1,"Huge, impressive, and all the other superlatives that go with such a large establishment of this nature, the one biggest disappointment is that non-smoking means just that"
c25000127,s2,The whole wing of the hotel section we were allocated had that residual smoke smell about it
c25000127,s3,You cannot cleanup smokers remains that easily and unfortunately the North East wing seems to have been rebadged
c25000127,s4,"The rooms are huge, the facilities great, shopping seems expensive to HK, but the masses are from the mainland and flock here for an experience"
c25000127,s5,"Macau is a great place to visit the blend of Portuguese and Chinese cultures, and Asias gambling capital"
c25000128,s1,"This is to bring to the notice of the management, that I had stayed in your hotel in the middle of may 2015 with my family and I very much regret to inform to you that we had to experience a bitter experience at your property, to elaborate further I would like to bring to your notice that during our stay at your property we had taken a Gandola ride and the photographer at the venue was persuading us to buy the souvenir photograph which was costing around 550 HKD"
c25000128,s2,"and on refusing to purchase the same he was very rude and arrogant he shouted on us and started murmuring in chinese language, after paying such high tariffs at your hotel, we were trying to enjoy the same but this incident real spoiled our two day holiday in macau, we really felt insulted and subjected to racism"
c25000128,s3,Also…
c25000129,s1,Really the property is so old - You feel hopeless once you are in
c25000129,s2,Its large and not well directed for choosy ones who would like to know were they are going and not keep guessing all the time if this would lead to that or that!!   I had great expectations from their bellagio suite as everyone before us gave super opinions of the place but we just felt was another ordinary suite at a 4 star
c25000129,s3,"This should not be more than $200 at tops, The check-in at both entrance felt like we were at the train stations, one from the developing world and another from a Third world"
c25000129,s4,"Not worth some $699 that we paid with breakfast!!  As a couple, you would do best to avoid this place"
c25000129,s5,Visited June 2014
c25000130,s1,We checkout on 12
c25000130,s2,5
c25000130,s3,15 and checked in 10th May
c25000130,s4,during check in Hotel ask for a security deposit of 2000MOP (macau Dollar)we gave our card and they blocked the amount thru one of their local bank and informed during the time of check out the same will be released
c25000130,s5,but till date thats 21
c25000130,s6,5
c25000130,s7,15 its not yet credited back to my a/c and now they say its done thru local bank and Indian banks have different policy
c25000130,s8,many follow up but no remarkable support from their end
c25000130,s9,lovely hotel
c25000130,s10,lovely rooms
c25000130,s11,In room dining wait time is almost 40-45 Mins whatever the order which was quite disappointing
c25000130,s12,and the worst experience is using an  Indian Credit card
c25000130,s13,so do an Indian carry a Local  bank card when plan to visit Venetian Macau
c25000130,s14,Completely dissatisfied with check out…
c25000131,s1,"The room (they call it suite) was huge, it was amazing Clean, kuxurious, great sofas, great view Only the 2 tv-sets were obsolete (leftovers from the 1980's ???) Great service  (Free) Transportation to and from the hotel was perfect and waiting times for the buses was fairly short"
c25000132,s1,We booked at the Venetian's official brand website and was offered a late check-out
c25000132,s2,The room is huge and the facilities are good
c25000132,s3,"Afterall, we have paid almost hkd3000 per night for the room so we have quite HIGH expectation on it"
c25000132,s4,"However the Venetian kept making us really Unhappy! The thing is we stayed there during the ""1/5 Golden Week"", we understand that there were hell lot more of tourists but it was not a proper excuse for giving us things we requested (e"
c25000132,s5,g
c25000132,s6,"Pillow, slippers and opener) ONE hour delay"
c25000132,s7,"During the process, my friend and I was asked to call different lines"
c25000132,s8,"Also, as mentioned it was CROWDED everywhere, but the transport arrangement sucked"
c25000132,s9,The rigid shuttle bus schedule made us mad when you saw bus and driver all available plus a super long queue
c25000132,s10,And it…
c25000133,s1,"I was surprised at the efficient check-in given the size of the hotel, that's the end of the good"
c25000133,s2,"Tacky rooms in need of some TLC, swarms of people, terrible breakfast"
c25000133,s3,"Stay somewhere else, there are lots of lovely hotels nearby that are infinitely better"
c25000134,s1,There are so many rooms here that be prepared to be treated like one in a million
c25000134,s2,Check in is a nightmare
c25000134,s3,Waiting in line is a nightmare
c25000134,s4,Walking from check in to the room was l-o-n-g
c25000134,s5,And then even though our room was classified as non-smoking there was still a definite smell of smoke
c25000134,s6,Calls to the operators were a challenge because they seemed to only speak Chinese and had poor command of English
c25000134,s7,"The rooms didn't have laundry bags, which Would be considered pretty basic for a hotel that charges hundreds of US dollars"
c25000134,s8,Not a pleasant stay
c25000134,s9,Certainly don't get what you pay for
c25000134,s10,"I Would recommend a smaller, newer hotel for sure"
c25000135,s1,"stay clear if you have kids as you will have to make a long, long detour to reach your room, passing by the Mall's food court"
c25000135,s2,"Does not matter if you pay top dollars, you will be diverted"
c25000135,s3,"if you have ever wanted to experience the most amazing buffet breakfast, then skip the Venetian's one"
c25000135,s4,Food choice and quality is sub standard
c25000135,s5,Our suite lacked of freshness
c25000135,s6,"Overall, Venetian is a beautiful hotel but not worth to pay high price for no exclusivity"
c25000136,s1,"This review is strictly for hotel, not for the mall grounds I think we have to be able to differentiate, as the shopping grounds are just fantastic and amazing"
c25000136,s2,"The hotel itself is starting to feel outdated the room although huge, but that is about all that is good about this hotel"
c25000136,s3,"The hallway constantly smells like mildew it is pretty gross, the tv's a poor mans flatscreen tv and the bathroom fixtures are starting to fall apart as our bathtub was leaking"
c25000136,s4,"For someone that travels a lot, the price they are asking for does not match the what you should be getting, not to say our room was filled with dust that our whole family had a coughing fit"
c25000136,s5,It is really hard as I have been to the one in Vegas a few years ago and always thought it was great this one although has the…
c25000137,s1,It didn't start well
c25000137,s2,our room reservation was messed up and we were only booked in for 2 nights instead of 3
c25000137,s3,so they booked us in the for the 3rd night
c25000137,s4,at a more inflated price than my printed out booking showed :-(   Then they decided not to include breakfast or internet in the 3rd night (my printout showed both included for all 3 nights but it didn't matter as common sense does not prevail at the Venetian Macau)
c25000137,s5,Then the breakfast voucher showed breakfast finishing at 11am
c25000137,s6,so my wife went to breakfast at 9am and the restaurant was closed
c25000137,s7,"they resolved this by allowing her to go to another restaurant, but also by taking the voucher off her, so we could not use it for the second mornings breakfast"
c25000137,s8,this took over an hour of arguing to resolve
c25000137,s9,as no-one…
c25000138,s1,"We recently  spent 3 nights at the Venetian, it is not a five star hotel"
c25000138,s2,The Cotai view suite we had was dark and dinghy with a terrible stale smoke smell
c25000138,s3,"The bathroom vanity had black mould in the grout, th carpet was dirty and the lounge was stained, not what you would except from this hotel"
c25000138,s4,"Look elsewhere , not good value for money"
c25000139,s1,It's like a factory in the hustle and bustle
c25000139,s2,"tacky interior , smelly room!! There's nothing but a huge hotel"
c25000139,s3,"If you get a service, you should ask for it 3 times"
c25000139,s4,I asked them to give me a non smoking room cuz i'm pregnant
c25000139,s5,But i was given a room that smells strange
c25000139,s6,And then they just sent a housekeeper with an air freshener! What I want was a different room
c25000139,s7,We waited and waited
c25000139,s8,It took an hour to send a manager
c25000139,s9,She showed diffrent rooms
c25000139,s10,The second room was also stinky and the next one smells moldy
c25000139,s11,I guess I had no choice
c25000139,s12,"If you want to receive a great service, relax and go shopping at the same time, I would suggest choosing a diffrent hotel"
c25000139,s13,"In addition, Breakfast  buffet was terrible !"
c25000140,s1,Booked 2 nights in a suite for family of 4
c25000140,s2,Checked in and found amenities for only two
c25000140,s3,Asked for two extra sets and room service staff arrived with a bag for 1 extra set
c25000140,s4,Took another 2 complaints before they got it right
c25000140,s5,"Bathroom door hard to close, literally having to slam it to close and push hard to open"
c25000140,s6,Bad luck if you had to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night and wake-up the family
c25000140,s7,Internet in the room was extremely poor
c25000140,s8,Better internet reception in the public area
c25000140,s9,"To top it off, the toilet was block in last morning, after 2 phone calls and waited for 45 minutes for maintenance to fix"
c25000140,s10,Have been to Las Vegas and got much better value and service
c25000140,s11,Overall very disappointing
c25000141,s1,We went to stay at the venetian thinking it was going to be a treat and ended up forking out quite a lot for it
c25000141,s2,"Service was awful, from the time the maid refused to get us another complementary bottle of water, to the time I found faeces all over the seat of the toilet in the casino and the toilet attendent refused to acknowledge it, to the fact that there was no room turning down service or breakfast included"
c25000141,s3,This is a resort which bills itself as a luxury retreat but is instead a total rip off with no focus on hospitality or service
c25000141,s4,"The room was actually very nice looking and the bed very comfortable and clean, but I was stunned by how little attention there was on the guest for the 5 star prices we paid"
c25000141,s5,Note this isn't a grouchy review from someone that lost at the…
c25000142,s1,Location is great but you feel like you're staying in a shopping mall
c25000142,s2,Hallways smelt of smoke too
c25000142,s3,We were allowed a late check out time but had to pay for wi-fi
c25000142,s4,Pay for wi-fi in a fricking 5 star hotel!!!  The casino is the largest in the world and the location is great for serious gambling and/or events at the Cotai arena
c25000142,s5,Room was spacious with a good view and quiet
c25000142,s6,Comfortable bed and splendid bathroom
c25000142,s7,Not worth the money overall though
c25000142,s8,Complete lack of a personal touch due to the size
c25000142,s9,Wasn't given any information on breakfast i
c25000142,s10,e
c25000142,s11,where to go etc so can't tell you about that
c25000143,s1,Premium pricing for average service and overcrowded facilities
c25000143,s2,This is what we experienced during our one night stay at the outrageously overpriced Venetian -   Spotted blood stains on one of the unused towels in the bathroom  The room was not properly cleaned and we could see cobwebs in one corner  The electric kettle kept in our room was extremely dirty with moulds on the inside
c25000143,s3,We called housekeeping to replace the kettle and they replaced it with another equally dirty kettle
c25000143,s4,"The suite comes equipped with a mini bar stuffed with overpriced snacks, soft drinks and alcohol"
c25000143,s5,The hotel lacks basic courtesy to even include plates and cutlery
c25000143,s6,We called the house keeping at least five times to get us some knives and tea bags
c25000143,s7,Finally after 45 minutes they did actually get the…
c25000144,s1,I really didn't like this hotel
c25000144,s2,"It was tacky in my opinion, and the breakfast area was a crazy noisy chaos"
c25000144,s3,"I didn't feel any luxury feeling even though the rooms are enormous and full of marble, everything is just very fake"
c25000144,s4,"It was also tremendous cold, the air condition so cold that we all got a cold"
c25000144,s5,Impossible to turn it down we just had to put on winter jackets in November
c25000144,s6,"I couldn't stop thinking of all the money they could have saved just lowering the AC in all the halls and lobbies, the hotel is huge its hard to find ones way"
c25000144,s7,I couldn't wait to leave this place!
c25000145,s1,In terms on price/quality this hotel is definitely not worth… Top prices for average service and overcrowded facilities (bear in mind that the casino and the shopping malls are open to everybody)
c25000145,s2,"The hotel is a massive building holding 3,000 rooms and suites and a fake Venice full of malls"
c25000145,s3,The reception is like a railway station full of signs and directions
c25000145,s4,One needs a map to go anywhere
c25000145,s5,"Since it a huge place it´s very difficult to have good service in such a big place, but the truth is that you are paying a lot of money and deserve more than the average service you are offered in this hotel"
c25000145,s6,"The suites are just big and lack soul and warmth with lots of golds and marbles, making it a baroque and uncomfortable"
c25000145,s7,Shoddy flat screen TV's with a poor resolution
c25000145,s8,It is…
c25000146,s1,We had planned a 5 nights 6 days trip to HongKong and Macau in last week of December 2014
c25000146,s2,"Having heard so much about the venetian and my husband having seen the sister property at Vegas, was quite convinced that we had to experience the place"
c25000146,s3,Hence we booked ourselves at this highly expensive resort thinking it will be worth the money
c25000146,s4,"Well, property wise it was worth it"
c25000146,s5,"Experience wise , it was not"
c25000146,s6,It was bursting with people
c25000146,s7,"the moment we stepped out of the ferry terminal in Macau, we were made to stand in queues everywhere - to get into the shuttle which would drop us to Venetian, to deposit our luggage before check-in, to check-in, to have breakfast in either of the restaurants !  As soon as we reached The Venetian, we could see thousands of people"
c25000146,s8,Everywhere
c25000146,s9,Being…
c25000147,s1,"Dear Venetian,  With the reference to my booking number 4408147 / 4408138I was travelling with my parents which are senior citizen and 2 of my babies which are only 1 and 2 years old"
c25000147,s2,I would give credit to the hotel to offer me the express check in pass and also a late check out
c25000147,s3,However overall we are truly disappointed with our 3days 2night stay at Venetian Macau
c25000147,s4,This is due to the poor crowd control by the Venetian Management during the New Year Eve countdown outside the main lobby with the theme Winter in Venice
c25000147,s5,One of the door was closed due to massive crowd out there and we were directed to walk to the drop off main lobby
c25000147,s6,"I just wonder how come Venetian Hotel guest wasn't given priority to this event? As I saw a lot of outsiders joining the event, I am not saying that…"
c25000148,s1,The Venetian is just like a dirty big Yank Cadillac
c25000148,s2,"Poorly designed, old technology and ugly"
c25000148,s3,Prices are unbelievable AUD $10
c25000148,s4,00 for a can of coke
c25000148,s5,Rooms are not designed and laid out well with obsolete technology and if you have a suite you spend ten minutes walking around turning off all the lights
c25000148,s6,The rooms aren't smart wired
c25000148,s7,Lack of international adaptors and messy wiring around the desk
c25000148,s8,No top sheet on the bedding only the duvet
c25000148,s9,When asked for a second sheet it took forever trying to explain what is required
c25000148,s10,"Towels are small and thin in quality, and the amenities are cheep and tacky"
c25000148,s11,The suites are just big and lack soul and warmth
c25000148,s12,Cheap flat screen TV's with a resolution that is poor and lacks definition
c25000148,s13,"No turn down service for the suite rooms, only…"
c25000149,s1,We stayed here with our parents over the Christmas holiday because they had stayed here the year before and had good experience
c25000149,s2,Our experience this time is just the opposite
c25000149,s3,We didn't enjoy our stay and wouldn't recommend this place to anyone
c25000149,s4,"To begin with, we got three rooms in the possibly the worst section of the hotel"
c25000149,s5,The lowest floor at the end of the hallway
c25000149,s6,Long walk from the lifts and a view of the roof construction next door
c25000149,s7,The whole place just reeks of over-commerialization
c25000149,s8,The attached mall is full of luxury shops and Chinese tourists
c25000149,s9,It was crowded everywhere
c25000149,s10,It was hard to find empty tables at the food court during meal time
c25000149,s11,"Prices at the food court and mall restaurants were on the high side, even relative to top HK restaurants"
c25000149,s12,TVs in the room…
c25000150,s1,I booked this place with some friends so we could use the spa which they guaranteed (they triple checked on the phone 1 hr before out arrival) was open until 2am
c25000150,s2,Upon our arrival they told us the spa was closed
c25000150,s3,There was also a 1000 hkd price increase between the phone reservation and check in
c25000150,s4,But as we checked in at 1130 pm it was too late to change or dispute
c25000150,s5,The non smoking suite smelled heavily of cigarettes
c25000150,s6,Max at the front desk was nice
c25000150,s7,The concierge found us an alternative spa that was open late
c25000150,s8,Most things at the hotel are as you'd expect
c25000150,s9,It's Macau though
c25000150,s10,"Breakfast is with another thousand or so people, it's all built for massive groups of ppl to gamble, so any personal touch or feeling of genuine quality gets lost amongst the masses of people and slot…"
c25000151,s1,This hotel is large and is unable to provide any sort of service
c25000151,s2,"The room was nice but the phone didn't,t work ,fighting in the corridor outside our room  and the seedy world of this place made me feel uneasy"
c25000151,s3,visited Wynn totally different atmosphere
c25000151,s4,My sister rang ten times and left messages got nil
c25000152,s1,"With such a price, I would think free wifi should be included"
c25000152,s2,"But it wasn't!  Free wifi is only provided to guests who book the room through their official website!  We booked through Agoda, so if we wanted to have internet access in our room, we had to pay for an additional MOP 168 for 1 day - that's only 24 hours of usage"
c25000152,s3,The sign and direction for the shuttle bus area was not clear enough
c25000152,s4,For a few times we actually got lost
c25000152,s5,The directions should be more clear and easier to follow
c25000152,s6,The price and quality of food at food court was horrible
c25000152,s7,I would rather spend money on food in somewhere else
c25000152,s8,There should have been a free shuttle bus to San Malo area
c25000152,s9,I think it's a place to get bored easily
c25000152,s10,I would love to see more performance at the streets in the shopping area
c25000153,s1,This Hotel is made for travellers who love to travel in groups without any touch of personalised service
c25000153,s2,Waiting for airport transfer and later for check in at hotel at long queues
c25000153,s3,Walking to the rooms is a long way passing the casino security with restrictions like no sunglasses and no carrying no cam in your hand
c25000153,s4,As men you find special attention by Chinese and Philippine prostitutes waiting in casino area for customers
c25000153,s5,The rooms are very spacious and comfortable
c25000153,s6,After I visited already the Venetian in Lad Vegas the Hotel there is much better
c25000154,s1,Was trying to book this hotel directly since I wanted some clarification on the verona suites that I wanted to book
c25000154,s2,They had a Sale which lasted till Nov
c25000154,s3,11
c25000154,s4,As early as nov
c25000154,s5,"9, I was trying to book with them through email, I figured I just book through email since I was already talking with them anyway"
c25000154,s6,I provided my credit card details and all
c25000154,s7,They only replied to me on Nov
c25000154,s8,"13, at first they were apologetic and told me that they can honor the discount since it was a delay on their part"
c25000154,s9,"But after a day, I got another email which said that they can't give me the discount rate that they had even though it was clearly their fault when they only replied to my email after 5 days"
c25000154,s10,"Each time I emailed back, a different person would reply to me"
c25000154,s11,"Its truly frustrating, never…"
c25000155,s1,Stayed for a night just to experience a Macau casino hotel
c25000155,s2,Chose the Venetian as we wanted to see how well they had recreated Venice in the form of a shopping mall
c25000155,s3,The hotels website makes a big deal of offering free wifi and late check out if you book via its website - we did and got neither
c25000155,s4,Instead we were offered wifi for 160 MOP ( about £15 after tax)
c25000155,s5,Ironically wifi is free on the free shuttle buses so if you need it just go to the west lobby and stand next to a bus
c25000155,s6,Check in is not as slick as in other hotels - and not available at all arrival points - be prepared for a walk
c25000155,s7,Beware the sneaky attempts to upsell you
c25000155,s8,The room - if you've got a spare few minutes try to establish the difference between one of their standard suites and a view suite apart from the…
c25000156,s1,Had our annual family vacation to Macau earlier this year in march
c25000156,s2,"we were a family of 4, and had booked a Bella Suite at HKD $1688 per night"
c25000156,s3,The services they provided was really shocking
c25000156,s4,"The checking-in at the reception was slow, the staffs were unfriendly and they look grumpy"
c25000156,s5,"However, could not disagree with the fact that the hotel room were spacious and well maintained"
c25000156,s6,stayed in the west wing and the housekeeping lady for the 11th floor was extremely friendly
c25000156,s7,Had initially checked with the receptionist during checking in and she was confident in telling me the wifi is complimentary in room
c25000156,s8,"However, after 4 nights of staying and using the internet, we were charged at HKD$160 PER NIGHT for the wifi usage"
c25000156,s9,"And despite the high price we pay, I must say that the wifi…"
c25000157,s1,My husband and I came to the Venetian for our anniversary trip
c25000157,s2,I wish we had stayed at a different hotel
c25000157,s3,Check in was slow and chaotic
c25000157,s4,The lady checking us in tried to up sell us to a larger room and a breakfast package
c25000157,s5,We also booked a deal which entitled us to late check out - we were not given this late check out
c25000157,s6,We ordered room service for breakfast and were very disappointed: the food was of a low standard and some listed items were missing
c25000157,s7,"Worse, we asked if we could use the swimming pool after check out (as is permitted in most other hotels) - we were told that as you need a key card to enter the pool area we would not be permitted to use the pool"
c25000157,s8,Overall furnishings in the hotel room are dated (but kept clean by the maid staff)
c25000157,s9,As a frequent visitor to Macau I…
c25000158,s1,I am currently staying at the Venetian for my birthday
c25000158,s2,"The service here is appalling and the food at the breakfast restaurant was pathetic (wet plates, ketchup everywhere and no fresh eggs)"
c25000158,s3,They even have a so called Michelen Star restaurant called the Golden Peacock - this by no means is close to any Michelen Star with the food being cold and rude service
c25000158,s4,"After raising the above issues with the general manager, I was informed that the breakfast restaurant is outsourced hence not part of Venetian's responsibility - which is contradictory as they include it in the package they sell to their customers"
c25000158,s5,No efforts made by the Manger to improve our stay
c25000158,s6,"In summary, the worst experience I have had ever in staying at a 'luxury' hotel"
c25000158,s7,Would not recommend to anyone
c25000159,s1,me and my family stayed last night at venetian macau hotel for a night
c25000159,s2,"we checked in august 29,2014"
c25000159,s3,we have asked the staff of valet parking of this hotel to take our car to park
c25000159,s4,"today aug 30,2014 after checking out and taking our car, the staff from valet parking asked us to pay 200 MOP,macau money, i told them that we checked in the hotel and even showed her the room number, but she insisted that we have to pay, and even told us that if we have parked by ourselves then it will ne free"
c25000159,s5,we paid the parking fee
c25000159,s6,"it was very disappointing for us to know a 5 star rated hotel with no free parking? and when you check in, they just give you a map and you find your room"
c25000159,s7,wow i cant believe it
c25000160,s1,I have been sitting on the FLOOR in the foyer along with about 50 others waiting for my husband to check us in
c25000160,s2,The queue is roughly the same long
c25000160,s3,Have been here for nearly an hour now
c25000160,s4,At least I can sit
c25000160,s5,My husband has to just stand and wait
c25000160,s6,If you can't cope with this many people
c25000160,s7,why accept our bookings? Not happy right now
c25000161,s1,We only stayed here because its such a famous hotel
c25000161,s2,But we are are happy we only stayed one night
c25000161,s3,"First some obvious comments: too crowded, waiting in line for check in, big walking distances to the room, no personal attention"
c25000161,s4,"But well I guess this is what everybody knows when they book this hotel, its just so massive"
c25000161,s5,"Its something they cannot change, its just what comes with running a big hotel, however points to improve:  - wifi internet: is overcharged and only available in the room - tv / remote controls: outdated and dirty - i had a pillow that smelled like old sweat, luckily i there was a spare pillow - somebody emptied his nose on the wall, and not cleaned - directions in hotel are not clear - restaurants in the hotel are overpriced - luggage service to bring luggage…"
c25000162,s1,It is definitely a place to visit and check off the list
c25000162,s2,But if you've been to Vegas you will surely be disappointed with Macau especially if you're not a gambler
c25000162,s3,The casinos are extremely smokey and overcrowded
c25000162,s4,At the Venetian there was a non-smoking section it was very small but still reeks of smoke
c25000162,s5,The majority of the gambling is table games so if you're into slot machines you won't find much to play with most of the slot machines being very old
c25000162,s6,Do you get out of the casinos and go to restaurant bro we highly recommend the restaurant O Santos which I did a separate review for
c25000162,s7,Getting to Macau we recommend paying the extra few dollars to upgrade to premium service on the turbo Ferry
c25000162,s8,You bypass the lines and it really makes for a smooth transition
c25000163,s1,"What a disappointment! Unless you are a hard-core gambler, avoid this place at all costs"
c25000163,s2,"Okay, the room was very nice"
c25000163,s3,That's about the only good thing I can find to say about the Venetian
c25000163,s4,Although old-fashioned with a very out of date decor and weak shower pressure
c25000163,s5,"Oh, and wi-fi was MOP 160 per day! The worst thing about it was the crowds--the public spaces were jam-packed with HORDES of tourists, mostly from Mainland China, which made even walking through the lobby like getting through Times Square on a New Year's eve"
c25000163,s6,The hotel pools were TERRIBLE
c25000163,s7,All four of them
c25000163,s8,"The water was only a meter deep, and the temperature of the water was like a hot bath in each of the four pools (it was a hot day and we were desperately seeking to cool off)"
c25000163,s9,There was an HOUR wait to…
c25000164,s1,Was our first time staying at Venetian Macau
c25000164,s2,Had a lot of expectations as there were so many good reviews and the hotel looks great from outside
c25000164,s3,It turned out that the whole experience was extremely disappointing
c25000164,s4,The place could be for you if you are into gambling but not if you want to have a relaxing weekend
c25000164,s5,1) you need to walk through the gambling crowd / whole bunch of visitors wanting to take a look at the architecture and all
c25000164,s6,the smoky areas before reaching checkin  2) we checked in after 3pm and the room is still not available
c25000164,s7,No explanation given
c25000164,s8,3) we need to scold and continue to insist to get a room in the other tower after over 40 mins
c25000164,s9,By then we lost all our mood
c25000164,s10,4) you need to walk another 10 mins and through the crowds again before you reach the other…
c25000165,s1,Purposely took my son to the Venetian transformers Expo as my 6 years old boy is a huge fan all the way from Hong Kong
c25000165,s2,The place was huge but with little to display mostly posters and toys but nothing else much to see
c25000165,s3,There is a laser game which the staff wouldn't bothered telling you how to play and when you finish they time you and say by the end of the day the winner will get a prize
c25000165,s4,My little boy finish within 4 minutes and is in the top 10 list so I asked how would they contact us and the staff was so rude and say she doesn't know and asked me to wait till the end of the day when the expo finish but it was only 3 pm when I was there but the expo close at 8 and the expo have so little to see you can finish within half am hour
c25000165,s5,By the end of the expo you could play…
c25000166,s1,We came here to stay during 6/24-6/27
c25000166,s2,Terrible things happened since we got off the shuttle bus
c25000166,s3,"We came a few hours earlier than the Check-in time, so we first went slot playing and registered for the membership cards in the casino"
c25000166,s4,Not until we checked in at the hotel counter did the clerk tell us that only those who register for the membership cards after check-in can have free 100 HKD vouchers
c25000166,s5,"As their customers for 3-day stay, I asked them why this cannot be worked out, but the clerks just said no and left us alone"
c25000166,s6,"Money was not the point, but we just couldn’t swallow this nonsense treatment"
c25000166,s7,"So, we returned to find the casino counter and after a long-haul argument, a mean female clerk told us to bring down the registration form put in our room"
c25000166,s8,She said she would send…
c25000167,s1,I booked my room directly from its website and everything was fine before I got my room keys
c25000167,s2,I was quite excited about having full experience in the hotel as they invited me to join their Express Check In program which was new to me
c25000167,s3,It looked like a grand hotel from the outside
c25000167,s4,"I went to the lobby with my friend, queuing up for the room keys then one of their Front Desk staff waved to us so we approached the counter"
c25000167,s5,"The receptionist called Charis and she had no smile, no eye contact, no greetings at all and she just didn't say anything unless I asked her"
c25000167,s6,She neither mentioned when I should check out nor my deposit information
c25000167,s7,"And when I asked her, she spoke extremely fast and I felt that she was being offensive and rude"
c25000167,s8,The room keys and key card holder were the worst…
c25000168,s1,"I have been booking my room for 2 nights from 23rd to 25th July,  and I got the room confirmation via email"
c25000168,s2,"However when the time husband and I checked in about 4pm , the receptionist told us that there was no room available at this moment and asked to wait for at least 1"
c25000168,s3,5 hours for the rooms  ready
c25000168,s4,My husband was very angry and made complaint to that receptionist named Ella
c25000168,s5,"We came after the official check in time, why is no room for us and we almost started our journey from 6am here till 5pm now, We felt disappointed of her response to just asking us shopping around first and there is no complimentary from the hotel, you just have to wait"
c25000168,s6,"In conclusions,  it spoilt our evening schedule and no place for us to rest at all"
c25000169,s1,The hotel is situated far away from town and everything else
c25000169,s2,"Unless your idea of a holiday is casino and being stuck in a massive complex with thrones of people and rows and rows of shops, I wouldn't recommend this place"
c25000169,s3,The rooms are large but that is about the only positive I can think of
c25000169,s4,The beds are not comfortable and the quality of the towels and other hotel room amenities is poor
c25000169,s5,"For example, we paid for 4 persons in our room and only got water and towels for 3 and 2 miserable packets of coffee"
c25000169,s6,"If you are lost within the complex, it is impossible to find the service staff or any house phones except for the security officers that double up as guest relations officers"
c25000169,s7,"While most are polite, some cannot speak English and are absolutely clueless on directions…"
c25000170,s1,We were in Macau for an overnight trip and someone mentioned that the Venetian Macau was running a show about Transformers
c25000170,s2,A quick Google search and I found transformers30
c25000170,s3,"com which is a site created by the Venetian to promote the new show which runs from June 1, 2014 - October 5, 2014"
c25000170,s4,Since I have an 8 year old boy who loves Transformers it was an easy decision to go check it out - he had to wait overnight due to our schedule before he could attend
c25000170,s5,What a major disappointment to say the least
c25000170,s6,"It is housed in a large warehouse type space, divided into areas"
c25000170,s7,The spaces are 90%+ empty with a couple of posters on the walls
c25000170,s8,There were some nice replica's of things like the AllSpark but they are the size of a tennis ball in the room the size of a tennis court!  My son…
c25000171,s1,The hotel staff are not friendly anymore
c25000171,s2,"Worse part is , the bed pillow is crazy smelly"
c25000171,s3,I think it should change long time ago
c25000171,s4,Terrible !! Smell like ppl no taking shower for months
c25000171,s5,For a 2600HKD  WIFI  should provide free
c25000171,s6,I should think the management must look into this hygiene !!!
c25000172,s1,Stayed here over the weekend and was very disappointed
c25000172,s2,"It's is a monstrous, almost vulgar display of  new money geared towards mass Chinese and Indian tourists who arrive by the coach full"
c25000172,s3,"If you want a relaxing stay then avoid as it is too big; it takes ages to get to breakfast, ages to get to the pools, ages to get to reception, you can't just 'nip' down anywhere as its a massively busy shopping complex"
c25000172,s4,My boyfriend especially hated the fact that to get anywhere 'quickly' you had to walk through the huge casino and you couldn't have your camera on you
c25000172,s5,If you have kids you have to walk round and that would take even longer!!  You can't check in before 1pm nor use the facilities whilst you wait
c25000172,s6,However they did allow us late check out at no extra cost
c25000172,s7,Reception staff…
c25000173,s1,This is perhaps the worst show I have ever attended
c25000173,s2,Certainly not value for money
c25000173,s3,"I visited on the very first day with my kids and we were greeted by indifferent staff, carelessly slapped on posters and statuettes and Oh the highlight was three xbox stations with long queues forming in front of them"
c25000173,s4,"The people manning the station kept announcing the 5 minute rule for turns, which was mostly ignored"
c25000173,s5,"The ""details"" talked about shows, but it turns out that the show needs a separate ticket"
c25000173,s6,"You are photographed two steps into the exhibition and lo and behold, your family photo shows up just a few steps ahead"
c25000173,s7,"A total con job, NOT recommended"
c25000174,s1,It's a worse place to stay
c25000174,s2,"Staff is cold n arrogant, ambience is cold and it feels as if u don't belong there"
c25000174,s3,Just artificial
c25000174,s4,Facade
c25000174,s5,Rooms r big and very outdated
c25000174,s6,Who is watching on old ctvs
c25000174,s7,Furniture is old
c25000174,s8,And to my surprise wifi was chargeable at 120 mop
c25000174,s9,The canal shoppes r good
c25000174,s10,That's it
c25000174,s11,Hundreds of people getting around n u feel u r in a railway station
c25000174,s12,Just no soul
c25000174,s13,Keep away
c25000174,s14,City of dreams is stunningly beautiful
c25000175,s1,The fourth time to stay there within these few years
c25000175,s2,"All in-room facilities are still in very good condition such as the shining water tapes and door knobs, clean bath tub, clean floor carpet, etc"
c25000175,s3,"However, the staff quality needs to be raised to catch up with the competition from other hotels at Cotai"
c25000175,s4,"Remembered when I was taking rest in the room after checked in, a lady suddenly standing in front of my bed and asked she wanted to check the drinks stored in the fringe"
c25000175,s5,I was shocked there was no door bell ringing
c25000175,s6,She just came in by using her staff key card
c25000175,s7,"Although she was polite, it made me quite embarass"
c25000175,s8,"The second incident was happened when I approached the Conceige for enquiry speaking in Cantonese, I  recieived a cold response from a smile lacking face that "" I…"
c25000176,s1,i was meeting friends for dinner
c25000176,s2,just arrived in Macau this was my first accounter with such a resort
c25000176,s3,"with only name of restaurant, i first went to reception and asked the location"
c25000176,s4,"first hurdle,sorry don t know must be level 3"
c25000176,s5,found a lift and moved to level 3
c25000176,s6,"as i was unable to find plan i decided to ask Venetian staff members ( wearing names badges) i  repeated the operations 6 times changing nationality or uniforms and got the following responses "" sorry no speak english / don t know / not sure you better ask someone else"" finally found electronic plan"
c25000176,s7,first one was only in chinese and would not swap language
c25000176,s8,"the second did turn to english but the cursor was away from actual touch screen so when hitting O the letter R would appear, the third one finally worked"
c25000176,s9,found…
c25000177,s1,"We are currently based in Honk Kong on a work contract and visit Macao periodically to unwind and generally stay at the Venetian because they have a lot to offer in terms of room size, restaurants, shopping etc"
c25000177,s2,"On this occasion though, we had a very different experience"
c25000177,s3,Firstly the room prices were over 1000HKD per night more expensive
c25000177,s4,Wow
c25000177,s5,but then it got worse
c25000177,s6,The casino was very busy and as the day wore on the air quality became steadily worse until by around 8pm when we left the hotel
c25000177,s7,Our eyes were red and sore and we both had trouble breathing and talking and the smell of cigarette smoke was very prominent throughout the casino area even in the non smoking side of the room
c25000177,s8,(smoking and non smoking zones are separated by a walkway not separate rooms)
c25000177,s9,By the end of…
c25000178,s1,The hotel interior are super kitch and the room are very big but super dirty
c25000178,s2,"The carpet is full of dust, same as the sofa'"
c25000178,s3,I am allergic to dust
c25000178,s4,you can imagine! The shower is super noisy and the tub was not clean as well
c25000178,s5,The worst is you need to pay 16 euro for day for the internet connection! Is a shame in 2014!!!  Better stay away from here!
c25000179,s1,It was the second time we stayed at the Venetian Macao
c25000179,s2,"To be transparent with the management who might read my review, we stayed in room 54 on the 34th floor between march 25th and march 27th"
c25000179,s3,Our cons :  - my fiancee and just got married the same day we arrived at the Macao and i mention that to them when I booked the room
c25000179,s4,"I kind of expected to have a plate of fruit or some chocolates in the room, the kind of things you expect from a 5 stars hotel, but there was absolutely nothing"
c25000179,s5,- We asked for a non smoking room but there was a strong smell of smoke coming from the bathroom
c25000179,s6,"The smell stayed during our stay, it's probably coming from another room, anyway, that was a problem for us"
c25000179,s7,"- Room service : i ordered a turkey club sandwich for $hk130 or $hk150, something like…"
c25000180,s1,"was forced to stay here because of a convention and hated it - the enormous crowds, the bling decorations, the way you are forced to pass thru the casino to get to your room (non-smoking signs and fines cheerfully ignored), the ghastly breakfast at cafe deco"
c25000180,s2,basically this is tricked out dorm for the gambling hordes  the only good thing is the proximity to taipa old town which does have decent restaurants and some good views
c25000181,s1,We went to the Venetian all starry-eyed and left very disappointed
c25000181,s2,"The resort is impressive in scale, but cheap imitation decorations and poor inside layout make it feel closer to a theme park experience than a 5-star luxury resort"
c25000181,s3,Taking a good 5-10 minutes to get from lobby to your room and routing everyone through massive empty hallways or shopping areas feels like going through an airport terminal rather than a luxury property
c25000181,s4,"Issues started at check-in: Non-smoking king rooms (as booked) were not available (so much for being the largest hotel in the world) so we were ""upgraded"" to a two queen room on a higher floor when it fact it was a downgrade"
c25000181,s5,"Worse, we entered the room only to find out it reeked of smoke, despite the clear non-smoking signage"
c25000181,s6,Walls are paper-thin…
c25000182,s1,"Second trip to Macau and the initial plan was to stay at the Hyatt, but that was fully booked so I thought let's try the Venetian instead"
c25000182,s2,I somehow wish I hadn't
c25000182,s3,"While 'run down' is a bit of  a strong term, the place does have a bit of a feel about it that its best times are already behind it, at least as soon as you leave the shiny entrance hall and the huge casino"
c25000182,s4,"We got a Cotai View suite on the 24th floor, which gives you a great view over"
c25000182,s5,the muddy and grey construction site that is the Cotai Strip at the moment
c25000182,s6,"So nothing for nature enthusiasts or landscape aficionados, that's for sure"
c25000182,s7,The room is quite big at 70 square meters or thereabouts and includes a small step down from the area where the bed is to the sitting area
c25000182,s8,"It has two TVs, one in the bedroom…"
c25000183,s1,Was there for a company big event with 9000 delegates from all over Asia pacific
c25000183,s2,Was disappointed to see how inadequate they are in managing the whole event with the traffic flow around the hotel
c25000183,s3,Most part was blocked to make a one way traffic hence you need to detour a big round to get to your destination
c25000183,s4,I was also made to understand that both breakfast & WiFi are not provided and if in need you can pay for it but is very costly
c25000183,s5,The room maybe big with sitting room area which will hardly be in use as you only spend time in the room for sleeping
c25000183,s6,Further to that the room is also not well lighted up
c25000184,s1,What an absolute nightmare I had
c25000184,s2,"I landed off the ferry onto the Venetian bus, everything was ok"
c25000184,s3,While I was getting off the bus and this is according to the hotel my passport and credit cards were stolen from my backpack
c25000184,s4,I was told by security after giving them the report to wait for around 45 minutes
c25000184,s5,After two hours I was told nothing was shown on cameras
c25000184,s6,It was obvious they weren't bothered
c25000184,s7,After that I was told to make my way to the police station and considering my wallet was stolen I asked if someone could take me and it was a straight no
c25000184,s8,I had to make an ardous journey in the rain
c25000184,s9,Also before I left I was told to stay with hotel as room was already paid
c25000184,s10,There was no mention of a refund
c25000184,s11,The hotel didn't guide me whatsoever or help me with some numbers
c25000184,s12,My whole…
c25000185,s1,"Having heard an Asian Vegas vibe, and having loved the shows/activities in LV, stayed with a friend as part of a combined trip to HK/Macau/China"
c25000185,s2,"Couldn't cope with the rudeness of some staff within the casino as well as the shops eg one of the ladies at the  Chinese food shop right on the corner on the LHS across from the chocolate shop on the level of the Hotel Suite North blatantly served other people whilst I was waiting - in the end I asked if she actually wanted my money, ended up serving me after  this"
c25000185,s3,This happened at different shops on the 3 nights we were there
c25000185,s4,"Asked the staff at the activities/shows counter at the Venetian what shows there were, the ice world show was the only one"
c25000185,s5,We also asked what else is there to do apart from gambling and shopping and she…
c25000186,s1,"5 Star price for room but terrible quality of service to be received:  a) Smoke of cigarette prevails at Level 19 (non-smoking zone), including corridor, pillows, covers"
c25000186,s2,b) Ppl are free to smoke at the public area on Level 19 c) Ashtray is available at a non-smoking room
c25000186,s3,encouraged ppl to smoke? d) Cannot confirm non-smoking room at the inception of booking
c25000186,s4,"only plOutace it at special request even u book it in advance for 15 days,,,,, e) Discriminatary service"
c25000186,s5,"complimentary stay and meal should be same for paid good and service f) Old fashioned TV  As a result of smoke of cigarette, my dad have to check out earlier to consult doctor in HK"
c25000187,s1,This hotel only good for its name
c25000187,s2,"Lack of personal touch by the staff, you had to queue for everything"
c25000187,s3,"Even for asking a direction, you had to wait in line, when it comes to your turn, the concierge is rushing to the next guest"
c25000187,s4,One of the concierge did not even speak English
c25000187,s5,"The room is spacious, can accommodate 6 adults easily, but they will provide you additional pillow"
c25000187,s6,"Since the hotel itself is huge, room service will take 10-15 minutes time to arrive"
c25000187,s7,"2 months ago, I stayed in another hotel in Macau, and now I realize how important to had that kind of 'personal touch'"
c25000187,s8,Will not stayed here in Macau
c25000187,s9,For USD
c25000187,s10,"350++/night, I had better options"
c25000188,s1,We stayed just one night and we are glad that we did so
c25000188,s2,It is a different world coming from a 5 star in Hong Kong
c25000188,s3,in comparison the Venetian is only a 3 stars
c25000188,s4,It is just everything to the maximum which leads to a lot less attention to detail
c25000188,s5,Our room had a broken cupboard knob and dental care packs lying in the room
c25000188,s6,Breakfast was a big let down
c25000188,s7,It lacks class but that is no wonder when you see its size
c25000188,s8,Ps
c25000188,s9,Be prepared there is no free Wifi in your room
c25000189,s1,My holiday has not started but I have already had a bad experience with the online booking system by the this hotel
c25000189,s2,I received an email from Venetianmacao
c25000189,s3,"com a couple of weeks ago promoting their Ice World Package  25 November, 2013 - 28 February, 2014"
c25000189,s4,"It says the package comes with all attractive freebies - water jet tickets, lunch for 2, ice world tickets (of course)"
c25000189,s5,"What it doesn't say is any blackout dates, not even in small prints"
c25000189,s6,"Yesterday, I decided to book my holiday through the link provided in the email"
c25000189,s7,"It all went well - I was given a ""best available rate"" so I happily submitted my persaonal and credit card information - until I realized that there was no confirmation screen or email"
c25000189,s8,I contacted the customers service by email today and was told that what I paid…
c25000190,s1,We had to wait in long queue for hotel Shuttle bus on arrival Macau Ferry Terminal and later had to queue for 45 minutes to check-in on arrival at the hotel
c25000190,s2,"Surprising, there was not a single staff attending to the queue"
c25000190,s3,Check-in process took 15 minutes and Check-in staff was not prompt and attentive as he did not provide the Ice World package we had paid
c25000190,s4,"I had to remind him to include the package in the hotel ""Passport"" issued"
c25000190,s5,Time wasted
c25000190,s6,The hotel should put up a lounge and provide some refreshment for the comfort of guests who are waiting to check-in
c25000190,s7,"Suite given to us was poorly prepared, short of towers and amenities"
c25000190,s8,There was strong smell of cigarette in toilet despite a non-smoking suite
c25000190,s9,Hotel and casino staff seemed to be at war with guests
c25000190,s10,I did not see any…
c25000191,s1,I had 1 night stay with family at Venetian and celebration my birthday at Macau
c25000191,s2,But the services is poor during check in and check out process
c25000191,s3,No further explanation on hotel facilities
c25000191,s4,When I and my family went to F&B outlet
c25000191,s5,"(Dingwang Dim Sum Restaurant), the waitress and waiter no smile and servicing the food also very slow"
c25000191,s6,I will not back to Venetian to stay although i have holiday to Macau again/
c25000192,s1,Pretentions of a 5 star hotel
c25000192,s2,"No Wifi on their flagship Ferry or Bus, No WiFi in Lobby either!!! Told Wifi in suite was free but during login info about unspecified charges flashed on screen"
c25000192,s3,"I called lobby said they would comp, very nice but wouldn't put in writing"
c25000192,s4,"Walked literally 1km to front desk each way - through sickly smoke filled casino! Front desk manager refused to put in writing till, I said she was like some old Mainland China worker refusing to accept responsibility!   Here for Paquio Fight Suite is fabulous but very pricey"
c25000192,s5,Could over look that all the murals are printed on cheap plastic paper - doesn't the real Vegas have real paintings & murals? I guess they don't know photoshop can add brush strokes & now printing can be one on canvas!   Too many little…
c25000193,s1,The lowest rate of the suites are from $500+ a night
c25000193,s2,Decorations in room old with bulky tvs
c25000193,s3,Shower terrible with low pressure
c25000193,s4,Hair dryer very loud but has weak output
c25000193,s5,Room is large but definitely not worth the price we paid
c25000193,s6,Concierge in the mall and casino don't understand English?? Will not return
c25000194,s1,Hi my name is rahul agrawal and i was in ur hotel from 12th nov 13 to 14th nov 13
c25000194,s2,i had 4 rooms i
c25000194,s3,"e 19-107,19-111,19-112 and 19-119 to be very frank i found ur hotel to a racist one with pathetic service i got two rooms at 5pm as ur checking time is 3 pm i had to call three times for water ur security guard told my fy each family member to carry room key individually as i was a indian this is complete racist i will never come back to ur hotel again and will not suggest it to anyone within my friends and relatives  thanks for reading  rahul"
c25000195,s1,"From the check in you understand where u are , long long queue , 30 minute to find my reservation , than I ask where it was located the Olde Neptune Restaurant inside the Venetian Hotel where i have a meting"
c25000195,s2,Do you believe me if I say that even the conciere could not provide direction!!!! For a Restaurant inside the hotel  no one staff of the Hotel was able to provide indication or confirming if the restaurant exhist or not! The room are huge but  the material used are of very poor quality particularly the bathroom and the towels was terrible see pictures enclosed
c25000195,s3,"This Hotel is probably nice for the one who wish to gamble , but I was here for business and there is pratically no assistance"
c25000195,s4,The breakfast was also extremelly poor
c25000195,s5,Rellay this kind of huge hotel with such poor…
c25000196,s1,"What should have been a nice evening with some friends in The Venetian, was quickly ruined by the hotel inefficiency to cope with a large number of guests arriving"
c25000196,s2,"You would think that a place of this size is equiped to do the check in in an efficient way, though this is clearly not the case"
c25000196,s3,I queued for 1 hour just to check in and get my room key !!!  After exhausting travels standing in line for 1 hour just to get a key is no fun
c25000196,s4,Check out was again the summum of inefficienty
c25000196,s5,"Hordes of employees behind the check out desk, though at least 20 minutes queuing"
c25000196,s6,It is obvious that the Las Vegas Sands corporation (LVS) is not caring about the ordinary guest
c25000196,s7,"Full focus is on the highrollers, platinum members and VIPs who have a separate check in without any queuing"
c25000196,s8,…
c25000197,s1,Venetian made me very very unhappy and really angry today
c25000197,s2,"I came to Venetian with my family and I had a happy moment from the casino,We were having lunch,dinner and shopping around in the beautiful shopping mall"
c25000197,s3,"But at the end around 4pm,when we went to the shuttle bus stop which goin to macau ferry termini"
c25000197,s4,The staff Ms黎美鳳(53-58yrs) was very very impolite and spoke very rude to my mother
c25000197,s5,Oh my god
c25000197,s6,Today is my mother birthday
c25000197,s7,Since my mother walked faster to the front of the bus alone cos she wanna get on it
c25000197,s8,But failed becoz it s moving alway
c25000197,s9,Then my mother queue up
c25000197,s10,"Ms黎美鳳 dunt allow her queue up from the front and order her to going back to the end of the road,start blaming her with rude sound and noise that made me mad when I get closer to them"
c25000197,s11,I asked her when will…
c25000198,s1,Opted to stay here for a 2 night stay in Macau and try something different
c25000198,s2,Arriving in from a 6 night stay in Borneo where the service was 2nd to none this was a total contrast
c25000198,s3,"Depends if you want to stay in this type of hotel - in a huge complex full of shops, meeting rooms, theatre, canals and obviously the casino"
c25000198,s4,On arrival we didn't have a clue where to go its not obvious where to check in - there are many lobby's but the one you enter has empty desks - we had to ask concierge
c25000198,s5,No offer by anyone to help with bags - this is a 5 star!  Checked in and one of the staff just stood and stared at me - rude!!  The cheapest room is very large and spacious but despite it was non smoking he room just had this smell of smoke and the toilet had a bad smell too
c25000198,s6,No turn down but…
c25000199,s1,Just got home from a long weekend in Macau
c25000199,s2,We thought Venetian would be somewhere different to our usual place
c25000199,s3,Rooms were nice and big - excellen for a small family like we have
c25000199,s4,Everything was perfect except for one thing - room service
c25000199,s5,We ordered breakfast room service - meal was good - they gave lots of cutlery which was nice
c25000199,s6,"After the meal, we called the dining hotline to have someone clear our plates - lady on the line said no problem"
c25000199,s7,So we left for the morning to go swimming
c25000199,s8,"Came back lunch time - room was cleaned, new towels etc but all the breakfast cutlery was left of the table with the half finished food the kids couldnt eat"
c25000199,s9,"Fine, so i called the service again"
c25000199,s10,No problem said the lady
c25000199,s11,so we left to go shopping
c25000199,s12,you get where this is going
c25000199,s13,in the end…
c25000200,s1,The hotel is so big they hand out maps at the time of check-in
c25000200,s2,"(Of course, by then you've walked several miles following their inadequate and misleading signage)"
c25000200,s3,"On the plus side, the rooms are large and luxurious but there are only so many ways you can do luxurious before you have to just do it bigger"
c25000200,s4,Two TVs was unnecessary and over the top in our opinion - as were the 3 telephone extensions (one in the loo!) The bed was big (of course) and the shower was amazing
c25000200,s5,"On the other hand, the thousands of staff they employ there either don't know or don't care where anything is and are every bit as misleading as the signs"
c25000200,s6,"In spite of the very high price you pay for a room in this hotel, there is no free internet - M$160 for 24 hours' access - and not a single biscuit to go with…"
c25000201,s1,Not good for families
c25000201,s2,"It took a long time to get from the room to the pool or to the gym, down two lifts"
c25000201,s3,Very congested hotel with more people just visiting the hotel shops and casino than actually staying in hotel
c25000201,s4,Air condition kept making noise
c25000201,s5,Sounded like a tap running so had to turn off
c25000201,s6,"A man was banging on our door at 2am in the morning looking for his friends and smoking, so we ended up having a terrible sleep that night"
c25000201,s7,Definitely no security with regards to who is able to enter the floors
c25000201,s8,Also the buses to the hotel from the ferry terminal are apparently for everyone who wants to visit the hotel not just hotel residents
c25000201,s9,So it took a while waiting in line to board the bus
c25000201,s10,Would not recommend to anyone
c25000202,s1,The venetian is old as compared to the other newer hotels
c25000202,s2,"with the same price, it is much better staying with the new hotels around the same vicinity which may not be so complacent in their attitude"
c25000202,s3,"I wrote the below feedback during my stay at the hotel between 25-27sept and they revert today 2oct with a call justifying that room service was served cold because it was a bento box!   I am appalled by the sheer arrogance of this hotel to justify serving cold food to their guests!  FYI, room service order which was delivered cold to us on the 25sept includes the chinese dim sum set, japanese bento (which obviously includes rice and soup - cold) and western style breakfast with omelette (cold? not even warm"
c25000202,s4,)  The management took absolutely no responsibility to revert with a…
c25000203,s1,We checked in to the Venetian Macau and was informed the rate quoted in the confirmation printout was incorrect and we need to pay an additional $345 to cover additional breakfast
c25000203,s2,We informed the check-in staff that was the rate that had been confirmed as shown in the confirmation email
c25000203,s3,The staff insisted the hotel did not make any mistake
c25000203,s4,Upon request for clarification the staff took a copy of the confirmation note and called us later to inform us the rate in the confirmation note is not correct and we need to pay the additional charge
c25000203,s5,Luckily we had our ipad with us and had kept all email correspondence with the hotel and clearly the confirmation was sent by the hotel reservation department
c25000203,s6,We went to see the duty manager at the reception and we had to wait for almost 20…
c25000204,s1,Very luxurious place but worst maintenance
c25000204,s2,The shopping mall very good and there is sale everywhere
c25000204,s3,The room overall nice
c25000204,s4,But in the pool when i swim the gardener cut the trees and there so many trees on the street when i walk
c25000204,s5,It was so annoying
c25000205,s1,Extremely bad service of front office
c25000205,s2,1- didn't check and refuse to change     deluxe room to superior
c25000205,s3,Unbelievable 3ooo room fully taken and can't flexible
c25000205,s4,2-give the wrong direction
c25000205,s5,Which is north more near my room but tick on south
c25000205,s6,3-ask more tour information
c25000205,s7,they will answer : I don't know! 4-towel was smelly
c25000205,s8,Very bad experience
c25000205,s9,one thing good is was free shuttles bus
c25000205,s10,"But , I think won't come back this 5 star hotel again"
c25000206,s1,I am writing an updated review as I have made a recent visit and the changes are worth mentioning
c25000206,s2,Good things first; it still has lots of fun to it what with its enormous shopping complex filled with food courts and the gondola rides and etc
c25000206,s3,The European room decor still is interesting compared to other modern hotels
c25000206,s4,"Now comes the bad stuff; THERE WERE BED BUGS IN THE ROOM!! I have even wrote to the hotel but NO ONE has replied, so that shows how bad things have become"
c25000206,s5,"And believe me, we have had experience with these nasty bugs before in NYC so I know what I'm talking about"
c25000206,s6,The pool area was so disappointing as well as they were undergoing some repair in one of the bigger pools and all the chemical spray were flying towards our direction in the smaller adjacent pool
c25000206,s7,So…
c25000207,s1,"We stayed in the Venetian two days back and we our money was stolen from the our room, we left our wallet in the room, went for breakfast and when we came back the money and a diamond ring were not there"
c25000207,s2,It was a terrible experience for us
c25000207,s3,"We tried to get help from the hotel security, but they didn´t give us any information about the camaras, to see who went into our room so we put a criminal case for investigation in the Macao Police"
c25000207,s4,"The hotel didn´t give us any feedback, even if they say they were going to check the cameras"
c25000207,s5,It was hell for us
c25000207,s6,PLEASE BE VERY CAREFUL IF YOU ARE GOING TO STAY IN THIS HOTEL
c25000208,s1,"I have never stayed at a worse hotel, that´s if you can actually call this an hotel"
c25000208,s2,It´s more lIke a factory conveyer belt from start to finish HORRENDOUS
c25000208,s3,"There are queues everywhere starting with reception, there must have been 500 people checking in when we arrived"
c25000208,s4,"This hotel is far too big, everywhere you want to get to you have to walk for miles and always passing through the casino"
c25000208,s5,The whole place stinks of smoke including the rooms which are very tired looking and need of refurbishment
c25000208,s6,The whole place is tacky and totally without class
c25000208,s7,The restaurants are on the lines of American fast food and there is not a breath of fresh air in the place
c25000208,s8,"They even control DAYLIGHT, with their false sky making you feel that you are living permanently in a state of dusk"
c25000208,s9,There are…
c25000209,s1,First time staying in this hotel
c25000209,s2,Checked in was fine as we used the key express system (highly recommended to use this service to avoid long queue)
c25000209,s3,Stayed in Bella Suites and the room was very spacious
c25000209,s4,"No issues in terms of beds, sofas and amenities provided in the bathroom - all perfect"
c25000209,s5,"However,  with all the good rooms and facilities,  comes the inconsistency part which made the experience unpleasant - the water provided in the room was really small so we called several times requested for drinking water"
c25000209,s6,Totally surprised when the staff delivered the water spoke to us in Mandarin to tell us don't call anymore and request for water! Is this how they trained their staffs? Will definitely avoid this hotel if possible
c25000210,s1,When we booked this hotel we knew it would be big but not quite as big as The Venetian
c25000210,s2,The scale of this hotel is undescribable
c25000210,s3,For a 5 star hotel it lacks any form of intimacy or specialised service
c25000210,s4,The queue for check in is like an easyjet airport check =-in desk
c25000210,s5,Be prepared to queue for a while
c25000210,s6,The rooms are big and acceptable although they lack anything special
c25000210,s7,Incorporated in the hotel is an extra large shopping mall
c25000210,s8,The hotel tries to sell you an all inclusive deal which incorporates vouchers and gifts
c25000210,s9,"Do not buy this! the food is buffet, the vouchers aren't accepted in most stores and overall these are a waste of money"
c25000210,s10,The casino is good which is the very least you would expect
c25000210,s11,Overall if you are looking for a 5 star experience do not stay here
c25000211,s1,The room was big and spacious like most of the 5 star hotel in Macau
c25000211,s2,"The hotel was massive, I was a bit lost"
c25000211,s3,Service was so so because crowded with the many many Chinese from the mainland to checkin
c25000211,s4,"Casino was bad, I order a drink, it takes up to 45 min to come and they had to verify me as a legitimate player in the casino not some freebie taker just aimed for free drinks! I had one try to the hotel and never come back"
c25000212,s1,"Email sent to the Venitian Hotel following a very bad experience last week  As I just left your hotel, I wish to express  my full dissatisfaction about my experience for the two nights I did spend"
c25000212,s2,"First impression as entering the room, was to go back to the hotel standards from the late 80'"
c25000212,s3,"Design, furniture, amenities, entertainment systems, TV, remote control not working, bad maintenance, not turn down service"
c25000212,s4,"My worst experience was at checking out; When I checked in, as my room was fully prepaid by my Company, I had no problem, as requested by your staff, to leave a print of my credit card in case of extra expenses, it does happen anywhere, to keep record of this number and use the card if necessary, but I have  a serious issue when, at check out, the lady told me…"
c25000213,s1,"I have mixed feelings about this hotel, but in the end, my wife and I don't think we would return"
c25000213,s2,"I stayed at the Venetion with my wife, her parents, her brother and his wife and two children (7 and 10)"
c25000213,s3,A total of 6 adults and 2 children spread out in 3 different rooms for 2 nights
c25000213,s4,We arrived at the Macau airport and got on the shuttle bus to and from the airport
c25000213,s5,This hotel is located very closely to the airport
c25000213,s6,"We got to the hotel and it was quite impressive and opulent, along with noisy"
c25000213,s7,"Since it was before check-in time, we all went for a stroll with my wife's cousin who lives and works in Macau"
c25000213,s8,"We had the hotel hold our luggage, it would be sent directly to our room after check-in"
c25000213,s9,"Upon returning around 15:00 hours, my wife, brother and sister-in-law went to…"
c25000214,s1,"Although this isn't our usual hotel type, we were there for a conference and were looking forward to staying at a fancy hotel"
c25000214,s2,We were very disappointed
c25000214,s3,The first thing we noticed was that the hotel is falling apart
c25000214,s4,"After spending time in Macau, it's apparent that nothing is being built to last because there's always something newer coming"
c25000214,s5,"The rooms were large, but not well kept"
c25000214,s6,The shower leaked onto the floor (cups of water for each shower) and tiles were cracked
c25000214,s7,"Everything cost extra, including the overpriced internet at $22US/day"
c25000214,s8,"Although we didn't hear our neighbors in their rooms, we heard EVERYTHING from the hallways, all night long"
c25000214,s9,We were staggered by the volume of shopping and the size of the building
c25000214,s10,It took us about 15 minutes to get from our room to…
c25000215,s1,"Upon arriving at their hotel bus terminal, which was near the West Lobby, we had to push our luggages from the West Lobby THROUGH the casino in order to arrive at the main lobby to do the check-in"
c25000215,s2,The walk was far as the building is huge
c25000215,s3,"(They have a total of 4 lobbies: Main, North, South and West"
c25000215,s4,")  After we check-in, we had to push my luggage THROUGH the casino again in order to get to our room in the North Lobby"
c25000215,s5,We were told that WiFi is chargeable at 160HKD for every 24 hours window period
c25000215,s6,We subscribed to their WiFi in the room on the first night and we regretted
c25000215,s7,"On top of the expensive charges, the WiFi was super lousy"
c25000215,s8,Data just couldn't load to the extend that you wouldn't be able send a simple text message from your phone without the system lagging
c25000215,s9,I STRONGLY…
c25000216,s1,Just visited Venetian Macau as my Easter holiday and found myself in the middle of major renovation - not sincerely a nice and pleasant surprise
c25000216,s2,"I recommend that all who are planning to go during spring 2013 would check from hotel, if the renovation is still ongoing"
c25000216,s3,You might reconsider to stay at nearby Galaxy instead - visited there and it was magnificient!
c25000217,s1,Venetian Macau
c25000217,s2,"I stayed at this hotel is 2 times, in fact one time is enough (because bad service) but I stayed 2 times, because a family member is forced to stay at the Venetian Macau, because the hotel is so iconic, so he wanted to stay here"
c25000217,s3,"Pros: -This is ""THE"" hotel in Macau"
c25000217,s4,You've got to Macau if you have not stayed in this hotel
c25000217,s5,Very iconic for Macau
c25000217,s6,"-Oversized Room (up to 4 people in the room, I think it is still comfortable), as they have a sofa that can turn into a mattress"
c25000217,s7,"-Located in Big Complex (food court, shopping mall, casino), all needs can be obtained here"
c25000217,s8,"-They have a free shuttle bus to many places in Macau (including Ferry Terminal), maybe every 15 minutes (vice versa)"
c25000217,s9,"Cons: -No Bellboy, so I must take my heavyweight suitcase about 800m from…"
c25000218,s1,I read favourable reviews of this hotel at tripadvisor and decided to make a booking for 2 Bella Suite several days ago
c25000218,s2,I used the search engine of tripadvisor and chose agoda
c25000218,s3,com which appear to be offering a pretty good rate
c25000218,s4,"However after making the payment, I realised to my horror that the specified date is a week earlier than my scheduled date"
c25000218,s5,I tried to inform agoda
c25000218,s6,com of the mistake immediately and also tried to email to the hotel to seek their understanding of the incident and to assist me in changing the dates
c25000218,s7,Agoda informed me after 2 days and responding that the hotel refused to make any changes due to their booking policy
c25000218,s8,I sent several emails to the venetian macao resort hotel again hoping that they may consider helping me with a fee rather than forcing me to…
c25000219,s1,"When we first stepped into the room, it looks tremendously grand and luxury"
c25000219,s2,"The room size was at least 30 sqmetre with a decent size of bathroom, separate toilet, a lounge area and with two tvs ( one at the lounge and one in front of the bed)"
c25000219,s3,I was very happy about it until i smelt something disgusting when I lie on the bed
c25000219,s4,"We found out that the smell was in fact came from the hanging curtain behind/on top of the bed !! FYI,the curtain is for decoration purposes"
c25000219,s5,"Since it was already midnight , we thought it was too much trouble to make a complain to switch room"
c25000219,s6,It was absolutely a nightmare sleeping under such a smelly and dirty curtain
c25000219,s7,We bet the hotel never washed or changed the curtain for years
c25000219,s8,"If you get a room like this, request to make a switch immediately! It was…"
c25000220,s1,Went to Macau for a few nights
c25000220,s2,Stayed at venetian because they were running a buy one get one
c25000220,s3,Should have coughed up more dough and stayed at Wynn
c25000220,s4,Room is identical to Las vegas but not near as clean
c25000220,s5,"In vegas, venetian is my goto spot"
c25000220,s6,Not in Macau
c25000220,s7,Asians must be hard on the property because it is showing wear bad
c25000220,s8,"Elevator buttons are worn, Awnings are blown off the outside of building, place looks like its 15 years old"
c25000220,s9,"Mildew all over our shower, drywall patched ceiling but not repainted, cracked baseboards, ect, ect"
c25000220,s10,"Casino is nice, one of the friendliest craps staff I have ever played with, made the game very enjoyable for hours of fun"
c25000220,s11,"Asians are rude, they do not wait in line, they bulldoze into you like your not even there"
c25000220,s12,"Free shuttles from the ferry terminal,…"
c25000221,s1,I was there for a trade conference… Not the best experience
c25000221,s2,Overall the hotel as one would expect is focused on people who want to gamble or shop not for people coming there for business and yet they have huge conference facilities
c25000221,s3,a little confusing
c25000221,s4,"I have been to The Venetian Las Vegas Casino, Hotel & Resort on holidays and have absolutely had a blast but I don’t think even if I came to The Venetian Macao Resort Hotel for a holiday I would have enjoyed"
c25000221,s5,"There were quite a few things wrong with the hotel, first and foremost is the language barrier I faced"
c25000221,s6,"If you are portraying yourself as an international vacation/business destination the lease you can do is train your staff appropriately, using sign language is not what I had in mind"
c25000221,s7,Dining options were limited around…
c25000222,s1,After the experience of the Venetian I am intentionally writing my first review on trip advisor
c25000222,s2,Venetian is the worst ever hotel we have stayed at
c25000222,s3,We always spend good money and stay at high end hotels on our holidays and usually the price we pay reflects the service that we expect
c25000222,s4,After reading all the reviews on trip advisor we decided to opt for the hotel over the famous  banyan hotel
c25000222,s5,Big Mistake
c25000222,s6,The allure of staying at this concept hotel as well as the view of the room we decided to pre book and pay for two nights stay
c25000222,s7,"Firstly our flight was delayed, and we arrived in macau later than expected and we were at the hotel at 10am"
c25000222,s8,The rudeness of the woman who checked us in will not be forgotten
c25000222,s9,We were abruptly informed that our check in would be at 2pm
c25000222,s10,As we had…
c25000223,s1,I checked into The Venetian Resort in Macao on Feb 3rd
c25000223,s2,"At the check-in counter, the receptionist, Colin, checked me into with a poker face"
c25000223,s3,"He merely pulled up the reservation made by my god-daughter, received her deposit in cash, and gave her a receipt"
c25000223,s4,Nothing else was said
c25000223,s5,No directions given to help us find our way to the room in this bewilderingly huge hotel
c25000223,s6,We walked for a good 20 minutes before we found the right elevator lobby
c25000223,s7,In fact the most direct route to the right elevator lobby is to cut through the casino and the very smoky environment of the casino made this very unpleasant
c25000223,s8,The first room we were assigned to had a funny smell
c25000223,s9,We requested a change in room and this was done rather quickly
c25000223,s10,The concierge arrived within 10 minutes to help us make the change
c25000223,s11,…
c25000224,s1,"I didn’t read any TA reviews before booking here, as the conference I was attending was being held here, so it made staying here a bit of a no-brainer, but I would not stay again"
c25000224,s2,The hotel is absolutely huge – and I’ve stayed in the MGM Grand in Vegas by comparison – and just sprawls out in every direction
c25000224,s3,"The public areas are clean, immaculate presented and generally quite good"
c25000224,s4,"The rooms are furnished with materials that look good, but don’t wear well"
c25000224,s5,I had a Rialto suite because it was so cheap I wanted to experience it – but it was not great
c25000224,s6,"The fixtures and fittings just look a bit tired and, I have to say, a bit grubby (rather like the rest of Macau)"
c25000224,s7,The wifi is also in your room only and is painfully slow
c25000224,s8,I speedtested it and got 128kbps in my room
c25000224,s9,There is no…
c25000225,s1,"I came to Macau for an expo at the Venetian and decided to stay for an extra 2 nights as the trip was already a long distance and as a fan of Vegas, I thought I'd stay to either relax in luxury or party and gamble hard if the mood took me"
c25000225,s2,I am now sat here with 8 hours to go before the ferry finally takes me away from this disaster of a place
c25000225,s3,I am not a fan of the Venetian in Vegas having stayed there in 2011 but against my better judgement decided to give it a go in Macau as the expo was there and I wanted the convenience
c25000225,s4,It was obviously a mistake as the couple of other hotels I visited - Wynn and MGM had a much better vibe
c25000225,s5,"Having said this, I still think I would have not particularly enjoyed my stay at either of these hotels as Macau itself is not my cup of tea and a far…"
c25000226,s1,"We saw the good reviews for this hotel, so we didn't hesitate to book it for our macau stay"
c25000226,s2,The room was HUGE!!! Very nice and clean! I really must commend on the housekeeping
c25000226,s3,They do such a good job
c25000226,s4,It's such a huge hotel and such huge rooms but they could keep it so clean! To the smallest details
c25000226,s5,They kept the hair dryer into the drawer everytime I used it
c25000226,s6,Coiled up perfectly! I was really impressed
c25000226,s7,Now comes the bad part
c25000226,s8,"When I checked in, there was a system failure for the creating of room card keys"
c25000226,s9,I was waiting and waiting at the front desk and the receptionist was running around behind the counter
c25000226,s10,I had no idea what is happening
c25000226,s11,"So I kept asking: Is something wrong??? What's happening?? But as if he didn't hear me, or couldn't understand me, he just ignored me"
c25000226,s12,…
c25000227,s1,We arrived at the airport in the morning and went straight to the taxi rank to be told there was a Venetian shuttle bus
c25000227,s2,"We walked to the bus and the ""guide"" pointed to the luggage area and told us to put our bags there"
c25000227,s3,"No offer of help and that included elderly people, too busy talking on mobile phone"
c25000227,s4,"On arrival at hotel we were early and room wasn't ready, so we left our luggage again no smiles or welcome from staff"
c25000227,s5,We wandered round the canal area upstairs with shops which is impressive but struggled to find anywhere for a coffee
c25000227,s6,There was no one around to help
c25000227,s7,The focus is on the enormous casino on the ground floor
c25000227,s8,"When we checked in staff were friendly but just told us which wing our room was in, no offer to show us where it was or help us with our bags"
c25000227,s9,It was a long…
c25000228,s1,"May be the biggest casino in the world, but not really conducive for family use"
c25000228,s2,Or maybe just not our family
c25000228,s3,Currently at the Venetian which we chose because we've stayed in it in Las Vegas and had a nice time
c25000228,s4,In Las Vegas we enjoyed our stay from the initial check-in through to the end
c25000228,s5,But in Macau its more like hangar sized spaces and major lack of service mentality or any real hotel feel
c25000228,s6,Just a big casino
c25000228,s7,And super smoky and hard to get around at that
c25000228,s8,"From our initial arrival when, after having just got off the bumpy jet boat that finally got us here (both people in front and back of us vomiting during the trip), all we wanted was a little calmness and easy check-in, what we got was the West Lobby entry which is just a lot of big buses dropping customers off"
c25000228,s9,…
c25000229,s1,This place is just bad
c25000229,s2,It is nothing like the Venetian in Las Vegas
c25000229,s3,In fact this place is just terrible
c25000229,s4,"See my review about the casino in another review, that will help understand more about that"
c25000229,s5,"Anyway here is my review of the hotel, it's long, but informative, any questions just send me a message"
c25000229,s6,"Positives:  Rooms are big and clean, but expensive"
c25000229,s7,Beds are comfortable
c25000229,s8,"Close to the airport, about 10-15 minutes I think by hotel bus"
c25000229,s9,"There are shows that go on in the ballrooms of the hotel, to get there you need about 20-30 minutes as they are quite a long walk, and you need to pay extra to get into those things, some events are like trade shows and stuff like that"
c25000229,s10,When we were there in August there was an ice show that was actually pretty cool
c25000229,s11,Negatives:  Some…
c25000230,s1,"Massive hotel, stayed one night for the experience"
c25000230,s2,The room is a bit outdated but nice all the same
c25000230,s3,"One big disappointment is the wifi you have to pay for which is rather expensive, it barely works really slow and only works in your room and not the hotel"
c25000230,s4,Kind of annoying when you want to use your iPhone
c25000230,s5,Another huge issue is they overcharged us at checkout by $100nzd which we are currently trying to sort
c25000230,s6,Go here for the experience but don't expect anything amazing
c25000231,s1,There is a huge variety of Hotel options available these days in Macau and in particular the Cotai area that was once dominated by the massive footprint of The Venetian
c25000231,s2,"Although we have loved The Venetian over time - for it's original Cirque de Soleil show that is no more, the occasional event such as the UFC in the Cotai Arena and the Shopping Cannel - the time has come that we'd really recommend that you consider the alternatives when it comes to retiring for the evening"
c25000231,s3,"Some PROS: The Room Service, although pricey even for a 5 star venue, was good quality and delivered quickly"
c25000231,s4,But then for the price - shouldn't it be? The Suite was very spacious with a king size bed and a step down lounge area
c25000231,s5,That's kinda it
c25000231,s6,Nothing terribly special or cool or luxurious
c25000231,s7,CONS On…
c25000232,s1,This was my fifth stay at the Venetian over the past four years
c25000232,s2,What use to be one of my favorite hotels around the world has slipped way down my list
c25000232,s3,I booked a non smoking room and was overpowered by the smell of smoke as I walked into my room
c25000232,s4,"Located in an ashtray, I noticed a small card that said the room was designated a non smoking room next to a couch had a rather large cigarette burn in the arm"
c25000232,s5,They obviously do not discourage smoking in no smoking rooms
c25000232,s6,I tried to stay in the room as it is quite a long walk to the check in area
c25000232,s7,"However, when I went to bed the pillows were filled with the smell of stale smoke"
c25000232,s8,"So I had to get up, pack up my bags and walk all the way back to the check in area"
c25000232,s9,"When I informed the desk of the problem, they reacted like this happens…"
c25000233,s1,I booked a titanic package during my stay last November
c25000233,s2,The package was good
c25000233,s3,You will get Bella Suite (Double Queen Bed Room + Sofa Bed) + 2 persons BF / Lunch + Free 1 photo + 2 tickets to the Titanic Exhibition + 1 way Cotai Jet ticket (Macau to HK)
c25000233,s4,The room was splendidly good
c25000233,s5,It has a certain class
c25000233,s6,It's the type of room that you will go scream as long as you arrive at the hotel
c25000233,s7,"The bathroom was very spacious, the amenities were great, all were fantastic"
c25000233,s8,"Nevertheless, I have to write some of my disappointing experiences while I stayed there:  1"
c25000233,s9,I took a free shuttle bus from the port to Venetian Hotel
c25000233,s10,They didn't arrive at the lobby as most of the hotel guests were expected
c25000233,s11,No porters are available to help out with our luggage
c25000233,s12,My grand mother and I arrived with…
c25000234,s1,Stayed here for 3 nights in November
c25000234,s2,"I've stayed at the Venetian in Las Vegas, so I was expecting the same quality"
c25000234,s3,"However, the hotel is not well built"
c25000234,s4,"The rooms look nearly identical to the ones in Las Vegas, but the marble tiling in the bathroom is uneven, and there are weird odors in the hallways"
c25000234,s5,It seems the Chinese tourists have a bad habit of keeping their hotel room doors open whenever they're in their rooms
c25000234,s6,so the hallways tend to be a bit noisy and smelly
c25000234,s7,walking by room after room of Chinese people hooting and hollering while they gamble in their own rooms
c25000234,s8,not classy
c25000234,s9,The casino is disappointing
c25000234,s10,"the rules are very different from Las Vegas, and the concept of personal space is lost because the Chinese gamblers crowd over you at the tables"
c25000234,s11,The…
c25000235,s1,"Four of us occupied 3 rooms at this hotel On 11/4-7, 2012"
c25000235,s2,We have stayed in the Veneitian Hotel in Las Vegas many times
c25000235,s3,"This one in Macau is no match with the one in Las Vegas, except the front desk check-in services that was wonderful and the only bright spot"
c25000235,s4,1
c25000235,s5,"There were too many gamblers - the noise was worse than a night market, unbearable! 2"
c25000235,s6,There were hookers openly soliciting in the casino 3
c25000235,s7,Guests from China were smoking in the hotel hallways and elevators 4
c25000235,s8,The services at two casino restaurants were pretty bad 5
c25000235,s9,"I witnessed two Chinese gamblers who were about to fight, the securitys responded but so poorly handled the situation - the securitys kept on asking bother guys why they were to fight that drew a good crowd"
c25000235,s10,6
c25000235,s11,After we came back home and discovered…
c25000236,s1,I have stayed in many top hotels in Macau and Venetian rank way below on the chart
c25000236,s2,"Rooms are of a generoussize however showing signs of ageing everywhere! Paints falling off, carpet feels old, stains on walls, in room leaflets and books are creased"
c25000236,s3,When we return to the room it felt like returning to an ordinary home without being tidied/cleaned for days
c25000236,s4,Lighting was dim
c25000236,s5,Bed was big and comfortable
c25000236,s6,"The hotel is too big to my liking, service was not personal, walking from point A to point B easily takes 10 - 15 minutes at least"
c25000236,s7,The glam and glorious decor was illusional as when you look closer you can spot the cheaper finishes
c25000236,s8,"Staff were polite enough but no warmth to be felt, no sincere welcoming and feel like you are to be get rid of asap"
c25000236,s9,This is a good…
c25000237,s1,Its terrible
c25000237,s2,you are living inside china casino full of chinese peasants from all faraway villages
c25000237,s3,"Everything is dirty and uncomfortable, restaraunts are extremely untasty"
c25000237,s4,Tons of prostitudes around and inside the lobby
c25000238,s1,Don't get me wrong
c25000238,s2,The Venetian is beutiful
c25000238,s3,The architecture and construction is second to none and really worth seeing
c25000238,s4,The rooms are all suites and are huge and quality built
c25000238,s5,The staff was a mixed bag
c25000238,s6,ALL Filipino staff were amazing
c25000238,s7,"ALL of them smiled, said hello, and did their jobs great"
c25000238,s8,"The Chinese staff did their jobs fine, but obviously struggled to say hello, smile, and go out of their way to be extra helpful"
c25000238,s9,"I see it as a cultural thing, but it was noticeable"
c25000238,s10,"The food in the hotel was good, but priced on the high side of course"
c25000238,s11,"I really wish there was a convenience store to get basic items, but I understand why there is not"
c25000238,s12,$$$$$$$$ I finaly found a 7-11 and a grocery store about 15 mins walk away in Taipa
c25000238,s13,(See my travel tip below for directions)  The…
c25000239,s1,Stayed for 4 days at the hotel in the Bella Suite
c25000239,s2,"Suite was large and spacious, well furnished and comfortable"
c25000239,s3,"Toilet was equipped with seemingly luxurious fittings but I was disappointed to find that the shower head was of poor quality, the water jet was too strong and not adjustable and made a clanging sound when turned on"
c25000239,s4,Towels were coarse and toiletries provided did not live up to expectation
c25000239,s5,"The bed was comfortable but pillows were terrible, with hardly any filling"
c25000239,s6,There was little head support even with 2 pillows and I woke up with a neck ache
c25000239,s7,The 'snaking' Check in queue was a nightmare and it took us almost an hour to check in
c25000239,s8,"To avoid the long queue on check out, we opted for the express check out, which was a breeze"
c25000239,s9,It was a convenient hotel as shops and…
c25000240,s1,"Booked a 4 night stay, the first impression was a bad one for checking in, not personalized just felt part of the maddening crowd, this continued throughout our stay, lots of queuing, difficult to get service without a thankou"
c25000240,s2,We will never return to the Venetian
c25000241,s1,We stayed with our friends in the hotel from 13 - 15 aug 2012
c25000241,s2,"Got few free coupons to use in some restaurants in the hotel itself , which of course saves on food but very bad experience the dimsum rest"
c25000241,s3,"We went to , most of the food they said sold out at 10 pm which was kind of odd for a place like Venetian"
c25000242,s1,I have never felt so unsafe during a hotel stay
c25000242,s2,It felt like the staff was free to go in and out of the rooms as they pleased
c25000242,s3,The first night someone had come into the bathroom to smoke as they left ashes all over the floor
c25000242,s4,Our bags had all been opened and searched
c25000242,s5,We called customer care to complain and for clean up and expected things to be better
c25000242,s6,"The next day we were out, someone left a bag in our room"
c25000242,s7,We called the front desk to have the bag removed
c25000242,s8,No apology or explanation was issued
c25000242,s9,This was completely unexpected and unacceptable for a 5-star hotel
c25000243,s1,The property is good - concept is good but overcrowded
c25000243,s2,"Food is pathetic , long queue at the reception to get in !Room service is pathetic"
c25000243,s3,No value for money at all ! We spent 2 nights and were waiting to get off !
c25000244,s1,"Before calling a 1-800 number, we looked everywhere for the price list for using the hotel in-room phone"
c25000244,s2,Found no information at all
c25000244,s3,Made the call
c25000244,s4,"Put on hold for 45 minutes with United Airlines, but at least got the United info we needed"
c25000244,s5,"Upon check out, we were told for the first time that we owed $300 US for use of the hotel phone for a 50 minute call"
c25000244,s6,Complained
c25000244,s7,"""Too bad"
c25000244,s8,"""  Won't stay there again"
c25000245,s1,It was Ok! To be honest at the check-in counter they said I booked the Bella Suite when I booked the Verona Suite
c25000245,s2,"They made me pay more! When I was sleeping a couple was fighting, screaming and banging on doors"
c25000245,s3,In the lift people where smoking
c25000245,s4,The cleaners were not good
c25000245,s5,My TV was dusty! I would not come back to the hotel and next I will try the new Conrad hotel!
c25000246,s1,"Having stayed at the Venetian in Las Vegas, I expected Venetian macau to be just as dazzling"
c25000246,s2,"and while all the features like the gondola ride , the large suites,the huge casino ( largest hotel casino floor in the world) and numeroues food stops are there"
c25000246,s3,this hotel is franklya bit jaded
c25000246,s4,Its too large and takes forever for to get from 1 spot to another
c25000246,s5,"The service also requests 40 mins for any room delivery, even for a babay's meal and its far too crowded and loud"
c25000246,s6,"The rooms though big, just are a bit outdated and boring"
c25000246,s7,"This hotel works on large volumes so offers many great deals, the discerning traveler will definitely be disappointed"
c25000246,s8,"Give this a miss, much better options nearby in macau"
c25000246,s9,"even though I won pot loads of money here, I won't be stayng here again"
c25000247,s1,I hated this hotel
c25000247,s2,Its like a major tourist attraction here and everyone wants to stay here
c25000247,s3,The rooms are good and spacious but terrible room service
c25000247,s4,The rooms are not very clean
c25000247,s5,The worst part is that it has a common lobby with the shopping arcade and you have hundreds of people around as soon as you come down
c25000247,s6,"The hotel is huge, at times it becomes difficult to find you way to your room and the hotel staff also does not guide you properly and is rude"
c25000247,s7,I wanted to make an international call from my room
c25000247,s8,the operator asked me to go to the reception first and pay a deposit
c25000247,s9,Its like you are living in a shady 2 star hotel where you are afraid of the guests leaving without paying you
c25000247,s10,its so stupid
c25000247,s11,Room service is very bad
c25000247,s12,takes about half an hour to get water which is…
c25000248,s1,"My friends and I stayed on April 20-22, 2012, total 5 rooms check-in together"
c25000248,s2,"Upon check-in, the receptionist didn't mention who she registered for which room number, so we just pass all these room keys around"
c25000248,s3,"At the 1st night, two of my friends been locked out twice due to the key card system was out of order"
c25000248,s4,"When my friend call the hotel, they just told him the room didn't register under his name"
c25000248,s5,"My friend spent time to explained to the hotel staff, but when we call the 2nd time they kept saying the same thing to us"
c25000248,s6,"Next day, there’re two strangers break into one of the rooms due to the housekeeper didn’t close the door when he left the room to pick up the stuff from pantry"
c25000248,s7,"The last day, same friends been locked out again"
c25000248,s8,Even though so many accidents happened…
c25000249,s1,Stayed at Bella Suite for 2 nights
c25000249,s2,"The hotel rooms was great, big & spacious"
c25000249,s3,"Since it's our first coming to macau, we shock seeing that the hotel situation is so croud, many tour leader cross by with about 30 people member"
c25000249,s4,The situation is like night bazaar
c25000249,s5,"We also try the casino, but unfortunately most if the slot machine in chineese"
c25000249,s6,We don't understand! The first day we having trouble with the the one & only Macau prepaid mobile phone booth inside the hotel
c25000249,s7,The seller is wearing nice suit but very arogan & rude
c25000249,s8,"Even after we buy the prepaid card, he didn't want to explain how to use the card (instruction in Chineese that we can't read)"
c25000249,s9,Luckily we ask the concierge at the front and explain to us about the card
c25000249,s10,good job Concierge! We already report to the manager on…
c25000250,s1,Chose to book this hotel for the second time
c25000250,s2,This time my son of age 21 accompanied me
c25000250,s3,"But, there would certainly be no third time in this hotel for me and my family"
c25000250,s4,Few very annoying instances: 1
c25000250,s5,"Very much crowded, as visitors from outside the hotel in big groups keep on flooding in as though it is a sightseeing place!"
c25000250,s6,2
c25000250,s7,Check-in personals/officers are least welcoming and act very much indifferent
c25000250,s8,3
c25000250,s9,No escort to see you to your room after check-in
c25000250,s10,"This hotel being quiet big in size, you may very easily tend to get confused"
c25000250,s11,4
c25000250,s12,Rooms are very much distant from the lobby as well as lift
c25000250,s13,Be prepared to walk a lot! 5
c25000250,s14,"No complimentary WiFi provided by this hotel, whereas all nearby hotels (some even cheaper than his one) offer this service free"
c25000250,s15,6
c25000250,s16,Be prepared to serve…
c25000251,s1,Traveled with extended family and booked 6 rooms for an overnight stay at Venetian Macao
c25000251,s2,Checking in took a while
c25000251,s3,We were given rooms in different floors and different wings (North and South) to our dismay
c25000251,s4,The front desk clerk said they were very busy and there was no way to remedy the situation
c25000251,s5,The hotel was enormous and we had to walk a distance from the West Lobby to the rooms
c25000251,s6,I had to go back for the maps as he forgot to hand them to me
c25000251,s7,The hotel lobby was packed and people were everywhere
c25000251,s8,It's like being in a classy market
c25000251,s9,chaotic is the best way to describe it
c25000251,s10,Air smelled like smoke in most places
c25000251,s11,The rooms are huge and nice with a seating area and huge bathroom
c25000251,s12,They were clean
c25000251,s13,Noise from the hallways can be heard in the rooms so I woke up several times…
c25000252,s1,"The property maybe identical to the one in Vegas, but there is a great deal of differnce in the service"
c25000252,s2,"The room service is very poor, you may have to call a minimum of 3-4 times for one order"
c25000252,s3,Housekeeping is no different
c25000252,s4,The casino service for drinks is not so great
c25000252,s5,"The rooms are the same & so are the facilities compared to Vegas, nonetheless, I would rather try another newer property called Galaxy in Macao the next time i visit"
c25000252,s6,I have already tried Venetian Macao twice in the last 2 years
c25000252,s7,We were 4 friends in one suite & they would give us limited amount of water (6 mini bottles) & limited amount of towels
c25000252,s8,The verona suite with terrace was ideal for our kind of group
c25000253,s1,Worst hotel experience I've ever had from check-in to check-out
c25000253,s2,"Bottom line is there are too many people here, and the management and staff are unable to accommodate the needs of the individual traveler"
c25000253,s3,This is an assembly line factory experience
c25000253,s4,From check in you are forced to check in your bags first then stand in line at another check in counter
c25000253,s5,Staff is rude and the rooms are just ok
c25000253,s6,The smell of smoke is everywhere
c25000253,s7,"The water and plumbing in the rooms is poor IE lukewarm water , weak pressure, etc"
c25000253,s8,"The bedsheets smelled like the previous occupant, and the breakfast was absolutely awful"
c25000253,s9,The hotel caters to mainland Chinese gamblers and could care less about family travelers
c25000253,s10,Crowds of people swarm the lobby
c25000253,s11,There were even groups of huddled people sitting on…
c25000254,s1,"Booked in for one night during chinese new year, if you are after somewhere overcrowded with bus loads of chinese tourists that blow 2nd hand cigerattes to your face - this is the place you are after"
c25000254,s2,Plus they randomly charge your credit card without any consent
c25000254,s3,"Initially enquired room rate directly via their poorly designed website, after filling in all details they put extra charges on top, so did not proceed with them but book via another online hotel booking service provider, The hotel sales team sent another email stating all rates have to be PRE-PAID prior in order to gurantee a room"
c25000254,s4,"Since I booked with someone else, I ignored the email"
c25000254,s5,"Upon check-in, I provided the front desk a confirmation issused by the online hotel booking service provider"
c25000254,s6,Front desk lady asked…
c25000255,s1,I visit Macau once a year and stay in different hotel each time
c25000255,s2,I won't recommend anyone to stay here
c25000255,s3,"At reservation stage, their information are really helpful and handle e-mails in timely manner"
c25000255,s4,"When I arrived at 11am (arrival time has been sent at reservation stage), an unexpected unwelcoming gesture was delivered but the female staff who handled the line up queue"
c25000255,s5,"There were lots of Mainland Chinese checking out, that lady without any smile and told me rudely ""NOW IS ONLY 11AM, SHOULD RETURN AT LEAST  2PM!""  She didn't attempt to offer luggage storage assistance or at least ask for name and check my reservation status"
c25000255,s6,I am sure you will miss your VIP if you continuous attitude like that
c25000255,s7,I went to Concierge inquired for on-hire car and another female staff gave me an…
c25000256,s1,This was our second time here - the first being several years ago when it first opened
c25000256,s2,We had issues with the hotel then but blamed it on teething problems and decided to give a second try staying over new years Dec 29th- Jan 1st
c25000256,s3,During our first trip the staff were not well trained nor helpful and also had some security issues
c25000256,s4,Overall things have gotten worse particularly the service particularly on the service front
c25000256,s5,The check-in was longer than expected but tolerable - the English of the check-in staff was poor and also took longer than it should have
c25000256,s6,The suites like the first time around were spacious and comfortable for the most part
c25000256,s7,As others have mentioned the smoking in the hotel has taken it's toll throughout and we did notice it but was tolerable at most…
c25000257,s1,"If you love staying in a place where every inch is infiltrated by the stench of cheap, Chinese cigarettes then you shouldn't miss the Venetian hotel"
c25000257,s2,Even though it is only a few years old everything about the place is looking tired and nicotine stained although the hoards of buses arriving from China keep the whole place permanently packed so I imagine it would be hard to keep-up the necessary maintenance
c25000257,s3,We had a non-smoking room on a (supposedly) non-smoking floor and yet everything stank of stale smoke and the air quality was awful
c25000257,s4,It was a relief to leave the hotel and casino complex to try and escape the stench
c25000257,s5,The shopping mall section was not as bad and neither was the theatre
c25000257,s6,"Comparatively, the City of Dreams complex across the street and the Four Seasons next…"
c25000258,s1,The room is so worn out
c25000258,s2,"I could see a black hand print on the door, walls are very dirty"
c25000258,s3,You will have flood in the bathroom after shower
c25000258,s4,"I asked for a non smoking room but the room was very smelly, thanks to those low class travellers never follow the smoking rule"
c25000258,s5,", sadly the whole hotel was full of those people, they would smoke anywhere, at the non smoking floor, lift lobby, at the main lobby, at the taxi stand"
c25000258,s6,"Only two bottles of 300ml water were provided in the room, no shaver, only one set of dental kit in the bathroom"
c25000258,s7,"The window overlooking 1000 AC units, i could hear them working perfectly well all night long"
c25000258,s8,"Don't talk about service, didn't even bother to provide turn down service"
c25000258,s9,In the morning I could hear people shouting outside of our door and it was…
c25000259,s1,The following occured on my trip which to me is quite a bad experiance ! for a 5 star hotel
c25000259,s2,On check in we had to first wait approx 20 min in the west lobby and checkin was rushed
c25000259,s3,We made our way to our room and since it was quite late 11pm and we had woken up at 7am in Sydney we were extreamly tiered
c25000259,s4,"I noticed that the room was very dirty Window had all finger marks, Tv in lounge room had finger marks with dirty food all on the screen"
c25000259,s5,I found a Red hair in my bed which is not mine since i have brown hair ! i checked the rest of the bed and removed the hair with gloves i had and went to sleep
c25000259,s6,The next morning I woke and was going to have a shower when i hopped in It was cold water i waited about 5 min and the water was still cold :( I had a meeting in the morning and was…
c25000260,s1,Too huge
c25000260,s2,Not suitable for family with children
c25000260,s3,Poor direction from main lobby to west lobby
c25000260,s4,Children are not allow to go through ground level and have to go to level 3 and going down again to ground floor
c25000260,s5,Not a friendly hotel
c25000260,s6,Too crowded and noisy lobby
c25000260,s7,I have a bad experience and will never stay again
c25000261,s1,Let me be straight
c25000261,s2,If you are looking only for gambling in a surrounding in a lot of noise
c25000261,s3,It will be your place
c25000261,s4,"But if you exspect more than that, stay away as far as you can"
c25000261,s5,The shows are great technical deals but most of the performances of the artist lacks the glamour of the great artistic
c25000261,s6,Cirque du Soleil on a low artistic level in a country where everybody exspects specially high performances
c25000261,s7,We also exspected that the restaurants opened late night
c25000261,s8,But the 24h dining only offered food I would nout eat for free
c25000261,s9,And do not try the beakfast
c25000261,s10,"You will get one piece of toast cut in half and a very, very small croissaint with two eggs a litte bit of marmelade and honey and butter for ""only"" 30 USD"
c25000261,s11,"When I (190m tall and 101KG) ordered more bread, they told me that this…"
c25000262,s1,This hotel is too big and you get lost very easily as there are too many entrances
c25000262,s2,It took me around and being pointed in different direction to locate the lobby of the hotel
c25000262,s3,Once I got to the lobby the staff in the front desk were rude and acted like he don't want to be there
c25000262,s4,We ask for a non-smoking room and were given a smoking room and were told there is nothing they could do
c25000262,s5,So we were stuck in a smoking room but luckily we were there just for 1 night
c25000262,s6,The so call suite is nice but room looks old and worn out and seems like a renovation is needed
c25000262,s7,One good thing is the bed is extremely comfortable and big
c25000262,s8,"Other than that, I would not stay here again"
c25000263,s1,Third stay in the hotel and pleased to report they are consistent
c25000263,s2,consistent in becoming average
c25000263,s3,Seems as though those profits are not being reinvested in maintaing the same standards as when they first opened
c25000263,s4,Customer service is on the decline and minimum bets are on the way up!  One thing that hasn't changed is the croupier service which is still verging on angry if you win and agnostic if you loose
c25000263,s5,This will be our last stay
c25000264,s1,We stayed for a night in Venetian last weekend
c25000264,s2,"i had high hopes from this hotel, but were so very disappointed"
c25000264,s3,"depite being so popular globally, it was like any regular chinese hotel"
c25000264,s4,no international feel
c25000264,s5,its so big & vast that you tend to get lost
c25000264,s6,its like a railway station (in India or China)
c25000264,s7,crowded & a feel of chaos
c25000264,s8,rooms are big but one has to really look for a plug point if you need to recharge your camera or phone
c25000264,s9,breakfast & meals were ok
c25000264,s10,"worst thing, we got rooms only after 4"
c25000264,s11,"30 pm, though normal check in time is 3 pm"
c25000264,s12,the staff just kept blaming the travel agent without realising that we were now the guests of the hotel & have to be treated like a guest
c25000265,s1,We stayed for 3 nights at Venetian
c25000265,s2,"Usually we stsy at Wynn/Encore, but wanted to have a new experience"
c25000265,s3,"Unfortunately, we had"
c25000265,s4,This is huge world of tourists like a ralway station 24 hours
c25000265,s5,"The disgusting smoke smell everywhere, the service was terrible in front desk, restaurants, consierge desk"
c25000265,s6,"For example, Mrs Keira, consierge staff, spent 40 minutes to sell me ferry tickets (!!!), with mistakes (!!!)"
c25000265,s7,It was at West lobby with a lot of crazy noisy tour groups
c25000265,s8,"Finally, no smiles or pleasure"
c25000265,s9,Avoid this property
c25000266,s1,the brothel
c25000266,s2,I don't even know where to start with this place
c25000266,s3,1
c25000266,s4,The place is crowded and loud
c25000266,s5,There are tour groups everywhere and extremely rude tourists
c25000266,s6,One actually got into an argument with a family member and had to be settled by management
c25000266,s7,I felt like I was in a marketplace with tons of people and their noise
c25000266,s8,2
c25000266,s9,The smell of smoke is so acrid
c25000266,s10,"Walking in the front door, you could already smell the smoke"
c25000266,s11,We visited other properties and none had this problem
c25000266,s12,Probably could be attributed to the large size
c25000266,s13,3
c25000266,s14,The rooms are old and they show the poor workmanship
c25000266,s15,There were chipped counters and paint
c25000266,s16,There was also 'repairs' that were so visible it was almost laughable
c25000266,s17,4
c25000266,s18,The housekeeping is very annoying
c25000266,s19,"On the day of checkout, they were standing out in…"
c25000267,s1,"The Moment me and my family entered the Lobby, We felt like we have came to a fish market"
c25000267,s2,"There were long queue for the check IN, People standing with truck loads of there luggage"
c25000267,s3,"After waiting for an hour in the queue and thereafter a 20 minute tussle with the receptionist, we finally got a room and were told that we shall be getting the rest of the three rooms after 2 hours (i"
c25000267,s4,e
c25000267,s5,4PM)
c25000267,s6,"I must agree the suites were awesome and were decorated, Just a small problem that there were no locks at the bathroom and the toilet"
c25000267,s7,"The room cards(keys) were troubling us too much and for getting new keys, we almost had to stand in the long queue at the reception"
c25000267,s8,The casino was almost dead with more than half of the casino not operational and with the rest of the casino was in low…
c25000268,s1,"We stayed at the Royal suites, for 1 night"
c25000268,s2,"Firstly,"
c25000268,s3,if you are an Indian and would like to have a feel of Macau - DONT STAY HERE! As this is more of a Mumbai housing board colony with dense Indian population
c25000268,s4,Every second room taken was by an Indian
c25000268,s5,The check-in process is toooooo lengthy and It took like 30 mins to get to the check-in desk and baggage counter
c25000268,s6,"Reminds of you tirupati darshan!  The place is toooooo crowded from the lobby, to the casino aisles, the swimming pool, the Canal Shopping area"
c25000268,s7,"every place is so populated, that u may just get lost! Though the shuttle service to the ferry areas and airport is too good"
c25000268,s8,I guess Venetian has more buses than the local public transport service
c25000268,s9,"For the price we paid (about 1800HK$++), We could have stayed at much…"
c25000269,s1,My husband and young child travelled to the Venetian over Easter and were not impressed
c25000269,s2,"Firstly when booking our accommodation we received complementary ferry tickets to get over to Macao and were told by the hotel that we couldn't prebook tickets and just to arrive at the HK ferry terminal to collect the tickets on the day/time we wanted to travel, big mistake we actually couldn't get on any of ferry for 4 hours!  Once we arrived the hotel was so busy we had to carry our own bags to our hotel suite, given we booked one of the more expensive suites we were far from impressed"
c25000269,s3,"When arriving in our room it took housekeeping 5 hours to provide a baby cot, something which we had pre ordered 2 weeks prior when booking our accommodation"
c25000269,s4,Also when ringing housekeeping to replace 3…
c25000270,s1,Just arrived back in Melbourne today after a stay in room 10-064 on the evening of 8 Jan
c25000270,s2,"I was compelled to hit Trip Advisor after such a frustratingly poor experience however, give them credit this is the first hotel I have stayed at where I was robbed by management"
c25000270,s3,"We caught the Coatijet to Macau then the hotel shuttle bus where we had to stand on the bus whilst staff were seated, when disembarking the bus we were herded like cattle to the reception, we were then trampled over by four men I presume high rollers or wannabe’s in a hurry to hit the casino, there was no control of the reception check in at all, the lady on patrol just watched it happen"
c25000270,s4,"When checking  in our room key was inserted into an express check out folder, and we filled in as requested the mini bar…"
