c80132,s2,We inquired as soon as we arrived about the possibility of an upgrade and were given a signature pool suite for just 500 MOP more,,,,,
c80132,s3,"It was great and the only quibble was that the pool temperature was 27 degrees, which was cooler than ideal, for us anyway",,,,,
c80132,s4,After a big lunch at Antonio in Old Taipa we didn't need much dinner so snacked upstairs in the bar,,,,,
c80132,s5,The spa was fantastic and the service throughout our stay was impeccable,,,,,
c80132,s6,"The breakfast the next day was excellent and the staff were very well marshalled, which was not the case at the Conrad's breakfast place!",,,,,

c80134,s9,"The smells, the sounds, the grand high ceilings and gorgeous decor, all meld_",,,,,
c80135,s1,This is our second visit to Banyan Tree Macau,,,,,
c80135,s2,During the interval we have had the opportunity to try other hotels in Taipa but somehow they all lack the charisma when put alongside Banyan Tree,,,,,
c80135,s3,"Even though we arrived a couple of hours before check-in time, the lady at the reception tried her best to see if they had any room available",,,,,
c80135,s4,No such luck as the hotel was fully booked the night before,,,,,
c80135,s5,"It wasn't hard to see why!  Everyone at the reception is multi-lingual and well trained, or may be even more polished than the ones we encountered on our last visit",,,,,
c80135,s6,"Refinement comes with maturity, I suppose",,,,,
c80135,s7,"The hotel is nice and quiet compared to the adjacent ones, with no tourist groups around",,,,,

c80136,s4,"So relaxing in our two bedroom villa, having our own pool and spa area are magnificent",,,,,
c80136,s5,"Breakfast is included in our package, however, I have higher expectations than that",,,,,
c80136,s6,"When you think of there are all these yummy restaurants in Macau competing, I think Banyan can definitely work on it to improve",,,,,
c80136,s7,"Will I go back?  For sure, next time when I need a retreat, definitely first place I think of",,,,,
c80136,s8,"Also interested in other Banyan tree resorts in other cities too, see you in the near future",,,,,

c80139,s1,My most enjoyable stay at the villa,,,,,

c80140,s1,This luxurious Hotel has amenities which are not found everywhere--- for instance,,,,,
c80140,s2,"a pool in your room??!  The Spa services are also quite unique-- and almost ""over the top""!!-- but its NOT a complaint!!  The emphasis on pools is almost a fantasy-- such as the relaxation pool-- or wooden bathtubs, a steam room and Jacuzzi",,,,,
c80140,s3,"The staff are very well trained, ""professional"" and seem motivated to provide the best assistance and service possible!!  The food is well prepared, very attractively presented as well as ""Yummy""!!  Being located in the ""Galaxy Complex"" also provides plenty of choices for entertainment, eating and shopping",,,,,

c80142,s2,"Friendly greeting, great breakfast, the room is spacious and gorgeous",,,,,
c80142,s3,"I only have one little problem, the pool in the room will running until it is full (i guess is feng shui thing) which at beginning might be a little noisy if you want a quiet moment",,,,,
c80142,s4,Another thing is this beautiful pool is not warm enough,,,,,
c80142,s5,(the waiter kept told us the temperature cant go high) that means if you stay inside a little longer than gets cold,,,,,

c80227,s2,Very relaxed atmosphere and the view is tops,,,,,
c80227,s3,Really a great deal when visiting Macau,,,,,
c80228,s1,A fantastic hotel and well worth the room rate,,,,,
c80228,s2,"Everything is designed for a most relaxing stay, the check in is quick and friendly, and the room is one the finest if not the finest in Macau with separate lounge, bedroom and bathroom complete with hot tub and cute pool all fitted out magnificently",,,,,
c80228,s3,The wi-fi works well  and the star attraction is access to the out door wave pool and gardens which are beautiful laid out,,,,,
c80228,s4,Also the lazer light show in the evening is great sitting by the pool or from Cabana restaurant and which makes for a wonderful evening,,,,,
c80229,s1,It was a surprise weekend away for my birthday and it was perfect! We were on level 25 (signature pool suite) the rooms are quiet large - where I feel we need to find friends & have a massive dinner party :) We were not bothered by others & even felt we were here on our own! The place is amazing but is a little pricey,,,,,
c80229,s2,Totally distressed from HK everyday living in a 3 day surprised weekend away!,,,,,
c80230,s1,"Set within the Galaxy Hotel and Casino complex, the Banyan Tree Hotel is quiet, with beautiful rooms (all suites, in room pool, multiple reclining spaces, soaking tub and double showers) and outstanding solicitous service",,,,,
c80230,s2,Everyone went out of their way to be helpful,,,,,
c80230,s3,The spa is beautiful as well as are the three pools including a wave pool attached to a sandy beach (artificial),,,,,
c80231,s1,In Cotai (which is not the center of Macau) but still in a very nice complex : Galaxy,,,,,
c80231,s2,"The feel is the same as in every banyan tree : zen attitude, nice smell and good service",,,,,

c80231,s4,Nice check in staff,,,,,
c80231,s5,"Breakfast was very disappointing (looked like a lunch, service was not great, did not look like a 5 stars hotel breakfast)",,,,,
c80231,s6,We only stayed there for a night to see what Macau was alike and it was a good experience,,,,,
c80232,s1,My family and I spend 4 incredible days at the Banyan Tree Macau,,,,,
c80232,s2,"The hotel is amazing; rooms are the best we ever experienced, they are huge with even a relaxation pool and a wooden bathtub that can accommodate 2 persons",,,,,

c80233,s1,Spend one night at the Banyan Tree hotel and have to admit I was very impress,,,,,
c80233,s2,"The rooms are very spacious and comfortable, like you do not want to leave the room",,,,,
c80233,s3,"Everything have been well think of, to ensure your comfort and that is very appreciable",,,,,
c80233,s4,The smell in the lobby (ginger and lemongrass) is welcoming you smoothly and put you in a great and relaxing mood right away,,,,,
c80233,s5,"Only the elevator sound (to notify you which one is arriving) is very irritating, as I stayed in the lobby 5 minutes and it ""bip"" every 10 seconds",,,,,
c80233,s6,"Nonetheless, this is a fantastic hotel with perfect rooms",,,,,
c80233,s7,I will definitely go back as soon as I can,,,,,
c80234,s1,"Upon the request of friends I stayed at Cotai Pool Suite, Banyan Tree Macau for the second time",,,,,
c80234,s2,The accommodation of this type of room was normally huge with all required facilities except there was a relaxation pool of roughly 5 x 1 metres by the window(it was said that the maintenance of the pool was incorporating the latest UV purification and technology and the pool water was kept at a constant temperature of 27degees),,,,,
c80234,s3,In the bathroom there was a huge wooden bathtub good for two or more persons; and further the shower room could accommodate two persons at the same time,,,,,
c80234,s4,In my opinion this type of room was most suitable for family with young children and couple on holiday or for relaxation,,,,,
c80235,s1,Banyan tree group is always my priority for family holidays,,,,,
c80235,s2,This Macau one next lets me down either,,,,,

c80236,s4,"It felt like we were really, truly at home, and that is not something I get to say about every hotel",,,,,
c80236,s5,"Lhoy was absolutely exceptional in his house keeping services-- he not only made sure all of our requests were met, but also went the extra mile by noticing our personal preferences and made sure they were met without even asking us about it",,,,,
c80236,s6,This hotel as a whole is simply heavenly,,,,,

c80238,s3,"Since we checked in to Banyan Tree last night, my husband told me 3 times that we have to stay here in future although paying more!  Although the hotel opened for years, it maintained quite well, decent and clean",,,,,

c80239,s9,I might visit her again sometime when arriving Macau,,,,,
c80240,s1,My family is in awe of our experience in Banyan Tree Macau,,,,,
c80240,s2,Firstly is the friendliness and courteousness displayed by Ms,,,,,

c80241,s2,"We would go back to Macau just to stay here, its that good",,,,,
c80241,s3,So many things about this place are excellent that it is easier to say just book it and experience it for yourself - the only bad thing from our stay was that we couldn't stay longer,,,,,

c80242,s2,"The room is wonderful, very comfortable for a family of four with 2 king beds",,,,,

c80245,s4,They took our bags and informed us that they'd be ready and waiting in our room,,,,,
c80245,s5,Our room became available just after 3pm and so up we went,,,,,

c80245,s7,Was,,,,,
c80245,s8,"Spectacular! We both agreed that it was the finest room we've ever stayed in!

c80245,s9,It was perfect,,,,,
c80245,s10,"However, as I was walking round the room,_",,,,,
c80246,s1,I would like to thank Banyan Tree Macau for another great experience I had with my family,,,,,

c80248,s3,"The bed was cozy and the whole hotel smelled just like ur were in Thailand, very relaxing",,,,,
c80248,s4,The high light was there were at least 3 places in the room where beside window you could lay down and enjoy the nice view while hving some drinks,,,,,

c80249,s3,"The Grand Resort Deck was everything we expected and more, best of all after the craziness of the slides, the wave pool, the lazy river, you can retreat to the Banyan Tree pool that guests from the other hotels can't access, and I thought it was the best pool in Macau easily",,,,,
c80249,s4,"Food-wise the breakfast is sufficient though not among the best I have had, but that's nitpicking",,,,,
c80249,s5,Food is not a problem as you're in a sprawling Galaxy complex and right next to another one (Venetian-Parisian) if you want to look for more food,,,,,

c80258,s3,5 meters long 'relaxation pool',,,,,
c80258,s4,"OK, it's not exactly a pool where you swim in, but it's quite inviting",,,,,
c80258,s5,"The good: - The room, very spacious and tranquil - Service: check in was a breeze - Free minibars - Gym  What can be improved: - Breakfast buffet seems to be highly Chinese skewed",,,,,
c80258,s6,"I was looking for a continental breakfast but all I could find was congee, dim sum, and noodles",,,,,
c80259,s1,"One of the hotels in galaxy resort complex, there's free shuttle connecting Macau outer/ taipa ferry pier",,,,,
c80259,s2,The banyan tree pool  is for banyan tree guests only and you can also go to other pools that belong to galaxy complex,,,,,
c80259,s3,"Overall, nice hotel for couples and family",,,,,
c80260,s1,I have been to lots of hotels around the world from budget to luxury but this has hands down been the best I have ever stayed in,,,,,

c80262,s3,Great for couples! The hotel is also conveniently located and proposed many amenities such as a movie theatre and many restaurants,,,,,
c80263,s1,"Even though Macau (and its many casinos) is a tad ostentatious to my liking, Banyan Tree is not only a hidden gem but an oasis in this city of excesses",,,,,
c80263,s2,Booking a room on their own website was a breeze,,,,,
c80263,s3,"While booking through one the hotel agents might save you a dollar or two, it would save one tons of headaches if something goes wrong or if amendments need to be made",,,,,

c80270,s2,The bellman directed us to the front desk and took care of our bags in a prompt manner,,,,,
c80270,s3,Then Sasa took care of us at the Front Desk using such amazing service,,,,,
c80270,s4,Our room was not ready therefore she upgraded us immediately with a smile on her face,,,,,
c80270,s5,She then conversed with us to add another level of service and when she found out this was a birthday present she made note of it and sent up a piece of birthday cake for us,,,,,

c80270,s7,tons of room and luxury in every area of the room,,,,,
c80270,s8,I would highly recommend you stay here if even for just one night,,,,,
c80270,s9,It's worth it_,,,,,
c80271,s1,"Checked in here end of June to celebrate my 47th bday with a couple of friends and after the trip, we are in agreement that the Banyan tree is by far the best hotel to stay in when in the area",,,,,
c80271,s2,From the moment we walked into the lobby we were definite the stay would be unforgettable and worth the price paid,,,,,
c80271,s3,"When you check into your room, the dipping pool with lounge bed and the old school bath tub will just blow you away",,,,,
c80271,s4,Even the toilet seats were state of the art with the settings for the heat and water pressure it was such a delight,,,,,
c80271,s5,All the things needed for the comfort and added luxury were in place,,,,,

c80273,s1,Banyan Tree in Cotai proved to be the most luxurious vacation we've ever had,,,,,
c80273,s2,"We stayed in a suite that was more like a sanctuary with its own private pool, a wooden bath, two separate showers and a really huge bed",,,,,
c80273,s3,"The urban resort , which is included in the Galaxy complex, offers an extensive list of leisure facilities like a wave pool with real white sands and spa which made out vacation extra special",,,,,

c80275,s2,"As on one hand, I love it really really much",,,,,
c80275,s3,"But on the other hand, I don't want to let too many people know about it as it makes it more difficult to reserve a room!   Alright then, I'll just write some of the amazing parts of it and let you find other hidden surprises!  Banyan Tree is not the most glamorous hotel in Macau, nor the most GOLDEN one as compared to other hotels",,,,,
c80275,s4,"It comes with all subtle, gentle warmth while you first entered the lobby",,,,,
c80275,s5,"The relaxing scents, just let you feel you're in vacation but not only travel",,,,,
c80275,s6,"Upon check-in, I was greeted by one of the helpful receptionist and apologise for not being ready at the check-in time of 3pm",,,,,
c80275,s7,"Honestly, I was not happy for the_",,,,,
c80276,s1,"It was a birthday trip and they probably notice this while checking in but without mentioning this they offered a cake to the room, a big thank you to ""Sasa"" from the front desk for this small detail",,,,,
c80276,s2,One small negative was the breakfast,,,,,
c80276,s3,"We were seated quickly and tea was served as requested but shame the cup was stained, the knife was dirty and the buffet plate was also dirty but this could just be a one-off incident",,,,,
c80276,s4,Otherwise the room was fantastic and could have stay all day inside and the service was so attentive,,,,,
c80277,s1,The hotel room was uniquely designed and simply top notch,,,,,

c80278,s2,"In this sense, villla is worth for money  The private pool is perfect",,,,,

c80295,s5,"Yet, with the spacious room and it's a good place for partying with friends",,,,,
c80296,s1,Having stayed in the original Banyan Tree property in Phuket on multiple occasions it was with some interest that we decided to try the Banyan Tree in Macau for the first time,,,,,
c80296,s2,"Could a hotel located in a casino complex and in a city setting, and with the air temperature below 10 degrees, possible provide the same ambience and ability to make you relax that we had experienced in the resort setting, tropical paradise, of the Banyan Tree Phuket? The answer, perhaps surprisingly, was a resounding yes",,,,,
c80296,s3,"Physically, while the Banyan Tree Macau is not a resort setting, they have compensated for this by leaving space everywhere and not trying to make every square inch  ""productive"" in a revenue sense",,,,,
c80296,s4,The spa was a particularly good example of this and created an overwhelming sense of_,,,,,
c80297,s1,"Toiletries can use some minis, selling more advanced meet, also add cream and facial cleanser, bath because the skin is dry, it will close Ôº_n the winter, a large heated swimming pool and hopefully, if the pool water is too cold waste, and the use of heated swimming pool tiles can slip stone,",,,,,

c80298,s4,"King size and soooooo comfy! And of course the private pool,  truly unique! If I have to find something,  that would be regarding the TVs which are fixed on the wall and you cannot turn towards the pool or the bath, a pity for such a well thought room and detail oriented",,,,,
c80298,s5,"Service wise,  it is as one would expect for this type of hotel,  check in and out is fast",,,,,
c80298,s6,I had headache in the evening and one of the groom walked with me through all the casino to the nearest pharmacy,,,,,
c80298,s7,Breakfast at the Saffron is good but as a_,,,,,
c80299,s1,"stayed in the Signature Pool Suite for 1 night super spacious room, luxurious bathroom plus changing room, cozy pool in the middle of the living room and nice setup in the dining room",,,,,
c80299,s2,one silly comment is there is no rubbish bin in the dining room,,,,,
c80299,s3,"quick respond from the reservation team and they are generous on some extra requests, also appreciated their promises in fulfilling these requests",,,,,
c80299,s4,both the front desk and room service staff are friendly and helpful had a wonderful night with my friends because the staff take care of their guests sincerely i believe,,,,,
c80299,s5,but i wonder if the pool will be deeply cleaned every time after guests checked out since we saw there was some tiny unknown jelly-like stuff floating in the pool which is believed to be from the water tube or the pool_,,,,,
c80300,s1,"We stayed at the room with the indoors pool, there was ample space + the hot pool was nice for winter",,,,,

c80300,s3,Also received hand written cards concerning pleasurable stay from the hotel managers,,,,,
c80300,s4,"The location is perfect - it's connected to the casino, but the atmosphere of the hotel itself is distinct enough to make you feel like you could be away from all the gambling areas if you wanted to",,,,,
c80300,s5,The local food street is close to galaxy as well - was super satisfied overall!,,,,,
c80301,s1,"I love this property, there pool villa is the best , must visit",,,,,
c80301,s2,"Hospitality is next level , as they goofed up on some email and they upgraded us for free",,,,,

c80303,s2,Easy walks to the other popular hotel like Venetian and City of Dreams,,,,,
c80303,s3,The free shuttle bus services to connect you from point A to B is real value for money,,,,,
c80303,s4,"However, the breakfast wasn't up to the mark and the wave pool and other outdoor pools are usually closed during the months of Dec and Jan",,,,,
c80304,s1,Had a really good time at the suite and customer service was very good too,,,,,
c80304,s2,I am just a little dissapointed at the birthday service,,,,,
c80304,s3,I was expecting some compimentary drinks such as alchohol,,,,,
c80304,s4,Our private pool was out of warm water but even at mid/night the technician service came and fixed it so overall we really had a blast,,,,,
c80305,s1,You enter and your role as a human changes to a role that of a king,,,,,
c80305,s2,Everyone from the reservations by cynthia to the duty managers Daniel and Michael to the service staff team of Fred,,,,,
c80305,s3,To their amazing general manager Mr John,,,,,
c80305,s4,It's absolutely a luxurious experience coupled with an amazing property  will visit again for sure,,,,,
c80306,s1,I stayted at the banyan hotel for two nights,,,,,
c80306,s2,"During those two nights, I'll have to say that the sevice and the hotel staff were some of the best that I have seen",,,,,
c80306,s3,It was worth every penny,,,,,

c80410,s3,"Also, my boys have enjoyed the hotel especially the indoor swimming pool and wanted to stay more",,,,,
c80410,s4,"Moreover, this hotel is incredible and I highly recommend it to all visitors as a first choice in Macau",,,,,
c80410,s5,Cheers and keep going :),,,,,
c80411,s1,Pleasant and soothing atmosphere with very attentive and well trained staff,,,,,
c80411,s2,Fresh fruit was supplied daily and our suite had a wading pool in the lounge area which unfortunately was too cold to use with nowhere to change this,,,,,
c80411,s3,The light switches are not immediately obvious - one needs to stay at least a week to discover how they operate! I loved their turn down service with aroma therapy - so soothing and very special,,,,,
c80411,s4,Great bed with lovely linen so we would definitely return,,,,,
c80412,s1,We love to stay at Banyan Tree,,,,,
c80412,s2,"Apart from the room and facilities, the service sets it apart from the other hotels",,,,,
c80412,s3,"I was wondering how they are going to incorporate the resort feel in such a high rise property, but Banyan Tree pulled it off really well",,,,,
c80412,s4,The only thing lacking is some soothing music to complete the overall feeling,,,,,
c80412,s5,"As what the other reviewers noted, there are so many switches around, a master switch would have made things very convenient",,,,,
c80412,s6,"On the first night, after lounging in the in-room pool and while taking a shower, the pool suddenly had a gush of hot water pouring into the pool",,,,,
c80412,s7,"That gave me a great shock, I think it is a way for the hotel to maintain the pool at 27 degrees and also to sanitize it? I thought it was brilliant of it to know when I am out_",,,,,
c80413,s1,"We stayed at the Banyan Tree Hotel in Macau and from the moment we arrived in Macau, I was blown away by the level of service! We had requested a car pick up and we were warmly greeted by an amazing gentleman from the Banyan Tree that took us to the hotel and directly into our villa - after showing us the amazing lobby entrance to the Banyan Tree",,,,,
c80413,s2,"The moment you walk into the lobby of the main entrance, you know you have arrived at a very unique place in the world",,,,,
c80413,s3,The aroma and the decor upon entering immediately suggests relaxation and luxury in a very inviting way,,,,,
c80413,s4,We were taken to our villa and shown the MANY features and were blown away by what we saw,,,,,
c80413,s5,The attention to detail is beyond amazing and the amenities were the best I've experienced anywhere in the world,,,,,
c80413,s6,The_,,,,,
c80414,s1,we had a wonderful stay at the Banyan tree from 8th for two nights and the stranded of the hotel is way above the rest,,,,,
c80414,s2,Ultimate luxury with fabulous service,,,,,
c80414,s3,good value & marvelous food at Saffron,,,,,
c80414,s4,If you are heading to Macau-this is the place,,,,,
c80415,s1,"Macau might not be everyone's cup of tea, the casinos lack the atmosphere of Vegas and the town itself it a mix of old portuguese buildings and some of the tackiest architecture I have ever seen",,,,,
c80415,s2,"However, the Banyan Tree was fabulous",,,,,
c80415,s3,Amazing room with its own relaxation pool,,,,,
c80415,s4,More than that the little touches like the fresh oil lamp and bath salts for the tub were lovely,,,,,
c80415,s5,"The Galaxy Casino lays on regular buses to the town - these are available from the front of the main Galaxy foyer - we got lost and tried to get on a staff bus  The Banyan Tree has a separate pool to the main Galaxy pool, although we didn't find it!   The foyer is incredible smelling! Lovely and enticing!   If you are coming from Hong Kong- take the Cotai Water Jet and there is a coach straight from there to_",,,,,
c80416,s1,"From the first time you walk into this beautiful hotel, the smells will tell you that you have arrived in an oasis of comfort and servce",,,,,
c80416,s2,"Remembering you are in Macao, where service is difficult, Banyan Tree makes all the effort and you sense they want your stay to be the best",,,,,
c80416,s3,"The room was beautiful, with a relaxation pool that hugged the windows looking over the river",,,,,
c80416,s4,"Kept at a warm 27 degrees C, it was a place to rewind after a long day of business",,,,,
c80416,s5,And they light incense at night to give the room a soft and quiet atmosphere,,,,,
c80416,s6,The bath tub is made of wood and sits in the middle of the room,,,,,
c80416,s7,"And the show has two shower heads, for those that can convince the other to join in",,,,,
c80416,s8,My only complaint is the light switches--or should I say--the TOO many light switches,,,,,
c80416,s9,You_,,,,,
c80417,s1,We spent one night in the King size Cotei suite,,,,,
c80417,s2,Loved the room especially the relaxation pool,,,,,
c80417,s3,Although not deep enough to swim it was lovely to relax and enjoy the view,,,,,
c80417,s4,The barrow type bathtub was also a real treat and my partner enjoyed the large double shower,,,,,
c80417,s5,"The japanese toilet was also a treat, love them!",,,,,
c80417,s6,The breakfast was incredible with so much choice both chinese and western,,,,,
c80417,s7,The only thing was that the complex is so big its easy to get lost,,,,,
c80417,s8,When coming from the airport or ferry take the galaxy bus to the hotel its free,,,,,
c80417,s9,It is part of the galaxy complex,,,,,
c80418,s1,"Stayed for 2 nights with bunch of close friends on the corner suites where they had 2 suite rooms combined into one ( yeap, combined into one extremely large suite, not those normal connecting hotel rooms )",,,,,
c80418,s2,"As always, this was not my first time staying here but we keep on coming back lol",,,,,
c80418,s3,"Rooms are very big, amenities are plentiful and generous",,,,,
c80418,s4,"Plus points to the housekeeping and FO team, they did a very good job keeping with our demands, even in the middle of the night",,,,,
c80418,s5,"Services are top-notch, and the RA is very attentive",,,,,
c80418,s6,"Basically, another great stay at Macao",,,,,
c80419,s1,"My fianc√©e and I stayed here for 3 nights and it was the most memorable stay ever, we had the Cotai room and it was the perfect size for a couple",,,,,
c80419,s2,"We stayed in Room 1812, and the view was perfect",,,,,
c80419,s3,overlooking the Galaxy and the pool areas,,,,,
c80419,s4,The staff were AMAZING and they spoke perfect English as well as being the most polite and well mannered people we have ever met,,,,,
c80419,s5,"(Rem the doorman, Ivy the lady greeting you for breakfast",,,,,
c80419,s6,Winnie and Sibyl our spa massages and of course everyone on the front desk and room makers staff,,,,,
c80419,s7,The staff and security guards always greet you with a lovely bowing gesture and a hello,,,,,
c80419,s8,"Our room was always spot clean, especially the pool and bed linens",,,,,
c80419,s9,Every night on our stay we always seem to get snacks from them and cakes,,,,,
c80419,s10,delicious,,,,,
c80419,s11,They feed_,,,,,
c80420,s1,Not sure why but this is my 2nd time staying here & still felt great,,,,,
c80420,s2,"Some small tiny issues here & there, such as water leaking from shower glass walls",,,,,
c80420,s3,"However, the service is great & will return again",,,,,
c80420,s4,Love the privacy of indoor pool,,,,,
c80420,s5,Need to try the restaurant on the top floor (was stupid to dine at Mandarin Oriental Macau),,,,,
c80420,s6,The breakfast somehow tasted less colorful than a year ago when we stayed,,,,,
c80420,s7,Suggest to get rid of guests smoking in the corridor as the cigarette smell mixing with aroma makes me want to throw up,,,,,
c80420,s8,And this is illegal smoking indoor too,,,,,
c80421,s1,"Me my husband and my 4 yr old stayed here for 3 days in Cotai suite , my 4 yr old simply loved the in room plunge pool , I loved there Japanese bathtub",,,,,
c80421,s2,Breakfast served in restaurant was awesome,,,,,
c80421,s3,Although we enjoyed rooftop pool but pool next door at galaxy hotel was huge,,,,,
c80422,s1,"Our 2nd stay at the Banyan Tree Macau, well what can i say? it's amazing! The room has a pool, which my children enjoyed thoroughly",,,,,
c80422,s2,"The staff were very attentive, they even provided a baby bath tub and childrens toiletries",,,,,
c80422,s3,"Would definitely stay here again, be prepared to be treated like royalty at this hotel!",,,,,
c80423,s1,"We arrived 3hrs early and they let us check in, then on top of that they gave us a free room upgrade to a jacuzzi suite",,,,,
c80423,s2,All staff were quite good at speaking English and helped in every way possible and definitely went above and beyond,,,,,
c80423,s3,Banyan is located in the galaxy complex which has a huge casino if your into gambling,,,,,
c80423,s4,Hotel runs free shuttle buses to other hotel and attractions which is very convenient and saves you money,,,,,
c80423,s5,Buffet breakfast was fantastic and was really nice,,,,,
c80423,s6,I would have to say its more like a 6* hotel,,,,,
c80423,s7,"Rooms are massive with your own in room relaxation pool against the window so you can overlook the strip, we had a jacuzzi with massage tables for in room massages and a huge bed where it feels like your partner is sleeping on the other side of the room",,,,,
c80423,s8,_,,,,,
c80424,s1,Excellent stay especially for couples,,,,,
c80424,s2,This was my 2nd time in Macau but first time at Banyan Tree,,,,,
c80424,s3,"Once you experience it, you will not want to stay elsewhere",,,,,
c80424,s4,Not only the room is nice (the setting) also the pool is great! Guest at Banyan Tree can assess the Galaxy pool & also Banyan Tree pool (which feels exclusive & less people),,,,,
c80424,s5,Breakfast was great with lots of selection,,,,,
c80424,s6,Spa atmosphere was really nice but massage was so so,,,,,
c80424,s7,I would strongly recommend this hotel & I am sure you will not regret it,,,,,
c80425,s1,We got a room at the 29th floor,,,,,
c80425,s2,"Everything was awesome from the pool, jacuzzi and bathtub",,,,,
c80425,s3,"Complete amenities!   Banyan cabanas, exclusive for banyan tree guests which means you get your own privacy",,,,,
c80425,s4,We loved our complimentary in-room spa massage for two! Great spa therapists!   Tell earlier if its a celebration so they can give you complimentary cake and wine which we also got on time,,,,,
c80425,s5,"Overall, our stay was excellent and luxurious",,,,,
c80425,s6,We were really relaxed and pampered,,,,,
c80425,s7,Great atmosphere from the lobby going up to our room,,,,,
c80425,s8,Buffet breakfast at Saffron was also top of the line!   Stanley the receptionist was accomodating,,,,,
c80425,s9,The two spa therapist are also friendly,,,,,
c80425,s10,"The 3 of them knows english which is a good thing!   The spa supervisor, reservation manager and supervisor was_",,,,,
c80426,s1,"There was a relaxing pool in our hotel room, what more do you need?  On a serious note though, the hotel is attached to The Galaxy which is attached to the largest casino in the world",,,,,
c80426,s2,"Personally, I don't gamble so watching an ocean of people playing baccarat is not my idea of fun",,,,,
c80426,s3,But getting served drinks pool-side and swimming in a wave pool on one of the hottest days of my year definitely is,,,,,
c80426,s4,The room was huge,,,,,
c80426,s5,It was more akin to a suite,,,,,
c80426,s6,We had a view of the pools which I'm thinking is the better side since it seems to be surrounded by construction on the other side,,,,,
c80426,s7,The bathroom has a fantastic tub but the shower,,,,,
c80426,s8,ohh the shower,,,,,
c80426,s9,It has his and her rain shower heads,,,,,
c80426,s10,"I ran them both at the same time, making one hot and one cold, jumping back and forth between_",,,,,
c80427,s1,This is the first time I stayed at a Banyan Tree outside of Thailand; it hasn't failed my expectations,,,,,
c80427,s2,Room is spacious and smell very relaxing,,,,,
c80427,s3,"We stay at one of their villa, their washroom is bigger than some apartment in HK !!! Their wooden bath tub is superb, I stayed there for hours",,,,,
c80427,s4,Their bed is so soft I literally sink in,,,,,
c80427,s5,Banyan Tree Macau is an excellent choice,,,,,
c80428,s1,"We walked from Galaxy Diamond Area through the link to Hotel, the scent was very special, you'll know that you're already get into Banyan Tree,  the staff will greet and welcome you, that's my first impression stepped into the lobby",,,,,
c80428,s2,"We arrived around 1pm and the official check-in time should be 3pm, the staff are English speakers, they're all very friendly and sincere, we learnt the service and the hotel hardwares are both excellent, so we opted for this hotel for our anniversary, we made the right choice",,,,,
c80428,s3,"We asked lots of questions about the room types & room view at front desk, but the staff was very patient and explained in details, after check-in, she personally showed us the way and even walked with us to lift lobby from front desk",,,,,
c80428,s4,"When we get into the room, we were_",,,,,
c80429,s1,The hotel was amazingly tidy and well kept from the moment we entered the lobby,,,,,
c80429,s2,Concierge and staff are plentiful and readily available to assist with any requests,,,,,
c80429,s3,"When checking in, the front desk employee acknowledged we were on our anniversary so he kindly upgraded the room for free",,,,,
c80429,s4,"The room was mind blowing with a large dining table, slim ""pool"" going from the living room to the bedroom, wooden tub, 2 bathrooms and ipod docking stations throughout the room",,,,,
c80429,s5,I would recommend everyone should stay here at least a night if visiting Macau,,,,,
c80430,s1,"With so much choice in Macau, it's hard to choose where to stay",,,,,
c80430,s2,After much deliberation we opted for Banyan Tree,,,,,
c80430,s3,"We're so happy that we did!  Free bus from airport to main Galaxy entrance, where we were greeted by a lovely member of staff who carried our bags and walked us through the Galaxy complex to the Banyan Tree, pointing out many things along the way",,,,,
c80430,s4,A great way to get our bearings,,,,,
c80430,s5,(We much preferred the Galaxy Complex to the others in Macau),,,,,
c80430,s6,The first thing you notice as you step into the peaceful Banyan Tree is the smell! In all the corridors and rooms - the changing scents are heavenly and instantly make you relax,,,,,
c80430,s7,Check in - fast and efficient as the duty manager welcomed us,,,,,
c80430,s8,We had arrived on an early flight so while our room was being prepared they stored_,,,,,
c80431,s1,It was our first time to try a Banyan Tree Hotel and we were not disappointed,,,,,
c80431,s2,Check In was fast and efficient,,,,,
c80431,s3,We were assisted to our room by One of the staff / Room Boy Morri or Morry who was very friendly and efficient,,,,,
c80431,s4,The room was everything what was in the pictures,,,,,
c80431,s5,"Attention to detail was very evident, starting with the utensils, amenities, drapes, etc",,,,,
c80431,s6,One feature of the room which made my stay really memorable was the Automatic bidet,,,,,
c80431,s7,I always look for a bidet in hotel rooms and the presence of a bidet in a hotel room and this time it was not just an ordinary bidet but a fully automatic bidet with different options!  I really liked the in room pool as the water was regulated to a very nice temperature,,,,,
c80431,s8,The bathroom was huge with options for a shower or a tub,,,,,
c80431,s9,The_,,,,,
c80432,s1,This is the second time i stayed at this hotel,,,,,
c80432,s2,"we came here for our first family trip with 3 families - a couple with 5 year old kid, a young couple and the grand parents",,,,,
c80432,s3,we booked 3 rooms and just couldn't get enough time to enjoy everything inside the hotel,,,,,
c80432,s4,"The check-in was much faster than last time, and we have been arranged with higher floor (29th!!!!) as we have requested when we book the hotel",,,,,
c80432,s5,"Since my family came for celebration, they kindly arranged cakes and wine for us!  I have received cakes from other hotels quite often, but a bottle of wine is something better than our expectation!  The view from the room is excellent",,,,,
c80432,s6,"We enjoyed spending time in the window side mini pool in the room, the super big and relaxing wood tub at the bathroom",,,,,
c80432,s7,Everything was so_,,,,,

c80433,s7,Breakfast served at lobby level was wholesome and full of variety,,,,,
c80434,s1,"The fascinating swimming pools with unique artificial wave-maker in the region; also, the in-room small pool and the ""bathing wooden bucket"" were all the unforgettable experiences that will be recommended to everyone",,,,,
c80434,s2,The excellent morning buffet breakfast with good variety of pastry and other foods were top-up surprises - our kids and parents-in-law all loved the hotel! Thank you!,,,,,
c80435,s1,We booked the Royal Cotai Suite and it surpassed all our expectations,,,,,
c80435,s2,We felt like celebs and got  5-star service from all staff,,,,,
c80435,s3,The whole complex is stunningly lit by nite and by far is the most impressive in Macau,,,,,
c80435,s4,The location is 15 minutes away from the shops and main casinos - MGM etc although the Venetian is next door,,,,,
c80435,s5,There are many shuttle buses/routes 10/15 minutes apart   The room  was a huge 100m2 and exactly like the pictures on the website,,,,,
c80435,s6,The in-room pool was great and so was the bathtub,,,,,
c80435,s7,The towels were changed twice per day and at night the beds were made and dressing gowns and slippers laid out,,,,,
c80435,s8,A candle was lit and each day had a different aroma,,,,,
c80435,s9,A gift was also left on the bed every night,,,,,
c80435,s10,The buffet breakfast was extensive and difficult to taste all_,,,,,
c80436,s1,"Recently my family decided to visit Macau and find a place which could fulfill all adults , teens and kids",,,,,
