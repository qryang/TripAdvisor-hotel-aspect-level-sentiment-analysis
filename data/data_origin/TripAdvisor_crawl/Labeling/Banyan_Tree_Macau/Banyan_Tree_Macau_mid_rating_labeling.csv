c800000,s1,Only a special thing of banyan tree: the room is big and pricey but not special,[room][0]
c800000,s2,The in-room service is not outstanding as 5 stars hotel,[in-room service][-]
c800006,s4,The water in the relaxation pool is too cold which cannot adjust,
c800007,s1,It's the birthday of mine and my girlfriend when we went to the hotel,
c800007,s2,I waited awhile in the middle of the lobby to check in as seems everyone is busy,
c800007,s3,The front desk lady upgraded us to a room with Jacuzzi as it is a birthday trip but she asked us to wait an hour although it is 3pm already ( A bit surprised she did not give the birthday greetings to us even she has our id on hand),
c800007,s4,I came back 40 minutes later but the room was still not ready and she was busy checking on the phone for our room,
c800007,s5,So i told her i would be outside,
c800007,s6,I waited for another 20 minutes and no one came to inform us the room is ready or giving us even a glass of water,
c800007,s7,When i went check again finally the room is ready thanks god,
c800007,s8,"However when we went up the room, our bags are still not yet in and we have_",
c800008,s1,"First of all the 100 square meter pool view suite with king bed is not 100 square meter for sure it feels much smaller, so I feel they are dishonest about the size of the room as a selling point",
c800008,s2,Second the room feels a little bit not so well maintained showing signs of aging and doesn't feel super clean as you would expect in a five star hotel,
c800008,s3,"The ""pool"" in the room looks cool, but is kind of pointless it's not a jacuzzi and not warm so you won't enjoy spending time in it, also the large water surface makes the room very humid and the pool makes noises so that may bother you",
c800008,s4,"The service is quite good and they are very friendly and accommodating, but the concierge was kind of bad",
c800008,s5,The in room dining is accommodating for gluten free options so that's a positive if you have_,
c800009,s1,It's quiet and clean,
c800009,s2,Staffs are friendly and helpful,
c800009,s3,"A good place for getting away for the weekend, as a couple or as a family",
c800009,s4,"Although it's located within a casino but once inside, the sound and sight is kept out rather well",
c800009,s5,He only problem is difficult to get a taxi,
c800010,s1,I wan in room 2807 and I found 5-10 bugs on the sofa bed and window ledge,
c800010,s2,I think the room cleanliness is poor and the response from operator is ridiculous,
c800010,s3,They told me that they will ask someone to come and clean up,
c800010,s4,But I think this is not a proper action,
c800010,s5,At least they should arrange room change for me instead of telling me to stay at the same room,
c800010,s6,"As a customer, I think the room cleanness is one of the important thing",
c800011,s1,"The price is really high and i expect the quality will be that high too, however it is not",
c800011,s2,The room is big and there is a so~called swimming pool which is tiny,
c800011,s3,I doubted the cleaniness cause i saw some insects in that room,
c800012,s1,To make it clear: the hotel is amazing and especially the rooms (we had a 160m2 suite) which are a true luxury experience,
c800012,s2,But a 5 stars hotel should provide a 5 stars service,
c800012,s3,Unworthy points : 25 MINUTES to get 2 bottles of Perrier with the room service,
c800012,s4,It was 11am and as an excuse they told me it was rush hour,
c800012,s5,Breakfast as well didn't have anything special,
c800012,s6,But the worst point was the restaurant of the pool,
c800012,s7,Pricy low quality pizza/sandwiches and poor service ! We may be back but will expect a better service,
c800013,s1,The room is spacious & nice but the wifi is really bad!! Got bites on my legs from sitting near the infinity pool thing,
c800013,s2,The Chinese reception at the outdoor pool entrance is very rude with dark face !!! The reservation staffs are nice to reconfirmed my booking!,
c800014,s1,We were there for my birthday,
c800014,s2,A little disappointed because several things not working,
c800014,s3,Pool lights are not working,
c800014,s4,Some electrical outlets were not working,
c800014,s5,During the night some lights flashed,
c800014,s6,For a hotel of this class is not normal,
c800014,s7,"And after discuss with the staff, I expected to receive a voucher for a future stay but nothing!",
c800015,s1,"the waiting time is too long , overall we  enjoyed this trip, the pool is very funny and the employee of the pool are friendly , when you meet them in everywhere , they say"" hello"":  i am grateful  for the employee who give us that experiences",
c800016,s1,Our kids love the little pool inside the room,
c800016,s2,"I laugh to see the list of charge for items in the room, e",
c800016,s3,g,
c800016,s4,the soap container,
c800016,s5,However the exclusive pool of Banyan tree was very small and crowded,
c800016,s6,The tidal pool was very weak in producing waves,
c800016,s7,"The new attraction of floating river was short and unexcited, also extremely crowded",
c800016,s8,"Everywhere in this hotel complex, you see glittering gold, no interest to come again",
c800016,s9,Macau has changed a lot from a peaceful nice place to a commercialised city of Gold,
c800016,s10,Gone the old days of Macau and the peaceful life of its original occupants,
c800017,s1,There is a lot to like about the Banyan tree at first glance,
c800017,s2,"Big rooms, yes",
c800017,s3,"Wooden bath tub, yes",
c800017,s4,Ambience everywhere you look,
c800017,s5,But our room had a loud clunky sound for two days that no one was able to diagnose or fix,
c800017,s6,"We were booked into 2703, which is a larger than normal suite",
c800017,s7,"After two days of noise and a scene that looked like something out of Night at the Opera (8 actual engineers in our room at one time, plus the Assistant Executive Housekeeper) we finally told everyone to leave",
c800017,s8,This was 7 hours after they had told us they would come to fix everything,
c800017,s9,We were offered another room,
c800017,s10,We explained it was smaller,
c800017,s11,The assistant executive housekeeper went home and never fofllowed up on her promise to move us to a similar room,
c800017,s12,After a full 3 hours of standing_,
c800018,s1,Stayed for 1 night with unlimited massage offer,
c800018,s2,"With the Banyan Tree label, I was expecting a 100 mark experience",
c800018,s3,I was pleased that they have tried to accommodate my requests before the visit,
c800018,s4,Customer service at both the reservation and spa was excellent and prompt,
c800018,s5,On my first step into the 100 sq metre room I was very impressed,
c800018,s6,The indoor relaxation pool was right by the window and would be great watching sunset with a glass of wine or champagne,
c800018,s7,"However, water came out from the shower and wetted the separated toilet floor n other areas of the bathroom",
c800018,s8,"Also, they only gave 1 set of toiletries for a 2 person room",
c800018,s9,Breakfast was very mediocre thai style or a 5 star style,
c800018,s10,They tried to give you some variety but quality of bread cheese and fruits was not that_,
c800019,s1,"My family and I recently stayed at the Macau Banyan Tree, and while the visit was still fresh in mind, I wanted to jot down impressions for the benefit of other travelers",
c800019,s2,"Though I hate to use bullet lists, since the ratings in different hotel areas varied substantially, I'll break this rule:  Hotel appearance: beautiful from top to bottom, from the first entry into the gorgeous lobby, to the design and decoration of our room  Overall staff service (except front desk--see further below): polite, considerate, always keen to help guests with requests  Dining: the in-house Thai restaurant Saffron was good, but Belon was downright excellent both in food and service; in particular, Belon's Sunday brunch was wonderful",
c800019,s3,"Also kudos to the gent Belon has playing piano--nice player,_",
c800020,s1,"It looks perfect from photo, even those I took by myself was very appealing",
c800020,s2,"The spa was fantastic, food was okay",
c800020,s3,The breakfast could have been better,
c800020,s4,"I stayed in the Grand Macau Suite and was very excited about the ""pool"" The pool was not clean and the water could not be drained without contacting the housekeeping",
c800020,s5,"And because the pool appeared to be less clean than expected, I had to clean the bath tub before using it",
c800020,s6,"The bath tub was cute, though bigger guys might find it hard to fit their legs",
c800020,s7,"Overall, for the price paid, it could have been better",
c800021,s1,Actually the environment is really good for relaxing,
c800021,s2,Unfortunately I can't sleep well as so noisy of the water in relaxing pool at my room,
c800021,s3,"Very good service for all hotel staff including front desk, F&B and house keep",
c800021,s4,etc,
c800021,s5,All of them are helpful guys,
c800022,s1,"I went on a girls' trip with my girlfriends, we decided to stay there because we've heard about the awesome spa and how luxury it is",
c800022,s2,"Yes the room is spacious and we were impressed by the pool and the room setting, however the actual staying experience was not as good as what we think a luxury hotel should be",
c800022,s3,"The shower is neither stable or strong, one of my friend got a cold after taking shower in the morning",
c800022,s4,The pillows and comforters don't suit high-end standard,
c800022,s5,"We also got charged from the"" gifts"" they left at the turn-down service, and we thought they are gifts",
c800022,s6,"What a disappointment !  I have to say Banyan tree spa is incredible, the spa room is unbelievably comfortable, we all fell asleep during the treatment",
c800022,s7,"And the concierge staff is very helpful, he booked_",
c800023,s1,Checked in on the 8th Sept 2014 for 2 nights stay in a grand cotai suite king room,
c800023,s2,Staffs were all polite and courteous,
c800023,s3,Check in was easy with no worries at all for English speaking guests,
c800023,s4,Lobby was very well furnished with a strong feel of the Banyan sanctuary,
c800023,s5,Lift was awesome as once you pressed the button it immediately indicates which one to arrive first,
c800023,s6,Walkway from the lift to our rooms was nice with the soothing music and the decor around makes us have a serene and soothing feeling,
c800023,s7,Room was spacious which was divided by a partition with one side having a resting area and a TV and the other side with the bed and TV,
c800023,s8,"Views in our room was spectacular as we asked for high floor, overlooking the private beach and outdoor swimming pool",
c800023,s9,The pool was nice and warm but_,
