c800000,s1,Only a special thing of banyan tree: the room is big and pricey but not special
c800000,s2,The in-room service is not outstanding as 5 stars hotel
c800000,s3,"Besides, I still can see some water stains on the marble floor and some dust gather in the corners of the room"
c800001,s1,I have always been so inclined in staying at Banyan Tree properties but this time around in Macau - the service was really off!  here are some things to consider before u book your stay in Banyan tree macau
c800001,s2,1
c800001,s3,facilities - the room is no doubt beautiful with a relax ambiance so yes
c800001,s4,2
c800001,s5,food - do not add the breakfast
c800001,s6,"considering the amount of food offered in the buffet, the price should not be $248, with so little to offer and food was way below average which is quite disappointing"
c800001,s7,scrap the buffet and offer in room breakfast options instead
c800001,s8,3
c800001,s9,cleanliness - its fine 4
c800001,s10,service front - it lacks warmth and / informative welcome to guests
c800001,s11,"no genuine interaction with guests, and more like reading a script"
c800001,s12,"would i recommend BT macau?  this time around, i would say NO"
c800001,s13,I…
c800002,s1,I booked this hotel on the 9th of December
c800002,s2,I checked in and got room 2008
c800002,s3,It was pretty and gorgeous
c800002,s4,I noticed the water in our the pool is cold
c800002,s5,I waited to see if it’s going to warm up later
c800002,s6,I waited until 10:30pm so I called guest service to drain the water out first and get new warm water
c800002,s7,The guest service agent says they will come back to turn on the water
c800002,s8,"After waiting for 30 minutes, I called guest service to turn on the water"
c800002,s9,The guest service tried but couldn’t turn on the water so they called engineering
c800002,s10,Engineering came and turn on a water switch that didn’t turn on and suppose to be turn on
c800002,s11,I then have to wait for another 30 minute
c800002,s12,"The water from the pool start to build up, but the water was still ice cold"
c800002,s13,"At approximately 12 am, I called guest service…"
c800003,s1,"Poor setting of the buffet table at the Lounge, the buffet table are placed near the common corridor in the hotel lobby"
c800003,s2,People are walking closed to the table and let the guests feel not hygiene and uncomfortable
c800004,s1,the atmosphere is excellent and I feel it is so memorabe
c800004,s2,"but I am disappointed that i need to use the telephone in the lavatory,instead of the one near my bed, when I am trying t contact with the customer service"
c800004,s3,"though the recpetionlistS help me deliver my request, the housekeepers keep to much time to provide my needs"
c800004,s4,"and, so, I keep phoning to the recpetionlistS in the lavatory - again and again"
c800004,s5,"Anyway, maybe other rooms are better but I am exhausted today and I did not change my room today"
c800005,s1,Liking the Galaxy Complex in Macao and having veen in Okura and Ritz Carton we had a look at Banyantree
c800005,s2,The Hotel is grandand well done as most of the prime hotels in  Macao
c800005,s3,Staff is friendly and helpful
c800005,s4,The problem for mewas when you enter the room
c800005,s5,The smell turned ne off immediately
c800005,s6,Smelled like stale smoke or whatever
c800005,s7,The sent us all kind of airimprovers and I hot used to it
c800005,s8,The small pool was fun 1 time but I think the rooms would be much better without constant water in it
c800005,s9,They have also a big  wooden tub in the room which i think is nzch more fun and can be emptied to avoid the smell problem
c800005,s10,We decided bot to extend our1 night and rather go in May to one of the other Galaxy complex hotels
c800006,s1,Good service in spa and breakfast
c800006,s2,The staff are nice and polite
c800006,s3,But cleanliness is bad with condom package under the bed and smell of smoke in the room
c800006,s4,The water in the relaxation pool is too cold which cannot adjust
c800007,s1,It's the birthday of mine and my girlfriend when we went to the hotel
c800007,s2,I waited awhile in the middle of the lobby to check in as seems everyone is busy
c800007,s3,The front desk lady upgraded us to a room with Jacuzzi as it is a birthday trip but she asked us to wait an hour although it is 3pm already ( A bit surprised she did not give the birthday greetings to us even she has our id on hand)
c800007,s4,I came back 40 minutes later but the room was still not ready and she was busy checking on the phone for our room
c800007,s5,So i told her i would be outside
c800007,s6,I waited for another 20 minutes and no one came to inform us the room is ready or giving us even a glass of water
c800007,s7,When i went check again finally the room is ready thanks god
c800007,s8,"However when we went up the room, our bags are still not yet in and we have…"
c800008,s1,"First of all the 100 square meter pool view suite with king bed is not 100 square meter for sure it feels much smaller, so I feel they are dishonest about the size of the room as a selling point"
c800008,s2,Second the room feels a little bit not so well maintained showing signs of aging and doesn't feel super clean as you would expect in a five star hotel
c800008,s3,"The ""pool"" in the room looks cool, but is kind of pointless it's not a jacuzzi and not warm so you won't enjoy spending time in it, also the large water surface makes the room very humid and the pool makes noises so that may bother you"
c800008,s4,"The service is quite good and they are very friendly and accommodating, but the concierge was kind of bad"
c800008,s5,The in room dining is accommodating for gluten free options so that's a positive if you have…
c800009,s1,It's quiet and clean
c800009,s2,Staffs are friendly and helpful
c800009,s3,"A good place for getting away for the weekend, as a couple or as a family"
c800009,s4,"Although it's located within a casino but once inside, the sound and sight is kept out rather well"
c800009,s5,He only problem is difficult to get a taxi
c800010,s1,I wan in room 2807 and I found 5-10 bugs on the sofa bed and window ledge
c800010,s2,I think the room cleanliness is poor and the response from operator is ridiculous
c800010,s3,They told me that they will ask someone to come and clean up
c800010,s4,But I think this is not a proper action
c800010,s5,At least they should arrange room change for me instead of telling me to stay at the same room
c800010,s6,"As a customer, I think the room cleanness is one of the important thing"
c800011,s1,"The price is really high and i expect the quality will be that high too, however it is not"
c800011,s2,The room is big and there is a so~called swimming pool which is tiny
c800011,s3,I doubted the cleaniness cause i saw some insects in that room
c800012,s1,To make it clear: the hotel is amazing and especially the rooms (we had a 160m2 suite) which are a true luxury experience
c800012,s2,But a 5 stars hotel should provide a 5 stars service
c800012,s3,Unworthy points : 25 MINUTES to get 2 bottles of Perrier with the room service
c800012,s4,It was 11am and as an excuse they told me it was rush hour
c800012,s5,Breakfast as well didn't have anything special
c800012,s6,But the worst point was the restaurant of the pool
c800012,s7,Pricy low quality pizza/sandwiches and poor service ! We may be back but will expect a better service
c800013,s1,The room is spacious & nice but the wifi is really bad!! Got bites on my legs from sitting near the infinity pool thing
c800013,s2,The Chinese reception at the outdoor pool entrance is very rude with dark face !!! The reservation staffs are nice to reconfirmed my booking!
c800014,s1,We were there for my birthday
c800014,s2,A little disappointed because several things not working
c800014,s3,Pool lights are not working
c800014,s4,Some electrical outlets were not working
c800014,s5,During the night some lights flashed
c800014,s6,For a hotel of this class is not normal
c800014,s7,"And after discuss with the staff, I expected to receive a voucher for a future stay but nothing!"
c800015,s1,"the waiting time is too long , overall we  enjoyed this trip, the pool is very funny and the employee of the pool are friendly , when you meet them in everywhere , they say"" hello"":  i am grateful  for the employee who give us that experiences"
c800016,s1,Our kids love the little pool inside the room
c800016,s2,"I laugh to see the list of charge for items in the room, e"
c800016,s3,g
c800016,s4,the soap container
c800016,s5,However the exclusive pool of Banyan tree was very small and crowded
c800016,s6,The tidal pool was very weak in producing waves
c800016,s7,"The new attraction of floating river was short and unexcited, also extremely crowded"
c800016,s8,"Everywhere in this hotel complex, you see glittering gold, no interest to come again"
c800016,s9,Macau has changed a lot from a peaceful nice place to a commercialised city of Gold
c800016,s10,Gone the old days of Macau and the peaceful life of its original occupants
c800017,s1,There is a lot to like about the Banyan tree at first glance
c800017,s2,"Big rooms, yes"
c800017,s3,"Wooden bath tub, yes"
c800017,s4,Ambience everywhere you look
c800017,s5,But our room had a loud clunky sound for two days that no one was able to diagnose or fix
c800017,s6,"We were booked into 2703, which is a larger than normal suite"
c800017,s7,"After two days of noise and a scene that looked like something out of Night at the Opera (8 actual engineers in our room at one time, plus the Assistant Executive Housekeeper) we finally told everyone to leave"
c800017,s8,This was 7 hours after they had told us they would come to fix everything
c800017,s9,We were offered another room
c800017,s10,We explained it was smaller
c800017,s11,The assistant executive housekeeper went home and never fofllowed up on her promise to move us to a similar room
c800017,s12,After a full 3 hours of standing…
c800018,s1,Stayed for 1 night with unlimited massage offer
c800018,s2,"With the Banyan Tree label, I was expecting a 100 mark experience"
c800018,s3,I was pleased that they have tried to accommodate my requests before the visit
c800018,s4,Customer service at both the reservation and spa was excellent and prompt
c800018,s5,On my first step into the 100 sq metre room I was very impressed
c800018,s6,The indoor relaxation pool was right by the window and would be great watching sunset with a glass of wine or champagne
c800018,s7,"However, water came out from the shower and wetted the separated toilet floor n other areas of the bathroom"
c800018,s8,"Also, they only gave 1 set of toiletries for a 2 person room"
c800018,s9,Breakfast was very mediocre thai style or a 5 star style
c800018,s10,They tried to give you some variety but quality of bread cheese and fruits was not that…
c800019,s1,"My family and I recently stayed at the Macau Banyan Tree, and while the visit was still fresh in mind, I wanted to jot down impressions for the benefit of other travelers"
c800019,s2,"Though I hate to use bullet lists, since the ratings in different hotel areas varied substantially, I'll break this rule:  Hotel appearance: beautiful from top to bottom, from the first entry into the gorgeous lobby, to the design and decoration of our room  Overall staff service (except front desk--see further below): polite, considerate, always keen to help guests with requests  Dining: the in-house Thai restaurant Saffron was good, but Belon was downright excellent both in food and service; in particular, Belon's Sunday brunch was wonderful"
c800019,s3,"Also kudos to the gent Belon has playing piano--nice player,…"
c800020,s1,"It looks perfect from photo, even those I took by myself was very appealing"
c800020,s2,"The spa was fantastic, food was okay"
c800020,s3,The breakfast could have been better
c800020,s4,"I stayed in the Grand Macau Suite and was very excited about the ""pool"" The pool was not clean and the water could not be drained without contacting the housekeeping"
c800020,s5,"And because the pool appeared to be less clean than expected, I had to clean the bath tub before using it"
c800020,s6,"The bath tub was cute, though bigger guys might find it hard to fit their legs"
c800020,s7,"Overall, for the price paid, it could have been better"
c800021,s1,Actually the environment is really good for relaxing
c800021,s2,Unfortunately I can't sleep well as so noisy of the water in relaxing pool at my room
c800021,s3,"Very good service for all hotel staff including front desk, F&B and house keep"
c800021,s4,etc
c800021,s5,All of them are helpful guys
c800022,s1,"I went on a girls' trip with my girlfriends, we decided to stay there because we've heard about the awesome spa and how luxury it is"
c800022,s2,"Yes the room is spacious and we were impressed by the pool and the room setting, however the actual staying experience was not as good as what we think a luxury hotel should be"
c800022,s3,"The shower is neither stable or strong, one of my friend got a cold after taking shower in the morning"
c800022,s4,The pillows and comforters don't suit high-end standard
c800022,s5,"We also got charged from the"" gifts"" they left at the turn-down service, and we thought they are gifts"
c800022,s6,"What a disappointment !  I have to say Banyan tree spa is incredible, the spa room is unbelievably comfortable, we all fell asleep during the treatment"
c800022,s7,"And the concierge staff is very helpful, he booked…"
c800023,s1,Checked in on the 8th Sept 2014 for 2 nights stay in a grand cotai suite king room
c800023,s2,Staffs were all polite and courteous
c800023,s3,Check in was easy with no worries at all for English speaking guests
c800023,s4,Lobby was very well furnished with a strong feel of the Banyan sanctuary
c800023,s5,Lift was awesome as once you pressed the button it immediately indicates which one to arrive first
c800023,s6,Walkway from the lift to our rooms was nice with the soothing music and the decor around makes us have a serene and soothing feeling
c800023,s7,Room was spacious which was divided by a partition with one side having a resting area and a TV and the other side with the bed and TV
c800023,s8,"Views in our room was spectacular as we asked for high floor, overlooking the private beach and outdoor swimming pool"
c800023,s9,The pool was nice and warm but…
