c45000000,s1,This time I booked total 4 rooms staying with another 3 families
c45000000,s2,The check in reception looks sharpe and the check in staff is very nice and helpful
c45000000,s3,Luckily all rooms are ready at around noon time and all have been upgraded to suite rooms which we love it
c45000000,s4,However my room has a burning smell which the staff claimed it is coming from the air conditioner
c45000000,s5,"The staff didn’t offer me to switch to another room, my whole family has suffered the bad smell for 3 hours until the smell gone"
c45000000,s6,I suggest the hotel to offer a room move immediately
c45000000,s7,"The pool is okay, a little smaller than I expected"
c45000000,s8,I love the sunshine
c45000000,s9,We ordered some food and drink from the poolside bar yet the food took some time to prepare
c45000000,s10,I suggest to put more chairs and cabanas at the pool as we have to wait for…
c45000001,s1,We were amazed by the quality of the hotel room
c45000001,s2,We were upgraded and we appreciate that
c45000001,s3,"Being a Grand Hyatt member, we are happy to be part of the loyalty program"
c45000001,s4,The location of the hotel is excellent
c45000002,s1,There are couple things not working well in the premier suite that I stayed at
c45000002,s2,"First, the curtain blind in the premier suite bedroom malfunction from the first day"
c45000002,s3,"I requested for technician checkup, they said it’s mechanical failure and cannot be fixed unless taking the whole blind off and will take quite a long time to fix"
c45000002,s4,"Given I have another room reserved that’s connected to this premier suite, I was told there’s no availability on other floor during peak season,  and thus not able to change rooms"
c45000002,s5,"I basically had the curtain blinds closed and unable to open it up manually, which basically I lost the bedroom view during the whole duration of the stay"
c45000002,s6,"Second, the TV in the living room of the premier suite is not functioning properly either, the sensor was pulled out…"
c45000003,s1,"In comparing with other branches and leading competitors, it was boring and exhausted !! For the same price I got better options"
c45000003,s2,Extra cost to Club was not justified
c45000003,s3,However staff was helpful
c45000003,s4,Expecially Randy
c45000004,s1,This Grand Hyatt is not the same standard as other Hyatt’s that I’ve stayed in
c45000004,s2,The check in process requires standing in a line for close to 30mins
c45000004,s3,No assistance was offered to help carry my two bags
c45000004,s4,The room whilst large was dated and showing wear
c45000004,s5,Nice bathroom products (Aromatherapy Associates)
c45000004,s6,Here is why I’m upset with my experience
c45000004,s7,On my last night I arrived in from work at 3am and went to the front desk to ask a second time to arrange a late check out
c45000004,s8,I was given two excuses why this is not possible
c45000004,s9,"The first being it was a Saturday (check out time is 11am, check in time is 3pm regardless of weekday or weekend) so I asked if they could make an exception"
c45000004,s10,I requested 1:30pm and was told no
c45000004,s11,I was not even offered the option of paying to extend
c45000004,s12,The second excuse was…
c45000005,s1,"Checkin date 8/12/2019  Poor experience since checkin: When we booked the hotel thru online agent, as the booking system didn’t allow us to confirm the bed type, which we expected to have a king size bed, hotel was unable to provide the king size bed room unless we pay more (around MOP 2xx) to have deluxe room"
c45000005,s2,We accepted the offer at all
c45000005,s3,"When I used the hotel key card to open the door lock, it was failure"
c45000005,s4,We requested the housekeeper assist us to open the room to download our luggages before we went to front desk counter to fix the card
c45000005,s5,"Of course, housekeeper didn’t open the door until she verified our personal information with front desk counter"
c45000005,s6,"Finally the hotel fixed the door lock issue after changing the key cards for 4 TIMES, we were frustrated that why the front…"
c45000006,s1,I visited Macau with my husband last weekend and stayed at Grand Hyatt for 1 night
c45000006,s2,We booked a single bedroom but it was upgraded to a suite when we checked-in
c45000006,s3,I was glad that our room was upgraded
c45000006,s4,My husband sat in the bed to play the mobile phone game and I unpacked our luggage after we got in the room
c45000006,s5,Then we went out for dinner and listened to a concert
c45000006,s6,My husband discovered his hand was bitten by flea when we left the hotel room
c45000006,s7,"After the concert, we had some dessert at their cafe in the lobby"
c45000006,s8,I ordered a stewed pear but I waited for 45 minutes after I made the order
c45000006,s9,I was disappointed as it was too sweet and the pear was not soft
c45000006,s10,Then we went to our room and slept after shower
c45000006,s11,My right underarm was itchy and I woke up in the midnight
c45000006,s12,I found that I was bitten…
c45000007,s1,The Macau provide good transportation
c45000007,s2,It is all free
c45000007,s3,The hyatt macau would make me back again
c45000007,s4,Restaurants  in side and out side the hotel are good
c45000007,s5,The air in the hotel is fresh makes you stay longer
c45000008,s1,I am absolutely disappointed by this hotel
c45000008,s2,"First, everyone can log onto the Internet leading to terrible Internet connection in the evening"
c45000008,s3,I I am coming to Macau for a business trip and the hotel screws me up badly
c45000008,s4,"Second, customers in the lounge speak loud and no one stops them! Third, don’t even wanna mention about it"
c45000009,s1,I booked this hotel for 3 nights and checked out after the first night  Rooms are comfortable and clean however the hotel had zero class many staff cannot understand English
c45000009,s2,The quality of the room service was atrocious mistakes resulted i nwaiting one hour for food
c45000009,s3,Breakfast also very basic poor coffee and poor service the quality of staff is so far below the wynn Palace opposite
c45000009,s4,No reason to stay in this hotel as Macau has far better hotels
c45000010,s1,I stayed for 5 nights here from 9-14 August
c45000010,s2,"I've stayed at various Grand Hyatt hotels previously, so had hope for similar quality service"
c45000010,s3,How wrong i was
c45000010,s4,"On the second day after i'd checked in, i'd returned to my room in the late afternoon at about 5pm and the room was still not made up"
c45000010,s5,"Bear in mind i did not leave any ""do not disturb"" sign at the door"
c45000010,s6,"So i dialled ""0"" on the phone and reached the front desk"
c45000010,s7,"Imagine my shock when i was informed that my room was not made up for ""environmental"" reason"
c45000010,s8,"I asked if that was the case, why was there not even a signage in the room saying that"
c45000010,s9,"Or is the hotel using ""climate change/environmental"" reason as a convenient excuse not to  make up the room"
c45000010,s10,"Come on, i can understand perfectly the importance of saving the…"
c45000011,s1,Stayed for 3 nights
c45000011,s2,1
c45000011,s3,"The room paid and occupied by 3pax, unfortunately the amenities only for 2pax"
c45000011,s4,2
c45000011,s5,"Complaint that shower room water won't drain, maintenance checked but can't resolve & the housekeeping just use the squeegee to remove the water"
c45000011,s6,3
c45000011,s7,The interesting part was the housekeeping tidy the entire room except the bathroom
c45000011,s8,"The reason gave by the maid was need to rush the check-out room due to high demand by front office, so they left behind in-house guest room"
c45000011,s9,4
c45000011,s10,No turndown service
c45000012,s1,"Weirdly enough, I wrote a review back in January and it has mysteriously disappeared so this is a re-write"
c45000012,s2,"Check in was very slow, the staff checking us in also spoke quietly on his radio when reporting the condition of the room I would be staying in, this was suspicious and later when arriving in the room I connected the dots"
c45000012,s3,The air conditioning didn't work and the room was like a sauna
c45000012,s4,"It was evident that the reception staff knew this was the case, hence why he spoke quietly on the walkie-talkie to the cleaning staff, but decided to place us in the room anyway"
c45000012,s5,Naturally I requested a room change due to the unacceptable sauna-like conditions of the room - only for the staff to come up to the room 45 minutes later to fulfil the request
c45000012,s6,We were then moved to a fountain…
c45000013,s1,"Terrible experience , old rooms , service poor , price high compare to quality  The only good things is the Club Lounge Manager which is very good , all the rest forget it   The Taxi waiting time at the Hotel is over 30 min sometimes and they are not organized at all"
c45000013,s2,Overall i won't suggest !!!!
c45000014,s1,Very disappointed with Grand Hyatt at this property
c45000014,s2,"the hardware was outdated, the room design was in 90s' style"
c45000014,s3,"The room's setup, decor, and facility were not quite up to today's standard"
c45000014,s4,"example, there was not usb charging socket in room, and the hotel was nice enough to offer adapter for it, yet, when you plugged the usb charging cable in, it failed to fit into the socket on wall"
c45000014,s5,we needed to make it charging at one of the sockets near the ground for it
c45000014,s6,failure! upgrade of wall sockets should not cost much but the enhancement offered convenient for guests
c45000014,s7,"check in experience was extremely bad, we reserved for a non-smoking single bed room but was told it was unavailable, we were forced to take either a smoking room or twin bed room"
c45000014,s8,Later we were told it was due…
c45000015,s1,There was smoke smell in the room despite it being non smoking room
c45000015,s2,There was also a large mosquito flying around in the room after we checked in
c45000015,s3,We ordered room service dessert and waited almost an hour and it did not arrive
c45000015,s4,"When we called again, they did not apologize at all and in the end we cancelled it, as it was already past midnight at that point"
c45000015,s5,There was also ton of orange mold chunky substance on one of the boxes next to the sink which is disgusting
c45000015,s6,"Lastly, we arranged check out at 12, and they already called and rushed us at 1145"
c45000015,s7,Overall the service and room is not up to standard
c45000016,s1,Cam here for my first wedding anniversary for a quick break from Hong Kong after what seemed to be a decent deal for a night away
c45000016,s2,bad idea
c45000016,s3,"Got to the hotel, they put us in a suite on the 15th that was non smoking but stank like smoke nonetheless"
c45000016,s4,they told us to wait in the room for someone to redirect us
c45000016,s5,We waited almost half an hour and almost missed our show in studio city
c45000016,s6,I had to call them to remind them to help us!  Then they moved us to another room in the 12th floor same problem and it was a non smoking floor !!!!!!     Was too tired after the show to move again so I called the front desk and spoke to an assistant manager to simply let them know that this was unacceptable for a five star hotel; the manager offered to give me an air purifier (not sure how that…
c45000017,s1,I visit Macau once a year for a family holiday
c45000017,s2,"Compared to my previous stays in JW Marriot, Venetian etc etc This is the worst hotel stay ever! Late check out was none and you can see there was no effort to even arrange it! We even received a call to rush us to check out at 11am even though they told us we can delayed to 12pm! Which shows that whatever said on the day of check in was not important"
c45000017,s3,Regretted staying there as we had booked 3 rooms and was not possible to put us on the same level and this is the first time it has happened! Anyway lots to rant! will never be back here!
c45000018,s1,First things I didn’t like it was on the check in
c45000018,s2,"I red a lot of hotel’s reviews when receptionists offering upgrade the room for free, and in my experience in the past was many times the same"
c45000018,s3,"But this time it was not free , I pay extra just because it was little bit earlier check in time and offered suit was available"
c45000018,s4,Another things which made the night of my staying hard it was  finished exactly in this days a medicine for headache which usually provide concierge service
c45000018,s5,On that moment my wife’s headache   was really strong
c45000018,s6,"Concierge initially offered to me go to pharmacy by my self , but I didn’t, after arguing that it is their responsibility keep their stuff replenished 24 hours they send somebody for buying medicine"
c45000018,s7,"It took a time off course, but my wife continued…"
c45000019,s1,This review is based on a one night stay in a King Deluxe Room
c45000019,s2,"The Grand Hyatt is part of the City of Dreams development featuring multiple hotels (including the impressive Morpheus designed by late Zaha Hadid) and a nicely designed luxury shopping mall, and is in walking distance to the Venetian (and the Cotai Arena)"
c45000019,s3,We selected the hotel partly due to the fact that is not a thematic or overly plush hotel with outrageous interiors that are unfortunately common in Macau but rather features a contemporary decor
c45000019,s4,"While well-maintained, the interior is somewhat bland, generic and in need of an update"
c45000019,s5,"It definitely does not do justice to it's official 5-star rating and is more reminiscent of a 4-star, upper mid-range hotel"
c45000019,s6,There's simply nothing luxurious about the property
c45000019,s7,…
c45000020,s1,Grand Hyatts around the world are best known for its elegant luxury but unfortunately the Grand Hyatt Macau is not one of them
c45000020,s2,"I took a Grand Deluxe Suite, which was the second suite I had taken at the GH within a month – the previous one being a Grand Suite King - so I would write this review based on the Grand Deluxe Suite"
c45000020,s3,The Grand Deluxe suite had a grand sounding name but at about 700 sq
c45000020,s4,ft
c45000020,s5,it was one of the smaller “suites” I have stayed in
c45000020,s6,I could accept that - the GH HK has suites of 650 sq
c45000020,s7,ft
c45000020,s8,as well
c45000020,s9,But in terms of amenities it certainly did not live up to the name “grand”
c45000020,s10,Check in was disappointing
c45000020,s11,It was a large hotel - officially with 791 rooms & suites -  and in early July on a weekday before the school holidays I somehow find it difficult to believe…
c45000021,s1,"I have been stay so many Hyatt brand in different city, Macau one was not the one I prefer, the stuff service was ok, but the room conditions was not that good"
c45000021,s2,Like The aircon was very hot even though I make it very low temperature
c45000021,s3,I hope it can make it better and looking forward to you see next time
c45000022,s1,I always favour Hyatt as a Hotel brand but will definitely have a second thought after our poor experience with Grand Hyatt Macau
c45000022,s2,I have stayed with the hotel for one night with my husband have a relaxing evening
c45000022,s3,"However, this turned out to be a total disaster!   Everything was fine when we first arrived"
c45000022,s4,"The main issue was with the lobby reception - Instead of a warm welcome, I encountered a very bad attitude staff Danielle who was terribly rude"
c45000022,s5,"She could not find our room (or name) in their system and since, have dealt the issue with extreme bad manner! I have then asked to deal with his management and obviously it turned out to be a mistake from their end! Even then, I did not receive any apology from Danielle!  Next morning at the lobby was again disappointing"
c45000022,s6,There…
c45000023,s1,The only thing within walking distance from the hotel is the Venetian
c45000023,s2,There's not as much to do in Taipa as compared to Macau
c45000023,s3,"Arrival experince was luckwarm, staff dont make eye contact, and are always busy in giving the reason why things cant be done rather than giving option"
c45000023,s4,its sad
c45000023,s5,room was non-smoking but often a strong smoke smell would come into our room
c45000023,s6,When I walked into the hallway there wasn't any smoke smell
c45000023,s7,I dont think i will ever visit again
c45000024,s1,"Being a frequent guest with Grand Hayaat, Shatin, Hong Kong, it came as a shocking disappointment when I decided to stay with Grand Hayaat macau"
c45000024,s2,The reception area is unimpressive and the check in was as pleasant as checking in the railway station
c45000024,s3,"The room was drab, ill equipped, with the worst view that macau can offer"
c45000024,s4,The in room dining took the cake for being the worst I had the pleasure of experiencing in many years
c45000024,s5,"I simply don't understand why or how Hayaat group decided to have one of their worst establishments of all places in Macau, a place full of wonderful world class hotels"
c45000024,s6,Oh
c45000024,s7,by the way the only restaurant that is available through out the day is a lobby lounge restaurant
c45000024,s8,Simply pathetic
c45000024,s9,Sorry to be so blunt
c45000024,s10,Go to Macau please stay away from Hayaat
c45000025,s1,"We stayed at a Grand Deluxe Suite on 10/F, the view is sucks, we are just right above all pumps/pipes of the opposite building"
c45000025,s2,The condition of the room is unacceptable
c45000025,s3,"Carpet in living room has large stains, it looks unpleasant and uncomfortable"
c45000025,s4,The four leather chairs are all rough and cracked
c45000025,s5,These are the first time I experienced in such a 5-star hotel
c45000025,s6,"Apart from the room itself, I checked in at 1pm and the counter staff expressed that my room will be available at around 3pm and asked if I want my luggage to be put at Concierge or sent to my room, I then answered ""my room please"""
c45000025,s7,"I then checked in with my family right before 4pm, however our luggage was not in the room"
c45000025,s8,I need to call and ask the hotel to send me my luggage as soon as possible as my babies need to…
c45000026,s1,"Overall the food is nice here, but this experience reminded me why I seldom come to have afternoon tea"
c45000026,s2,"SERVICE!!! While we raising up our hands for more than 10s, i thought the server saw us already, but actually they are still talking with other"
c45000026,s3,"When we have finished our dishes and drinks, they just collected the empty plates while leaving the empty cups on the table, didn't ask if we still need any food or drinks or even just need water or not"
c45000026,s4,They waiting till we asking them for water
c45000026,s5,"Later, I raising up my hands for the menu again, they keep on talking to each, I'm really wondering why need so much talking in order to just give me a menu??? then I knew that they are wondering we want the bill or menu, isn't it more efficient to approach the guest for what they really…"
c45000027,s1,I was attached by the beautiful grand haytt mooncake boxes and made the reservation in early August
c45000027,s2,Total purchased two boxes ( A blue one with the dragonfly and the purple one)
c45000027,s3,"I did ask for the detail about the mooncake decoration, but the staff didn't mention there will be a difference between the sample and the actual products"
c45000027,s4,"Unfortunatly, when i collected my two mooncake boxes, i was so disappointed by the outlook and mooncake quality"
c45000027,s5,"The actual mooncake boxes turn out to be unexpected and looks like broken, such as the butterfly and dragonfly were not stick properly with matching with the decoration (The staff have never mention about the butterfly and dragonfly were not going to stick on the box"
c45000027,s6,") Seriously, if i have known this before i made the purchase, i will not…"
c45000028,s1,"For the celebration of our anniversary, my partner and I booked a stay at the Grand Hyatt Macau for 2 nights"
c45000028,s2,"Days before our arrival, I sent the hotel an email regarding our arrival time and our purpose of stay"
c45000028,s3,"Coming from Hong Kong, I told them we might arrive few hours earlier than their standard check-in time which is 3pm hoping they could prepare a room and check us in earlier than usual"
c45000028,s4,"Unfortunately, upon arrival around 12noon, according to the Front Desk staff, no room is ready yet which, of course, we understand since 3pm is the standard checkin time"
c45000028,s5,"So, we decided to walk around and have lunch first"
c45000028,s6,The best thing about this hotel if not only the good thing about is its facilities
c45000028,s7,"The lobby is breath-taking, the architecture is one of a kind and the interior is…"
c45000029,s1,The Grand Hyatt Macau is actually located in Taipa which is a separate island from Macau
c45000029,s2,The only thing within walking distance from the hotel is the Venetian
c45000029,s3,There's not as much to do in Taipa as compared to Macau
c45000029,s4,The hotel is located right next to the Macau airport
c45000029,s5,We could hear planes take off from our room
c45000029,s6,Our room was non-smoking but often a strong smoke smell would come into our room
c45000029,s7,When I walked into the hallway there wasn't any smoke smell
c45000029,s8,"There are free shuttles to Macau, but we mostly took taxis"
c45000029,s9,The service at the Grand Hyatt was hit or miss
c45000029,s10,"I had excellent service from the concierge, who helped us make dinner reservations and provided great recommendations"
c45000029,s11,The attendant at the taxi stand actually told us to get our own taxi when we approached
c45000029,s12,The taxi…
c45000030,s1,I stay in this hotel in 24/8 for one night with my family and stay in the Premier Suite
c45000030,s2,This lounge service is so disappointed to me
c45000030,s3,"I went to have the breakfast at the 6:30 am, at that time all dish have not yet prepare"
c45000030,s4,I have to wait around 15-30 minutes to make the lounge breakfast well prepare
c45000030,s5,"When I have breakfast in the lounge, I order 2 set of  over easy egg dish"
c45000030,s6,The chef know my order of 2 set
c45000030,s7,However he only provide 1 set of dish
c45000030,s8,"When I ask for the other dish, he so rude to answers me I haven't order 2 set of dish"
c45000030,s9,"Also, when I have the evening cocktail time, the others chef service is so bad"
c45000030,s10,I order a Hamburger from the open kitchen and tell the lady chef to have 2 set of Hamburger
c45000030,s11,She tell me to wait around 10 minutes
c45000030,s12,I am waiting for 10 minutes and…
c45000031,s1,"Stayed there for two nights, the hotel itself is fab, clean, modern and good sized rooms, however, 99% of the staff we mat are not up to standard"
c45000031,s2,"We booked two rooms at the club tower, the staff at the lobby didn't ask us to go up to the 37th floor for check in, instead  we waited in the line and was told the rooms were not ready, it was 3 pm at that time"
c45000031,s3,"Second, 95% of the staff greet us in Mandarin"
c45000031,s4,"Yes we are Chinese, but do you think some people might get offence? I don't want to be rude but honestly, i am from HONG KONG, not China! We are 100% not the same, please don't put us under the same type! Thirdly, we dine at the lobby cafe on the second night, we ordered some set dinner and ask the staff what was the soup of the day, the answer I got was we have Western style…"
c45000032,s1,We stayed at this property in March 2011
c45000032,s2,We were very impressed with the club lounge on the bottom floor with wonderful service and food stations
c45000032,s3,The gym was also a highlight of this hotel in 2011
c45000032,s4,"However, they no longer exist"
c45000032,s5,They have decided to remodel this relatively new hotel and if you have visited prior to the beginning of this year you will be very disappointed with the Club Lounge and Gym
c45000032,s6,The gym has been relocated to a back section of the Spa
c45000032,s7,"And the club lounge has been moved to where the old gym used to be, overlooking the pool area"
c45000032,s8,This is not noted anywhere on their site and when we booked our room earlier this year with Award Points it was not noted
c45000032,s9,We also wrote directly to the hotel in July of this year to express how happy we were to be coming…
c45000033,s1,"I was there and held two different types of events for biz, both of time I encountered exactly the same problems, actually I had immediately feedback to the hotel, unfortunately, nothing had changed"
c45000033,s2,"The valet parking staffs were so arrogant and not willing to provide assistance, they even asked me to park in the public car park by myself"
c45000033,s3,"Maybe they were only work for the people who driving a super luxury limousine/super-roadster, futhermore they were just so slow to return my and my colleagues CHEAP JAPANESE cars"
c45000033,s4,"The receptionists were rude and impolite, two of my vvip guests were so unhappy because of their innocent behavior and untrained conversation, finally, my vvip guests went to Conrad hotel and paid by themselves, I was embarrassed to them"
c45000033,s5,I complained to my account…
c45000034,s1,I kept the idea to myself during our stay to avoid dampening my companion's enjoyment
c45000034,s2,"But she said it anyway over lunch: ""This is not like a Grand Hyatt!""  Before the hotel visit, we were wondering whether to book for a two-night stay to make it a more restful one"
c45000034,s3,We were glad we stayed for one night only
c45000034,s4,"The room (a suite) was exceedingly spacious, especially for a brief stay"
c45000034,s5,"In order to sleep more properly, we had to put some extra effort into getting used to the loud-noise air-conditioning: constant fan / air-movement noise, regular cranking sounds of the air-conditioners turning on and off"
c45000034,s6,"In order to have coffee, we had to wash the handle-less tea cups (only two tea-cups provided) for Chinese tea"
c45000034,s7,Grand Hyatt Macau put a lot of effort to down-manage my…
c45000035,s1,Stayed for one night to see Cirque de Soleil so I wanted a top rated hotel room for me and my beautiful companion
c45000035,s2,paid $457
c45000035,s3,37 for one night
c45000035,s4,"At that price I was expecting the best, and anticipated this dream room"
c45000035,s5,"well, I was not impressed"
c45000035,s6,"Room was like an abandoned hotel in the middle of Chernobyl, Russia"
c45000035,s7,"First I looked outside the window and all I saw was a junkyard, the living room was plain with no atmosphere, kitchen area was like a utility kitchen for staff, table and chairs were uncomfortable, no easily accessible outlets for my laptop, bedroom was plain, bathroom was like a poolside bath"
c45000035,s8,"People, don't waste your time at this place"
c45000035,s9,They are over-rated
c45000035,s10,I stayed at the Venetian for half the price and it was full of personality
c45000035,s11,"I won't go back to this place, that's…"
c45000036,s1,From previous pleasant  stays at the hyatt hotels around Asia we decided to stay at the grand hyatt in Macau also
c45000036,s2,"it was me , my wife and 3 little kids"
c45000036,s3,As we arrived the hotel their were so many people quing to check in
c45000036,s4,Lockly I have a platinum membership so we had to wait for only 15 min
c45000036,s5,The room was ok but we expected better from the hyatt
c45000036,s6,The most disappointing part was the dinning options
c45000036,s7,"They have only 2 resturants in the hotel , one Chinese and one international which have also kids menu"
c45000036,s8,The international restaurant was closed on Monday so we had no other alternative for dining with the kids
c45000036,s9,We asked the front desk staff and they recomamded to order room service
c45000036,s10,What a joke ! Staying in 5 stars hotel and need to stay in the room for dinner???  We asked for the…
c45000037,s1,"We stayed one night at Grand Hyatt Macau May 24, 2011"
c45000037,s2,Upon arrival the room was not available so we went to the Beijing Kitchen for lunch
c45000037,s3,"Very Good, but QUITE expensive for Chinese food"
c45000037,s4,but to be expected at Grand Hyatt
c45000037,s5,The room is laid out very differently with the tub/shower totally exposed to the bedroom
c45000037,s6,The shades were broken to hide the shower so a repairman was called and quickly repaired the problem
c45000037,s7,Dinner in the Mezza9 was a disaster!!  We were aked if we wanted smoking or non-smoking and were seated in non-smoking as requested
c45000037,s8,"Shortly after ordering dinner, they opened the doors to a private dining room where everyone was smoking cigars"
c45000037,s9,The smoke was intolerable!  They moved us two table toward the windows but that did not stop the smoke from ruining our…
c45000038,s1,This hotel is a master of form over function
c45000038,s2,The lobby is poorly thought out with adjacent checks invisible to each other; such that the staff can not see how many people were queuing
c45000038,s3,Tried to check in and had to wait an 30 mins in queues
c45000038,s4,There is no organised method of checking in customers on a first come first served basis
c45000038,s5,"Checking in at 4pm, one hour after the check in time, and no rooms available"
c45000038,s6,I had a meeting to go to and then customers to take for dinner
c45000038,s7,"I tried to complain to management, however, when I finally got someone, they really could not have cared less"
c45000038,s8,"Similar situation on check out, I was checking out at 7:30am, there was only one desk working"
c45000038,s9,From what I was told the night before the hotel was full
c45000038,s10,so why only one desk working
c45000038,s11,On the plus side…
c45000039,s1,Long waiting for check-in (more than 15 minutes) but still acceptable as I could see how busy the lobby was
c45000039,s2,I was told by my wife that the operator couldn't understand her English and eventually her call was transferred to Concierge
c45000039,s3,"My wife just asked about the frequency of shuttle bus to the nearby pier after noon time and it's very RIDICULOUS that the operator couldn't understand!!!  I called ""0"" for operator before check-out and I spoke in CANTONESE, the operator answered me in Mandarin"
c45000039,s4,"I stayed in Venetian Macao 2 years ago, Wynn last year and MGM Grand last Christmas but we never encounter this kind of situation"
c45000039,s5,Our enquiries were just a piece of cake anyways!
