c4500000,s1,"First time to Grand Hyatt to celebrate my birthday, but the entire experience doesn't match my expectation"
c4500000,s2,"Good things to mention: -A male staff/porter at lobby is very proactive, he direct us to the elevator when we were confused about direction"
c4500000,s3,-Room is big enough for 2 person with a dining table and sofa
c4500000,s4,"-We are coming for birthday celebration, the staffs arrange a small birthday cake during turn-down"
c4500000,s5,Few things I also want to mention: -No one escort to room and no introduction to any facilities
c4500000,s6,We have to find out by ourselves which is not convenience at all and takes times
c4500000,s7,"-When I ask the schedule about house of dancing water show at concierge, a lady in concierge just want to pass me to the counter of the show center without patient"
c4500000,s8,-I booked 2 days book the key…
c4500001,s1,They overcharged me upon check out
c4500001,s2,"With a final folio showing 10,400 Macau dollars for five nights - what they posted as a final charge to American Express was 13,000 Macau dollars"
c4500001,s3,Unbelievable and unacceptable
c4500001,s4,Their accounting people are utterly careless and incompetent
c4500001,s5,"I am not talking about the authorized hold - I am talking about what ended up on my Amex account as ""posted"" charge"
c4500002,s1,The entire experience was fine
c4500002,s2,"However, I’m just a bit disappointed to the HSKP here"
c4500002,s3,I was in rush to take a shower before departure and I just figured out that there was no Bath Gel in my room
c4500002,s4,"Instead, I got TWO body lotions (one in the shower and the other next to the sink)"
c4500002,s5,"Anw, if you are reading this, please check ur bath gel when u get into the room!!"
c4500003,s1,No warm welcome
c4500003,s2,Check-in was slow
c4500003,s3,"Despite the multiple counter tables, there's only one in operation with three or four check-in staff working"
c4500003,s4,"Each receptionist took their own sweet time handling the guests, without noticing the line that was building up"
c4500003,s5,"After a while, we realized there's a separate counter for World of Hyatt"
c4500003,s6,"We stood behind the counter for quite a while, it was not manned, nobody came and approach us for assistance"
c4500003,s7,We were attended only when we told one of the staff that we are a member
c4500003,s8,The treatment suddenly changed drastically from being rather ignorant to super attentive
c4500003,s9,"Though the guest room need serious upgrading work, it was in clean good condition and bed was comfortable"
c4500003,s10,F&B service needs serious improvement
c4500003,s11,Table given to us during…
c4500004,s1,The hotel is at the far end of COD but still quite convenient moving around by foot
c4500004,s2,We had a suite and the room is big and spacious
c4500004,s3,All basic facilities are there but the hotel is a bit aged lacking some updated basics such as USB plugs and air con in our room was very noisy
c4500004,s4,But all in all it good value for money and upkeeping with the service you expect from a Grand Hyatt
c4500005,s1,It ticks all the boxes of a 5-star property
c4500005,s2,But that is it
c4500005,s3,The staff are professional
c4500005,s4,Will answer all your queries
c4500005,s5,But no warmth
c4500005,s6,A note to housekeeping to make up the room in the afternoon was not followed up with
c4500005,s7,A return to the hotel at 3:30pm to find the room still not made up
c4500005,s8,A call to reception to just replenish water and shower gel was was obliged verbally
c4500005,s9,"But after a 30-min wait, there’s still no water and shower gel"
c4500005,s10,Went to the lobby to buy a piece of chocolate
c4500005,s11,"However, the lady attended to us seemed to hate her job"
c4500005,s12,every question was met with a long face
c4500005,s13,"I had to tell her how much it cost after tax, rather than the other way round"
c4500005,s14,"However, we dined at the beijing kitchen"
c4500005,s15,"Peking duck was one of the best and Vicki, the restaurant manager was perfect in…"
c4500006,s1,Stayed for two nights
c4500006,s2,Paid extra Amount to upgrade the room and breakfast at club lounge
c4500006,s3,Club lounge was in another tower and has to change the lift at level 3
c4500006,s4,"Got to level 3, staffs here do not know the direction unable to give us a proper guidance"
c4500006,s5,"A chef was asking Host at mezza 9 to assist, host replied ask the guest to come here and ask"
c4500006,s6,Wow~
c4500006,s7,nice service
c4500006,s8,"Room cutleries have stains, bath tub looks dirty with stains"
c4500006,s9,Breakfast at lounge was disappointing
c4500006,s10,Little selection
c4500006,s11,A short hair wearing suit lady looks stern and rough when clearing our soiled on table
c4500006,s12,Chef at egg station was not approachable at all and reply was unwilling
c4500006,s13,Never again for the price I paid!
c4500007,s1,I was on a trip with my cousin's family to Macau during the new year of 2019
c4500007,s2,My cousin booked 3 non-smoking rooms with the Grand Club access for 5D4N
c4500007,s3,We were really excited and looking forward to a high standard of service and quality as it is a 5 star hotel with many good reviews
c4500007,s4,"However, it was a slightly disappointing experience with this hotel"
c4500007,s5,The check in process was rather slow even though there weren’t many guests
c4500007,s6,"Also, the receptionist failed to tell us to go up to the 37th floor to check in in the beginning"
c4500007,s7,The lobby was elegant but it is a bit odd to find there was no seating area for guests to relax
c4500007,s8,The major issue of this hotel is the cigarette smoke smell in their non-smoking rooms
c4500007,s9,My room reeked of cigarette smoke
c4500007,s10,We are sensitive to it and requested…
c4500008,s1,The room is decent with a nice view of the Wynn Palace fountain show (note you can hear the sound of the show every 20mins in the evening)
c4500008,s2,We booked a non-smoking twin room with an extra bed for our family
c4500008,s3,"However, they ran out of non-smoking rooms and decided to put us into a smoking room with double bed without informing us"
c4500008,s4,It wasn’t until we called to complain that they admitted their mistake
c4500008,s5,"There was no twin room left so we got put into a non-smoking double room, which still smelled of smoke"
c4500008,s6,It was already late so we accepted it
c4500008,s7,We tried to change the room again the next day but was informed that there was no room available
c4500008,s8,It’s a bit disappointing to have the mistake and not be informed of the change
c4500008,s9,"Traveling with children, we are particularly sensitive to the…"
c4500009,s1,A colleague and I stayed at the Grand Hyatt Macau for two nights on two separate non smoking floors
c4500009,s2,Both of these designated floors reeked of cigarette smoke
c4500009,s3,"The smell was so strong in the bedroom of my suite, the unworn clothes I unpacked from my suitcase when I got home to Sydney, smelled of smoke"
c4500009,s4,Check in was ridiculously slow
c4500009,s5,"Not sure what the check in agent was looking at on her screen but from the time we handed over the credit card,  it took a good 10 minutes to be given the key"
c4500009,s6,"We asked the concierge, who was a Clef D’or member, for dining options but he really had difficulty following our requests"
c4500009,s7,"Not a language barrier, just disinterested in listening"
c4500009,s8,"On the plus side, the position is excellent, the views of the Wynn fountains appealing and the staff are…"
c4500010,s1,"Came to attend an event, and I needed to iron my shirt"
c4500010,s2,"They don't have a dedicated line to housekeeping, so I called guest services to ask for one"
c4500010,s3,No sign of it
c4500010,s4,"Called 15 minutes later to chase, and still no sign of it for another 20-25 minutes"
c4500010,s5,I finally gave up and tried to hide my wrinkled shirt under my jacket
c4500010,s6,"When I returned to my room several hours later, I did find an iron and board in the room, but it was too late"
c4500010,s7,My friend also mentioned to me that it took them 1 hour to deliver an iron to his room
c4500010,s8,Otherwise the room was fine
c4500010,s9,"The bathroom was done in an open style, but there are two large floor-to-ceiling wooden panels that could completely close off the bathroom"
c4500010,s10,"The shower and bathtub came in one glass enclosure, which was not ideal"
c4500011,s1,Room is plain and comfortable as long as you don't mind the water fountain noise from Wynn
c4500011,s2,"Restaurant is a big issue, there is only one buffet and Chinese restaurant"
c4500011,s3,Buffett is always fully booked
c4500011,s4,Breakfast only starts at 7:30
c4500011,s5,My God
c4500012,s1,I were celebrating my boyfriend’s birthday last week in Grand Hyatt Macau and i bought the accommodation with house of dancing water water package
c4500012,s2,"Not to be bloated, the major reason i choose Macau was because I had been longing to watch the water show since I was small and heard of much good review about it"
c4500012,s3,While Grand Hyatt is a hotel brand I’d like to try and it’s also quite high rated in travel websites
c4500012,s4,"However, the whole Hyatt hotel and entertainment experience from City of Dream were a total disappointment"
c4500012,s5,The check in area was lack of control
c4500012,s6,"Im not sure if he was security of what,but he just stood still even when people queued whenever they like and cut in line"
c4500012,s7,Check in process was relatively slow even after I had done the pre check in online which they sent…
c4500013,s1,We stayed at the Hyatt for 2 nights
c4500013,s2,Whilst our room was very spacious with a fountain view the atmosphere clinical and utilitarian
c4500013,s3,"The service was general good, but always seemed a bit below what one would expect from a 5 start hotel"
c4500013,s4,Breakfast was average both with regards to the food and service
c4500013,s5,The Western food selection was very limited and of inconsistent quality
c4500014,s1,"Service at this hotel, is comparable to Grand Hyatt's at other regions"
c4500014,s2,Its very good
c4500014,s3,"From bellmen to front desk to housekeeping, restaurant (beijing kitchen)everyone made you felt welcome and were more then willing to make your stay memorable"
c4500014,s4,"We were also greeted at check in by the butler, who was very helpful in giving info on the hotel, sights to see, history of the hotel and surrounding hotels, and personally escorted us to the room"
c4500014,s5,"Facilities are well kept, rooms are comfortable and maintained well"
c4500014,s6,"Only advice is that the bathrooms are fairly small (for suite), with bathtub/shower setup needing some improvement"
c4500014,s7,Small area to shower (next to tub) and with slippery marble type floor
c4500014,s8,Grand Hyatt is connected to City of Dreams which I wasn't aware of
c4500014,s9,Facilities…
c4500015,s1,I trusted the Hyatt brand and have used Hyatt hotels in the past
c4500015,s2,"I had been really pleased with their service in the past, hence I chose a Grand King Suite at this hotel for my friend's birthday trip in Macau"
c4500015,s3,Our experience here started with placing our baggage in storage before our check-in time
c4500015,s4,The staff at the luggage storage desk were helpful and swift
c4500015,s5,"At 2:30pm we came back to check in, the process was slow"
c4500015,s6,"I mentioned this was for my friend's birthday so we just hoped to check in smoothly, especially as the swimming pool which we planned to visit was already closed due to a typhoon"
c4500015,s7,"The receptionist did not seem to acknowledge what I said, it felt strange as if she was just telling me everything she had to tell me, instead of having a two-way conversation"
c4500015,s8,…
c4500016,s1,"I booked a suite with requested on non smoking floor area, the hotel arranged me the room i requested but somehow the smell from cigarette is there and it's everywhere even in the bed sheets and pillows and blanket"
c4500016,s2,The smell got stronger overnight
c4500016,s3,not sure if it is because of the ventilation or something but if you build the non smoking floor with non smoking room
c4500016,s4,you should have find the way to protect it from anywhere
c4500017,s1,"I booked the room for me and my 12 year old daughter with breakfast included, but at checking in I was informed that only one breakfast was included"
c4500017,s2,I was surprised to hear that so I purchased another breakfast for my daughter for the next morning!   Later on I checked my reservation and very clearly said breakfast included per person
c4500017,s3,"I said I will let them know at check out!   The next morning at breakfast, there was a sign at the entrance that said: “kids 6-12 years old pay 1/2 price"
c4500017,s4,"When we went to do the check out, I showed to your staff my reservation and details and she said: “you only listed one adult in the reservation, therefore only one breakfast is included”"
c4500017,s5,"I told the girl, what do you mean, it very clear that here in the confirmation of my reservation it said:…"
c4500018,s1,"As i am not for casino in macau, i merely enjoy hotel facilities and services"
c4500018,s2,"GH macau is in city of dreams where the centrally located next to Wynn palace, venetian, cotai sand and mgm cotai"
c4500018,s3,The hotel restaurant has been famous of the buffet offered
c4500018,s4,We tried and the food is really good
c4500018,s5,But staff is not attentive and sincere
c4500018,s6,The Filipino manager seems not helpful with collecting dishes while he is just walking around chatting with guest
c4500018,s7,"And the chef in dessert counter is playing with mobile phone - not professional and not hyatt standard, i think"
c4500018,s8,The room is spacious with a large sleeping sofa
c4500018,s9,"The overall environment is so homey that lacks the sense of luxury, on the other hand you may say they are subtle and down to earth"
c4500018,s10,"However, the bed is so hard that is the…"
c4500019,s1,Grand Hyatt is unusual for a Cotai Strip hotel as it has no casino no shopping area
c4500019,s2,Majestic entrance lobby with really high ceilings and tasteful interior decorations which are simple yet tasteful
c4500019,s3,A good 5 star hotel slightly away from the tourist crowds
c4500020,s1,"The City of Dreams complex, which this hotel is part of, is now a bit dated compared to the other large and newer complexes in Macau"
c4500020,s2,The Grand Hyatt is the same
c4500020,s3,The rooms need updating
c4500020,s4,"Service was fine, but not outstanding"
c4500020,s5,One cannot compare this to the other Grand Hyatts in the world
c4500021,s1,First impression was good
c4500021,s2,Staff pleasant but food wise could be better in terms of breakfast and lunch as we were stuck there for 4 days eating the same food
c4500021,s3,My room was noisy could be because of the air conditioning
c4500022,s1,I have been stayed in this hotel for 2 times! The room was very spacious
c4500022,s2,The room service was excellent! Just that one time we got a high floor room and experienced noises from the ceiling/air-con
c4500022,s3,"It was like a huge ""bang"" sound and loud enough to wake us up a few time while we were sleeping"
c4500022,s4,"But it was mid-night and we only stayed for one night, so we didn't bother to report to the front desk"
c4500023,s1,My usual experience of the Grand Hyatt chain is excellent
c4500023,s2,"In this case the location and service are both great, with lots of attentive staff"
c4500023,s3,The rest however was mediocre compared with that which one should expect from the Grand Hyatt
c4500023,s4,"Room was ok, food a bit disappointing"
c4500023,s5,Had a lovely morning jog around Cotai though
c4500024,s1,Stayed in this hotel for 3 days
c4500024,s2,I can say service here is up to standard of most hyatt hotels
c4500024,s3,Everyone seemed very helpful
c4500024,s4,I remember a few of their staffs that made my stay pleasant
c4500024,s5,I definitely recommend this hotel! Thank you hyatt for the experience
c4500025,s1,Here for two nites for conference and team building
c4500025,s2,Upgraded to a big suite
c4500025,s3,Spacious
c4500025,s4,Comfy bed
c4500025,s5,Good toiletries
c4500025,s6,But irritating smell in the living room
c4500025,s7,I suspect there were people who smoked in the room before and the hotel tried to clear it up
c4500025,s8,"anyway, strong chemical smell"
c4500025,s9,Luckily it was not in the bedroom
c4500025,s10,Breakfast average
c4500025,s11,"Given the things you can do in macau hotels, grand hyatt seems below par"
c4500025,s12,Shopping areas big but all the big brands and no customers
c4500025,s13,Maintenance and customer service needs to be strengthened
c4500025,s14,"Staff who checked me out did not look at me, did not say thank you but just 'he yi' -- ""ok"" in putonghua!!  Frequent customer to grand hyatt"
c4500025,s15,Have to say i am surprised by the service
c4500026,s1,We got the magic show room package
c4500026,s2,The room overlooking the airport was large and fun to be in
c4500026,s3,The hotel is very cold and apart from some flowers in the lobby feels very cold
c4500026,s4,No attention to detail in the room or the service and some frontline staff rather impolite
c4500026,s5,Large pool and friendly pool staff an oasis of calm
c4500026,s6,T  he breakfast is extensive and cappuccino a pleasure
c4500026,s7,Great place to take your mother in law; big enough to get lost and unfriendly enough to discourage her from meeting up with you soon
c4500027,s1,The shuttle Bus which I took from the border with China does not unload the passengers by the main door of the hotel
c4500027,s2,The hotel is part of a complex of buildings
c4500027,s3,"and for some reason I found myself in the lobby of another building, where no porters or helpers to be found"
c4500027,s4,I asked the bus driver to take us to the main entrance but he refused and could not change the rules
c4500027,s5,So i Had to carry my own luggage for about 500 feet to the main reception
c4500027,s6,"This would have been very annoying if I had more luggage, and very disturbing for  an old or disabled person"
c4500027,s7,At the reception I was treated with a lot of care and consideration and was upgraded to a suite
c4500027,s8,All the staff are well trained and very courteous
c4500027,s9,"The Buffet at the highest floor is very Chinese, does not provide  a good choice…"
c4500028,s1,Was staying in hotel for a conference
c4500028,s2,My reservation was lost and at one point I was told that it is cancelled according to the voucher I provided- not the best experience after 26 h trip to get to Macau
c4500028,s3,"Luckily my colleague was already in hotel, so I had to phone her, get her room number and somehow after that I got a  room"
c4500028,s4,"Considering that it was Sunday night its not the best experience, the same was at check out"
c4500028,s5,Couldn't get deposit back even it was my credit card as for some reason the room was still not on my name
c4500028,s6,"Other then that the rooms are nice, Internet is good, make sure that you request non smoking room as sometime ago they still use to smoke in hotel and now if you get such room which used to be smoking before its still smells really bad"
c4500029,s1,The food was not good - salad was not fresh and food quality had dropped a lot comparing with my stay in Feb 2015
c4500029,s2,It does not support F&B promotion program of other Grand Hyatt
c4500029,s3,"All hotels of Hyatt hotels in China, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok support F&B promotion program of other Grand Hyatt in China"
c4500030,s1,We stayed on the Executive Suite
c4500030,s2,Everything was perfect from check in till the spacious room
c4500030,s3,However the breakfast experience in the club floor was disappointing
c4500030,s4,I was queuing for my sunny side egg
c4500030,s5,"In front of me, was an Caucasian , your female young staff smiled n asked him to come back later"
c4500030,s6,"But for my turn, her face turned black n without any smile , she replied me in Cantonese come back later"
c4500030,s7,"Extremely disappointed, I wanted to know is she racist? Next I came back again and this time I asked for a bacon, your male staff without any smile again pick it up n drop it onto my plate"
c4500031,s1,I stayed here for a few days because I have Diamond status with Hyatt
c4500031,s2,"The hotel is okay if what you're after is a clean, modern room near the casinos, but I was disappointed with its service and quality aspects"
c4500031,s3,"For one, the supposedly non-smoking room smelled of smoke"
c4500031,s4,"Secondly, my treatment at the spa was poor for the price (the massage therapist didn't seem professionally trained)"
c4500031,s5,"The club lounge does have tasty food and good service, with very attentive staff"
c4500031,s6,"The pool area was empty, which is good if you want to be alone at the pool, but seemed a bit desolate"
c4500031,s7,The hotel is far from the historic area of Macau
c4500031,s8,"Overall, the Grand Hyatt seems good for people who are in Macau to gamble or shop, but wasn't for me as a tourist interested in more touristic activities"
c4500032,s1,spa 及 早餐強差人意
c4500032,s2,"spa 的同事欠缺知識, 只是草草了事, 尤其是 foot massage, 不是為何伏在床上做 foot massage"
c4500032,s3,"banyan tree 較好, 而且較平, 房及早餐都較好"
c4500032,s4,"房的環境很好, 但酒店很遠"
c4500032,s5,泳池是我在酒店內最滿意的
c4500032,s6,"grand club 的職員都很 nice, 但不知為何當我說廣東話時, 你們職員仍要說普通話, 可能我不是你酒店的 target customers, 而且可見到你們酒店只 target 內地人, 我只想安靜吃早餐, 但你們沒有控制內地人音量"
c4500032,s7,很失望
c4500033,s1,This is the first time I found that have 3 hotels connecting with each other with a casino on top of it
c4500033,s2,"They call the place City of Dreams with Crown Tower Hotel, Hard Rock Hotel and Grand Hyatt"
c4500033,s3,Hotel
c4500033,s4,Free transportation {bus) to town and airport
c4500033,s5,Near to the Macau International Airports - 15 minutes drive
c4500033,s6,From the hotel you can go to Venetian Hotel through a illuminate tunnel by foot which you can have good varity of foods - cheap and good
c4500034,s1,We had previously stayed here & thought it was great but this time our 'non-smoking' room smelt terribly
c4500034,s2,It was so bad it was as if cigarette smoke was coming thru the air-conditioning
c4500034,s3,We were there for 3 nights & advised the reception upon checkout but in hindsight we should have done so upon checkin
c4500034,s4,This is a problem that obviously should have been picked up by housekeeping
c4500034,s5,Lots of hotels to choose from now so it should be better
c4500034,s6,"Otherwise, service was excellent"
c4500035,s1,We stayed here and had a nice time
c4500035,s2,It is a casino-less part of city of dreams
c4500035,s3,The room was clean and modern
c4500035,s4,"However, our room service never was delivered and we were charged TWICE! They also messed up our bills, such as charging us for parking (we took a bus from the ferry terminal) and other odd things"
c4500035,s5,"While they finally fixed this after calling Hyatt corporate, the staff treated us like we were looking for freebies"
c4500036,s1,I stayed here as I was attending a business conference
c4500036,s2,The rooms are of a decent size with big beds but furnished in a highly minimalist style that gives a rather cold impression overall
c4500036,s3,There was no desk in my room
c4500036,s4,The location is probably good if you want to spend your time in the adjacent City of Dreams casino and shops but this part of Cotai is also a huge building site and will remain so for several years yet
c4500036,s5,Service is efficient and friendly
c4500036,s6,I had a problem connecting to the hotel wi-fi and someone came to my room immediately to fix the problem
c4500036,s7,The concierge also recommended a good restaurant for dinner and obtained a reservation
c4500037,s1,"We had a free Hyatt night with limited selection, and we went with one night in Macau while we were in Hong Kong"
c4500037,s2,"Once again, I can't speak about value for dollar, but I think you can find better places in Macau"
c4500037,s3,"First, the rooms were excellent"
c4500037,s4,"Clean, big and easy to get to"
c4500037,s5,"Service was ok, but with a hotel this size it is natural to assume service will slip some"
c4500037,s6,"The hotel is gigantic, and it is right next to a bunch of other huge hotels"
c4500037,s7,"Breakfast was very good, though we had a quick dinner at the Hard Rock and it wasn't good at all"
c4500037,s8,"My mistake for choosing the Hard Rock, I suppose"
c4500037,s9,The real problem I have with this place was that the casino was so terrible
c4500037,s10,"It wasn't that clean, and it was empty"
c4500037,s11,"Never seen a casino that empty before, it is chilling"
c4500037,s12,Ended up going…
c4500038,s1,"The Hotel is good and I can only write about its good rooms, its great restaurant called the Beijing Kitchen which is a favourite and the new Club room which is fabulous"
c4500038,s2,The City of Dreams is a good location and a 2 minute walk to the Venetian so overall its good
c4500038,s3,The negatives are service can be slow and to get a taxi you need the patience of a saint
c4500039,s1,Visited this hotel from 25-28 May 2013
c4500039,s2,"First impression: Not that good as even though there was a porter or staff at the entrance of the hotel, when the shuttle bus came to a halt and I got off to retrieve my luggage, no one came to welcome and pick up my luggage even though I was the only passenger/customer"
c4500039,s3,"This happen only after I enter the hotel ground that someone ask me if I am checking in and led me to the counter - after I went to the wrong counter though, haha"
c4500039,s4,Good: 1
c4500039,s5,"Hotel lobby is grand and nice with very high ceilings and a nice ""water ball"" display"
c4500039,s6,2
c4500039,s7,"Check-in was smooth and the check in counter personnel, a young chap, was friendly and tried his best to communicate in English"
c4500039,s8,3
c4500039,s9,A porter helped me with my luggage to my room and explained the various…
c4500040,s1,We had very high expectations of the Grand Hyatt at the City of Dreams
c4500040,s2,The food situation was amazin
c4500040,s3,"Beijing Kitchen and Mezza9 have excellent, attentive and knowledgeable servers with a diverse strong menu to match"
c4500040,s4,Had the grandest foie gros there! It's the spa where we had the greatest issues
c4500040,s5,I booked my wife an Herbal Calm massage on their website
c4500040,s6,It sounded like something she would like as they said they used herbal botanics and other face rejuvenating things
c4500040,s7,The actuality was a totally horrible spa experience
c4500040,s8,The beautician just sprayed her face with an alcohol based toner and proceded to lather 4 different types of products on
c4500040,s9,She also got her eyebrows plucked and makeup removed But that stuff could have been done at the room later
c4500040,s10,"For a sensitivw skin massage,…"
c4500041,s1,3 nights
c4500041,s2,Lobby massive and representative
c4500041,s3,Check in slow
c4500041,s4,"Our room very large, no decoration, no flowers, no fruits"
c4500041,s5,"Not a Grand Hyatt, more a Holiday Inn"
c4500041,s6,"Equipments in the room working properly, everything is clean"
c4500041,s7,Room on the 18th floor overlooking a massive construction site with some noise impact and a view to the airport
c4500041,s8,"Breakfast good, but not great"
c4500041,s9,"Fresh orange juice, good bread and Asian food"
c4500041,s10,Pancake and waffle station
c4500041,s11,"Coffee is bad, try the very good selection of tea instead"
c4500041,s12,"Amazing pool ! 40 meters ! Location of the hotel good, bus shuttle available"
c4500042,s1,"Good room, but it would have been nice to have desk for use of my laptop"
c4500042,s2,Suite faced a construction site with pile driving starting at 6:30am
c4500042,s3,"Service was excellent, but room placement is important"
c4500042,s4,A new Wynn hotel is going up next door and they appears to be at a early stage of the project with pile driving starting at 6:30 am
c4500042,s5,Hotel is connected to the casino and two other hotels thus the limited food availability in the hotel is not much of an issue
c4500043,s1,"we selected the water dance package , is a real bonus"
c4500043,s2,as the hotel is within the complex
c4500043,s3,"Room is very spacious , however lots of construction around the hotel , make the view somewhat negative"
c4500043,s4,"( at least -2 )  the outdoor pool is very ordinary , I suppose everyone is in the casino , shopping and not really into pool"
c4500043,s5,"( -2 )  we asked for Non smoking rooms , when we check in is perfect no smell , But when we return at 6PM , the bed is done so the room maker have come in, but the room is full of smoking smelll"
c4500043,s6,the entrance is very GRAND
c4500043,s7,"Resturant is in Grand Hyatt is OK , I would not call it a surprise  If you consider the Package with Water Dance then is price have beat it all !!"
c4500044,s1,Stayed here for 2 nights at the Club level room with access to the Club Lounge
c4500044,s2,The room was a good size and the bathroom was very spacious and modern
c4500044,s3,It is a typical Hyatt room
c4500044,s4,Nothing really stands out except for the Nespresso machine and a tea pot with choices of tea leaves
c4500044,s5,The hotel is connected to the City of Dream mall and the Hard Rock Hotel
c4500044,s6,It's convenient if you plan to see The House of Dancing Water show
c4500044,s7,The concierge was attentive and helpful in giving directions and booking our ferry tickets to Hong Kong airport
c4500044,s8,Now the not so great news
c4500044,s9,The hotel is very close to the Macau airport
c4500044,s10,We were told the hotel offers complimentary shuttle bus for airport pick up
c4500044,s11,We waited almost 50 minutes for the shuttle
c4500044,s12,We could have just taken a cab for the 5…
c4500045,s1,"Not up to my expectation, here's why: 1"
c4500045,s2,"Checked in on Thurs, which is not even their weekend rush yet, but they couldn't get the room to us by 3pm, but only by 4:15pm 2"
c4500045,s3,They gave us a non-smoking room which was filled with smoking smell
c4500045,s4,"The floor clearly labelled ""Non-smoking floor"", but the front desk said they don't have a non-smoking floor, but non-smoking room only"
c4500045,s5,"I can understand how hotels with business mainly from Mainland Chinese could have difficulties in enforcing non-smoking policy, but if their signs of non-smoking says ""fine of $1,000 if evidence of smoking is found"", then no guests are going to take this seriously"
c4500045,s6,This is terrible
c4500045,s7,I have visited many 5-star hotels including the Kempinskyi in Chengdu that was able to have the non-smoking floor policy…
c4500046,s1,I and my family planned to stay in this hotel for 2 nights
c4500046,s2,We have booked the grand suite twin room and mentioned that we will have a child go with us
c4500046,s3,The check-in service needed to improve
c4500046,s4,They cannot stop the people from interrupting into the queue
c4500046,s5,"When we arrived  the room, we found that the room is spacious and clean except that they only provide us two sets of pyjamas and shoes"
c4500046,s6,"When we ask for extra blanket  on the second night since my son said that it was quite cold at night, it made us surprise since we were told to pay for the extra blanket"
c4500046,s7,"Besides this , the pool is quite big and the helpers at the pool side are good"
c4500046,s8,They are very nice and helpful
c4500046,s9,"On the whole, quite a good hotel although the standard of service is  below my expectation"
c4500047,s1,This is our second favorite hotel option after Venetian
c4500047,s2,I guess its because Venetian is right across the street when we can't book it cause its full
c4500047,s3,"Hyatt is very spacious and the deco is modern, simple and sleek"
c4500047,s4,"However, it lacks a warm feel"
c4500047,s5,"dunno, maybe its because of the layout"
c4500047,s6,The Nespresso coffee maker in the room is what made me real happy
c4500047,s7,The beds are nice and comfy
c4500047,s8,The only issue I have with Hyatt is their bathrooms
c4500047,s9,I have stayed here 3 times and each time I had a problem with the drainage system that we had to change rooms twice altogether
c4500047,s10,Not nice
c4500047,s11,The hotel breakfast is nice but not overtly commendable
c4500047,s12,The staff here at Hyatt are very very attentive and well trained
c4500047,s13,The best thing about Hyatt is their swimming pools
c4500047,s14,"Its big, there are many sunbeds…"
c4500048,s1,I came here April 2012 and stayed in the suite room
c4500048,s2,"The hotel is quite nice, the staff is polite and professional"
c4500048,s3,"A nice sitting lounge on the ground floor with cigars, whiskeys, wines, and cakes"
c4500048,s4,"Very nice looking, although I didn't try it"
c4500048,s5,"I booked a package, for a suite room, which included two roundtrip ferry tickets and 600MOP dinning credit"
c4500048,s6,The package was 2600HKD including 15% service/tax
c4500048,s7,"The 600MOP dinning credit is generous, although the room service menu appeared to be a little bit more expensive than the other hotels, hence you get less food"
c4500048,s8,"The lobby is nice, although the hotel is located at the end and you always need to walk farther to get there"
c4500048,s9,"The lift and hallways are nice, and while the room was very clean, I was not impressed"
c4500048,s10,It did come with a…
c4500049,s1,My dad actually loved this hotel and could not stop raving about it
c4500049,s2,"That's why we came back but unfortunately this time, it was less than I expected"
c4500049,s3,"Upon entering the hotel, the lobby smells like smoke despite signs of non-smoking"
c4500049,s4,We found a cigarette butt at the elevator and even on our non - smoking floor
c4500049,s5,No wonder our non-smoking room smells like (cigarette)smoke
c4500049,s6,We complained but they just insisted that the room is non- smoking
c4500049,s7,Our room has a nice modern design and spacious - true to the picture they show at their website
c4500049,s8,Free nespresso and tea
c4500049,s9,Free wi-fi
c4500049,s10,Beds are comfortable
c4500049,s11,Great shower and Bathtub too
c4500049,s12,Strict on the check out time- they gave us a late check out up to 12 noon
c4500049,s13,Just 3 minutes walk to the shuttle area
c4500049,s14,Free shuttle buses to a number…
c4500050,s1,Recent stay at the Grand Hyatt Macau for a business trip
c4500050,s2,Hotel was disappointing
c4500050,s3,"Had reserved a non-smoking room, and was told that the floor I was on was a smoking floor, but not to worry, as the rooms had all been cleaned"
c4500050,s4,"Room reeked of smoke and sanitizer, literally leaving a sour taste in my mouth the entire stay"
c4500050,s5,Requests to relocate to another room were denied
c4500050,s6,Hotel also refused to honor an early check-out request given to them 4 days in advance of the actual checkout
c4500050,s7,Hotel was thus just an 'average' experience with significant bad parts
c4500051,s1,We came with a package to see the the dancing water show
c4500051,s2,Room is big but many small details are already torn being a year old hotel
c4500051,s3,"Curtains are torn, carpet dirty, face mark on the window, shower leaks water into the bathroom floor, air on very noisy"
c4500051,s4,Maybe they rather have guests in the casino
c4500052,s1,My partner and I stayed at the Grand Hyatt Macau 10-13 September 2011
c4500052,s2,"What we liked:  The lobby: It's very grand,spacious and very beautiful! Lovely ambience"
c4500052,s3,"Room: The rooms are spacious and well designed with different separating doors for the bedroom,living room and bathroom"
c4500052,s4,We loved the coffee and tea making facilities
c4500052,s5,The Nespresso machine was really nice
c4500052,s6,The bathroom: quite spacious with nice bathroom amenities
c4500052,s7,We loved the closet space
c4500052,s8,They really provide a lot of closet space! Location:the location is excellent
c4500052,s9,Really close to everything
c4500052,s10,Casinos and shopping malls as well as House of Dancing Waters
c4500052,s11,Can't complain about the location
c4500052,s12,Buses frequently transport you to other casinos
c4500052,s13,What we didn't like: Service: the service at this hotel is mediocre to say the…
c4500053,s1,I booked 2 grand suites at the Grand Hyatt for a Friday night
c4500053,s2,I booked over the telephone and the process probably took about 15 minutes in total
c4500053,s3,"When I received the email confirmation of the booking, I found that the bookings were for the Thursday instead of the Friday, and we were booked for two smoking rooms when I requested non smoking"
c4500053,s4,"As not everyone checks over confirmations of seemingly easy tasks, I feel fortunate that I caught these two major mistakes"
c4500053,s5,"When I arrived to check in, I found that they had mixed my Gold Passport account up with another person by the same name as me, which I found strange since I had given the Passport number to the man during the reservation"
c4500053,s6,The start of my trip was not good given the number of mistakes already
c4500053,s7,The room was…
c4500054,s1,"Bright and clean room, nice bed, high quality amenities and wonderful location, Grand Hyatt Macau is posed to be a great hotel but ultimately let down by some mindless staff"
c4500054,s2,The check-in staff is very cold and without a glimpse of smile
c4500054,s3,We have mentioned late check-out during reservation but the check-in staff didn't seem to be aware
c4500054,s4,The hotel has offered us a complimentary cake to celebrate our special occasion yet the cake has never appeared during our stay
c4500054,s5,"We've passed our cellphone for their staff to recharge and were told that it would take 1-2 hours and they will contact us once recharge completed, yet no one contacted us after more than 3 hours"
c4500054,s6,We've asked the staff to return the phone nevertheless since it was late night yet it took them more than 40mins to return…
c4500055,s1,"I had not wanted to review this hotel, but after reading the reviews here I thought I should do one as a reality check"
c4500055,s2,This is a luxurious 6-star hotel with 3 star service
c4500055,s3,"Sure, the hotel and room were lovely"
c4500055,s4,The photos posted by the reviewers are completely accurate
c4500055,s5,I paid about $280 Singapore dollars for a huge beautiful room that would have cost an arm and leg in Singapore and London
c4500055,s6,But the hotel is very new so therefore everything was in mint condition
c4500055,s7,I just hope they keep it that way
c4500055,s8,Reason for my stay there was to attend a conference
c4500055,s9,"Otherwise, there was nothing to attract me there"
c4500055,s10,"The hotel is located in the City of Dreams so unless you enjoy gambling and being surrounded by an unreal and tacky atmosphere, don't go there"
c4500055,s11,The area tries to replicate Las Vegas…
c4500056,s1,"Stayed in a room which was ""fashionable"" and big, but ultimately was poorly thought out"
c4500056,s2,Bathroom in particular was out of a design magazine but bath had nowhere to put soap etc
c4500056,s3,When stepping in you activated the plug and the adjacent shower did not drain
c4500056,s4,Restaurant shut after breakfast apparently to save money etc
c4500056,s5,etc
c4500056,s6,Staff had little clue generally and this is a three star hotel in a four star buiding with a five star mattress
c4500057,s1,I stayed at this hotel with my spouse and child
c4500057,s2,"The room is great, but the service is FAR BELOW my expectation of a Grand Hyatt"
c4500057,s3,"It took me 1/2 an hour to check-in and while I was waiting, I asked 3 different staff to allow me to use a house phone to call friends who had already checked-in and I was never actually guided to a house phone"
c4500057,s4,"After checking in, I went to the poolside"
c4500057,s5,2 staff advised there was no children's pool - but I found it myself at the end of the walkway
c4500057,s6,Poolside staff are the most TERRIBLE within the hotel
c4500057,s7,"It took them forever to bring our food and when they did, they forgot bowls & plates, I asked them 3 times and they finally could only bring my salad bowls"
c4500057,s8,Quite ridiculous service from a Grand Hyatt
c4500057,s9,Then my child got sick! A traveller's…
c4500058,s1,The trip mainly for celebrating my parent in law's birthday and ther wedding anniversary
c4500058,s2,We have booked 3 deluxe King room and the director confirmed us that she has upgrade all of us to suite
c4500058,s3,"When we got there, the front desk said there is no instructions and not even take one more step to help"
c4500058,s4,The kids were tired and so do the elderly and I just accepted the rooms
c4500058,s5,"Later on, the Director said front desk made a mistake and can switch us back to suite"
c4500058,s6,Forget it because all of them were taking nap already
c4500058,s7,She said she will send us some gift for the kids as a compensation
c4500058,s8,"You know what"" No show again""!!!    Even the deluxe king is not bad but there are something weired in our rooms"
c4500058,s9,There are some bugs in my room keep on bite my legs and the air conditioning is so…
c4500059,s1,Stayed in a deluxe room in the grand tower block for two night
c4500059,s2,The room was nice and big
c4500059,s3,However service and cleanliness were not top notch
c4500059,s4,I requested for extra bed during check-in at around 2pm and the staff promised that it will be set up at around 6plus
c4500059,s5,"When I return to the room at around 9,  the bed was still not set up"
c4500059,s6,Had to call the guest services to set up which they came after twenty minutes
c4500059,s7,"However,  the extra bed was dirty"
c4500059,s8,I can see clearly that the bed  has been lying in their store for a long time as the bed sheets is grey due to collection of dustp
c4500059,s9,"On top of that, there was unknown black stains on the bed sheets"
c4500059,s10,The king size bed is dirty as well
c4500059,s11,The bedsheets will unclean and possibly re-use as there is a sweaty smell which should be left behind by…
c4500060,s1,I do not remember how many time I've stay in Macau for vacation
c4500060,s2,The reason I chosed this hotel because it has a promotion on the person who birth @ June
c4500060,s3,50% off and I loved grand suite with a big sofa which is enough for 2 people sleep
c4500060,s4,"so we've planned to stay 3D2N, and I did studied on web what is about good or bad things about this hotel, I knew the worst thing is check in & out"
c4500060,s5,"Forunately I've no problem at all when the time I checkin, maybe we were very late around 6pm and no one was on queue for checking in"
c4500060,s6,It took only 5 mins to get the key
c4500060,s7,"Everything is so nice and smooth, except"
c4500060,s8,"the last day we are ready to check out, I spent 30 mins to wait on queue only for checking out"
c4500060,s9,"After I finished checkout, I left our luggage on bell service and then head for lunch"
c4500060,s10,…
c4500061,s1,It was a busy day obviously during my check-in as I queued for about 10 minutes at the Front desk
c4500061,s2,But I was glad to see how the staffs interacted with other guests before me
c4500061,s3,"It was fine while I was waiting until I saw and heard something unpleasant- a staff called Mani, yelling and questioning at another staff at the check-in counter in front of a lot of people"
c4500061,s4,"Dumbfounded and feeling unease, I was not sure if I was at a five star hotel"
c4500061,s5,Checking in is supposed to be a nice experience and the hotel staff should not deliver any anger and worry to the guest directly or indirectly
c4500061,s6,Witnessing the staff  suffered in humiliation was a surprise to me and it totally changed my perception of Hyatt culture
c4500061,s7,I was not sure if Mani is the manager but her attitude is so inconsistent to…
c4500062,s1,"Front Desk:  - Unfriendly and not helpful staffs - Staffs were not smart enough, they gave poor feedback on customer's every question, no matter how simple the question was  Hotel Baggage Service: - Helpful and friendly staffs  Restaurant (Mezza 9 Macau):  - Staffs were unfriendly - Receptionist was rude - Staffs were not helpful, you had to ask everytime to get what you want - Some staffs were just chatting but not serving"
c4500062,s2,"- Staffs were not smart enough, I found the manager had to take care of the guest's request by himself while other staffs were not helping (they were chatting or acting like they didnt care about the guest) - Staff's english needed to be improved, at least they should know some simple terms about the food they were serving  Operator: - Very helpful and…"
c4500063,s1,"We was recently staying in Grand Hyatt Macau, however, it was an unpleasant experience during our check in and would like to share with you"
c4500063,s2,We used to staying at Four Season Macau and We heard Grand Hyatt just opened in Macau
c4500063,s3,"For the curiosity and the change of the environment, we decided to stay at Grand Hyatt over the Easter holiday this time"
c4500063,s4,We made an reservation for 3 rooms 1 night over their website a month ago
c4500063,s5,"Few weeks ago, we received the Amex statment that they overcharged us for one night"
c4500063,s6,So we called them to correct the booking as they said they would refund to us during our checked-in and they would make a note on the computer
c4500063,s7,We arrived at Grand Hyatt a little over 1pm on 4 Apr
c4500063,s8,"The woman ( afterward, we found out she was the duty manager at that time) over…"
c4500064,s1,My husband and my kids stayed here for 2 nights right before Christmas
c4500064,s2,We are Grand Hyatt Gold Passport holder
c4500064,s3,We are used to Grand Hyatt standard
c4500064,s4,The hotel hardware itself is very nicely done and up to Grand Hyatt standard
c4500064,s5,"However, their staffs in this hotel are totally lack of Hyatt standard and training except for the duty manger called Eric"
c4500064,s6,We have major problem at the front desk; we were given a Hyatt Gold passport discount coupon (US $100 off) from our Gold passport club to be used on any room rate
c4500064,s7,The expiry date was globally extended until Dec
c4500064,s8,"31st, 2009 instead of Nov"
c4500064,s9,"30th, 2009 and it was confirmed directly to us by the US Gold Passport centre"
c4500064,s10,"However, when we check it, the front desk clerk (named Donna) without first checking with her superior, questioned…"
c4500065,s1,Negative impressions started with arrival
c4500065,s2,"Lobby can seem grand, but the reception area is a bit of a mess - a string of counters, not right together and no coherent line or way to approach --- indeed, a bellhop had taken our confirmation slip to get our check in processed, but he was unable to get anyone's attention and we lingered in limbo for quite a while (with an infant to boot)"
c4500065,s3,"On top of that, though we'd requested 'early checkin' from a list of options with our package, at 2:45 the room still wasn't ready -- 3pm is standard check in and we got in about that time"
c4500065,s4,"However, staff was relatively accommodating with late checkout"
c4500065,s5,"Room though is huge, a true suite with separate living room and bedroom areas, much more so than the Venetian's (though bathroom isn't quite as…"
c4500066,s1,Booked 2 Suite Rooms to celebrate 50th wedding anniversary with family
c4500066,s2,"Made mention of anniversary at reservation, and also at front office"
c4500066,s3,They did NOTHING for the stay
c4500066,s4,"We arrived the hotel at 11am, they said the rooms could only be ready at 3pm"
c4500066,s5,We emphasized to them a special dinner was arranged at 6pm
c4500066,s6,"When we got back at 3pm, only 1 room is ready"
c4500066,s7,(NOT A GOOD START) They told us the other room will be ready SOON (finally not until 6pm)
c4500066,s8,The suite rooms are spacious but not up to a 5-star hotel hygienic (probably the housekeeper don't have sufficient time to clean the bathroom)
c4500066,s9,NEW HOTEL BUT DISAPPOINTED
