c55000000,s1,"The place is nice, but the management is dishonest"
c55000000,s2,"I used my Creditcard to pay 1000 dollars deposit a few months ago, but they did not refund me"
c55000000,s3,"May I remind you, integrity and honesty is very important"
c55000001,s1,"While staying there recently, and since our stay there, my husband and I have since been down with both lung and eye infection"
c55000001,s2,"While staying there, my husband and I experienced difficulty in breathing but were not sure what may be the cause of these issues"
c55000001,s3,We asked the hotel to investigate the air vents in our room to clean out the vents and filters
c55000001,s4,They apologized after sending their HVAC engineer to investigate and even gave us a bottle of Prosecco and other gifts to apologize
c55000001,s5,"We thought it was due to poor ventilation in our room and didn’t think too much about it, but after checking out for about a week now, we are still experiencing the same symptoms that we got while there"
c55000001,s6,To the St Regis Hotel Management / Marriott Bonvoy Management: Please kindly investigate…
c55000002,s1,I am writing this review 2:15am at St Regis Macau and hoping I can cool down and  sleep soon!    We picked this hotels because it's long term repetition and remarkable services
c55000002,s2,Not sure we got any of these in the stay
c55000002,s3,Check in : The front desk staff services was great as usual
c55000002,s4,"However, we booked 3 rooms and arrive at 1430, official check in time is 1500, we thought the rooms should be ready but they weren't"
c55000002,s5,We were told one of the room is almost ready and rest not yet
c55000002,s6,"We came back at 1530, 2 of the rooms are ready but one still not"

c55000002,s8,My baby needed to use my aunts toilet because our rooms wasn't ready
c55000002,s9,"It was so inconvenience!  Stay : Before we sleep, we…"
c55000003,s1,Third time staying here now
c55000003,s2,Overall the hotel infrastructure is great and is unlike many of the other more tacky Macau options
c55000003,s3,"Check-in was smooth and attentive, rooms are good and comfortable"
c55000003,s4,The bar has much improved and now the bartenders know how to make regular cocktails very well and were v friendly and professional; hostesses warm and chatty
c55000003,s5,Pool area is spacious but maybe too much? Feels a bit dead and like a vast concrete area outside
c55000003,s6,"Maybe some landscaping changes (greenery, divisions, wood, music) and work on atmosphere would make it feel less brutal and more welcoming and comfortable"
c55000003,s7,"Only real, but major issue, was there were a lot of pretty rough tourists staying there, one of whom at breakfast decided I was not being swift enough for their impatience and…"
c55000004,s1,We have been travel around and always choose St
c55000004,s2,"Regis as our first choice, but after this time, we will change to other 5 stars brand hotel"
c55000004,s3,"We are celebrating our anniversary and my birthday, so about few days ago, we have already booked a room through Trip"
c55000004,s4,com and sent an email to St
c55000004,s5,"Regis to double confirm everything, cause this time of staying means a lot to me and my fiancé"
c55000004,s6,Unfortunately we didn’t have a good time of staying here
c55000004,s7,"First, we bring our own cake and asked for serve at 10pm, but we came back earlier so we called and ask for serve at 9:30"
c55000004,s8,"When the staff bring the cake to us, it’s not what we think the way to “serve”"
c55000004,s9,"He bring me the cake with whole packing, no plates, no forks, not even light up candle for us"
c55000004,s10,We have been to many other 5 stars brand…
c55000005,s1,"Been to Macau 4 times, worst hotel here so far"
c55000005,s2,"Rooms are tiny, expensive (can be near $1000 AUD per night for a standard room) and you have to wait for breakfast (now 2nd morning in a row I’ve had to wait for over 10 minutes for buffet breakfast!), cockroach in my room (not a huge deal but annoying on top of everything else)"
c55000005,s3,"The staff/people are amazing though, very friendly and they do want to help but the actual hotel/infrastructure isn’t great"
c55000005,s4,I’m in a St Regis suite
c55000005,s5,Try Sheraton (better value as only level 4 SPG compared to level 6) or Wynn or Banyan Tree (amazing!!!)  Have fun!
c55000006,s1,"WARNING: If you are ASIAN or COLORED people, you would be treated differently in this hotel"
c55000006,s2,I have never been treated this bad in a five star luxury hotel in my entire life
c55000006,s3,My white Australian friend and I (Asian) recently stayed at the St Regis Macau for one night during our trip around Macau and China
c55000006,s4,I am a SPG Gold member
c55000006,s5,"When we checked out, the front desk staff asked about our stay, I said we were happy, except we did not get upgraded to an enhanced room, which is a STANDARD benefit for Gold member"
c55000006,s6,"We booked a Cotai view room, and we did not even get the view from our bed"
c55000006,s7,"All we could see was another hotel, we had to stand by the window in order to see the Cotai view"
c55000006,s8,I believed we had been downgraded
c55000006,s9,"The staff apologized and told her Room Operations Manager,…"
c55000007,s1,I booked a suite with my wife to celebrate her birthday on 29-March
c55000007,s2,The good part about my stay is that butler service there was amazing especially a girl named Elaine who serves us very well
c55000007,s3,"If it wasn't for her service, my rating for this property would be terrible and not poor!  They offered a butler doll to my wife as a birthday gift and also some baby toys to my soon-to be born baby"
c55000007,s4,Coffee and tea are free during the stay and the deliver time is always within 10 minutes which is good
c55000007,s5,The bad part which caused them such low rating are the other departments beside butler team
c55000007,s6,I arrived very late that night and I was in a hurry to celebrate my wife birthday at mid-night
c55000007,s7,Since it was my first time going to St
c55000007,s8,"Regis, I am not sure where it was"
c55000007,s9,I drove my car to…
c55000008,s1,I was there for my wedding anniversary with my 7 months old boy
c55000008,s2,i clearly mentioned this upon reservation made but all these are not up to any expectation
c55000008,s3,1
c55000008,s4,requested a baby cot and this is the only thing pre-set in room
c55000008,s5,"i need to ask for baby shower basin, sterilizer and baby blanket afterwards"
c55000008,s6,"if you worry about safety, why dont you just ask me upon C/I? i can sign the liability form once and for all? 2"
c55000008,s7,mentioned the stay is wedding anniversary but only room upgraded
c55000008,s8,not even a card or any amenities set up or even a staff say congratulation
c55000008,s9,3
c55000008,s10,"i paid for a stay beyond my expectation, not to check your room situation"

c55000009,s1,I stayed at the St Regis for two nights
c55000009,s2,There are quite a lot 5-star hotels in Macau and St Regis is not a good one among them
c55000009,s3,It is located at the end to the south of Cotai Central
c55000009,s4,"I took the Sands shuttle bus, it dropped me off at Sheraton"
c55000009,s5,I have to walk a long way to the hotel
c55000009,s6,The rate was high for the room that I stayed
c55000009,s7,It is smaller than other 5-star hotel rooms
c55000009,s8,There is no coffee machine in the room
c55000009,s9,The complimentary bottle water they provide is cheap
c55000009,s10,"Maybe I am just picky but for the same room rate, other 5-star hotel like Wynn Palace or Galaxy do better"
c55000010,s1,The relatively poor rating is all down to the fact that it is branded as Starwood's top tier and my expectations were expectantly high
c55000010,s2,"The hotel just lacks any character or soul; it is not awful by any stretch of the imagination, but bland and boring"
c55000010,s3,"The Lobby is relatively small,  but that's fine, nice not to have a typical over the top Macau Lobby; but the reception area on the first floor is awful; it feels like an after thought next to the entrance to a Casino and a very uninspiring corridor to other Cotai hotels and shopping"
c55000010,s4,Sitting down to check in you just want to be anywhere else
c55000010,s5,"The restaurant is so unappealing, a whole row of glass exit doors onto the same uninspiring corridor to shops and again feels like an after thought to the design"
c55000010,s6,"The room, one word…"
c55000011,s1,"Stayed at the hotel with my family during Christmas holiday - being an fun of st regis brand,  it came as a shock to us - the overall standard of the hotel, from overall staffs' services to room decor and hardware, the hotel feels more like a Sheraton business hotel than a five star St regis"
c55000011,s2,"First, the size and decor of the room, you could easily get much better value and quality from the conrad (next door) or Ritz Carlton (all suite, and much better trained staff /thus services)"
c55000011,s3,"The room does provide locally produced ""Bonaqua ""distilled drinking water for the guests (did not even bother changed to hotel label), feeling like they were taken straight from convenient store, let alone no welcome cookie/fruits, given its holiday seasons, letting alone it's almost basic for any…"
c55000012,s1,"everything about this hotel is wrong, not up to St"
c55000012,s2,Regis standards
c55000012,s3,"No branded shuttle bus at the pier, no one tells you where to get off from the general shuttle bus,  no water or refreshment in the lobby, no one greets you or help you with the luggage in the lobby"
c55000012,s4,"Room is ok, but bathroom is very small for St"
c55000012,s5,Regis
c55000012,s6,"No butler service, and no room turn-down service at night, very limited facilities, no kid club, dinning area is very small"
c55000012,s7,Managers don't take serious about guest complaints
c55000012,s8,"Won't go back again, and won't recommend it to any of my friends"
c55000012,s9,The holiday inn and Sheraton next door have bigger lobby and much better facility
c55000013,s1,This is a brand new hotel in macau that opened up in mid-decemeber 2015
c55000013,s2,I came here to spend one night to treat my parents for holidays
c55000013,s3,Firstly I knew check-in wasnt until 3pm
c55000013,s4,I showed up at 2pm and being a SPG gold member i approached the SPG desk checkin
c55000013,s5,The women furiously typing away on keyboard after 15mins told me that only one room would be ready
c55000013,s6,"Which is fine, I gave that room to my parents"
c55000013,s7,I booked my room 3 months in advance and specifically requested a high floor room and to be on the same floor as my elderly parents
c55000013,s8,I came back at 3pm to checkin for the second room
c55000013,s9,No luck
c55000013,s10,They told me hotel was full and the only room that was available was at a low level room
c55000013,s11,This is absolutely unacceptable and ridiculous!! The person who helped me had little power and…
c55000014,s1,I stayed here for one night on Christmas day with my partner
c55000014,s2,The hotel is brand new and there are lots of kinks and feels nothing like a St
c55000014,s3,Regis as far as service is concerned
c55000014,s4,"Before I get into the details, I just have to say I won't be returning to this hotel anytime soon"
c55000014,s5,"There are other options in Macao, all of which offer much better value for money"
c55000014,s6,"Check-in:  Since it was Christmas day, the hotel was full of guests"
c55000014,s7,We arrived and was shown to the reception by the bell boy who insisted in speaking Mandarin with us despite us returning his every question in English
c55000014,s8,Not all Asians speak Mandarin and good service is all about flexibility and adjusting to the guest
c55000014,s9,"Upon arriving at the reception area, there was a large group of guests clamouring for the first…"
