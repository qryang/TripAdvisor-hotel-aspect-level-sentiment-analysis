c35000000,s1,"Since our first stay in Mar 16, we have stayed here many times and always rated the hotel and staff highly, and been strong advocates recommending it to many friends"
c35000000,s2,"Unfortunately, our most recent stay was spoiled by a petty dispute on checkout, that was unwarranted, dragged on for almost half an hour and just unpleasant"
c35000000,s3,"We left with no resolution, the hotel refusing to budge"
c35000000,s4,"We have been patrons and advocates of this hotel, but not any more"
c35000000,s5,"Very unfortunate but lots of other great hotels in Macau, so looking forward to trying others"
c35000001,s1,"I have just finished my survey the hotel and as a silver HH member, I am just mad"
c35000001,s2,This was our second stay and to be honest it will be our last in Macau
c35000001,s3,Points are you know what
c35000001,s4,"The toilet clogged, we were not treated as members, the floors and carpets are awful and the worst"
c35000001,s5,what is with the water situation? Like two small bottles for each person? I had to go the gym to get more water because there is no 7-11 to get anything because that is what the casinos have done in order for you to pay top dollar
c35000001,s6,Totaly unacceptable
c35000001,s7,I LOVE the Hilton and Conrad hotels but I am not staying here again
c35000002,s1,We were allocated a room on a non smoking floor that smelled of smoke
c35000002,s2,It took the staff nearly an hour to find us a new room
c35000002,s3,Watch out for the charges they levy if you pay by Amex
c35000002,s4,They are not upfront about these
c35000003,s1,My worst stay in any 5 star hotel
c35000003,s2,Start with check in
c35000003,s3,The staff was a trainee we needed for check in over half an hour
c35000003,s4,Breakfast is right for a 2 star hotel
c35000003,s5,The internet was breaking down again and again
c35000003,s6,The air condition I was not able to control
c35000004,s1,"starting from check in, the experience really bad"
c35000004,s2,they cannot find one of our room and ask us to contact the travel agent
c35000004,s3,what kind of service is this FIVE star hotel
c35000004,s4,and after having a drink in its lobby bar
c35000004,s5,diarrhea and vomiting all night long
c35000004,s6,what a experience for us all!!!!
c35000005,s1,While I start to write I am sitting in a suite room of conrad macau itself
c35000005,s2,"Excellent part -   room size and upkeep Few great servicing individuals like -  Achin and Tyra at exec lounge and gentlemen who checked us in -  forgetting his name and Jim at restro grand orbit,  casino downstairs and part of cotai Sands connected to venetian and parasian from level 2 in mall"
c35000005,s3,And yup also Ricky and Stephen at concierge and Edmund prior to our visit   Good part - upgraded to suite as a diamond member of honors   Poor and arrogance -  when you travel with an infant 18 months old you need some flexibility
c35000005,s4,Which this place lacks big time -  comparably I am just coming from conrad Hong Kong and I can't mention how different in a good way and service standards were set by management of…
c35000006,s1,I chose Conrad Macau because the overall comment on the internet is very high
c35000006,s2,I did have a high expectation to visit the hotel but…
c35000006,s3,We checked in at 3:05pm which was advised by the hotel that the room should be ready after 3pm
c35000006,s4,"However, their staff told us we had to wait for another half an hour because our room was not ready?? We booked a Junior Suite which I believed this type of room shouldn't be that popular"
c35000006,s5,I don't understand why it wasn't ready yet
c35000006,s6,"After complaining to their manager, we then were offered to change another room"
c35000006,s7,"He said they ""upgraded"" us"
c35000006,s8,"But we found out it was still the same type of room but the only difference was ""1 King bed"" vs ""2 twin beds""???? I don't care about the upgrade"
c35000006,s9,It made me surprised that the international hotel like Conrad couldn't…
c35000007,s1,I am currently staying in the Conrad Macau for a brief getaway
c35000007,s2,I travel internationally for work each week and have never had such a poor experience
c35000007,s3,The check-in counter was poorly staffed (HHonors Desk) and the agent rarely spoke English
c35000007,s4,I had asked if any upgrades were available and he said he would look
c35000007,s5,He then mentioned none are available because I arrived too late
c35000007,s6,I had reserved the king deluxe city-view room and went to my room to find this was not correct
c35000007,s7,I then went up to the 39th floor club lounge to speak to the concierge
c35000007,s8,He proceeded to tell me the hotel had too many gold and diamond members to accommodate my request
c35000007,s9,I have never experienced a Hilton property mention that you needed to show up earlier for the upgrade
c35000007,s10,This is certainly not the number 1 hotel…
c35000008,s1,Sorry Conrad you are not a 5 Star Hotel
c35000008,s2,The reviews here actually confuse me
c35000008,s3,"For a real 5 star hotel just walk on over to the Four Seasons, St"
c35000008,s4,"Regis, or Ritz"
c35000008,s5,The over all rating should still a four but because everyone puts this a 5 I feel something odd is going on here
c35000008,s6,My family booked 2 rooms here on a Sunday based on reviews on this site and ranking of #1 Hotel in Macao
c35000008,s7,When we showed up at the hotel at 5:30PM the rooms were not ready yet and was told we would need to wait
c35000008,s8,I explained that we had plans for that evening and needed to get checked in to change and go to dinner and show
c35000008,s9,So the rather nice attendant inquired if we would be open to a 'smoking room'
c35000008,s10,whereupon I said absolutely not
c35000008,s11,After about 10 minutes they decided to upgrade us to a 1 bedroom…
c35000009,s1,I have stayed in this hotel for one night on July 1 with my family
c35000009,s2,It was a terrible experience and i doubted this is a 5-star hotel quality
c35000009,s3,"When i arrived at the hotel at 11am, the reception staff told me the hotel was full and the room will be ready at 3pm"
c35000009,s4,I had also requested slippers for children on the spot
c35000009,s5,"However, when i came back at 3pm, the reception staff told me the room was still dirty and they even couldn't advise how long we had to wait to check-in"
c35000009,s6,"Then, we waited at the lobby for another 1"
c35000009,s7,5 hours without any updates from the staff
c35000009,s8,We finally get into our room at 5pm until we rushed to the reception staff for updates
c35000009,s9,"In the room, we could not find the kid's slippers inside"
c35000009,s10,"Therefore, we called the ""personal service"" for the slippers again"
c35000009,s11,After…
c35000010,s1,Bell boy is helpful
c35000010,s2,"HOWEVER, I was upset by the front desk and your hotline's colleague"
c35000010,s3,29/FEB is my wedding anniversary
c35000010,s4,"I have requested a ""surprise"" during on-line booking"
c35000010,s5,"While checked in (on 28/FEB), front desk informed me that the "" surprise"" will be on 28/FEB/16"
c35000010,s6,"I corrected him immedialety and requested the ""surprise"" on 29/FEB/16  Unfortunately, a cake with the welcome letter delivered on 28/FEB/16"
c35000010,s7,Even the name of my wife is stated wrongly in the envolpe
c35000010,s8,"I have written down my request during the on-line book via your website I have called the hotline before my jourary to double confirm the requested can be done on 29/FEB However, the surprise came 1 day before what i requested"
c35000010,s9,What a big surpise to me
c35000011,s1,"Despite the facilities of this hotel are very pleasant and luxurious, but the front desk staff (multiple) were very IMPOLITE and UNPROFESSIONAL in customer services"
c35000011,s2,"Our group checked in for two rooms at around 12:45pm, and was told our rooms would have been ready by 2pm"
c35000011,s3,So we decided to take some rest and wait at the lobby to pick up our room key at 2pm
c35000011,s4,"At 2pm, it turned out neither of our room were ready, and when we asked follow-up question, the staff (multiple) started to make up excuse on why our rooms were not ready, such as housing keeping supervisor had not checked the room, room was not tied up, IT system was not working etc"
c35000011,s5,etc
c35000011,s6,etc
c35000011,s7,"Our group started to get frustrated on their nonsense, because all other check-in customers went up to their room smoothly at the…"
c35000012,s1,I had a terrible experience during my short stay
c35000012,s2,"On my first night, the hotel had a power blackout that lasted for about 3 hours - from 11 pm to 1 am"
c35000012,s3,There was no explanation on what had happened
c35000012,s4,"The next day, there was even no apology letter to the guests"
c35000012,s5,"On my second night, there was a short power blackout again"
c35000012,s6,"When I got to my room at around 10:30 pm, there was no TV service"
c35000012,s7,This lasted until early in the morning
c35000012,s8,"So, on the third day, I checked out leaving Conrad unsatisfied with the experience I had"
c35000013,s1,I stayed in Conrad Macau in April 2015
c35000013,s2,"Nothing fantastic about the hotel but since it was a business trip, I did not really bother too much"
c35000013,s3,"Upon check-out, I paid the bills as per what normal decent guest would have"
c35000013,s4,"Once back home, I settled by credit card accordingly as well"
c35000013,s5,"To my shock and surprised, about a month later, I received another charge on my credit card from Conrad Macau for the SAME amount which I have already paid a month ago"
c35000013,s6,I contacted the hotel and they confirmed that it was a double charge and they will refund
c35000013,s7,"I then reminded the hotel that they need to take note of the currency exchange rate, which Ken Xu promptly responded that he will take care of it and ensure there is no inconvenience to me"
c35000013,s8,"What happened next was, the hotel did a refund without…"
c35000014,s1,Would not stay here again
c35000014,s2,"Firstly, I just wanted to say that the Executive lounge and its staff are fabulous, and that aspect I will certainly recommend"
c35000014,s3,However what marred my stay was the following 1
c35000014,s4,Hot water not working in the shower this morning
c35000014,s5,2
c35000014,s6,The sound on the television in the bedroom kept going off every 5 mins or so
c35000014,s7,You had to turn the tv on and off to get it to put the sound back on
c35000014,s8,3
c35000014,s9,Last night I was having a Skype conference for work in my room
c35000014,s10,There was some type of concert/outdoor entertainment occurring which made it hard to hear
c35000014,s11,I rang down to reception to ask what it was and what time it would be finishing
c35000014,s12,I was very rudely told we cannot control outside noise
c35000014,s13,"I wasn't asking for anyone to do something, I just wanted information"
c35000014,s14,The staff member…
c35000015,s1,I went to this hotel for my honeymoon but my room was dirty with a big stain on the headboard when I walked in
c35000015,s2,They didn't even bother to switch the room for us so totally disappointed
c35000015,s3,I would not recommend this hotel to any traveler
c35000016,s1,I stayed at the Conrad Macao for two nights with my wife as a part of a group trip with 12 other friends
c35000016,s2,"I had also considered the Venetian, Galaxy, Four Seasons, and Sheraton"
c35000016,s3,"However, upon checking out available rooms and prices, I proposed to the group that we stay at the Conrad Macao Cotai Central"
c35000016,s4,I regretted this upon check-in
c35000016,s5,"My friend, who is a HHonors Platinum member helped us book (I am just a Blue level, normally preferring to stay at Marriott and InterContinental)"
c35000016,s6,"SERVICE  Normally, I include service as a part of my review of the Hotel and the Room"
c35000016,s7,"However, this time, the service at this hotel was so disappointing, I must address this from the start"
c35000016,s8,"Coming from Hong Kong, we were greeted at the Cotai ferry pier by a hotel representative"
c35000016,s9,As 6 of us were…
c35000017,s1,This hotel made an unauthorised charge for no-show on a booking that was cancelled two days before arrival with Hilton Worldwide Reservations (with confirmation number)
c35000017,s2,"The hotel claimed they did not receive the cancellation notification from reservations, none of this should be a guests' issue"
c35000017,s3,The lack of thought to even check whether the reservation had been booked before charging a credit card is careless
c35000017,s4,The fact that my credit card was charged without any notice from Conrad Macau by email or letter is questionable business practice
c35000017,s5,As a Gold Member of Hilton Honors I was extremely uncomfortable with this whole experience and this Hilton property needs to get its act together
c35000017,s6,Booking Reference: 3121131924 Cancellation number: 1569940157
c35000018,s1,"I never had met the worst treatment by the Conrad Macau Hotel receptionist "" Shaylee"" before"
c35000018,s2,I always go travel and have written serval positive reviews
c35000018,s3,I hesitated for some days to decide writing this review
c35000018,s4,"Firstly, I had made a reservation for Conrad Macau Hotel three months ago before stayed on 31/1/2014 to 2/2/2014 for 3 days"
c35000018,s5,"When I checked in, I needed spending some time for negotiating with the receptionist ""Shaylee"" for insisting asked to write my husband's name"
c35000018,s6,In booking list I mentioned two people to stay
c35000018,s7,"But, from Shaylee's attitude made me felt more like a criminal rather than a welcome guest"
c35000018,s8,"Secondly, we still spending time to negotiate for the complimentary preferential (see photo)"
c35000018,s9,"Thirdly, we got into the room (3801), when we saw the window view was…"
c35000019,s1,"We stayed at the Conrad Macau on the 20 Dec 2013 for 1 night and we were very disappointed of this ""5 star"" hotel"
c35000019,s2,"Firstly, there was no free wifi inside the room, I found it ridiculous in this day and age"
c35000019,s3,"Secondly, there was no electrical outlet in the bathroom, so we had to blow dry our hair in the corridor of the room by using their not so hot hairdryer"
c35000019,s4,(It probably took me 20 min for my medium-long hair)
c35000019,s5,"Thirdly, we found hair in both of our plates during breakfast and we were having a different dishes"
c35000019,s6,"Lastly, when we checked out on the 21 Dec 2013"
c35000019,s7,I found out that I left all my cosmetics inside the hotel when I got home (Hong Kong)
c35000019,s8,I called the hotel right away and they said they found it and will ask the Lost & Found department to contact me
c35000019,s9,No one contacted me…
c35000020,s1,Stay at Conrad Macau 14th to 17th November
c35000020,s2,"Paid approximately $550~600 SGD for a Night, stayed here for a total of 3 nights"
c35000020,s3,"Given the Price I've paid as a Starwood Preferred member, SADLY enough, wifi and breakfast was not included"
c35000020,s4,Wifi Usage has a separate charge
c35000020,s5,"To my astonishment, Conrad Macau pre-charged me in case of damages, almost 300 Singapore Dollars"
c35000020,s6,"Conrad Macao is the First ever hotel that I ever know of, who would pre charge customers for damages or whatever reason they have"
c35000020,s7,"Room is big and spacious, bed is comfortable"
c35000020,s8,Toilet is considerably SMALL compared to Sheraton and Venetian Macao
c35000020,s9,Conrad Toilet Bowl Flushing System is the worst I've had encountered in a 5 star hotel
c35000020,s10,I had to CALL for room service to request for make up room
c35000020,s11,Shuttle Bus to airport only…
c35000021,s1,"We recently stayed at the Conrad Macau and although there were positives to our stay, we found it to be, overall, a very disappointing trip"
c35000021,s2,Let me start with the good things about the hotel:  -The rooms are stunning
c35000021,s3,"We were in a standard kind-sized room and it was very, very spacious and beautifully appointed"
c35000021,s4,We were pleasantly surprised by the size of the room and bathroom
c35000021,s5,My daughter especially loved the giant tub! -The pool area was beautiful and despite the cruddy weather we really enjoyed our time down there
c35000021,s6,Two of the pools were heated and swimming was fine in spite of the cold
c35000021,s7,"The hot tub also looked really nice, but I did not go in"
c35000021,s8,"-The mall that it is attached to is quite nice, however the selection of western restaurants in very limited"
c35000021,s9,We often ate at the…
c35000022,s1,My experience with Conrad Macao started about 2 months ago when I decided to take my family to a trip to Macau for 3 days
c35000022,s2,"I booked 2 rooms with city view, and right after my booking, I emailed the hotel and requested to be put on the higher floors with better view and two rooms on the same floor, next to each other"
c35000022,s3,"a connecting room if possible and of course, it never hurts to ask for an upgrade"
c35000022,s4,Everything seemed okay and I even got an email from the staff I originally exchanged email with a few days before my check-in
c35000022,s5,"Upon arrival, as my sister checked in an hour earlier than me, I had to separately check-in even under the same booking which is understandable"
c35000022,s6,"Of course, being Easter Holiday, I did not expect to have any upgrade which is totally fine"
c35000022,s7,"When I checked in,…"
c35000023,s1,I am a frequent traveller and stayed at the Conrad Macao in July 2012
c35000023,s2,My experience was less than satisfactory
c35000023,s3,We checked-in at the Club Floor and were met by a snobbish Duty Manager - Nicole Chen
c35000023,s4,"She was rude, moody, not friendly at all and with limited vocabulary"
c35000023,s5,"Considering the money we spent on food, drinks and accommodation, we expected a reasonable level of service"
c35000023,s6,My husband and I wondered why Conrad Macao hires someone who is so inexperienced and with such poor manner
c35000023,s7,We certainly won't be returning to this hotel again
c35000023,s8,No thanks
c35000024,s1,"We thought that the Conrad Hotel was a luxurious 5-star hotel in Macau but to our surprise, the hotel facility/service was below that standard"
c35000024,s2,"First of all, we found that the toilet in our Club Suite was blocked up on 2 occasions during our 2 night stay & had to call the guest service twice to get their plumber to unblock the toilet"
c35000024,s3,"Secondly, the food variety available in the Club Lounge was limited"
c35000024,s4,We intended to take some hot dishes (e
c35000024,s5,g
c35000024,s6,"the buns & dumplings) which was supposed to be available in the afternoon tea but having waited for an hour, we only saw the waiters taking trays of food in from the kitchen & then abruptly taking them back to the kitchen since all of them were still cold (it was already 4:50 pm by that time)"
c35000024,s7,"Tired of waiting further, we just took a…"
c35000025,s1,I had specifically requested to stay at this hotel after reading the great reviews online
c35000025,s2,"However, during my stay with them a couple of weeks back for a business trip, I was utterly disappointed with the level of service quality at the Conrad"
c35000025,s3,"Quality of service was scattered all over the place, with the clear lack of sense of efficiency and direction"
c35000025,s4,"Not only that, the layout of the entire place doesn't even feel like I was staying in a proclaimed 5 star hotel"
c35000025,s5,Basically did not feel the unique sense of belonging and the satisfaction of being pampered upon
c35000025,s6,Honestly had expected better service
c35000025,s7,"On top of that, the main triggering factor was that I had specifically requested for a high level city view"
c35000025,s8,Instead I was given a low rise floor that reeked of smoke with a…
c35000026,s1,The hotel is new and is part of a complex that includes the Holiday Inn and the Sheraton Hotel
c35000026,s2,The Conard claims to be a 5-star hotel and in many respects this is true
c35000026,s3,"Staff are ultra attentive, the room was large and well equipped, and the pool area, spa and gym were of equal quality"
c35000026,s4,"However, except for the quality of the staff, nothing was really outstanding, just the usual acceptable 5-star quality"
c35000026,s5,What is really off putting with the Conard is that everything else is missing that one usually associates with a 5-star hotel
c35000026,s6,"By this I mean restaurants, fine dining, a decent bar"
c35000026,s7,The Conard is in effect located in a Casino and a rather large Shopping Mall
c35000026,s8,The hotel lobby is separate from the Casino and Shopping Mall but that is about all
c35000026,s9,What passes for a bar is…
c35000027,s1,"I just spent a night in this new hotel in Cotai Strip and we are most disappointed with the poor, non-existent service of this hotel"
c35000027,s2,1
c35000027,s3,"When we were lining up for taxi, we were being pushed in by another mandarin speaking tourist"
c35000027,s4,"My husband told him to line up like everybody else but was shouted at and me, being a pregnant wife, felt threatened and looked to the usher at the taxi stand but he just looked on and did not attempt to mediate the situation"
c35000027,s5,We find this unacceptable as we feel it would be the usher's job not only to stand there (he did not even open the taxi doors for the guests) but really to attend to the line and make sure the passengers can be safely escorted off the hotel property
c35000027,s6,2
c35000027,s7,We requested for a non-smoking room on a non-smoking floor
c35000027,s8,"However,…"
