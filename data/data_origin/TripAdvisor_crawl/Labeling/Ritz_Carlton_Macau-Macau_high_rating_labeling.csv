c60000,s1,We stayed for two nights
c60000,s2,"Minutes after we entered the suite right after check-in, a playing/sleeping tant with kid’s  amenities were delivered together with a handwritten card with our daughter’s name on and Princess Elsa’s image ( which she treasures like crazy during the stay, holding it to sleep, even after we checked out, believing that’s from Elsa saying “let’s have fun together”!) We had several room service and the experiences were all nice"
c60000,s3,"Though it happened that some of the order taker were not so familiar with the wine by the glass list, and some items were out of stock, but the room service staff were very helpful to make it up, making sure the entire dinning experience was perfect"
c60000,s4,The breakfast downstairs in the Ritz Carlton cafe was also good
c60000,s5,"We have dined there several times before, this time is as good as always"
c60000,s6,"Front desk service was efficient upon check in and check out, and there’s a little kids corner to entertain young kids while waiting, which is very useful! Housekeepers at evening were quite helpful too, being very friendly and thoughtful"
c60000,s7,Offered us the bath service by seeing us being tired from the day and brought us the lavender bath-bomb
c60000,s8,"In general, it’s one of the top choices among so many hotels in the region"
c60000,s9,No matter the facilities or service
c60000,s10,Highly recommend!…

c60002,s2,"My wife had booked a book at RC to celebrate my birthday, and we were just amazed for what the team has done - They knew that i was staying with a kid, so the first surprise we received when we got into the room was the RC signature kid's safari (kid's tent) along with kid's amenities; next were the birthday decoration and the arrangements (cake and chocolate, etc); last but the the least was a heartwarming gift - a handmade photo album with wishes from every team members, I was really so touched when seeing it"
c60002,s3,"Words just could not describe how much I appreciated your efforts, what you have done just blew me away"

c60002,s5,"Good job and well done, thanks again RC team!…"
c60003,s1,My stay at Ritz Carlton with my boyfriend was definitely the best experience ever
c60003,s2,"Ahead of the check-in, I got a warm greeting email from the team"

c60004,s5,"And what made it extra memorable was the level of care given by the Guest Services Supervisor Rev, he truly went above and beyond and took such good care of us during the whole stay"
c60004,s6,I was planning to decorate the room by myself while my girlfriend was enjoying the hotel facilities and Rev just offered to help me with the decorations
c60004,s7,and guess what? it turned out better than expected!! His outstanding service and attention to details really made this wonderful holiday memorable

c60006,s8,"As a non gambler, it fits me really well"
c60006,s9,Actually the hotel itself has a casino
c60007,s1,Had a relaxing stay at the waterfront king room
c60007,s2,the panoramic view was perfect overlooking the macau/taipa bridge especially at night

c60010,s3,"But with indoor swimming pool, I can still enjoy it"
c60010,s4,"A minor disappointment for me is that, the casino has only 1 type of game with table, Baccarat, other games like roulettes has machine game only"
c60010,s5,"The hotel has shuttle bus to go to other area in Taipa, please check with the hotel"
c60011,s1,Thank you to all the staff at Altira for their help and understanding as a marathon runner competing in the Macau International Marathon

c60013,s1,The hotel situated in the heart of Taipa which is an ideal place if you want somewhere far from the casino area
c60013,s2,The hotel itself is amazing and every single staff is very professional and well-trained
c60013,s3,We stayed here to celebrate our anniversary the only drawback is that the hotel only offers special amenities to those who come for birthday or honeymoon only
c60013,s4,Somehow we think that it might not be fair to those who really come for real anniversary
c60013,s5,"However, the hardware of this hotel (i"
c60013,s6,e the room view) “compensated” and we ended up having a very pleasant stay
c60013,s7,The room is spacious enough and the view is one of the best in Macao I am sure

c60014,s8,Their ginger tea is divine
c60014,s9,"They have luxurious treatment rooms with your own personal Jacuzzi,  a king size bed for relaxing on,  a rain shower along with side shower…"
c60015,s1,"We reserved breakfast package, but we did not receive any requests for breakfast, and we called directly"
c60015,s2,and we woke up at 4 a
c60015,s3,m
c60015,s4,"in the bathroom, and we woke up and saw the sound when next-door customer was using shower in the next room, so I couldn't sleep until the sound stopped"

c60018,s4,"I just say “yes, perfect” and she made the reservation for me"
c60018,s5,"Once I stepped into the hotel room,  the pleasant welcoming fruits were there waiting for me"
c60018,s6,😊 But real delightful experience was that a hotel staff brought in welcome tea soon after I walked around the room and started to admire the night sea view from the room

c60027,s3,"So now complete for all service, suppose one of best hotel in Macau!!"
c60028,s1,"During my first visit, I thought the location of the hotel is not favourable since it is far away from other attractions"
c60028,s2,"In fact, it has become its unique attraction"
c60028,s3,I can explore local cafes and Macau people life style by visiting nearby areas
c60028,s4,Taipa has many good restaurants and they are just walking distance from Altira
c60028,s5,Staffs are helpful and always ready to assist
c60028,s6,Should  visit roof top bar and it has outdoor area for smokers like me!  Excellent!

c60034,s11,"Lounge staff was very attentive to the service, always smiling and…"
c60035,s1,I think Altira is a very nice hotel
c60035,s2,The room is big and nice
c60035,s3,The staffs of the hotel are so nice
c60035,s4,I only think location is quite far from Sand Cotai Strip which is the centre of entertainment of Macau
c60035,s5,Altira should provide more shuttle bus to Venetian Hotel or Galaxy Hotel and the operation hour of the shuttle bus should be longer than now
c60035,s6,Thank you
c60036,s1,I stayed for one night only
c60036,s2,"Yea~ as expected it was fabulous! We may say it was a amazing stay! The standard room is good for family already, just add a extra bed"
c60036,s3,"We ordered a room service food also , it was okay"
c60036,s4,Service is great
c60036,s5,They offered a free shuttle to cotai
c60036,s6,Super market is just nearby
c60036,s7,Altira is highly recommend for those who want travel macau
c60036,s8,⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
c60037,s1,I was happy to make happy memories with my mom before I got married
c60037,s2,"Although I am not good at English, I thank Skyo for being accurate and kind"
c60037,s3,"Because the Portuguese restaurant I want to go is fully booked, Mr"
c60037,s4,Jacky recommended another restaurant to me and I was able to have a delicious meal
c60037,s5,The view of the indoor swimming pool was magnificent
c60037,s6,And it was nice to relieve the fatigue of the trip at the spa in these cold days
c60037,s7,"The hotel was fragrant, and the amenities and the prepared tea were excellent"
c60037,s8,"It was unfortunate that there weren't many shuttles, but it's convenient to take a bus or a taxi"
c60037,s9,It was nice to have many restaurants on foot for about 15 minutes
c60037,s10,"If I go to Macau again, I will stay in Altera without hesitation"
c60038,s1,"this boutique like hotel  has a wamr, high class feel"
c60038,s2,staff are super and very attentive to your needs
c60038,s3,the restaurants are faboulous
c60038,s4,"but what I like is that unlike some of the bigger hotels with thousands of guests, Altira is warm and after the bustling lights of macau you can return o a wonderful room in peace"
c60039,s1,We attended an event at this hotel and stayed one night and were pleasantly surprised
c60039,s2,"As this property primarily caters to high roller gamblers, this was largely free of noisy crowds that plague other Macau hotels"
c60039,s3,"The entire hotel has great ocean views (for the time being), guestrooms are relatively large (50-60 sq m) and well designed"
c60039,s4,"We had a good Spa experience in a ""Couple's Room"" (for a MOP500"
c60039,s5,surcharge) that featured a private sauna and Jacuzzi
c60039,s6,Service was very prompt and courteous
c60039,s7,"The only downside I found is that there is no dedicated restaurant for western breakfast, so in-room dining / room service is the only option"
c60039,s8,"While not the most economical hotel, it was an oasis in an otherwise crowded and noisy market in Macau; I would return again"
c60040,s1,"We stayed at some airbnb nearby and went there to store our luggages after  check out, suggested by the owner"
c60040,s2,"I wasn't quite sure if it works because usually hotels don't allow non staying guest to store luggage or some hotels in Macau, they charge for each piece of luggage stored"
c60040,s3,"We went thinking that we ll get rejected, but they were so friendly and accommodating"
c60040,s4,"I met Keith and he assured that we got our luggage kept with no additional charge, and even for a group of 8 with more than 10 luggages, he was happy to assist us"
c60040,s5,Getting our luggages back was no hassle
c60040,s6,The team helped us to call for taxi and load our luggages in
c60040,s7,We were wowed by their hospitality and we really appreciate it
c60040,s8,"I couldn't get all the names and thank each and everyone, but a big thank you to…"

c60042,s1,"Altira serves professionally more than 5 star quality! All employees have been well trained, being attentive, friendly, professional, make me feel like super VIP all time during my stay"
c60042,s2,"Each and every bit of Altira, even a tea pot and cups, are high end quality"
c60042,s3,"Altira surprises me in all aspects, in fact more than I could expect"
c60042,s4,"A 5 star hotel however serves more than that, I think Altira should be rated 6 Star!"
c60043,s1,"if you want to go Best Spa & Pool, you must experience Altir Hotel"
c60043,s2,"It have best service, cleaness room, huge room, etc"
c60043,s3,Best condition
c60043,s4,But Casino is not recommend
c60043,s5,Because it have not Black-jack game
c60043,s6,It's my favorite game
c60044,s1,"What a fantastic spa, hotel and restaurants! The service was Five Stars Plus! Love Ying and their Michelin Star Menu"
c60044,s2,The spa and pool are the best
c60044,s3,Forbes 5 Star in every way
c60044,s4,The views are spectacular and it is difficult to find a staff that is more service oriented than what we saw at Altira
c60044,s5,"If in Macau, impress your significant other with a night at Altira - Ying and 38 Lounge (on the 38th floor)"
c60045,s1,Highly recommended hotel in Macau! The most beautiful view of Hotel in Macau!
c60045,s2,Tasty restaurant and comfort SPA service!  Everything is wonderful except  no shutter bus available from airport to hotel

c60046,s1,"First, All staffs are very kind"
c60046,s2,They were always smile and said Hi
c60046,s3,So I had a happy time in Altira
c60046,s4,"Second, room was Greeeaaat! my room was ocean view, so on the bed you can see the beautiful Macau ocean view day and night"
c60046,s5,I thought night view is fantastic
c60046,s6,"Plus, room size and bathtub were big"
c60046,s7,"third, the hotel was calm"
c60046,s8,"Altira is not in Cotai, so you feel transportation is not good"
c60046,s9,"but It has shuttle bus goes to COD and etc, and many bus stations are nearby so you can move everywhere of Macau"
c60046,s10,I recommend Altra If you want to have happy memory in Macau
c60047,s1,The room is a great surprise facing Macau side and observing with detail the huge structure been build to accommodate the bridge Hong Kong -Zhuhai- Macau
c60047,s2,The indoor pool is gorgeous and very well maintained
c60047,s3,All experience from check in /check out was wonderful
c60047,s4,A must see
c60048,s1,This hotel was without a doubt just incredible!  Where to start? Firstly when we arrived we got scammed by a taxi driver charging 200HKD for a 10-minute drive
c60048,s2,I knew this wasn't right so I photographed his ID and vehicle's licence plate
c60048,s3,"(In hindsight, tell a driver who does this and not by the meter to either switch on the meter or take you to the police station where you will be reporting him)"
c60048,s4,"Anyway, we told the staff and they immediately got on the phone and got the ball rolling with reporting the man to the transport bureau and to check their own CCTV of his vehicle"
c60048,s5,They were very helpful and efficient
c60048,s6,"We didn't want the money back, just wanted this conman of a driver to pay for his sins and hopefully he got what he deserved!   Now let's talk about the suite! Wow, what…"
c60049,s1,After my chemotherapy journey finally we can stay in hotel again
c60049,s2,This stay is for my boys actually
c60049,s3,Who graduated in primary 6 and my other boy was top 2
c60049,s4,To reward them i booked one night stay
c60049,s5,The moment we stepped on the vicinity of hotel Emman the bellboy gave us a smile and a helping hand
c60049,s6,"He introduced the hotel to us until we reached to 38floor, the check in area"
c60049,s7,Then Glenn in check in area was very friendly and professional as well
c60049,s8,We are so satisfied in our corner room

c60050,s1,"Not so many hotels offer a cake for birthday celebration but Altira does! It is not about money but its courtesy and care! How can you go out and buy a cake in a city you are not familiar with? At mid-night, room service staff sent us the cake ( as we requested ) in professional manner"
c60050,s2,All staffs we saw were courteous and nice! We will come back for another celebration soon!
c60051,s1,Got a free room from friend who is a casino member

c60052,s1,This is my second stay and one thing always attracts my heart about this boutique hotel is the panorama view of bridges and beautiful skyline from top floor
c60052,s2,Service was seamless and offered late check out since my ferry time was 4 pm
c60052,s3,"Porters seemed busy but did not fail to run and get a taxi for us with cheerful smile , I think he is Filipino or maybe Nepal? Overall experience is perfect"
c60052,s4,Will be back!
c60053,s1,They have the best service in Macau
c60053,s2,The room is bigger than most of the rooms in Macau with a huge bathtub which fits more than one
c60053,s3,The service is absolutely stunning and the view is just shocked
c60053,s4,One small thing is that the light switch for the window lights are hard to find or maybe it doesn’t really exist that i need to sleep with the a bit lights on
c60053,s5,Perfect service from front desk Andrew
c60053,s6,Great in-room dining selections and food quality as well

c60055,s2,I have booked at Altira Macau Hotel because it was near to the ferry station
c60055,s3,The hotel is just unbelievable!! When you arrive you feel that starting from the first step through the hotel door to the lobby for check inn to the stunning room
c60055,s4,"Location:  The hotel location was in Taipa Island, near to the ferry station is you will use taxi or bus"
c60055,s5,Also it is near to some other attractions in the south of Macau
c60055,s6,If you will go to the north you can use the bus station which is only 5 minutes waling and go direct to North Island
c60055,s7,Room:  Best part in my trip was the hotel room
c60055,s8,"It was very big, comfortable, and the view was amazing during day time full big window on the sea and at night time full stunning view on the…"
c60056,s1,"The Hotel room was outstanding , was there to celebrate my birthday on a spa package  The Food at the Chinese Restaurant was Amazing  The Director of Room Alan Yu Sent me a Surprise Cake at 11:59pm That was a great gesture by him !

c60058,s1,Stayed there for a family vacation
c60058,s2,"At first, I wasn't familiar with the location as it is off to the other side of Macau (away from the casinos)"
c60058,s3,Checked in at the 38th floor and went to our room
c60058,s4,"Room was very spacious, the mini-bar had complimentary 2 beers, big double beds, and a spacious bathroom with a big bath tub and 2 sinks"
c60058,s5,The swimming pool was great
c60058,s6,It is an infinity pool in the middle of the building where you have a view of the city
c60058,s7,"They also have a huge spa, steam room, saunas, and locker rooms"
c60058,s8,Very clean and it was quiet

c60058,s10,Lots of restaurant choices around the hotel and a local market in walking distance
c60058,s11,The price is very affordable but high quality hotel
c60059,s1,Booked 2 Nights on a Waterfront view room for our Wedding Anniversary was the best thing we did
c60059,s2,From the welcoming front desk Staff Andrew that checks us in; from the Accomodating Fitness staffs at the 16th floor like Carlo and the other Filipino Staffs(sorry if we didn’t got all your names); From Elaine at the 38th lounge that took care of us and the magnificent Housekeeping staff that kept our room so elegant always

c60059,s4,Will definitely be seeing you guys again soon
c60059,s5,God bless and more power!
c60060,s1,"We had a really relaxing stay here this weekend, with the couples retreat(?) One night stay package which included a 1 hour spa treatment"
c60060,s2,"Hotel room was beautiful, and breakfast is in and was really nice; the only issue for breakfast is that strangely the website only offers the choice to add 1 breakfast to the package, which caused confusion and delay at check in where we then had to add an ADDITIONAL breakfast"
c60060,s3,The only other criticism of the room was that there was only 1 large towel
c60060,s4,"Maybe this hotel is popular with singles? The spa couples room was really nice, we were treated very well and had the room and jacuzzi to ourselves for an additional hour after"
c60060,s5,The trip was finished off with a dip in the award winning indoor infinity pool that has the same view as all the…
c60061,s1,It’s my second time staying in this hotel
c60061,s2,I like tranquility as it’s not located in the busy area of where the major hotels are in Taipa
c60061,s3,"Though most people found it inconvenient, the shuttle bus takes you to the City of Dreams, Studio City and Taipa souvenir street"
c60061,s4,The restaurants inside the hotel are excellent
c60061,s5,"It’s also easy to take a bus to the main island, which is just 2 minutes away from the hotel"
c60061,s6,The room gives you the beautiful sea view with the Macau Tower and the glittering hotels
c60061,s7,I especially like the indoor pool which is well equipped with spa facilities
c60061,s8,I was very happy with my stay!
c60062,s1,Altira Macau is not like any hotels in Macau
c60062,s2,"but their big room is very clean, nice n good view too, n the service is awsome"

c60063,s1,Very large comfortable and stylish fitted out accommodation
c60063,s2,Great bed  huge comfortable couches with views across the water facing mainland Macau
c60063,s3,The indoor pool is great when other hotels have closed outdoor pools for winter and it has fantastic views over to mainland Macau
c60063,s4,Sauna and steam room within the gymnasium floor and fully equipped large gym with free weights and machines
c60063,s5,Overall a very convenient hotel away from the hustle and bustle but close to everywhere in Macau and I would stay again
c60064,s1,"Incredible hotel, a different calibre from the mass-catered hotels that Macau has been recently known for"
c60064,s2,"The check in on the 38th floor was seamless, with charming team at the front desk made sure we were well taken care of with a stunning room on the 21st floor"
c60064,s3,"The room itself was lush, a soft bed with beautifully pressed linen and a super cuddle-friendly couch if you're enjoying the stay with a special someone"
c60064,s4,"The giant bathtub was icing on the cake, with even a small TV on the top of the mirror so we'd have something to watch when soaking in the tub"
c60064,s5,The bathroom was wonderfully spacious (one small criticism is that the mirror isn't very friendly for women to apply make-up)
c60064,s6,"We used the pool once, which has nice spa facilities and changing areas"
c60064,s7,Everything was nicely…
c60065,s1,"Reception is on level 38, with stupendous views over mainland Macau! Want luxury? It abounds here"
c60065,s2,starting with the friendly welcome by the conceirge who escorts you in the lift to reception
c60065,s3,"After formalities, to the room"
c60065,s4,again escorted where room details are explained
c60065,s5,"Then the welcome from the floor butler, was it’s green tea and sumptuous"
c60065,s6,Chocolates and canapés
c60065,s7,It just gets better and better
c60065,s8,Though a business I was accompanied by my daughter
c60065,s9,Ideal as our luxurious room had 2 king size beds! A dressing room and separate wet room and WC! Ideal!!!
c60066,s1,We spent a non-chaotic but kinetic energy to have long lunch here
c60066,s2,This restaurant locates at higher floor can absorb sunlight; heard that watch fireworks is fantastic here
c60066,s3,Dessert is well presented and surprisingly by the container to display such a magical piece
c60066,s4,Also found a gadget of toothpick
c60067,s1,"We did the deluxe relaxation package, a massage and then a room for the night"
c60067,s2,We ordered room service which was excellent service and food
c60067,s3,"There's not much in the to do in the hotel, but we did hear the pool was good"
c60067,s4,"The spa was wonderful, there's a shower room and spa pool to use before or after the massage"
c60068,s1,I stayed in one hotel on my first day and was not comfy
c60068,s2,Then I transfered to this hotel
c60068,s3,I felt comfortable
c60068,s4,Specially the staffs are well mannered and very friendly
c60068,s5,The Filipino staffs are always smiling
c60068,s6,Always makes my day specially  because I came here for business and need the extra motivation
c60069,s1,We've just got back from Macau and our stay at Altira was amazing
c60069,s2,"It's a pity that we only stayed for 1 night, because the room was big and luxurious (note that we're used to Hong Kong apartment standards) and the view was stunning  Some of the best restaurants are in walking distance"
c60069,s3,"As we like to walk, we visited The Venetian, The Parisian and enjoyed the House of Dancing Water at City of Dreams"
c60070,s1,My friend & i celebrated our birthdays here & it was unforgettable
c60070,s2,"The moment i came to the reception, my friends (2 of them) & i were welcomed with water, we were given a tea set as we entered the room"
c60070,s3,"We went to the pool and as we came back to the room, fruit plate was served to us"
c60070,s4,A lot of drinks on the fridge were free
c60070,s5,I was quite disappointed with a particular guest that was with us on the pool as she kept complaining about us of just about anything she sees
c60070,s6,"She was kind of an irate guest, and wasn't minding her own business at all"
c60070,s7,As if she owned the building
c60070,s8,"Nonetheless, the staffs handled the situation very well and we were treated nicely and very welcome"
c60070,s9,The staffs are all smiling and warm towards us
c60070,s10,The view was amazing! And the movies were free inside the…
c60071,s1,I was staying in this hotel on 2 Feb for 1 night
c60071,s2,I booked via online travel agency and i was expensive than the normal day as for the chinese new year
c60071,s3,"I arrived from Taipa Ferry Terminal to the hotel, which only take us in 10 mins"
c60071,s4,"During checking in at around 4pm, i was informed my room was assigned on 36th floor as per my request and in very detail for presenting the facilities and ordering in room breakfast"
c60071,s5,"After check out, the front office lady saild happy birthday to me and I felt her sincere so much"
c60071,s6,"When i got in the room, the view was stunning"
c60071,s7,I can see the panorama of the sea and the Macau peninsula
c60071,s8,The room is spacious and simple decoration with style
c60071,s9,"Even though the room rate was expensive for me, I felt it was worthy"
c60071,s10,The hotel is not very far from the tourist…
c60072,s1,"Though the location is little bit inconvenient and without shuttle bus to major tourist attractions and ferry terminal, the nice hotel staff with 5-star service will let you enjoy the stay very much"
c60072,s2,Sure will stay there again next time
c60073,s1,Our stay at the hotel was a 5-star experience in every respect
c60073,s2,"From the moment you check in at the sky lobby, you will be awed by the drop-dead view of the entire bay and downtown Macau across"
c60073,s3,You will have both a day time and night time (city light) view
c60073,s4,Our room had the same view
c60073,s5,Everything in the room was quality
c60073,s6,Maid service was good and paid attention to details
c60073,s7,"The indoor pool and spa was impressive and with good service, and yes another great view as well"
c60073,s8,We noticed that a lot of things in the frig was free
c60073,s9,The only thing is that the location of the hotel is not at the heart of Cotai Strip and it does not offer shuttle service
c60073,s10,So we ended up having to take a cab everywhere we go
c60073,s11,There are a few acceptable local restaurants nearby that are open late
c60073,s12,The…
c60074,s1,From the moment we stepped out of the cab we could tell the Altira was going to be something special
c60074,s2,"The staff were friendly, professional and immaculately presented"
c60074,s3,"We were escorted up to reception on level 38, offered water and checked-in promptly"
c60074,s4,We were then escorted to our room
c60074,s5,We had a waterfront view king room and were frankly surprised at how spacious the room was and how spectacular the views
c60074,s6,"We entered into a wide entry way, walked past the enormous bathroom with double vanity, separate toilet, walk-in robe and amazing (and very large) tub with views of the waterfront, into the bedroom and sitting area with lounge and desk"
c60074,s7,Breakfast was included and was lovely; fast wifi was also complimentary
c60074,s8,"Water, soft drinks and beer from the minibar were also free of…"
c60075,s1,"I have stayed in more than 10 difference hotels in Macau before and this was the first time I stayed at Altira and was really impressed by the services, the facilities provided by the hotel as well as the hotel room"
c60075,s2,Check in / out at the 38 floor was fast
c60075,s3,Complementary breakfasts were offered to us even though my booking does not included breakfast (in fact I booked at a very very low price)
c60075,s4,Late check out at 2 pm was also granted in less than one minute after I requested
c60075,s5,"The water front room was big, comfortable and with a very nice view (I stayed at the 35th floor)"
c60075,s6,"The mini bar for drinks and beers, the movies on demand, internet are all complimentary"
c60075,s7,Indoor swimming pool is at the 16th floor and the counter also offer free drinks which included fresh fruit juices…
c60076,s1,We spent two nights in this hotel toward end December 2015
c60076,s2,"I must say that this is one of the few hotels that gives you a cozy environment to hide away from city life if you want to, or a base for you to explore interesting locations around"
c60076,s3,Our room is on the 35th floor which is only two floors below the front desk
c60076,s4,Rooms in this hotel spread from 37th floors all the way down the tall building with restaurant on the 10th floor
c60076,s5,Security is very good as you have to enter the hotel concierge on the ground floor before taking a lift all the way to the reception desk on the 38th floor
c60076,s6,Being on the high floor gives us very good view of Macau both day and night
c60076,s7,Room is spacious and mini bar is stocked with soft drink and beers for yours free
c60076,s8,If you want to stay all day in the…
c60077,s1,Well
c60077,s2,"i`ve been traveling the world, and visiting many cool hotels over the year, but the room in Altira blew my brains"
c60077,s3,"AMAZING!   the service is impeccable , HUGE rooms, super well designed, every little detail is thought off and to top it off the minibar is FREE yes"
c60077,s4,FREE! beers/soft drinks/water
c60077,s5,and the view of the bay oh wow
c60077,s6,bawler hotel
c60077,s7,A M A Z I N G!
c60078,s1,"Room was clean , whole hotel experience very good"
c60078,s2,"Had a swim in there wonderful pool, very helpful afterwards took us to the spa pool, had a sauna , and after wards u could shower and had everything from cream to hairdryer"
c60079,s1,best place to live for a luxury stay in macau
c60079,s2,"costs as much as other hotels but the rooms, views and the space is amzaing"
c60079,s3,the morning breakfast is to die for
c60079,s4,just absolutely divine
c60079,s5,If i have the budget definietly is on my list for macau
c60080,s1,Best hotel in Macau I've experienced
c60080,s2,The staff are all extremely polite and professional
c60080,s3,"Unlike several other luxury hotels in Macau where we felt like we had to fight for attention in order to get help, in Altira we were addressed by name and every staff we we met were ready and willing to offer us help whenever we needed, such as with directions, explanation of amenities, restaurants, taxis and luggage"
c60080,s4,The hotel side is separated from the casino so there are no noisy guests around and it is not packed with tourists (which is one of the main reasons why I wanted to stay here over the other hotels in the City of Dreams area)
c60080,s5,"The lobby on the 35th floor is breathtaking, as are the suites"
c60080,s6,"I especially loved the large, round bath tub and the floor to ceiling windows which…"
c60081,s1,"If you want to be spoilt, this is the place"
c60081,s2,From the moment you arrive staff run to push elevator buttons and to service every need
c60081,s3,The room was very large and spacious with nice cosmetics
c60081,s4,"Much of the mini bar is complimentary, fresh fruit each day"
c60081,s5,Breakfast was the only downside as they just begin to change the way it is served
c60081,s6,High recommendation for this hotel
c60082,s1,I came here to watch the Fireworks and it was a good location to enjoy the Fireworks Show here
c60082,s2,"I went to lunch before I check in and they arranged to pick me up at the restaurant, it's really a six stars service! We were warmly welcomed by staff of the hotel and the room is clean and comfortable, all the snacks in the bar is free including a small bottle of red wine"
c60082,s3,"After a wonderful evening, we have breakfast in the room enjoying the spectacular view"
c60082,s4,We went to swim in the indoor swimming pool and surprisingly we can enjoy music while swimming
c60082,s5,"After lunch, they provided the limousine service and we arrived at the Ferry Pier just in time"
c60082,s6,What a wonderful escape!
c60083,s1,One of the best hotel stay we had for a long time! Spacious room with a great view
c60083,s2,F&B:  Japanese buffet choices/ selections are very good
c60083,s3,"Front service staffs are great, nothing is too much for them"
c60083,s4,They even went all the way to arrange someone to escort us to a nearby restaurant we wish to visit
c60083,s5,I will definitely choose Altira again for my future visits to Macau
c60084,s1,We visited Macau with a family and nice hotel away from the crowd been the must
c60084,s2,"Beautiful rooms with a lot of living space amazing view and breakfasts in room, we got everything what we paid for"
c60084,s3,Stuff is very helpful and always there for you
c60084,s4,One thing that annoyed me is air refreshing in the corridors the smell is very strong
c60085,s1,"We needed to get away for a few days so that my husband could get off the ""hamster wheel"" of work"
c60085,s2,From the moment we stepped into the Altira we felt the stress just slip away
c60085,s3,"Having breakfast served in our room was a delight, the underwater music of the infinity pool was soothing and the large comfortable room with amazing views meant we were very to content to just laze around all day"
c60085,s4,"We did go to the workout room and the locker room with the Jacuzzi, sauna and steam room meant that I didn't use our huge bathtub in our room as much as I would have liked"
c60085,s5,The couples message was one of the best we've ever had (and we've had a few!) We stayed in to eat at the excellent Italian restaurant and had drinks on the patio prior- very relaxing and romantic
c60085,s6,Best of all was the…
c60086,s1,We have visited this hôtel during 2 days last week and really loved it
c60086,s2,"Very Nice room, gorgeous swimming pool and outstanding service"
c60086,s3,"Thank you very much for your hospitallity, from the Bellmen, the people at the entrance and exit of the lift, to the receptionist, and Head sommelier of the cantonese restaurant"
c60086,s4,Very good team! A luxury place
c60086,s5,"Only thing that could be improved, pick up service at the airport"
c60087,s1,All rooms only faced one direction and there is no need to request for a room with view
c60087,s2,Countless photos have shown you how much u can laze in bed to witness the sunset and city nightlights
c60087,s3,Separated toilet & sink from bath is the biggest plus point
c60087,s4,You must visit and enjoy the pool with the accompanying water facilities
c60087,s5,"Never, ever miss that"
c60087,s6,Did not partake in the hotel's f&b as there are various affordable options on 3 sides of the hotel
c60087,s7,You can walk in to a local coffeeshop (cha chan teng) for breakfast set
c60087,s8,Choose a hotpot restaurant for lavish dinner/supper
c60087,s9,Seafood restaurant for lunch with local folks
c60087,s10,These added plus points for a hotel that sits in a local residential district
c60087,s11,It was much fun too to take local public bus rides from the stops dotted along…
c60088,s1,"Though located outside the city center, the hotel gives guests five star service all the way, from check-in to check-out"
c60088,s2,"Staff were friendly, in-room breakfast was great, all rooms have a great view of the Macau Skyline"
c60088,s3,Not our first choice when we booked but was recommended as an alternative by the hotel group and we're glad we tried it
c60089,s1,"When you arrive at Taipa Ferry Terminal, you might feel disappointed as you would see many shuttle buses to the different hotels but none to Altira"
c60089,s2,The only way to the hotel unfortunately is via cab
c60089,s3,Any unhappiness though will be gone once you see the room
c60089,s4,"When you step into the room, the first thing to notice is the full length glass window offering a superb view of the Macau island"
c60089,s5,A few more steps in and you will marvel at the amount of space in the room
c60089,s6,"Other than a king-sized bed, there is a large bathtub with a separate rain shower, a walk-in closet, a long work desk and a living area with a comfortable sofa"
c60089,s7,Quite a contrast to the hotel room in Hong Kong that I had just come from
c60089,s8,The hotel also offers free soft drinks in the mini-bar as well as free in-house…
c60090,s1,This hotel has it's class
c60090,s2,"The building design, the building concept, the friendly and experience staffs, the casinos, the rooms, the indoor swimming pool, all the F&B outlets, the spa, and other facilities"
c60090,s3,All has class
c60090,s4,The Japanese Restaurant called Tenmasa and the award winning fine dining restaurant called Aurora top it all
c60090,s5,Dining experience here is can never be the same in any part of the world I have traveled
c60090,s6,The room I stayed has a fantastic view of Macau
c60090,s7,"The room is fresh, clean and well maintained"
c60090,s8,I was treated like King at Crown Macau
c60091,s1,"My parents and I really had a restful, memorable, magnificent overnight staycation at this hotel"
c60091,s2,"The CLEAN MODERN INTERIORS, SPACIOUS AND PRETTY BATHROOM, MINI BAR packed with FREE DRINKS and instant noodles, and wide selection of HOLLYWOOD MOVIES (FOR FREE) are all wonderful points"
c60091,s3,But here are the highlights of our stay
c60091,s4,● The POOL: This made such an impression on us that we still talk about and miss it till now
c60091,s5,the water is really soft and light (great to swim through); there's spa music underwater; it's indoor and has an amazing view of the city (you can see the Grand Lisboa and MGM from the pool); and they give you mixed nuts and dried fruit as you relax poolside
c60091,s6,"The sauna, steam rooms, and jacuzzi are all spacious and clean as well"
c60091,s7,● The complimentary BREAKFAST…
c60092,s1,The Good -The rooms were very spacious and well designed
c60092,s2,I spent the first hour or so upon checking in just lounging on the sofa and staring out the windows
c60092,s3,"-Because all of the rooms are on such high floors, you get a great view overlooking the Macau bridges (There is some construction going on nearby though, but I expect that to be completed soon) -Everything was spotless"
c60092,s4,Even at most top notch hotels my wife is capable of finding strands of hair here and there but not at this hotel
c60092,s5,Kudos to housekeeping
c60092,s6,-The inbuilt TV above the bathroom sinks
c60092,s7,"I'm always bored when I brush my teeth, so having something to stare at was fantastic! -The minibar (minus wine and hard liquor) is free"
c60092,s8,"How many hotels in the world has this? You get snacks, beer, and sodas"
c60092,s9,I could spend many a…
c60093,s1,This hotel is the best hotel I have ever stayed at so far
c60093,s2,All the staffs were very passionate and dedicated
c60093,s3,We were escorted to the concierge located at the top floor once we arrived and our luggages were all carried by them
c60093,s4,The staff at the concierge kindly gave a lot of advices on what to do in Macau
c60093,s5,We stayed at the executive suite on the 36th floor which is the top floor for the guest room
c60093,s6,"It could be that I have never stayed in a 5 stars hotel before, I found the room too good to be true"
c60093,s7,"It was way more than I expected: stunning city and water views looking over the harbour and casinos on the other side, spacious room with a cloak room, the bathtub (OMG) in the bathroom can probably fit 6 people inside, and complimentary drinks are just more bonus point on top of my…"
c60094,s1,This hotel is just about the only good thing about Macau
c60094,s2,"Extremely professional service, good value for your money"
c60094,s3,"Once you are there, I suggest you don't get out at all"
c60094,s4,Everything else in the city is bellow par
c60095,s1,We spent two nights at this faultless hotel
c60095,s2,"The staff are just amazing,remembered  Our name and greeted us every time we went in or out"
c60095,s3,The rooms are a super size with stunning views over Macau
c60095,s4,There are plenty of taxies and and a very good bus service to all areas very close by
c60095,s5,"There are some very good Portuguese restaurants within a short taxi ride to Taipa, especially Antonio's don't miss the House of Dancing Water"
c60095,s6,We shall certainly return next time we visit Macau
c60096,s1,I travel all over Asia for work and i have to say that this is the best hotel i have stayed in bar none
c60096,s2,"The staff are exceptional, the rooms are fantastic, the view is simply stunning, the pool area is so peaceful and the service is excellent"
c60096,s3,I look forward to my next visit!
c60097,s1,We had a great time in this hotel! The rooms were huge and extremely luxurious
c60097,s2,The bath was a treat and the beds were soft and comfortable
c60097,s3,"The pool facilities were fantastic, but there are not many pool chairs so if they are full you may need to be a little patient"
c60097,s4,There is even music playing under water!   Free movies in the rooms and about 10 non-alcoholic and 5 beers free in mini bar each day
c60097,s5,The view on the Macau facing side is amazing at night
c60097,s6,Just an easy and very inexpensive bus ride across the water
c60098,s1,This is a beautiful boutique hotel with great service
c60098,s2,"The rooms are huge, with a lounge area, enormous bathroom and wonderful views"
c60098,s3,The pool is lovely and the breakfast room service was great
c60098,s4,"However, the best part about this hotel is the service, everyone, from the doorman to reception to the pool attendant are friendly and respectful and go above and beyond"
c60098,s5,I've stayed in many international 5 star hotels for work and this was by far the best
c60098,s6,Well done to a great team
c60099,s1,"Visited there during the Black Thunderstorm signal in Hong Kong, such a beautiful escape since Macau was totally dry and chapped that day"
c60099,s2,The hotel lobby was located on the roof of the building which shown a wonderful view of Macau
c60099,s3,We booked a room with a river view which shown a whole full picture of the city
c60099,s4,Room is super spacious with amazingly huge bath tub (you can even fit in 4 people i guess
c60099,s5,)
c60099,s6,The hotel has no official casino but its attached to nearby hotels
c60099,s7,"I spent the night at the 38 Lounge, singers were good"
c60099,s8,Wine selection was okay but it can be better
c60099,s9,The best is you can escape from the main stream tourists in Galaxy Macau and the Venetian and experience the real Macau here
c60099,s10,Will definitely visit here again
c60100,s1,Overall review: Stay three nights with two rooms (thanks a lot for arranging on the same floor)
c60100,s2,"Great view! We all like the hotel very much with its comfortable, modern and comfortable rooms, top class facilities, friendly staff and strategic location with easy access to taxi and public transport for sightseeing"
c60100,s3,Absolutely a gem for sightseeing in Macau
c60100,s4,"Location: before the trip, I was concerned that the hotel doesn't have any shuttle bus and is not close to any other big resorts"
c60100,s5,Don't worry at all especially I found guests need to wait and sometimes there is a long queue for most of the shuttle buses in those big resorts
c60100,s6,Also it is a smaller but high quality hotel which makes it easy to commute within the hotel
c60100,s7,If you leave the hotel in the morning / noon and come back…
c60101,s1,Altira is hands down the best deluxe hotel available in Macau if you want to stay away from the Cotai Strip due to the outrageous number of tourists there
c60101,s2,"Altira is set in the more residential and quite part of Taipa, overlooking the peninsula"
c60101,s3,The view itself is worth the cost
c60101,s4,"The service was tip top, couldn't ask for better staff! Everything about this hotel was beyond my expectation"
c60101,s5,"Loved my stay there, and we've planned to visit Altira at least annually now!"
c60102,s1,The Altira Macau is the epitamy of opulence and the perfect place to be pampered
c60102,s2,The King Waterfront rooms are very spacious and want for nothing
c60102,s3,"The views to Macau central are panoramic and the hotel is well located to the temporary Ferry Wharf, Cotai and the various other Casinos and sights"
c60102,s4,The friendly and professional staff at the Altira made our stay an extremely pleasant one and we would highly recommend this hotel
c60103,s1,Spectacular Rooms and Service  Their infinity pool is really spectacular with a 180 degree of Macau Penisular
c60103,s2,"Special mention for the view from our room, one of the best I've seen in Macau"
c60103,s3,Memorable and romantic night view
c60103,s4,The Japanese Tempura restaurant is very good and famous
c60103,s5,The hotel is undoubtedly one of the best in Macau
c60103,s6,Will definitely stay for another turn
c60104,s1,"First Impression: All the staff dress smartly, fully alert, attention to details with great customer service"
c60104,s2,Room: Welcome tea and the complementary birthday cake that serve to our room is impressive
c60104,s3,"Not only the super comfort bed, the big round shape bathtub inside our room is something worth to mention too"
c60104,s4,Dining: Ask hotel concierge for map
c60104,s5,They can show u very yummy local food within walking distance if Japanese & Hot pot restaurant in the hotel is not your choice
c60104,s6,"(I personally don't like the buffer as the teppanyaki make the whole environment so smoky & smelly)  There is a very nice local food: ""feichaiman"" within 5 min walking distance from the hotel"
c60104,s7,Crab porridge and fried fishball is something special to try
c60104,s8,Internet at Macau: There are CTM (the local telco…
c60105,s1,"Got a really good deal for a night in this hotel, didnt quite expect it to be this good since the hotels in Macau are mostly catered for the hungry gamblers even if they are 5 star hotels, there is always something missing"
c60105,s2,Altira is the only one ice experienced really really good service
c60105,s3,"Could not fault anything from the moment the concierge took my bags, he started up conversations even in the elevator"
c60105,s4,Everything was very swift and efficient
c60105,s5,Everybody spoke good English and always make a point of addressing you by the name
c60105,s6,Everyone seemed so sincere! And the pool is just beautiful with crazy views perched up high
c60105,s7,Would definitely come back to this property
c60105,s8,"Even if it is a casino hotel, you won't see those crowds at all and the service is really top notch!"
c60106,s1,I am currently staying at the hotel
c60106,s2,The hotel is amazing and the service one of the best
c60106,s3,Room dining in is very nice all of the staff are very friendly starting from the door man until the room they try to welcome you to the hotel
c60106,s4,Good location bear to dream city only 22 HKD  Very romance hotel with no crowded gamblers
c60107,s1,i like the cozy rooms un this spa
c60107,s2,complete amenity
c60107,s3,comb
c60107,s4,tooth brush
c60107,s5,steam n
c60107,s6,shower room in
c60107,s7,"ur massage room makes it convinient not crowded place like some places, which the whole  purpose of going to spa is to have some peace n quiet"
c60108,s1,We decided to see the sights of Macau and stay one night to make it easier
c60108,s2,The Altira hotel is a casino hotel but you wouldn't know it! We had an enormous room with a spectacular view and the service was impeccable
c60108,s3,Immaculately clean and every amenity you could wish for
c60108,s4,"We've stayed at 5 star hotels before, but this was way above anything we've experienced before"
c60108,s5,"We will certainly be going back! Be warned though, the food is very expensive, so we ate out"
c60109,s1,"This Forbes-rated hotel is superbly located on the Taipa side near the two bridges linking to old Macau ,  providing an awesome panoramic view of the Macau  city skyline especially at night"
c60109,s2,"And to capitalize on the great view, the hotel provides breakfast in your room as part of the room package"
c60109,s3,The service was great -  attentive & genuinely courteous staff from the Front Desk to the Bellhops to the Room Service staff
c60109,s4,The  well-furnished room was very spacious and the toilet was the probably the best amongst all the hotels I stayed in this region
c60109,s5,The Bar Lounge on the 38th Floor and the Japanese restaurant on one of the lower floors offer good entertainment & Japanese cuisine respectively but were slightly over-priced when compared with similar class & type of F&B outlets…
c60110,s1,"Pros: - spectacular seaview - restaurants: both its Italian and Japanese restaurants are fantastic - staff: very warm, friendly, and sincere, a refreshing change from the ordinary - in-room entertainment: loads of FREE new movies for the family - gym: spacious and well appointed with great views  Cons: - room design: perhaps in an attempt to be discreet and modern, the room layout became inconvenient; towels and amenities etc"
c60110,s2,were stored away in sometimes hard to find/reach spaces - location: no shuttle or convenient public transport; have to rely on taxi  Overall: a great new place to stay in Macau if you are looking into having some quiet time and attentive pampering
c60111,s1,Staying at this hotel was an incredible experience
c60111,s2,"We were treated like ViPs the whole time, with the staff being very helpful and professional"
c60111,s3,The swimming facilities were fantastic and it had a stunning views
c60111,s4,"It was my friends birthday, and they arranged a delicious cake for him"
c60111,s5,The room itself is massive
c60111,s6,I highly recommend this place
c60111,s7,Once you stay here every other hotel seems average!
c60112,s1,I was very fortunate to book during the Easter break and receive a great deal on an excellent room with a fantastic view and and hour long Spa treatment
c60112,s2,"When we arrived, we found it odd to have to take the lift to the top of the building to find the lobby to check in, quite unique but again, slightly odd"
c60112,s3,We were greeted with a fantastic view and friendly staff
c60112,s4,"When we arrived in our room, and it was breath taking"
c60112,s5,"We could see the sea, bridge and casinos (Imagine what that looked like in the evening!)"
c60112,s6,"The room was equivalent to a suite, furnished a king size bed, a choice of pillows, sofa, desk and large TV"
c60112,s7,"The washroom was large with a private toilet, walk in wardrobe, large round tub, showers and a his and her washing basins"
c60112,s8,The facilities are quite impressive too
c60112,s9,…
c60113,s1,very good hotel every thing pool no10 in wrold eat good  relxa i like this hotel everything was first class but staff was exceptional we've great time The hotel facilities and amenities are amazing and the staff's attention to detail is fabulous
c60113,s2,The selected free mini bar and the welcome tea on arrival were lovely touches
c60114,s1,The room is perfect in every little detail its spacious and has a huge sofa and amazing bathroom with a bathtub and great view
c60114,s2,Its just perfect The checkin was so smooth and they housekeeping were really good
c60114,s3,Everyday they will keep a little thing on our bed like foot lotion or face moisturizer
c60114,s4,The location of the hotel is not exactly at the tourist attractions its a few minutes drive which was perfect because it was calm and quiet away from the other busy hotels and noisy casinos
c60114,s5,The in room dine in was good but a bit expensive but the Aurora restaurant didn't taste as good as I expected
c60114,s6,One thing that could improve in this hotel is providing free shuttle service to Macau Island and to Venetian as it takes time to find a taxi
c60114,s7,Also the water in the huge bathtub was…
c60115,s1,"My fiancé and I have travelled to Macau several times before, preferring to be away from the larger casino hotels"
c60115,s2,"We stayed one night in a Waterfront View Room which was beautifully designed and very spacious, with a separate lounge style area, ideal for eating in room or relaxing in front of the amazing view of Macau"
c60115,s3,The deal through Trip Advisor meant this was excellent value for money
c60115,s4,The bathroom features a large tub and shower room
c60115,s5,The large pool has a panoramic view of Macau
c60115,s6,"We ate in Ying, the Cantonese restaurant which has great dim sum, and had drinks in 38 lounge (again overlooking the amazing view)"
c60115,s7,At all times the service was excellent
c60115,s8,"The breakfast is ok, but not the best"
c60115,s9,It is a short taxi ride from the Cotai Jet ferry terminal at Taipa and just 10 minutes…
c60116,s1,"Although the hotel has a casino (with a separate entrance from the hotel), what I loved about it, as a non-gambler staying there as part of a visit with our son and family who live nearby, was that it was small and calm - a world away from all of the tremendous glitz and gawking tourists in the bigger hotels and casinos"
c60116,s2,Our room was beautifully set up with a separate large seating area and plenty of desk space
c60116,s3,A full wall of window overlooked the harbor and mainland Macau
c60116,s4,"We had a room package that included breakfast in the room, and we found the various egg dishes we chose, as well as the yogurt and fruit and fresh juices, very good"
c60116,s5,"After one day of the ""bread"" basket, with only very sweet Danish and muffins, we asked for toast and were brought fresh white and whole…"
c60117,s1,I highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to experience another level of luxury
c60117,s2,Perfect for a couple getaway
c60117,s3,Spacious room with amazing bathtub and spectacular view like nowhere else
c60117,s4,Definitely get a breakfast in room-delicious food and hey how often do you have breakfast overlooking Macau? Amazing! The service is very attentive and you will feel like a celebrity the way they treat you
c60117,s5,We got a limousine pick up and drop off and it was all worth it! Nice new cars (BMW) with wet towels and water provided
c60117,s6,We also tried their Kira Japanese buffet and it was the best Japanese buffet I've ever tried! I would recommend this hotel to everyone
c60117,s7,And will definitely stay there again
c60118,s1,"Chic, comfortable , good service, very very good SPA!! The massage was awsome !! The breakfast gorgeous"
c60118,s2,"The room is cosy, practical and elegant design"
c60118,s3,"ask a hight level, the view is fabulous! The only negative point, a bit far from the main interest of Macau"
c60118,s4,We recommended
c60119,s1,This Hotel is just perfect
c60119,s2,"The Casino is so so, but the venue is superb"
c60119,s3,We went to the Chinese (YIN) Hot pot restaurant and we have been surprised by the package offered by this venue
c60119,s4,"Nothing is perfect but here, we have had one of the best Hot Pot in Macau"
c60119,s5,The price is there to remind you the all experience
c60119,s6,"This hotel offers you one Italian restaurant, Japanese restaurant, this hot pot restaurant and an amaizing roof top bar named 38"
c60119,s7,Just go there and enjoy the view and of course the food
c60119,s8,The service was ok and professional with some issues which are easily forgivable
c60119,s9,Do not miss this hotel if you are a food lover
c60120,s1,"Altira Macau is located close enough to all the chaos, yet you feel completely at home in its large comfortable rooms and fantastic spa/changing rooms"
c60120,s2,I seldom felt this much 'at home' in a hotel!  PRO's: - High comfort rooms - Gorgeous swimming pool/spa/changing room - Fantastic view - Great in-depth interior design - Very friendly and helpful staff !!  CON's: - Only breakfast in-room - Bit strange layout: lobby/reception on the top floor
c60121,s1,2nd time back to this hotel and it seems better
c60121,s2,Hotel is in taipa not Macau so you are away from all the craziness but only a 10mins drive from Macau
c60121,s3,Limo pick up service & drop off was efficient & on time & luggage was dealt with as soon as we were picked up
c60121,s4,"We were greeted by name from pick up to front door to reception which is a nice touch, but bit weird"
c60121,s5,"The room has everything incl a lovely view of Macau- all amenities you need are here- products used are Aigner in Leather, slippers are velvety & dressing gowns are silky!  In the evening, they do turndown service & hey leave Aigner foot gel on your bed, super cute"
c60121,s6,Room service is pretty good- they even give you an etd for the room service and are on time! Breakfast in bed is the best thing especially with the view…
c60122,s1,I stayed at this place 2 times after a number or visits and stays at about 10 other Macao hotels
c60122,s2,It is incredibly good value
c60122,s3,"It is not very downtown, but everything is close in Macao and btw, Macao´s downtown is not really where you want to be in in the evening"
c60122,s4,"You visit the places, casinos etc"
c60122,s5,"And get back to your room, where you get absolutely the best view over Macao"
c60122,s6,"The room are huge and very fancy, as well as the service"
c60122,s7,The roof bar garden is the best roof bar in Macao
c60122,s8,The breakfast is served in your room and is amazing
c60122,s9,"Don't miss the swimming pool, again it gives you the most amazing view"
c60122,s10,Check the hotel's website and you will understand what I mean
c60122,s11,"And yes, it a really place for a romantic weekend:-)"
c60123,s1,Stayed for one night while taking a vacation in Hong Kong
c60123,s2,AMAZING hotel
c60123,s3,"A limousine service comes to greet you at the Ferry Terminal, and while not a limo in the traditional sense, it's IS a luxury van"
c60123,s4,Bottles of water are provided along with fresh minty cold towels for a quick wash up
c60123,s5,The rooms are huge (I'm guessing close to 700sq ft
c60123,s6,") and coming from the microscopic expensive rooms of Hong Kong, it was a very welcome surprise"
c60123,s7,"Our room (3510) had a crazy unobstructed view of the water and city, as i'm sure almost every other room does as well"
c60123,s8,"The room had a foyer, large comfortable queen size bed, a desk area and a large sectional couch by the huge picture window"
c60123,s9,"The bathroom, which takes up about 1/3 of the room is compete with a walk-in closet, LARGE soaking tub, bath…"
c60124,s1,"As what where written by other reviews here, the experience at the hotel was great"
c60124,s2,Do remember to tell them when you will arrive at macau and they will be there to pick you up
c60124,s3,The limo is more of a toyota alphard or similar car which is quite popular in hk/macau
c60124,s4,Nothing much to complain about the ride as it is complementary
c60124,s5,Some unexpected things happen during the check in
c60124,s6,We check in at 3 pm and was told that we have to wait another 1 hour for our rooms to be ready
c60124,s7,Was really upset with the staffs
c60124,s8,"I suppose the check in time was a standard 3pm and since they expect me to arrive at 3, i expect the room to be ready by then"
c60124,s9,Was told that the hotel was fully book which i slightly doubt that
c60124,s10,"after all, waited 30 minutes for everything to be sorted out"
c60124,s11,"one more thing, i…"
c60125,s1,"From its stunning views, competent and attentive staff and its large family suite this hotel cannot be faulted"
c60125,s2,Relaxing swimming pool and a sauna and steam room that actually worked - many a 5 star hotel weakness
c60125,s3,Concierge spoke perfect English
c60125,s4,We even were provided an extra-early room service breakfast free of charge as we were missing our breakfast to get the ferry to HK International Airport
c60125,s5,This is one 5 star hotel that lives up to its billing and more and I would recommend this hotel without reservation
c60126,s1,it was great good service
c60126,s2,The staff were really friendly and the swimming pool was awesome i particularly the music every time you went under the water it was really relaxing
c60126,s3,Overall it definitely deserves 5 star
c60127,s1,I recently visited this place on a romantic getaway weekend with my wife and we were both blown away by the service and our room itself
c60127,s2,"The staff was incredibly professional and very heplful, plus they all speak very good english"
c60127,s3,It is a beautiful hotel and our entire experience was great
c60127,s4,I would suggest this place to anyone
c60127,s5,Especially couples
c60127,s6,"Plus, they have great package deals!  The room was very modern and well layed out"
c60127,s7,"It is not a huge room by western standards, but by eastern standards I could live in it happily"
c60127,s8,"The bathroom has a shower, dual sinks, and a tub big enought to easily fit 2 adults"
c60127,s9,My only complaint of the entire stay was the bed was a bit harder than preferred
c60127,s10,Our package deal came with a round trip ride from the ferry terminal and breakfast for 2…
c60128,s1,I booked thru the hotel website and stayed for 2 nights
c60128,s2,We liaises thru email a lot and they very prompt in replying email
c60128,s3,We're greeted at Macau ferry terminal and the personnel attendant was very professional
c60128,s4,He started by asking if I got places I like to visit and they'll try the best to arrange for us
c60128,s5,"And they did !! They helped to booked a restaurant and arrange the taxi so once we're down to the 1st floor, the taxi is ready in front of the hotel"
c60128,s6,No need worry if you shop a lot as the bell attendants there is very helpful
c60128,s7,"Upon arrival at the hotel, we go straight to 38 floor for check-in and once we reached there, we greeted by the staffs with a genuine smile"
c60128,s8,We booked waterfront room and the room is spacious for 3 persons
c60128,s9,The view is magnificent
c60128,s10,The fridge is…
c60129,s1,This was my second stay at the Altira
c60129,s2,We booked it on short notice but had no problems at all with our reservation
c60129,s3,We arrived at the lobby and the staff still remembered my name and when I was there the last time
c60129,s4,Very impressive
c60129,s5,We got to our room right away without waiting at check in at all and everything was done in our room
c60129,s6,The view from the room was very nice and the room itself was spacious and clean
c60129,s7,We used their restaurant for brunch which was excellent
c60129,s8,They combined the Italian and Japanese restaurant for brunch which was interesting
c60129,s9,Using the Spa was just icing on the cake and so relaxing
c60129,s10,They have an amazing couples room which I can highly recommend using
c60130,s1,We stayed for two nights mid week in October
c60130,s2,We booked a harbour view room and a couple of days before arrival we were notified that renovation work was going to be taking place in some of the rooms
c60130,s3,We were naturally concerned so we contacted the hotel and we were immediately offered an upgrade to a suite
c60130,s4,Upon arrival at Macau ferry terminal we were met by a hotel rep and quickly transferred to a waiting car
c60130,s5,The hotel is away from the centre of Taipa Island but two minutes from the middle bridge to Macau - we found this a very convenient location
c60130,s6,The hotel has two entrances - one for the casino and restaurants and the other for hotel guests - excellent
c60130,s7,We were taken to the reception on the 38th floor and then to our suite
c60130,s8,The suite was enormous - a spacious living /…
c60131,s1,"I travel all over Asia for work, and when I went to Macau last month, I managed to get 3 nights at this hotel"
c60131,s2,Just to say it didn't disappoint
c60131,s3,I don't write many reviews but this hotel was worth the time to come here and write one
c60131,s4,Everything from the spectacular view from my room to the service to the amazing Italian restaurant exceeded expectations
c60131,s5,Even the bar/lounge on the 38th floor and band were great
c60131,s6,Great value for what you get
c60131,s7,If you want the best place to stay in Macau this is it
c60132,s1,"I normally do not write reviews as i am not very good at writing them, but this hotel has compelled me to do that for all the good reasons"
c60132,s2,"the moment i booked the hotel the things started to roll, I got a mail stating that we should inform them about our travel plans, which we did, and as promised everything happened well on time"
c60132,s3,"The moment we reached the hotel the personalised service was so great that i cant put it in words, we were upgraded to a corner suite the moment we checked in the suite is a pleasure to stay in, the service and courtesy and helpfulness shown by the staff is the best i have experienced so far in all my trips around the world"
c60132,s4,We had dinner at tetmasa which was again as good as i have had in japan of not made better by the attention and care taken…
c60133,s1,"Wow, that is all I can say"
c60133,s2,"From arriving at the hotel, checking in at the 38th floor with an amazing view to a huge room (57 sqm) this was an excellent stay"
c60133,s3,The staff treats you like you want to be treated at a five star hotel
c60133,s4,The room had an amazing water view and the decor was great
c60133,s5,This hotel has everything you need and the location is so close to everything that you get there in minutes
c60133,s6,The restaurant and spa which is included in the hotel is excellent
c60134,s1,"Macau is a bizarre place, feels really fake and ghost-town like, but the Altira is brilliant"
c60134,s2,We stayed there with another couple of friends last year and loved it
c60134,s3,"We stayed in a suite on one of the top floors and the view was incredible, service is great and very attentive, the spa is really good and the swimming pool is very relaxing although not huge"
c60134,s4,I really liked the minimal decor and the size of the rooms
c60134,s5,"We had drinks on the roof terrace and dinner at the Japanese restaurant, we enjoyed both very much"
c60134,s6,"The food was great (strongly recommend the Japanese hot-pot), and the view from the roof terrace bar was pretty spectacular"
c60134,s7,"I wouldn't go back to Macau as it is void of any atmosphere or character, but I would love to move the Altira to somewhere a little bit more…"
c60135,s1,We've been to Macau several times and stayed in various newly opened hotels such as the Venetian
c60135,s2,"Our recent stay in Altira is the BEST experience, bar none"
c60135,s3,"We were upgraded from a Corner Suite to a 3,000 sq ft 2-bedroom Villa"
c60135,s4,"Fabu-tastic! The rooms are spacious, clean, smartly designed, tastefully decorated, and well maintained"
c60135,s5,The 270 degree view is simply spectacular
c60135,s6,"There are a treadmill and jacuzzi in the master bathroom, about 6 or 7 TVs in total, iPod dock, Acqua di Parma toiletries, the fluffiest white towels, mini bar, espresso machine, an impossibly large fruit basket"
c60135,s7,the list goes on
c60135,s8,The staff were the friendliest and most professional
c60135,s9,"Our butler (!) was a polite and efficient young man, who seemed to be committed to providing us with the best…"
c60136,s1,"I have seen many hotels around the world, and about Altira I can say that it is the best so far"
c60136,s2,"It has a great sea view, conveniently located near all the attractions"
c60136,s3,Very close to the center too
c60136,s4,Spacious rooms equipped with everything you might need
c60136,s5,Very kind and attentive personnel
c60136,s6,Really the best
c60136,s7,The only thing I did not enjoy is the fact that the swimming pool is only indoor
c60137,s1,My fiance and I were in Macau for the day and had a couples massage at Altira Spa
c60137,s2,The room was above and beyond anything we could have imagined
c60137,s3,The staff were very friendly and professional
c60137,s4,Our massage started off with time in our spa suite to use the jacuzzi or shower/steam room as we we liked followed by a foot scrub and 1 hour massage
c60137,s5,Afterwards we had more time to use the facilities and enjoy a spa lunch
c60137,s6,We also ate at the Aurora Restaurant and the meal was phenomenal
c60137,s7,We highly recommend this to anyone looking for a relaxing day at the spa or a romantic getaway
c60138,s1,Frankly I wasn't interested to stay in Altira before I came to the hotel because of it's location
c60138,s2,My friend had booked a package including 2 tickets of Dancing Water Show
c60138,s3,We were warmly greeted by the hotel staff at ferry port
c60138,s4,It was seamless
c60138,s5,"From the time we arrived to hotel until stepped out, staffs are amazingly friendly, attentive and helpful"
c60138,s6,I did not have enough notes to give taxi fare and they solved my problem
c60138,s7,"Visited swimming and it was fantastic!!! Encountered one problem only, cigarette smell in the lifts"
c60138,s8,Overall we enjoyed and come back in future
c60139,s1,I am a seasoned traveller and stay mostly in 5-Star hotels throughout Asia
c60139,s2,The Altira is by the best hotel in this area
c60139,s3,"Rooms have a spectacular view of the Macau peninsula, but more importantly, is the management and the team that are always available to meet your needs/demands, and always with a smile"
c60139,s4,Once could not feel more welcome anywhere
c60139,s5,"This is certainly ""a home away from home"""
c60140,s1,"I go back to Macau every year but this is first time at Altira,  Altira doesn't feel like any other hotel in Macau, the staff are really polite and professional, the hotel itself feels a million miles away from Macau, its really relaxing!  The views from the room are incredible at night, really beautiful"
c60140,s2,"The Spa is a must try, we had a winter package and it was such value for money, the suites are amazing with bed, jacuzzi, monsoon showers with mood lighting, tea etc"
c60140,s3,etc
c60140,s4,The only down side is the location is a little far from Macau main bit but as we only stay for 1 night and we have a driver it didn't really bother us!  Would really recommend this hotel
c60141,s1,Words fail me
c60141,s2,"They told me that they were upgrading me, but when I realized they had put me in a $4000/night villa instead of the $300/night I had booked, my jaw dropped"
c60141,s3,"I have never stayed in such a place before: A massive suite of rooms with a full-wall skyline view, everything very tastefully designed, not tacky like in Vegas"
c60141,s4,It's a beautiful place
c60141,s5,"I was unimpressed by Macau generally, but if you must visit, definitely stay here"
c60141,s6,The staff was attentive but not imposing
c60141,s7,"Somehow they always said my weird last name exactly right, something even people in my home country can't do"
c60141,s8,I still wonder how
c60141,s9,"I splurged and got the chef's recommended five-course meal at the Italian restaurant, and loved it"
c60141,s10,"Thank you, Altira -- You've spoiled me, and no other hotel will ever measure…"
c60142,s1,I've been to Altira a few times and it has never failed me
c60142,s2,"Friendly, genuinely helpful staff that work very efficiently (which I find rare in Macau sorry to say"
c60142,s3,!)
c60142,s4,"Room quality is great, clean, sleek, modern and feels spacious"
c60142,s5,I had an air con problem with my room and the staff efficiently resolved this within 30 minutes in the middle of the night around 1am
c60142,s6,They provided a complimentary later check out time for the time loss in resolving the issue which was a sensible touch
c60142,s7,"I had a limousine transfer but was quite disappointed that it was not what all others were describing as Benz, but only a city of dream Nissan minivan - which even turned up late!  Not sure if they are cutting cost or"
c60142,s8,"Other than that - fantastic!  Hotel restaurants - stick to Aurora, Kira is…"
c60143,s1,Everything about the hotel is classy and made to perfection
c60143,s2,"From the limousine pickup to drop-off, we thoroughly enjoyed each moment in this lavish hotel"
c60143,s3,"We were a group of 2 couples, and booked 2 normal rooms, but were upgraded to a 2 room villa upon arrival"
c60143,s4,The villa was something we had never imagined
c60143,s5,it was so grand and luxurious that none of us felt like leaving the hotel to see any of Macau
c60143,s6,!! Furnishing was tasteful and immaculate
c60143,s7,"There were 2 jacuzzi, steam room, treadmill, 10 TVs, home theaters, ipod docks, kitchen, personal bar, walk-in wardrobes and study rooms, all within the villa"
c60143,s8,spanning some 3000sqft
c60143,s9,Villa was on 36th floor with a grand sea view and amazing view of the casinos skyline at night
c60143,s10,"Buffet breakfast was good, not great variety but fine food"
c60143,s11,…
c60144,s1,"This is the best hotel I have ever stayed at - it's not even a contest, and that's saying something"
c60144,s2,"I always wondered what ""world-class service"" means, and now I know"
c60144,s3,"On arrival, we were upgraded from a corner suite to a villa"
c60144,s4,"Yes, a villa"
c60144,s5,"The staff was amazing:  from the porters to the management, the service was consistently great without being overbearing, even for us average Joe's"
c60144,s6,The spa was superb - the private room is well worth the extra 500 MOP
c60144,s7,Breakfast at the Aurora is wonderful
c60144,s8,Housekeping is pristine
c60144,s9,The concierge staff could not do enough for us
c60144,s10,They even found the eyeglasses that we left behind
c60144,s11,No hidden charges or discrepancies on the bill
c60144,s12,A PERFECT hotel experience
c60144,s13,A few tips - wait until Macau to change money if you can
c60144,s14,I found I got a…
c60145,s1,I will give this hotel a six stars
c60145,s2,First class service from the moment we were met at the ferry terminal
c60145,s3,Hot towels and drinks were served during our limousine transfer to the hotel
c60145,s4,Speedy check-in and hot tea were served by our personal porter once we were in the room
c60145,s5,Spacious room with beautiful habour view that overlooking Macau main island
c60145,s6,Complementary fruits and mini bar with choices of beers and soft drinks
c60145,s7,Huge bathroom where the boys enjoyed soaking themselvesin the huge Japanese bath tub every night
c60145,s8,Excellent spa services and massages that make me want to come back to Macau just for that
c60145,s9,Stayed for two nights and will be back soon!!
c60146,s1,we have travelled extensively however this hotel has set a whole new standard for us
c60146,s2,This (waterview) room has a stunning view and the service is impeccable
c60146,s3,"Walk in robe, large bathtub, living room area, flat screen TV - we had to force ourselves to venture outside from relaxing in our room"
c60146,s4,Highly recommended!
c60147,s1,I booked this hotel on recommendation from a friend and was blown away
c60147,s2,"From the moment you take the elevator up to the top floor lobby, you know you’re somewhere special"
c60147,s3,The view is fantastic panorama of Macau harbor and night lights and the hotel is designed so that every room has the view
c60147,s4,"The décor in the lobby and restaurants is artistic and engaging, but also makes you feel relaxed and welcome"
c60147,s5,Front desk staff very friendly and helpful
c60147,s6,The room layout makes the most of the spectacular view with bed and sofas all optimally located to soak it in
c60147,s7,The bathroom is opulent and romantic
c60147,s8,The gym and indoor pool are also very impressive – it feels great to float on infinity pool high above the Macau skyline
c60147,s9,The bar on top floor also has good atmosphere for a chill drink and…
c60148,s1,"I am the tourist from Hong Kong and my boyfriend chose Altira as for our accommodation in Macau~  Altira's staff has a high quality of service, they are really helpful and thoughtful, sometimes even humorous"
c60148,s2,"^^ They know how to impress their customers~  From the very first step to your hotel to the end we left Macau, we can feel the warm hospitality of Altira"
c60148,s3,"Also, all other facilities in the hotel are well-equipped, we spent a nice evening in the lounge and a delicious breakfast in the Aurora"
c60148,s4,"(the restaurant^^)  After the trip, I wrote the first appreciation letter of my life to Altira (No kidding!)  I hope you guys can experience the same wonderful stay as mine in Altira!"
c60149,s1,The Altira is one of the best hotels I ever stayed in
c60149,s2,"It was luxurious, spacious and very comfortable"
c60149,s3,I was always happy to return to the hotel after a long day outside
c60149,s4,The spa is actually the best in Asia
c60149,s5,The restaurants are very good
c60149,s6,"The rooms are very spacious and finally, the service is top notch"
c60149,s7,"After arriving at the Macau Ferry Terminal, we were greeted by the bell hop who was very kind"
c60149,s8,He allowed us to buy ferry tickets and waited patiently for us
c60149,s9,The car was pretty roomy too
c60149,s10,"When we got to the hotel, everybody greeted us by our last names"
c60149,s11,Check in was fast and done in an interesting manner
c60149,s12,The lobby was on the 38th floor facing the Macau peninsula
c60149,s13,"Since the lobby was on the 38th floor, there was an express elevator to the lobby, but no express to the rooms"
c60149,s14,…
c60150,s1,We chose the Altira Hotel purely on the reviews of Trip Advisor which turned out to be a sound choice
c60150,s2,We arrived at the hotel after a late flight to Macao
c60150,s3,We were met and returned to the airport by the hotels airport shuttle service (personal driver and car) which was excellent
c60150,s4,"On arrival at the hotel we were checked in by friendly and helpful staff that quickly registered us and showed us to our room, which was a pleasant suite of quite reasonable size with stylish and well fitted bathrooms"
c60150,s5,This was our first time in Macao and had a wonderful time
c60150,s6,The staff made our trip very special
c60150,s7,including a bottle of champagne
c60150,s8,it was my 60th birthday and they noticed that on my passport
c60150,s9,Step above and beyond
c60150,s10,We would recommend this hotel to any traveler; yes it was costly…
c60151,s1,"what can you not say about this hotel,  We have stayed at many great 5 star hotels around the world, Peninsulars, orientals, etc, but the service in this hotel left them in a wake"
c60151,s2,"From the Lovely S class Mercedes-Benz to the housekeeping, totally faultless"
c60151,s3,You arrive or should I say swept up and cocooned in service from the minute  the car arrives to the time you depart
c60151,s4,"The rooms were wonderfully appointed, restful and believe it or not for a casino, tastefully decorated, best bathroom I have ever seen"
c60151,s5,"Only point  that may have let them down, is  the breakfast buffet, but I have been spoiled  with amazing breakfasts at resorts, so it would be hard to live up to this,  The presentation on the plate of cooked food was good only the buffet part was a little lack luster"
c60151,s6,We…
c60152,s1,The Altira is first class all the way
c60152,s2,The red carpet treatment started at the airport where a hotel employee greeted us on the ramp of the airplane
c60152,s3,"Yes, literally on the ramp"
c60152,s4,"He took our passports and said, ""Follow me"""
c60152,s5,He ushered us to a private passport agent
c60152,s6,"We could hear people saying, ""Who are they"""
c60152,s7,Our luggage didn't arrive and our personal assistant was on it
c60152,s8,We arrived at the hotel and check in already knew our luggage was missing
c60152,s9,They asked what we needed to get by until it showed up
c60152,s10,"I had enough for one night, so I was all set"
c60152,s11,My associate had nothing
c60152,s12,"They got his size and preferences for toiletries and within 30 minutes returned with designer clothes, cologne, and other items! We've never experienced such service"
c60152,s13,They couldn't do enough to make us…
c60153,s1,From the moment you arrive the doorman leads you to a private elevator that brings you to the 38th floor for check-in
c60153,s2,"The staff is well spoken in every language, I speak 7 languages and I was fooling with them but I was amazed that they had staff members that spoke 5 different languages aside from mandarin"
c60153,s3,"I won't get in to every detail regarding this hotel, if you are looking for luxury this is the place to be and be seen"
c60153,s4,"Don't expect crowds, this is all about high-rollers who wish to go unnoticed"
c60153,s5,This is perhaps the most private hotel and staff you will ever encounter in any city in the world
c60153,s6,Certain floors cannot be accessed since they are private for those who wish to not be seen when spending hundreds of thousands on single hands of baccarat
c60153,s7,The rooms are immaculate…
c60154,s1,"I'd stayed here for 2 nights recently, and thoroughly enjoyed it"
c60154,s2,"I got their winter promotion package, which is a relative good value"
c60154,s3,"It includes 30-minute massage in the spa, breakfast for 2 and limo transfer (in a Mercedes sedan) from/to the ferry terminal"
c60154,s4,The room is spacious and decor elegant; it has the feel of grandness when one first walk in the spacious corridor in the room
c60154,s5,"The separate vanity, bathroom and walk-in closet area is about half the size of the room!  The L-shaped couch in front of the floor-to-ceiling window is very comfortable, but has some stain spots that couldn't come off"
c60154,s6,It is great for lounging and watching the big LCD TV (provided that you are not distracted by the Macau view facing you ;-)
c60154,s7,The facility in the spa is no doubt first class
c60154,s8,…
c60155,s1,Most amazing hotel I've stayed at! Located just south of Macau Island on the Taipa side
c60155,s2,It is the tallest building on Taipa
c60155,s3,The view is spectacular both from the lobby and the Seaside view rooms
c60155,s4,The beds are super comfortable and spacious
c60155,s5,Swimming pool is great as well
c60155,s6,"Not  very large, but is indoors and has a great view"
c60155,s7,"Breakfast is excellent as well, though the buffet selection is a bit limited in terms of main course items"
c60155,s8,The hotel staff are warm and helpful
c60156,s1,We stayed here in December 2009 during a visit to Hong Kong
c60156,s2,"What a stunning hotel!  Downstairs doesn't look a lot as the lobby is up on the 38th floor, and when the lift opens it's just wow"
c60156,s3,"We stayed on the 32nd floor, so it was back down 6 floors in a different lift"
c60156,s4,"The room was large, clean and extremely comfortable with the biggest bed I've ever slept in!  The wet room had everything we needed, and when we went out in the evening the maid came in for the turndown service and replacement of any toiletries we had already opened"
c60156,s5,The minibar was all available free of charge and there was also a well stocked fruit bowl and tea and coffee box
c60156,s6,There was a comfortable seating  area and huge cable TV  The staff were attentive and friendly and we'd have loved to stay…
c60157,s1,"As we got a very valuable package with tickets from HK, we chose Crown"
c60157,s2,"The location of Crown is not near old urban district nor new developed area, but this resulted a peaceful environment around"
c60157,s3,The room is large and well equited
c60157,s4,It is one of the most fancy one that i have even stayed
c60157,s5,Big bath tub and rain shower
c60157,s6,The bed is very comfortable
c60157,s7,The lounge area is one of the best of my experience
c60157,s8,One thing I would highly recommand is the infinity pool
c60157,s9,It is over looking the whole macau Peninsula
c60157,s10,The view is absoultely stunning
c60157,s11,The steam and sauna and Jacuzzi in the changing room worth a visit~!  The breakfast we had inroom is very nice
c60157,s12,Arrive sharp in the order time
c60157,s13,Nice presented and taste excellent
c60157,s14,"Staff are all friendly, but some of the service attendent came…"
c60158,s1,I have been staying with those very famous 5 stars hotels in macau
c60158,s2,This is absolutely the best one that I have ever stay with
c60158,s3,I didn't like their location a lot
c60158,s4,but other than that
c60158,s5,everything was almost perfect
c60158,s6,I love their room the best
c60158,s7,nice suite
c60158,s8,"very cozy, so homelike they offered free high speed internet access"
c60158,s9,free softdrinks
c60158,s10,"newspaper service, fruit plate"
c60158,s11,i-pod stand
c60158,s12,we just stayed in the room reading
c60158,s13,surfing online
c60158,s14,"we ordered a room service ""club sandwich"" very delicous"
c60158,s15,the staff was always there for us
c60158,s16,to help us
c60158,s17,"We also tried their french restaurant , nice food and good service I do believe this is the very best getaway hotel you can choose in macau We stayed there 2 nights"
c60158,s18,there are some comments about their room cleaness
c60158,s19,which didn't happened…
c60159,s1,In november 2007 I spent 2 nights at The Crown Macau
c60159,s2,I must say it was a very pleasant experience
c60159,s3,In the other reviews it was mentioned dat this hotel does not deserve a five star rating
c60159,s4,"(or a six star experience) Although I agree, ik think that the Crown is one of the best hotels in Macau"
c60159,s5,"Food and service are very good, the design of the hotel is very special indeed"
c60159,s6,"What the hotel spent on design, they saved on materials"
c60159,s7,"Shower, toilet, taps, tables, walls don't have the quality you would expect"
c60159,s8,If you look closely you'll see they used cheap products with the lack craftmanship
c60159,s9,It all was fine now but in a year or two I would expect a refurbishment would be needed
c60159,s10,"The service was perfect, staff is very friendly and all spoke English"
c60159,s11,This I would rate 5 stars
c60159,s12,At…
c60160,s1,"This was my second trip to Macau for business purposes, and the Crown is definitely the most luxurious hotel in Macau (I've also stayed at the Wynn, Venetian, and Westin in Macau)"
c60160,s2,"The spa is gorgeous, restuarants great - although pricey"
c60160,s3,Much more of a boutique feel than staying at the other casino properties
c60160,s4,The only negative is that its in a strange location with not much around it
c60160,s5,"There also isnt much mass gaming going on, since its mostly a VIP location, which is fine with me since I dont gamble"
c60161,s1,"It was a nice place and nice stay, specially when sleeping is so comfortable and the room was so clean and also all staff was so polite and nice, we will go back to the future again and i will recommend to my friends also what kind of experience they will have it if they stay in altira"
c60162,s1,"Cannot visit other places, stay at local hotels instead!  The room, the amenities, the staff, the food, the spa, the in-door swimming pool, everything everything are all perfect!  The turn down service is so caring and full-heartedly!  One must come to stay here once in a life when in Macau!  Worth!"
c60163,s1,"It was a nice place and nice stay, specially when sleeping is so comfortable and the room was so clean and also all staff was so polite and nice, we will go back to the future again and i will recommend to my friends also what kind of experience they will have it if they stay in altira"
