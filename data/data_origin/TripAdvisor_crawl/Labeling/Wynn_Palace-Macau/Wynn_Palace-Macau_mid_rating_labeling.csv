c6500000,s1,For the past few years my husband and I have been staying at the Wynn Palace Hotel at least 3 or 4 times a year and usually for about a week or so
c6500000,s2,Usually the staff were very helpful and friendly but this time we encountered a very rude and unhelpful bellboy!   Back in January we stayed a total of 10 days and we also got friends to stay there for a few days too
c6500000,s3,While my husband was checking out my friends and I were standing to the side of a doorway with our luguages not blocking anyone
c6500000,s4,When my husband came out we got ready to push our 6 luggages out to the front entrance
c6500000,s5,A bellboy walked over and told us in Mandarin to move aside with our luggages
c6500000,s6,I told him back in Cantonese that we are moving out to the front entrance as we have checked out
c6500000,s7,Instead of doing his job of…
c6500001,s1,Last year was really pleasant and all the staff were kind but disappointing
c6500001,s2,I don't think it's being managed well
c6500001,s3,And The smell of flowers in the lobby seems to have weakened
c6500001,s4,Our room smell was so strange
c6500001,s5,"I asked for a non-smoking room, but I got a cigarette from the bedhead recognition air conditioner"
c6500002,s1,"Hotel room are really badly designed, looks luxurious at first look, but really designed by someone who lacks taste"
c6500002,s2,Its nothing compared to Wynn in Las Vegas
c6500002,s3,"Staff was average, restaurants really average as well"
c6500003,s1,Great expectations can lead to great disappointments
c6500003,s2,"It may be because of Chinese New Year's Day, but there are too many people"
c6500003,s3,"It was a nonsmoking room, but the smell of cigarettes in the room was very unpleasant"
c6500004,s1,"Although the decoration is too golden for my liking, it matches the casino theme"
c6500004,s2,Staff are friendly and helpful
c6500004,s3,The room is spacious and full of mirrors and the location is good
c6500004,s4,I guess I have nothing to complain
c6500005,s1,This is a Forbes Standard hotel but some area might need to improve
c6500005,s2,"Experience: - Using Expedia VIP Access to enjoy the privilege, but unfortunately did not treated as a entitled guest - Front Desk was unsure my entitlement, checked-in process was take more than 15 minutes - Request early check in, but when approached to front desk only been informed have to wait for 3 1/2 hour for room to ready"
c6500005,s3,- The most TERRIBLE incident is get to informed luggage assistant for check out which after step in to room for 30mins! - Housekeeping been sent wrong item for twice
c6500005,s4,Pros: - Hotel provided Cotai connection shuttle which can explore other hotel within Cotai area and also shuttle to different location which is really convenient  - Breakfast served at Fontana is awesome! - Spa in…
c6500006,s1,We stayed for three nights
c6500006,s2,This hotel is not good if you are bringing kids
c6500006,s3,The problem is not really about the hotel staff or the infrastructure
c6500006,s4,There are just too many mainland Chinese people running around the hotel
c6500006,s5,They are not nice and friendly
c6500006,s6,"For example, we used our room card to get into the express queue for the cable car service"
c6500006,s7,A mainland Chinese lady was originally in the normal queue
c6500006,s8,"She came over to my queue and said that they know us and ""join"" us (i"
c6500006,s9,e
c6500006,s10,jumping the queue)
c6500006,s11,"Another example: In the middle of the day, two other Mainland Chinese tourists were wandering in the lift lobby"
c6500006,s12,"When we entered the lift, they followed us"
c6500006,s13,We used our room card to go to my floor
c6500006,s14,They requested us to use my room card again so that they could get to the floor they…
c6500007,s1,"Wynn Palace is a grand and elegant Casino hotel, the primary colours are gold, off white, yellow, orange and shade of purple"
c6500007,s2,"Open more than a year ago I was told, everything, carpet, lightings, is rich and beautiful"
c6500007,s3,"I would have given it a perfect score if not for the staff, its not their attitude but communication and soft skills is a problem in Wynn Palace, you wonder if enough or correct training is being done? I check in at 1am, reception told me I do not have a reservation, she passed it to her colleague, took sometime before he says, oh, its under a different name, he look at my passport and the reception computer, Ok, now its my fault"
c6500007,s4,"The suite we book is nice, big but bare, my recommendation is, save the money and book a normal room, in Macau, one hardly spend time in…"
c6500008,s1,the resort it was very nice
c6500008,s2,room clean and big
c6500008,s3,design and finishing very accurate
c6500008,s4,service ok
c6500008,s5,not bad not wow!
c6500008,s6,just standard!!! the line in the morning to be seated for breakfast took me over 20' and the swimming pool it was close because under maintenance: that's very disappointing because it was a reason of my choice while booking and nobody informed about the disservice!!!
c6500009,s1,I do not speak English
c6500009,s2,"When communication became uncomfortable, the employees were in a bad mood"
c6500009,s3,I would not recommend this hotel for those who can not speak English and Chinese
c6500009,s4,"When we could not communicate, the staff kept us waiting and was doing sns"
c6500009,s5,"The room condition was better than the Galaxy Hotel, but the service was a mess  I wanted to extend the day but I was denied that the room reservation was full"
c6500009,s6,"But I was able to extend the room for free at the casino, but I was in a bad mood"
c6500010,s1,"It was said that it was daytime only during the day, but there was no advance notice and the child was uncomfortable to take a nap"
c6500010,s2,"Again, it was an experience"
c6500010,s3,"However, the employees ' feelings and cleanliness were very impressive and happy"
c6500011,s1,"Everything was fine, but"
c6500011,s2,I felt a little sorry for my poor breakfast
c6500011,s3,breakfast
c6500011,s4,was no steak & ice cream
c6500011,s5,But the fruit juice tasted good
c6500011,s6,"Bread tasted good, but I couldn't eat it beacuse morning"
c6500011,s7,and I didn't catch the sky cap
c6500011,s8,See you next time
c6500012,s1,Same as its Name
c6500012,s2,PALACE!! Expect everything Grand n Spacious
c6500012,s3,"Hardware, really Great!! Software"
c6500012,s4,Can be better
c6500012,s5,2 things we really Appreciate most were Unlimited rides of cable car n 2 Huge TV inside room
c6500012,s6,Other than that
c6500012,s7,Everything was just fine
c6500013,s1,"there was someone tried to enter the room in the early morning, luckily i locked the door when i slept, he/she could not enter the room, in room dining service is good, but the dry fried beef river taste was bad"
c6500014,s1,"Improvement at higher level,on this other side I have not feel any problems in the lower level, such as house keeping,room service"
c6500014,s2,"reception, reseveration even the luggage delivery etc"
c6500014,s3,"all seem to be quite on duty, that is want idea and feel during my stay"
c6500015,s1,"As of this writing, my companion's luggage has not been delivered to his room nor has it been found"
c6500015,s2,The last time we saw it was at the bell-service trolley
c6500015,s3,Hey the staff is very respectful but not all are efficient
c6500015,s4,"While we hope the guy doesn't lose his job, we hope that the luggage is found"
c6500015,s5,"It's more of the hotel system: the hotel is full of touchbutton technology and all, but i wonder about security cameras which should be able to trace the whereabouts of luggage deliveries"
c6500016,s1,We came to celebrate friend's anniversary and I would like to express my feelings from pre-	arrival arrangement to staying experience
c6500016,s2,Pre-arrival
c6500016,s3,1
c6500016,s4,I book two rooms (a package with guarantee upgrade to suite room and cable car tickets) online and requested for connecting room
c6500016,s5,I found the rate was double than my Oct reservation with the same deal
c6500016,s6,I called to reservation and they of course can't do anything
c6500016,s7,Not even bother my question
c6500016,s8,I explained that I visit Macau every month and each time I stay in suite in other hotel
c6500016,s9,Last month I got a much better offer and I also found a good rate on travel agent
c6500016,s10,They said they didnt cooperate with that travel agent and just ended my question
c6500016,s11,2
c6500016,s12,I called to Concierge to help a few arrangement to my friend's room
c6500016,s13,They…
c6500017,s1,"Since hotel is new, rooms are clean and nice"
c6500017,s2,"There are a lot of shops but location is not accessible, hence there is little shoppers"
c6500017,s3,There is cable car ride at the hotel entrance which is interesting
c6500018,s1,I stayed at the Wynn Palace recently for one night as part of a 5 day trip to Hong Kong
c6500018,s2,I have been to Vegas and perhaps unfairly expected a similar experience
c6500018,s3,"The room at the Wynn was exceptional, perhaps the best hotel room I have ever stayed in, certainly the largest television!   The casino was less impressive, mainly higher stakes games; probably fair enough given their target clientele but nowhere near the diversity of choice available in Vegas"
c6500018,s4,Drinks service at the tables was very slow bordering on the non-existent; as amateur gamblers we expected a drinkie or two!   The casino is surrounded by shops and amazingly there is only one bar! I think one of the restaurants had a bar within but only one dedicated place to get a drink! Very odd
c6500018,s5,"The bar itself was nice, a bit…"
c6500019,s1,"The room is spacious and huge, kind of wasted since we were her only for 1 night"
c6500019,s2,"Our package didn't include breakfast, so we need to go out for meals"
c6500019,s3,"Not much choice of restaurants within the hotel complex, because most of the restaurants are quite expensive, although there is a Starbucks outlet"
c6500020,s1,This is one of the newest hotels in town with the biggest room size
c6500020,s2,"I checked in on my birthday but was not recognized by the hotel, not even a greetings from the front office agent after seeing my id"
c6500020,s3,It is well understood as I was not paying any rack or corporate rate but this can tell a difference from a truly luxury hotel
c6500020,s4,Guest room and bathroom is indeed spacious and fully functional
c6500020,s5,"TV is huge and user friendly tablet is available to control lighting, curtain etc"
c6500020,s6,There are 6 built-in usb plugs which are adequate to recharge my gear
c6500020,s7,"Golden color amenities and decoration are used extensively in guest room and public areas, such as comb, tooth brush, razor, tissue box, speakers, carpet, which are too much IMO"
c6500020,s8,Will I come back then?
c6500021,s1,Its the little things that can make a hotel stay memorable for all the wrong reasons
c6500021,s2,Yes it is a well appointed hotel casino with all the glitz and glam that Mr Wynn brings to all his establishments
c6500021,s3,"My only issues were check-in guy kept telling me that i couldn't get Skycab access even though I was a Wynn-Insider member, had to ask another staff member the next day who fixed things up immediately"
c6500021,s4,No turn down service on the first night
c6500021,s5,Training issue it seems
c6500021,s6,"Put the 'Clean My Room' Light on at 8 am, no one came till I called after 2 pm"
c6500021,s7,"Once the cleaner arrived, keeps the door open and other guests wandered in and out of my room to ask for additional items from her"
c6500021,s8,"Luckily I was in there and I could observe where they went, but still an oversight of security in my…"
c6500022,s1,I got the suite room overlooking their lake and with amazing views especially at night
c6500022,s2,Check in was slow and messy as their reception room was crowded with a lot of people
c6500022,s3,I had two negatives with them and both involves the refrigerator and the drinks inside
c6500022,s4,I found a half drank Heineken inside and couldn't believe that wasn't checked when the room was being cleaned out
c6500022,s5,They changed and fix that with no problems though
c6500022,s6,"2nd problem was during check out, they thought a Red Bull was drank but it was never touched! They were kind about it though but I think their sensor fridge need some fixing"
c6500022,s7,The room and everything with is was comfortable and location was very near to other high end hotels
c6500022,s8,"Inside the hotel, there weren't much things to do and limited stores and…"
c6500023,s1,Went to Wynn Palace to see what they have as the cable car and fountain attracted me
c6500023,s2,The casino is at the center of the whole building which is the same for the Coatai hotels
c6500023,s3,Hotel guests are having free ride of the cable car
c6500023,s4,Try it in the night will be nice
c6500023,s5,Most restaurants are located along the fountain to enjoy the show with their meal
c6500023,s6,They have two main flowers displays at two junctions
c6500023,s7,Now is having flower wheel and flowers balloons
c6500023,s8,Of course the outer ring surrounding the casino are the luxury shops and restaurants
c6500024,s1,"The stay at your hotel is generally very pleasant however, expecting a non-smoking room but with matches and ashtray inside the room"
c6500024,s2,My inlaws would love to try the pool but it was under maintenance
c6500024,s3,They then wanted to try the cable car in the morning but was under maintenance
c6500024,s4,That was a bit disappointing
c6500025,s1,This was my second visit to this hotel as I like the sky cab and the fountain
c6500025,s2,I came with my family and they were unable to give us our rooms until 17:00
c6500025,s3,We had made our request for non-smoking rooms a few days before our arrival but the rooms were found with strong smell of cigarette
c6500025,s4,We ordered room service for breakfast in the next morning and was asked to pay cash despite of our room deposits
c6500025,s5,It took for about 15 minutes until he got permission from his superior before we could start our cold breakfast
c6500025,s6,"The rooms were luxury  and the lake view were good, we also enjoyed the sky cab ride"
c6500025,s7,"However, good hardware should be supported by good software"
c6500026,s1,Hotel condition is great and elegant
c6500026,s2,Rooms are very spacious and we have a good stay
c6500026,s3,"However, we struggled to find the right restaurant (lunch/dinner) when travelling with a 2 years old"
c6500026,s4,Almost all restaurants serve only above 5 while it is not likely to have seats available at the buffet restaurant (the only place for kids) for walk-in guests
c6500027,s1,"helpful and efficient of front line staff - Coco Mall environment is nice and special, smell good with loving atmosphere"
c6500027,s2,rooms for improvement: 1- i book 4 rooms by 2 seperate booking by different date thru travel web site
c6500027,s3,when i check in i ask the front line staff - Anthony that whether i need to check out and check in again on the second day
c6500027,s4,and he says i need to do so
c6500027,s5,so the next morning i need to spend almost 40mins for my 4 rooms
c6500027,s6,i think this can be improved as other hotel can take care too
c6500027,s7,2- the cleaning of the room is poor
c6500027,s8,i find the stain on the coffee table when i check in but the next day i still find the stain there 3- the hair dryer is damage when i first use
c6500027,s9,i place it on the table and hope they will get it fixed
c6500027,s10,but the next morning i take it out again…
c6500028,s1,"When I made this booking, I specifically stated that it was for my mom's birthday celebration"
c6500028,s2,"When we arrived at the hotel, I was told that a birthday cake has been arranged, so we were all waiting till 2 am, but received nothing, my mom was disappointed"
c6500028,s3,"Also I requested a room near the elevator as my mom can't walk very far, but we were given a room at the end of the corridor"
c6500028,s4,"As a loyal customer at Wynn, I didn't expect this level of service"
c6500029,s1,I stayed two nights from 23/11 to 25/11 with my wife to celebrate her birthday
c6500029,s2,We expected this brand new hotel would provide high end services
c6500029,s3,The front desk manager greeted us during our checkin which we appreciated
c6500029,s4,The standard room with said 68 sq
c6500029,s5,m which was spacious
c6500029,s6,However the room provided with very limited room amenities than I expected
c6500029,s7,"There was no coffee maker, bath salts and/or bubbles powders"
c6500029,s8,I made requests of bath salts from the guest services but with the answers that it was out of stock
c6500029,s9,But finally I knew that bath salts were only provided for suite room which I could not accepted
c6500029,s10,"As I had same requests at Sheraton hotel, they provided the amenities to us without any hesitation"
c6500029,s11,Furthermore the hotel official website should provide sufficient details…
c6500030,s1,The Wynn Palace is one of the two latest additions to the Cotai Strip
c6500030,s2,"This is the second Wynn property in Macau, being located just east of the City of Dreams property next to a future LRT station which will be located just in front of the hotel"
c6500030,s3,"From the outside, Wynn Palace resembles its other properties with tall bronze coloured high rise hotel building"
c6500030,s4,"One of the things that makes this Wynn property unique, is that it is fronted by a large artificial body of water referred to as the Performance Lake, similar to what you might have seen at the Bellagio in Las Vegas"
c6500030,s5,The Performance Lake features a Light and Water fountain show every 30 minutes between 12-7pm and every 20 minutes between 7-12am daily
c6500030,s6,"During the intervals, the fountain continues to burst smaller water…"
c6500031,s1,"I'm a huge fan of Steve Wynn, his properties and everything he has accomplished in Las Vegas, where I love to visit reguarly"
c6500031,s2,I was thrilled to find out Wynn Palace was opening shortly before my visit to Macau and had to see the latest evolution of the Wynn experience
c6500031,s3,"Undoubtedly, as others have said, this is a beautiful and well thought out resort but I felt genuine hospitality was saved only for those with the deepest (VIP) pockets"
c6500031,s4,"Everything in the hotel is priced exceptionally high by like-for-like standards (and I have been lucky enough to stay in numerous luxury hotels around the world) to the point where, frankly, you feel ripped off"
c6500031,s5,Cafe Fontana restaurant was perhaps one of the worst experiences of our trip - being charged 45mop for a small glass of coke at an…
c6500032,s1,Requested birthday amenity but got no feedback from the hotel
c6500032,s2,And the staff service at the reception area was not prompt and efficient as we thought it should be
c6500032,s3,I arrived at around 2 oclock and the staff told me that room is not ready until 3:00， I was told to come back again by 3， but i got back at 3:00， the staff told me the same that my room was not ready
c6500032,s4,Isn't it suppose to be three oclock the check in time
c6500033,s1,"Nice hotel, big room, good services in the hotel but worst services in restaurant  Red 8"
c6500033,s2,Waiting over 30 mins for the food in non-peak hours
c6500033,s3,Staff don't let us to cancel the order with bad atitude
c6500033,s4,"Recommend live in this hotel, but go outside to eat"
c6500034,s1,"The rooms looks 6 stars, but the furniture, toiletries and amenities is really 3 stars"
c6500034,s2,I checked into the hotel at 14:00 and my room was ready until 16:00
c6500034,s3,"Will I come back again? No! For the price, there are  better hotels in Macau"
c6500035,s1,Let just begin with the check in where it is extremely chaotic
c6500035,s2,Only two sofas with 50 people queueing
c6500035,s3,"So I waited 20 minutes before I was able to check in and they say the room is not avaliable until 3pm, which is not the end of the world for waiting under 55 minutes"
c6500035,s4,"Finally, when I got my room, I requested the front desk to request bath salt for obviously taking a bath and they said they ran out of bath salt because too many hotel guest request bath salt"
c6500035,s5,"I stand firm and requested to talk to the senior manager and they called back and said they made a mistake, which means that the front desk lied"
c6500035,s6,It was complete non sense to say they ran out of bath salt
c6500035,s7,"Then, we book the Wynn Lei Palace chinese restaurant at 2:15pm for 2 amd the front desk said it is possible as they…"
c6500036,s1,"Check in organize was poor, no lines to line up, ppl all jumping around to get check in, left me  wait for long time to have staff to notice me waiting"
c6500036,s2,dis pointed that waterfall was not operate on the day
c6500036,s3,"reason to book the hotel and restaurant was the waterfall, but it was not operate"
c6500036,s4,bad experience
c6500036,s5,Room was great and design is detail with design
c6500036,s6,"Fitness room great , equipment updated and staff are helpful and friendly"
c6500037,s1,Top price but not provide top service
c6500037,s2,Not graden or playground for kids
c6500037,s3,Cable car rule not standard for every staff: some is ok if only show the room card but some need to get the free tricket first
c6500038,s1,"Overall:  Though pricing is in line with other similar 5* properties in Macau, Wynn Palace is just ok"
c6500038,s2,Location isn't at the most happening part of Taipa
c6500038,s3,Service is below average probably due to training issues
c6500038,s4,The pool is so-so
c6500038,s5,The decoration is way over the top with too much gold and bright carpeting
c6500038,s6,"Please turn off the music in all public areas!  Location:  15 minutes from Taipa pier, 30 minutes from Macau pier, shuttle bus runs frequently and a few other places (Venetian, Taipa town)"
c6500038,s7,There is no much around the hotel's immediate area--nothing is truly within walking distance
c6500038,s8,Reception:  Check-in/out service is inefficient
c6500038,s9,"My entire reservation is prepaid, but the staff has to spend several minutes finding it on the system, asking me the same question…"
c6500039,s1,The TV remote was not working properly
c6500039,s2,There was no turn down service the first night
c6500039,s3,The remainder of the nights there was turn down service for one even though there were two of us in the room
c6500039,s4,Two of the four days a Chinese newspaper was left on the door but we are English speaking
c6500040,s1,"Overall service quality was poor, especially the attendants on the floor"
c6500040,s2,Staff were poorly trained and lack spirit to serve customers or the capacity to greet customers with a smile
c6500040,s3,I am unlikely to stay with Wynn Palace again if there are no Craps table
c6500041,s1,"Visited here as I was in Macau for the Parisian opening, and so only made use of the facilities on a Day Trip basis"
c6500041,s2,"Wynn Palace is in part modeled on the ""Encore at Wynn"" in Law Vegas"
c6500041,s3,"Eg floral kinetic sculptures, the carpet, the red and gold decor"
c6500041,s4,"However, there is an over-emphasis on high end shops  and not enough attractions which are more accessible"
c6500041,s5,"This is thinking appropriate for 2013 / 2014, when there were lots of Chinese high rolling gamblers, but not for 2016"
c6500041,s6,The cable car mode of arriving at the hotel is a gimmick
c6500041,s7,It's not worth the HK$100 to take the trip
c6500041,s8,Many guests appear to be pulling there luggage from the Main Street by hand
c6500041,s9,"The hotel is poorly located although it's next to a Monorail station, running through the Taipa area (unfinished) and so it's…"
c6500042,s1,"The room was large and it was luxurious and gave an impression of cleanliness, and sweets of the every evening were very good"
c6500042,s2,"The quality of the buffet is good, but a price is high"
c6500042,s3,The entrance of the hotel is far when from the outside
c6500042,s4,"Because the pool is small small, it is not a product for families"
c6500043,s1,This brand new ultra-high end hotel grantly opened in the last week of August
c6500043,s2,The casino is really nice and cosy
c6500043,s3,"The decorations and image of the ground floor is the same as Wynn,  Macau but I like the casino here when comparing to Wynn Macau"
