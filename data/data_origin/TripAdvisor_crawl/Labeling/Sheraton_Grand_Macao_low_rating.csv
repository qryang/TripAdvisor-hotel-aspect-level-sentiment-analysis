"All the filipino staves and security personnel from the hotel and in casino are all acting bossy and disrespectful. They are like waiting for a tip, and if you don‚Äôt give a tip, they will snob and make face plus laugh behind your back. They are making fun of the guests. Seems like they‚Äôre not seriously doing their job. They should be fired and replaced by more competent people. They act bossy like they want the guests to adjust for them, really.",10
"Would not suggest staying here at all. The rooms are below par, the service is missing and there is very little ambience or atmosphere. It is lacking in every element that a Sheraton Grand should portray. Sadly can not recommend this place. ",10
"Upon booking, I ordered a non-smoking room, but I was welcomed by a strong smell of cigarette when entering the room. We called Room Service, and the staff was indeed very sorry and willing to help. The agent told me that a staff member would bring the keys to the room in a few minutes.  Behold, that's when the drama starts.  It was 11.45 pm when we called room service (it was indeed late by normal standards, however, in Macau, the service was still at full scale, even in late night). We waited for an hour, an whole hour without any staff appearance. We called again. The staff remained very polite and was very sorry for the delay, which was appreciated. However,  the staff member did not appear in half an hour. This was already around 1.20 am.  The staff did not brought us the‚Ä¶",10
"Very basic stay in Macau, and as a Titanium Elite Member, I expected more than a plate of fruits in my very basic, old feeling room, which deserves some remodeling.  Unfortunately, I wasn‚Äôt upgraded to a suite as expected whenever there‚Äôs one available (and there was). That would have made a big difference.  In fact, the only good thing about my stay was Ms. Carmela at the Club Lounge, who‚Äôs a true professional and the sweetest person. Thank you. ",20
"I received an email stating I can check in at Marriott Bonvoy counter but when I wanted to step onto the steps, I was blocked by a Marriott lady staff who was very unfriendly and rude requesting me to show the print out indicating I am a Marriott member.  I told her that I am a gold member but I didnt print out the check in email or downloads the apps.  However, I asked her to let me in to sit on the sofa first and show her my passport.  She used her  body to block me to go in, I felt so insulted. My husband just came in and gave her my passport, then she passed the passport to let the reception staff to check.  After checking, our booking was there.  The lady did not apologize for her rudeness but just walked away.",30
"Arrive hotel at 5pm and the queue isn't very long, but the ground staff took me to 4/F club lounge but it takes around 5 mins up and down, once we get out from the lift, original I am at 2nd, other guests jump in front of me and make me into fifth...so sad, the staff should arrange it...In fact, I don't feel it is faster with only 2 staffs there and feel inexperience.  Finally, I can check in and the lady told me they only have double room, but what I booked is a twin room, also she said all non smoking rooms are unavailable or still tidy up, OMG...is 5pm, I suppose everything are ready...what's a poor front desk service I never have in Sheraton group.

"It's fine if you like gambling, I guess. And shopping though the prices are twice as high for brand names than anywhere else. The rooms are large and comfortable> the rest of the hotel is like being on a crowded city street. No quiet lounge or coffee shop or bar. They were waxing the floor in the lobby at 1 am when people are still out and about and the one coffee shop bar in the middle of the crowded lobby was already closed. I guess the only thing left to do is gamble.",30
Stayed at Sheraton this November. Room condition was poor. Middle of the night room heater stopped working. I had to change room with small kid. Even after talking to the manager I was not compensated for the trouble ,10
"As an Elite Bonvoy member I was really hoping to leave a more positive review. Our trip was mixed, at best.   The rooms are quite nice and comfortable, although the hotel itself is very disjointed. Service is far off what a normal Macau experience is.   Our check-in was very unpleasant. We were invited as Bonvoy members to check in online prior to arriving. Don‚Äôt bother... you need to go through the entire check in process all over again when you arrive.... Check in took a long time, as our attendant was working through the system. The staff are quite pleasant and do try their best to deliver good service, but the system and the poor Organisation of the hotel work against their efforts. The lobby and elevators all smell of cigarette smoke...  The only positives were that our‚Ä¶",30

Normal facilities and good size of room. Avoid 2~3 pm n 5~6 pm for check in or out as many tours wld arrive n created long waiting time.  Drop keycard at express check out stand to avoid long queue.

"Unacceptable service.  I was disappointed by this hotel because I checked out at 7:30am. Obviously I left my glasses already and no one from hotel gave me one single call for the whole day. I had my conference in this hotel conference room till 4pm. Within all these 8 hours, no one called me. Not a single call. And if any of their staff had tried to call me, I might not need to go through all these email sending, phone call waiting.   I discovered I left my glasses when I arrived Hong Kong home. My friends will check out tomorrow so I asked them to call the reception to see if they found any glasses. The receptionist replied them immediately saying no lost items was found. So I called the reception myself at 8:30pm, they said they would check for me, and they called back saying‚Ä¶",10

When asked, he told us that the swimming pools are all closed until March. I could not find these information on their website. Not recommended.",30
"The hotel room rate is cheaper than the rest adjacent Marriott brand hotels.  As a platinum member, I didn‚Äôt get any upgrade, not even a better view room.  It was a slow weekday, the hotel was not sold out.  I checked in the hotel by Marriott mobile few days ago and it didn‚Äôt seem anything happen.  I asked if there was any upgrade during in person check in, the check in person immediately told me no without even looking the computer.  When we got to the room, I saw a maid was cleaning the adjacent room.  I asked her if we can get extra large towel, she immediately told me no.  She said she only had enough towels for the room she was cleaning.  We did get the free breakfast as the platinum benefit on the first floor restaurant.

Well, there is no service especially your claim yourself 5* hotel at the formal dinner, the staff doesn't even know what is red, white glasses, yes, it was that bad, no training at all, just randomly find someone who is available for part-time work.

"Spent two nights in this hotel with my wife to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Booked their suite  which the room is quite nice, clean and very spacious. However, the room is full of cigar smell and we thought the smell will gone after some time, but when we get back at night time,  the smell is still there and we are too sleepy to ask for another room, so we spent our first night sleeping in an ashtray.  First day breakfast is very disappointed as we were asked to have our breakfast at their ballroom which everything was set up temporary, some of their hot dishes are cold. So we request to have the breakfast at the cafe in the next morning but not at the ballroom.

"Even as a premium member it took us ages to check in. 4 bottle white wine list with only 2 available (and as you would expect the two I didn‚Äôt like!). Corridors and room smell of stale food and the air-con didn‚Äôt work. People who visit here like to cook their own food in the rooms.   They did send people up to try and fix it, but frankly it shouldn‚Äôt happen in the first place. (Photo of chap deodorising)  Just generally a typical Cotai casino hotel experience - very average and best to be avoided. In fact, avoid Macau hotels in general!  I don‚Äôt apply this to Marriott/Bonvoy in general - I‚Äôm a fan - but just this (and most) Macau hotels! Stay in HK and travel over!",20
"After an exceptional stay at the Sheraton Nanshan, this property fell short in welcoming me as a Lifetime Titanium Elite guest. I was upgraded to a regular club room with a sad view. No suite upgrade and they said I had to have breakfast in the club room or use up my welcome amenity to eat in the main breakfast area. Seriously? This property made me feel like an average guest. I haven't been in a regular room in years. It is very disappointing given how many rooms there are here, and that they have a designated check in for elite members. The check in was just underwhelming, no welcome note from management with snacks in my room, and again, the view and room, as basic as can be. So disappointed! Take note from the Sheraton Nanshan and step it up!  ",30
"Stayed at this hotel for one night in early September 2019.  This hotel is an average casino hotel, very large and very busy. Have stayed a few times but as a Marriott Titanium member have been rarely upgraded. Have always been advised the hotel is very busy.  The rooms are quite large but do not have a stocked minibar. Also the room had basic amenities unlike other Sheraton hotels in Asia.  As a Marriott Elite member you are able to request extra amenities on their app. These were not in the room and had to make a request three times for them.  The club lounge is good and has an excellent Happy Hour and Breakfast.  Overall this hotel is average but don‚Äôt expect anything special if you are an elite member.    ",30
"Was there a couple of years ago and I gave it a real thumbs up for service and quality. Fast forward to today, tired , poor service and dirty room. Maybe it‚Äôs because of the business or joining Marriott  Bonvoy. It was my wife birthday and I wanted to get a room upgrade. Before grouping together it was much easier. Now points are meaner to get by just like Cathay. Had similar experience in Sheraton Melbourne. All I got was a 3 inch cake. The cleaners also never cleaned the cups and gave us so little toiletries. Had to ask all the time. Highly embarrassed. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll stay in Sheraton chain again. I noticed a big drop in quality after joining Marriot Bonvoy",20
"The Sheraton is a bit of a dinosaur. It hasn't aged gracefully and it shows. Check-in is a real pain with long lines and slow service. The layout of the hotel is truly awful as if you're staying in the Earth tower, the trip to the pool is really far. And the pool is really quite mediocre compared to the competition. The taxi lines are also long and unforgiving. The hotel feels like a casino first and hotel second. There are so many superior choices in Cotai that if I hadn't gone to the Galaxy afterwards, my impression of Macau would have remained rather poor. ",20
"I stayed here for two nights. I don‚Äôt think it is worth the price. After I checked out at noon I wanted to use the pool, which I thought was a reasonable request. The unsmiling staff told me that I would have to pay a fee to use the pool only for  a few hours until I took my cab ride to the airport. I paid the price and used the pool but what a disappointment! The burger they served was burned, literally and they charged for it too. ",10
"The worst hotel in Macao, especially the front desk and concierge, is not at all enthusiastic, the shower is broken, and waiting for long time with room change, is far worse than that next to Conrad Macao, Cotai Central",10
"bad 1: checked in loooong quene as in photo. i cant understand why there were only a few staff serving such a long Q. tip: book direct with hotel next time so can use e-check in. bad 2: The Sheraton is comprised of two towers. Earth tower is far from swimming pool.  tip: to avoid the looong walkÔºåchoose sky tower if available. esp if you are travelling with kids/old family members.  good 1: comfy bed n clean room. good 2: swimming pool is big. safeguard is responsible since i saw him asking 2 children who play without adults' attendance.  Overall: an average hotel staying experience. Did the job but surprised that there were NO staff expressing greetings, as a hotel residence, during our 2D1N stay.  It's cool if you like this cold feeling.  ",30
"Sheraton Hotel Macau is located at the Cotai Central, inside the Sands Cotai Central - a huge resort complex. Also it known as the largest Sheraton in the world.  Glad to receive some pre-welcome email from the hotel before my stay. One of the email mentioned they have a checkin counter - ‚ÄúMarriott Bonvoy Counter‚Äù to enhance an better arrival experience. So that I tried to process my checkin there, however, the first thing I suffer is the staff at the entrance shout to me ‚ÄúAre you our member!?‚Äù In an impolite way surely. That‚Äôs the way to enhance a better arrival experience for guest? I doubt.

Room service is pricey and the food isnt good  Now for the good: The location is superb The hotel grounds is lovely   ",30
"Visited this hotel 5 years ago thinking that it is still one of the finest hotel in Cotai with impeccable service at the club lounge .. was I wrong !!!! The lounge has deteriorated into a canteen type environment with disastrous ambience.. people were piling up the food they cannot finish and it was like a disaster relief centre.. real disappointing  Room wise things are looking ‚Äútired‚Äù and towels definitely need a change ... housekeeping is bad too. Definitely will not return as there are many many choices in this area now with many more hotels up like MGM,Wynn,Parisian,etc just across the road from Sheraton. I suspect the management has changed hands to local management",10
"The first thing I noticed about the Sheraton Macau, and Taipa Island in general, is the shear size and awe of everything. Macau basically took a bunch of US buildings from Vegas, World Trade, Space Needle, and actually created better versions of them.   The appointments in this hotel are what you would expect from a top tier hotel. Everything is immaculate, the staff are friendly and welcoming, and even though Macau is more tailored towards Chinese visitors, I did not feel terribly out of place.  Review disclaimer: I am a US traveler and therefore my tastes may be different than others.  Rooms: The rooms are very well appointed and the bathrooms are gorgeous.

"1. Hotel isn't clean enough, I saw some stains in the bathroom.  2. This hotel is quite far from Taipa tourist area, it takes 20+ minutes walk.   3. There are two towers, I was staying in the earth tower which is very far from the pool. And the design of the pool is quite strange, there are 13+ tiny pools that I could cardly swim.   4. Mattress is a bit too hard for me and my mum. We both couldn't sleep well. ",20
"The hotel might have good reviews but my first impression with this hotel was total disgust. What 5 star hotel in the modern world has you wait over an hour just to check in?  This was not even as check in first opened, but several hours later.  Sheraton is a second class hotel in the United States and I guess it applies to the Macau location as well.  This review is just based on the check in process. Pathetic.",10

We returned at a little past 18:10 and collected our bag, then caught the transfer bus to the Macau Ferry.   3. On reaching the Macau Ferry at 18: 35¬† we discovered that we had left a personal item in our room (3144 Earth Tower). We therefore boarded a return transfer bus back to the Sheraton.   4.

First, ridiculous waiting time at the check-in counter (40-50 minutes). This I still can understand... But totally unprofessional service from the staff is unacceptable in the hotel like this. Every time when I check in into hotel, I give the 100USD or 200USD CASH because I do not prefer waiting for the money transfer on the card (since I only have debit cards).

As Macau is pretty humid, the room does have a bit of a smell and a bit sticky when u first went in. They should really enhance the room humidity control. The bed is very comfortable.

"We are regular guests at Sheraton hotels internationally and are so dissapointed by the status of upkeep with the rooms at this hotel.  A horrible smell exists in all carpetted areas, from the lift to the corridor and then the rooms, which can only be described as a mix of old smoke and bodily fluids like vomit and urine. The carpets are stained and the bathroom has grime between the tiles.  The only positive experience is the staff and customer service. Despite their efforts and good will, they cannot change the standard the rooms are in and therefore limited in what they can offer.   Do not come to this hotel with a false pretence of a 5 star standard room.",20

After spending 15 minutes to queue for the kiosk, I couldn't proceed my check-in though the customer service at kiosk scanned my ID card and retrieved my booking 5 times, and she didn't understand why it happened neither.  Then I had to spend another 50 minutes for another queue, damn.  Nevertheless, Vlad was very helpful for my check-in, my request for non-smoking twin room was granted at least. ",30
"Am staying here as I type.  Really difficult to contact them by email, as all the advertised emails do not work, even the email that the general manager replies to the bad reviews on here doesnt work when I used it!  Anyways the hotel is large and chaotic as expected.  Can see most of the good reviews are from people who were upgraded to a deluxe suite.  We paid for 2 deluxe suite rooms, and wanted them near each other, but instead got them allocated at opposite ends of the building.    They said they were giving us an upgrade at check in, however this turned out to be the same room with a higher ceiling...  Sheraton if you read this, a higher ceiling is not an upgrade!!!  Needless to say hopes were raised, and left disappointed.  The suite is very spacious, but not practical.  ‚Ä¶",10
I stayed here as part of the conference that I was attending. We did get a choice in terms of options and it was OK. But really just OK. The rooms are getting a little long in the tooth and nothing to write home about. I want to be clear that I‚Äôm not really a gambling town kind of guy and this may have jaded my perspective. But really sunk it for me though was the service level in the bars and restaurants. This is not the place to come for a large convention. They just don‚Äôt seem to have the horse power to be able to ramp up to deal with large volumes and I would say this wasn‚Äôt limited to this hotel - this was pretty much everywhere we went in Macau with a large group.,30

"As a SPG member and a repeated guest, this Sheraton outlet kept disappointing us.

Breakfast in feast restaurant gave up another round of queuing up, even to be seated, the coffee ordered will not arrive until 20-30 mins. As a family targeted hotel, a lot of kids were running all around the buffet table with the balloons hanged out to them by the restaurant, it seemed to be dangerous and it was so full during the whole breakfast period.

We were too tired and can't be bother to ask for a different room at the time, we just want to sleep and leave first thing the next morning.

Ms. Zhen answered all my questions in a very professional way.  she is probably the best staff i met during my many stays at this hotel.

"We stayed for 3 nights in this hotel in January 2019. These are items we enjoyed:  Location - Great if you want to explore the hotels/casinos/malls/attractions on Cotai Strip. It is very central, right in front of both The Venetian and The Parisian, and very close to CoD, MGM, and Wynn Palace.  Rooms - Clean and spacious. Beds and pillows were quite comfortable, and so were the towels and bathrobes. I particularly liked the bathroom: huge and beautifully decorated.  Facilities - Decent bars and restaurants on the hotel premises (I particularly liked Palms Caf√© and Bar and their craft beer selection). Beautiful swimming pools and modern gym (just visited, but didn't try them). Several luxury stores and boutiques if you want to spend some serious money. The casino was nice,‚Ä¶",30
"The hotel is located in the Sands City. If you aim for a quiet resort, you should stay away from this hotel. There are two towers, the Sky Tower and Earth Tower. If you stay in Sky Tower you have to walk at least 5 minutes to the restaurant for breakfast. The breakfast was very nice and provided a wide variety of food include raw honey and fresh juice. The price of breakfast was expensive but the hotel provided big discount if you buy coupon during check in. The pillows and blankets were of high quality. If you are not a SPG member you have to queue  quite sometime for check in during the peak check in time.",30

"2nd stay at Sheraton Macao w hubs and 9 year old child. This round we stayed at the Sky tower.  Hotel: A typical massive 2,000 + room hotel in Macao. Which means madness during breakfast time. It‚Äôs always a long queue at the main restaurant and we always had to be ushered to another restaurant. Which also explains the sour and dour breakfast line server behavior I.e. those working at the egg and noodle station. Check-in and out however was breezy with family area.  The good: Cheery cleaning crew, also with a smile and polite greetings. I also had a nice birthday surprise from the front office. How nice.   Overall: A decent 2nd stay and only because we couldn‚Äôt get a room at newer hotels such as The Parisian, and JW Marriot during the busy Christmas month.",30
"Macau is one of the most imaginative and stirring man-made city in Asia. Undoubtedly anyone who visits this place - comes with ideas of thrill and excitement.  Sheraton hotel is a commercial busy outlet with poor staffing and poor regard for the time of the guests. Their staff is dealing with guests like robots - one comes and one goes- nothing more. It doesn't ring a bell if their check-in counters are queued up with waiting time more than half an hour. There are no sofas or seats at their checkins for young children and women who have to stand up with the waiting while someone from the family does the check-in.  This is something that no hotel in the world does to its guests- make them stand the wait.   Curiously, is this hypocrisy in the name of hospitality, even permissible‚Ä¶",20
"For the customer service and lady in red uniform (i don't know whats her position) ,i give them 5 stars for the service because very helpful when we trying to check in.  For the other staff,they treat customer badly,  they never smile,  doesn't have manner and ethics at all, You guys work at hotel the most important thing is service but your service so terrible, i have been to many hotels, but never get service like this at all",10
"Not a pleasant stay.  I have chosen to stay with Sheraton in the late night on December 19. My booking cannot be found upon arrival for check-in, and since booking was made via travel website, I was informed that he cannot help to check-in and was told to contact the travel website even I have the email confirmation.  During the time I am seeking for help to manage my booking, I receive no active assistance by the hotel staff.  As a customer, I felt that I haven't been treated well, he was rough when he was providing service to me.",20
"Stayed here in the month of December 2018. Hotel property is vast and looks amazing. Rooms are bigger than usual and look very nice. But as soon as I checked-in, the toilet seat was dirty. After complaining, obviously the management made sure it's clean and tidy. After they left, the toilet roll holder broke and the whole stand fell upon which the plumber came and sorted the issue. When I used the shower room, all the water was leaking out from the shower room to the bathroom and I was shocked to see everything was flooding when I came out. The whole stay was a mess. Surely they cleaned everything but the problem lies on how they manage the facilities provided to the guest. I have stayed in Sheraton in other places, even 3 star properties do not have such basic issues. I stayed‚Ä¶",30
"It‚Äôs a huge hotel, lots of elevators, somewhat difficult to navigate, have to change lifts at different floors to go from room to lounge. Suite was large but all glass doors in bathroom area needed attention, had quite a lot of dubious marks which are not expected of a 5 star establishment. Summer holidays with many mainland tourists, place is noisy & very commercial. That is Macau! ",30
"The Sheraton, from a 1000 night Platinum member‚Äôs prospective. What a disappointment.  Well not really, I didn‚Äôt expect much to be honest.  But it is Macau and things tend to run on the top side of the brand name in this town.  What I got was an Albany NY experience while trying to give a Beverly HIll show.  So its a little confusing.  I should start by saying the place is fine, not good, not bad, just fine.  I have stayed at 10 to 15 different places in Macau over the years and this was the worst of all.  But the price was on the low side of the city for my days of stay.  Checkin would have been a nightmare if I wasn‚Äôt Platinum, the wait could have been 45mins to an hour.  I was second in line for checkin for the elite line.  The agent was super nice, but couldn‚Äôt find the‚Ä¶",20
"I have stayed at this property twice this year and the customer service was poor to Marriott standard.  Check in - even though I am a Marriott Gold member, I was asked to go to a dedicated check in counter, but when I present my passport to the front desk staff, there are a lot of people come and go by various questions, and the front desk staff continue to answer their questions by ignoring my check in process. Eventually, it took me 20min to complete the entire process which is not acceptable.  Check out - the first time when I stayed at this hotel, I personally went to the front desk to experience the check out process.

They also have good facilities (pool, gym, etc.) However, the check in process is always so long and they never have enough staff. I am a Marriott rewards member and the line was still very long as there was only one person serving loyalty members. Also, they did not credit my one night stay and I tried to email them with no response.  I will still stay again because of the location but I advise others to not expect too much in terms of service.",30
"First time to stay in one of the Cotai hotels and have mixed feelings.  The  Good:  Location is right in the middle of Cotai strip and is connected to Conrad, Holiday Inn, and walkway across the road to the Venetian.  City of Dreams and Morpheus close by.  Studio City a bit harder to get to but walk-able.  Breakfast has a huge variety.   Often has special discounts for room rates or restaurants.  Staff are mostly very friendly and helpful.    The Bad:  Way too many guests - check-in takes a long time and it's crowded everywhere   Tip #1:  check out the SPG check-in counter as the queue is shorter and the staff are actually quite understanding during the peak / crowded hours.  The hotel is designed to be a single long corridor - this means noises can echo and quite loud.  This‚Ä¶",30

"Wish to acknowledge Nello, a guest service ambassador who served us in a restaurant. Friendly, warm, enthusiastic and knowledgable about the dishes. Great dining experience.   Sheraton Grand was OK but not amazing for a top class hotel. Executive lounge was lovely with a good spread for breakfast but more snacks & drinks on offer in between meals would be good.",30
"Booked a room for 4 pax. Were super disappointed from the minute we stepped in till we check out. 1) SPG membership couldn‚Äôt be located in the system. 2) were given 2 single bed for 4 pax. Toiletries (toothbrushes) were given for 2 pax instead of 4. All the whatever not (showercap x 1, towels x 2, lotions, gels etc x 1 tube each). 3) the woman who came to give us extra 2 towels, 1 tube each - shower, shampoo, conditioner was very rude. 4) the staff, Benjamin Hung downstairs at the counter was very arrogant, unfriendly, unhelpful, rude and impatient. 5) the male staff at the shuttle bus service area (towards galaxy) was very lazy, unfriendly, unhelpful and unprofessional.

"We were travelling with 7 people including 2 small children and two grandparents.  We came over from Hong Kong by ferry, timed it so that we could check in after 3pm so the children could be taken straight to the room for naps and everyone else could have showers and settle in.  After standing in the check-in queue for over 45 minutes, only 1 room was ready, despite it being after check-in time and having booked weeks in advance. We were told to come back later to check if the other 2 rooms were ready.  We spent over an hour wandering through the shopping mall with tired children and grandparents before rooms were ready.   Once we got to the rooms, 2 keycards had to be re-keyed which meant more queuing.  During our stay, there were issues with house keeping not making up a room‚Ä¶",10
"The room‚Äôs carpet was so dirty and the Sheraton Tower Lounge did not provide wine, tap water and hot water during dinner snacks time. The server said they were just too busy to provide any water.  Comparing to other Marriott brand lounges I visited, those lounges would provide a refrigerator with different kinds of drinks. And this Sheraton hotel provided almost none.  In terms of service, I didn‚Äôt felt valued as a Marriot platinum member. The St. Regis hotel (opposite to the road) offers much better service for 30US more per night. ",20
We had two nights at this hotel in october.  + Best bed ever. Great pillows and duvet. + amazing view over Cotai Strip. + great service at check Inn. We got late checkout without asking. + huge and Best breakfast buffet ever. They had everything. I mean everything!  - Bad service at the pool areal. - Bad service with the shuttle concierges. We endes up at the ferry terminal and had to take a taxi. - only one bar at this huge hotel. And it closes at midnight. ,30
"My work books this hotel for me a few times a year. I've been coming here about 3 years. The hotel is getting worse over time. The queue to check in and out is ridiculous - my normal waiting time is about an hour. The gym removed things like combs, and the shower has been broken for at least two years now (water goes cold then boiling then cold then boiling again...) and I've told the staff about the problem numerous times.  This is all quite a shame because the rooms are nice (especially the suites) and it's obvious a lot of money went into the hotel.",20
The hotel is bit as spectacular as it‚Äôs close neighbours such as the Parisian and Venetian and the price reflects that significantly. With that said the hotel are obviously in the money making game as they would rather have you pay a machine for a fast check in than help customers out.  We stood in a queue for 45 mins to check in instead.  With that said the rooms were nice and large and the breakfast was ok. ,30
"I stayed in Sheraton Macau for few times and it is a hotel never listening what the guest need.  I experienced noise disturbance during the stay in August. After my complain I got the promised from the Duty manager that my room preferences will be updated in my profile. For this stay, I have also called to the hotel in advance and provide my SPG number to ensure all information will be on the reservation.  Upon my check in this stay, the check in lady seems did not know about my preferences. I mentioned again the I need a quiet room which is not connecting room.

I‚Äôve met a guest service staff named Josie B. who helped me get to the room with so many luggages, was very friendly and that friendly conversation made me feel welcomed. He also explained about services Sheraton provides. I tried to give him service tip but he strongly refused. So I made a promise that I‚Äôll write a review of his great service. Thank you for your great service. I would definitely go back there and stay at Sheraton Macau again, soon!",30

There are connecting bridges and all  Cons: a) My SPG Gold was not recognised. I asked if there is an upgrade, the check in front desk staff said no, but there are plenty of room types that are still available, including the suite. Well, I'm not a plat so you don't need to give me suite, but there are the ones with Cotai view? Nope, not even an attempt to offer that. b) Did not offer late check out / ask if I want to.

Second visit and it‚Äôs certainly gone down hill since 4 years ago. Arrived at 5am and the night staff are clueless.

I explained I‚Äôm on vacation with my mother and definitely didn‚Äôt want to share a bed. After 15 minutes and several staff getting involved we eventually received a twin disabled room which was not ideal.

This is despite prior confirmation via email and also again at check in. Staff called front desk but no one picked up, and my wife and two toddlers had to wait like denied morons while other guests with breakfast vouchers were served. I had to raise my voice and showed email confirmation before allowed in  -  Departure time, submitted my luggage ticket and waited in queue but bags did not arrive.

"I have stayed at the Macau Sheraton for more than 50 times (I think) since it's opening. The recent closure of the Sheraton Club has made the stay, especially for Platinum and loyal guests a big nightmare. Checking in and checking out is the worst experience one can ever imagine! The platinum line is always jammed (and I don't think many of them are gold or platinum members) and with one person serving that line, it usually takes up to 30 mins before I was checked in. (I stayed at the Sheraton 3-4 times after the Sheraton Club closed and I keep reminding myself I have to raise a complaint.)  Another big issue is the gym and the changing room.

"Stayed here for two nights, Sheraton Grand Macao is located along the strip amongst with other Las Vegas named hotels - Conrad, The Venetian, Holiday Inn, and close to other 5-star hotels such as Wynn, Hilton, etc. The place was always crowded with plenty of tourists from the mainland.  The hotel is relatively brand new but the not so high quality of finishing is beginning to show and the corridors smelt of cigarette smoke even on nonsmoking floors.",30
"Thumbs up to everything from the bus trip from the ferry to the check in procedure. All very polite, efficient, etc etc. Then we got to our room. The first thing I noted was that there was just one towel. It was double room with a King size bed. Why would there be just one towel? Already this inconvenienced us since we were in a hurry to shower and leave for dinner.  I called Guest Services immediately. There was a long message in three different languages about how much they valued our patronage and that the conversation would be recorded, blah blah. I asked for a second towel.

Very bad service at thin‚ÄùSheraton‚Äù . They don‚Äôt speak English! Go to st Regis! We stay there in two rooms and really was the worst experience we ever had in a hotel. Bad bad bad bad bad service! Or not service at all.,10
"When I checked in, I arranged for an earlier checkout than originally planned for the trip. I was told that it is fine and I will not be charged extra. Today when I was checking out, the staff was so confused. I was first told that the Travel Agent that booked the room will pay for the room, so they can't reduce the extra nights and I will have to speak to my Travel Agent, so I queried if that was the case, why did they need my credit card for payment? Then their story changed completely and I was told I still need to pay for all the nights because I am checking out early. So even with pre arranging it, it wasn't worth anything. So best is to avoid this hotel unless you are willing to waste your money. As a traveler for an international company, we use Sheraton around the world.‚Ä¶",10

"The hotel is beautiful, perfect location and I found it to be the only affordable option in the area. But it was way too crowded! May be because of the same reason the staff was not able to attend well during the check-in and check out process as well. There are multiple elevator banks, the least that could be done is to have someone guide after check in, which one is to be used!",30
This hotel was average when comparing it to others in Hong Kong and the standard of them. The room was spacious however when you walked in it didn‚Äôt seem like it was immaculately clean like others in Hong Kong.

I went to the casino for a couple of hours to avoid the check in queues and even then I had to wait in line for 40 minutes when I lined up at around 4.30pm.. The staff do their best but there are just too many people. The ground floor which includes the check in counters and casinos is always like shopping on Christmas Eve.

After our daughter's very painful night on the 'bed' we complained to the hotel, who provided us a rollaway bed. That was nice but they really shouldn't have supplied such an uncomfortable / incomplete bed in the first place.  A real shame for what, otherwise, was a perfectly decent hotel.",30

There were so many free tables but all were dirty and waiting to be turned and that is the reason we had to wait. No plates at stations. No be leans in coffee machine. No tea spoons.

What happened was we saw two hotel guest were holding some drinks and foods with them, and I found out that the foods and drinks were actually from 3/F FOOD COURT !

"The Sheraton used to be a fairly decent hotel. It has gone downhill very fast. So many things that make a hotel stay great did not exist here! First of all, we are SPG members, so we SHOULD be able to check in at the SPG counter, but they would not let us check in as we didn't have the card on us at the moment. (Other hotels just refer to email to get it). The checkin service counter people were so rude, they actually told us to 'go away', come back later!  Also, the rooms were not cleaned, nor new supplies replenished. The pool is overcrowded, and a child was actually seen peeing in the pool from the side! All in all, very shoddy service indeed.",20

To start with it doesn't deserve a five star tag because the kind of services they offer to their guest is pathetic ..called several times for towels which never  came called for extra bed which never till 3 am in the morning and above that staff is also very rude ...will try not use this hotel again .the banquet manager Gagan gupta is very rude and didn't accomodate our request !!!,10
"To be honest, this is the most unforgettable birthday that I have ever had. I can never imagine a hotel like Sheraton provided nothing for my birthday, no birthday cards and not even a word of blessing which was very disappointing.  I still remembered we queue for check-in process which kept us waiting for more than half an hour. When we were waiting, I could see there were many staff presented while they refused to open an extra check-in counters ( 3 counters are closed and opened after we had wait for 20 minutes) We bought a package with breakfast, I would say the check in helper had ignored this. If we didn't remind him, he totally forgot and treated us with no breakfast.  For the whole stay, I appreciate the fast speed and response of the housekeeping and customer service‚Ä¶",30
"I was travelling with my kids, husband and mum. Took us 2 hours to checkin because we arrived on a very busy Friday. I liked that they have ammenities that my kids could enjoy like the dreamworks parade. The rooms were neat and spacious but there‚Äôs something about the smell that I cant figure out about. The attendants in the lobby were two things. I asked a guy where the toilet was and he just pointed it with his mouth without saying anything as if im interrupting a very important conversation with his buddy. The guy Martin was a different story. Assisted us with our luggage and was really nice and friendly. He made a connection with us by talking in french when he noticed the tag in our luggage. His english was also really good for an Asian. He told us the best places to visit‚Ä¶",30
"There is a shuttle at the ferry but no signage for Sheraton, need to ask someone there.   This huge hotel took almost an hour to check in, very long queue and each queue also take such a long time.The hotel need a lots more check in counter.  Room are spacious and clean with a nice pool view. Compare with the price of venetian, I still go for Sheraton.",30
"This should be my fifth time staying in this hotel. We booked an Executive suite and they upgraded us to a Deluxe suite (perhaps nobody booked large rooms in this middle-class hotel). Compared to the rooms that I stayed in during my last visits, this one was a bit dirty and old. The bathroom, especially, was a bit rusty. Also, the hotel is extremely crowded and noisy, which is not welcoming to hotel guests. Don't stay in this hotel. If you stay in this hotel, remember to book a room with access to Executive club lounge for better service and fewer people.",30
"We have already been several times in Macau and our last stay in Sheraton was so far the worst.  The facilities are great and well maintained, that's not the problem.  When we arrived we had to wait around 1h45 before being able to check-in.  They mention that it's possible to checking starting at 3PM. We managed to reach our room at almost 5PM. Our plan was to enjoy of the swimming pool in the afternoon.... we arrived at the swimming pool when the sun was almost already gone (and the swiming pool was closing at 6PM...).  Everything seemed normal for the staff... that was not very helpful.  That's the first time that we experience such a bad service in an Hotel of that standing. We were all very disappointed. We understand that Sheraton Macau is huge hotel but that's not normal‚Ä¶",20
"Despite management's claim that they are trying to improve their check-in process, the line to check-in is still indeed one hour. The clerks were pleasant and apologetic but there is absolutely no excuse for any professional hospitality group to not have planned for accommodating their room capacity - certainly not an established company like Sheraton and certainly not one well past their opening days.   That's lack of hospitality, a nuisance, but what's inexcusable is the lack of housekeeping!  We stayed for three nights and had been offered the ""eco-friendly"" option of trading in housekeeping for a late checkout. Since we are Marriott Rewards members (late check-in already a given) with supposed reciprocity with SPG, we asked for housekeeping. The first two days, we had no‚Ä¶",20
We stayed at Sheraton for 2 nights. Check-in took an hour inspite of us being an SPG member. There wasn't any place to rest/sit in the reception area while we were waiting for our turn to check-in.  The front desk staff was not at all warm and flexible during check in. Same was the case with staff at luggage and conceirge service - they were neither friendly nor helping. We were greatly disappointed with the service.  The room allocated to us was modern and clean but not luxurious. There are other better hotels to choose from at Cotai center.  They had a mobile phone for guests to use inside and outside the hotel area. It provided unlimited internet access and both local and international calls (to 10 or 12 pre-listed countries).  We liked the pool area. There were many small‚Ä¶,30
"We arrived around 4:30pm, there was a super long queue. It took us around 50 mins to check in. However the front desk staff, Rikko was unfriendly, strict & does not even smile during check in. I am disappointed with the service.",30
Stayed at Sheraton for 3 nights. Checking in take an hour. Stayed at sky tower and room is old. Stay at this hotel for the past 4 years and this would be our last stay at this hotel. There are so many hotel to choose from at cotai center.,20
"We stay two night for wedding anniversay.  The hotel is really huge and the staff is very busy.  Some of them seldom smile. The club lounge staff did not ask us of coffee tea, we need to ask fir it.  He serve tea without milk and sugar, we need to get it by ourselves. The suite is nice and spacious.",30
"We are SPG Platinum members and we are deeply disappointed with this hotel. We came here for some rest and relaxation but instead of relaxing by the pool, the security at the pool has been haranguing us nonstop. They have a new (and STUPID) policy where if your child is under 140cm, they MUST wear arm bands and an adult MUST be in the pool with them. Our children are (unfortunately) under 140cm but they are all on the swim team, having years of (very expensive) swim lessons that they could probably save me from drowning in the ocean if they had to, yet because of their height, they cannot swim and play in the pools by themselves. After an hour of arguing that they cannot make us go into the pool with them, they have to be in our line of sight. The Sheraton has multiple small‚Ä¶",10
Very nice hotel but only one thing must be remembered and pay attention to  Check in time !  Either you go there to do the ore registration provided no need to queue. Then come back after 3 to collect your room key.   Otherwise you are expect to wait for hours to finish your check in procedure. I don't understand nowadays with the technology what Sheraton did not offer e check in service.  Since they are so popular otherwise it's not worth to pay over 1000 dollars for such short period of time.  Since check in time after 3. Mostly you will be able to get the room around 4 and check out time is 11am next day. The rest of the facilities are meeting the standard.,30
"Its not my 1st time i stayed in this hotel but the worst experience i have ever had. I booked the cotai view room and assigned to the normal deluxe room which was HKD500 difference on the room type. The check in staff was not helpful and especially when i asked if there any pamphlet for the restaurants provided that the sheraton is connected with other hotels as we want to stay in the block such that my colleague and i can work in the restaurant. He gave me a look and asked me to go to the concierge, so i did and got a quite not useful one as the map was for the Venetian chain.  After i got into my room, my blanket was dirty and i have to call the operator to send someone over to change it while i was out for dinner.  It was 12am when i back to my room and ready to bed, 2 rooms‚Ä¶",20
"i normally wouldn't write anything but i think it's useful for other parents to know about a few things.   My husband and I stayed in Sheraton Macau over the weekend and I felt the good comments i read previously was quite misleading. In conclusion, it's not a baby friendly hotel.   First of all, it takes forever to check in, we arrived at the hotel around 12 pm, they said the check in time is 2pm but my baby needs to take her nap soon, so i asked if they would allow me to check in first, and they said i could try at the SPG member check in counter, i waited in the line for half and hour and only to find out it's not possible until 2pm. so i had to come back at 2 and waited in the line for another 45 mins before we could get our key.. and baby has become over tired and cranky,‚Ä¶",20
"Check in at the club lounge was slow.  Might be understaffed.   However the staff was polite and courteous.  Our room was on a higher floor.  It was roomy and clean.  The reason I gave a 3-star rating was the poor design of the shower and the breakfast situation.  First, there was no shower mat (you have to ask housekeeping for one).  Otherwise it was very slippery.  No handle bar.  Also water ran outside the shower door because of the shallow ledge.  Secondly, there was not enough table for breakfast seating in the lounge.  We finally found a table but was next to the outside area where people went in and out causing a draft.   Food was ok.",30
"First, the good news: Most of staff we interacted with, with the exception of the grumpy, over-worked concierge lounge people, were friendly and responsive--within their province. The bad news, there weren't enough of them. The rooms were clean. The bathrooms very small.   But my biggest complaint was the price gouging. I attended a conference with a group rate and decided to stay on to enjoy a weekend in the city. I asked my daughter and friends to join me. In order to accommodate this, I needed to make a second reservation and decided to do so on the club floor. My friends booked the club floor themselves for the same weekend. Once I arrived at the hotel I decided the room I was given was adequate and asked to change the reservation, cancelling the second and extending my stay‚Ä¶",20
The slowest check in I have ever experienced. It was the long weekend in China so understandably busy but then the hotel did things like closing one of the pools which did not make sense. Pool ran out of towels no drinks etc.,20
"I was locked in the room on my first night there due to the faulty lock and my friend who came back to the room later was locked out. Took the maintenance/staff almost 40 minutes to dismantle the lock from outside. Staff at the reception didn't give priority to my call when I informed him that I was locked in my room. I had to call twice.  I was given a different room but no compensation whatsoever was offered to me until we asked. As a 5 star hotel, I believe they can do better.",30
Overall it's a good experience to stay in Sky Tower of Sheraton. Especially to dine in the Xin restaurant with very nice hospitality from Catalina. We did enjoy the food and to go twice within 2 days.,30
"Stayed here in May 2016 and arrived the hotel at around 13:30. My friend and I requested for early check in if possible. However, when I wanted to approached the reception, a man (looks like a security guard) told me check in counter has not opened and refused me for checking in (just directly turned me down). At that moment, I was very disappointed since no other guests over there and I wonder whether the staff there don't know how to do check in. Other hotels that I stayed before would allow me to do the registration and assist with luggage. Well... but no such service in Sheraton Macao. My friend and I needed to bring our luggage to the bell. (Not close to front desk)  Before arrival, I was quite happy with their staff since I sent them an email and ask for assistant for‚Ä¶",20
"To start off this hotel made a terrible impression when I had to cue up for 50 minutes to check in.    While this hotel has a rather large casino in the middle they fail to make space to accommodate their guest in their breakfast halls often seeing out their customer in 30 minute cues just to get seated in the breakfast buffet. Furthermore they fail to realise that many guests have cued up for much time and they very quickly start removing the breakfast buffet at 10:30 resulting in many not receiving the package they paid for.  Despite having such a great potential to be one of the best hotels in the area with spacious rooms and high quality of materials from the hair dryer which was greatly appreciated to offering free wifi hotspot throughout Macau and rather elegant hall,‚Ä¶",20
"About one to two weeks prior to our trip we requested to have 3 rooms that should be close to each other, but when we arrived we could only be arranged  with rooms about half a minute distance from each other. The worst thing appeared in the lift. They install a security system that requires the use of room card to get access to the floor we lived, but that system often malfunction. For quite a few times we could only take the lift back to G/F and scan the room card again. The elevator is really a mess.",30
"I'm used to better from Sheraton, this was a surprising disappointment. Try another NEWER Hotel I suggest, such as the Venetian or Parisian. I stayed in a Club Room on the 31st Floor of the Sheraton. The rooms are Nice and reasonable, however, an Older style. Pillows are those super soft falls away type, that you either love or hate. The Internet speed is good and free in the Club Rooms. The Room Service and the Food options are expensive and NOT the highest quality. The Minibar in the room is a bad joke, but it is Asia.The food in the Food Halls is just as good and  1/3 of the price, and a 10 Min walk. Try the food hall in the Parisian or Venetian. The pool area is nice, but most hotels have nice pool areas. The Club Room Lounge is a waste of time, the snacks at Lunch time are‚Ä¶",20
Sheraton Grand is just 10 minutes away from Macao Airport but is a typical massive casino style hotel where the lobby is like a busy shopping mall and it takes forever to find where your room is as the place is just too big. If you like massive casino style hotels this place is perfect. I dont.,30
This hotel is very good in terms of infrastructure and also the facilities but I was very disappointed in terms of service  I did share with the management and they promised to improve  Hope they do so  I normally have warm water with lemon and honey in the morning and they first say will try and then asked a exorbitant price for a this (which normally is free),30
"The hotel was defintely good for its value. The room was spacious. It was also generally clean. Check in was quick. The internet was quick. The view was ok. The guy from the philippine who was standing in the lobby was super helpful. I am sorry I forgot his name already but he was the best service staff so far I have encountered in Macau. However, most bell and concierge staffs were so rude and unwilling to help. The concierge were chatting among themselves while I went approach them to ask for questions and they made me feel like I was disturbing them and was not helpful at all. That's not the worst. The worst was the bell service. The staffs there did not speak English or Cantonese. They kept making me feel like I should speak Mandarin to them. And if I didn't understand, they‚Ä¶",30
"I've booked 4 rooms for my friends and I. It was a holiday so the 30 mins long queue was expected. However, the reception desk was very stupid and slow. It took us 15mins to complete everything.  At night we rang the room service and request for a dozen bottles of beer. it took quite a few minutes to be delivered. I rang the room service again and she said they were busy. Well, it was 2am...  The other day, 3 rooms were checking out and 1 room will be continue staying. I asked the reception desk lady if I have to pay for the drinks that we have ordered last night. she said the guest checking out will be paying so we sorted out the bills ourselves to the guest leaving the next day.   And the room didn't cleaned up properly. The left over of the beer bottles were still on the desk‚Ä¶",20
"My first stay at the Sheraton Cotai as a quick Birthday getaway weekend. Thought would give this a try as Sheraton is usually good for value!   Getting around is no problem, there are shuttle buses from almost anywhere to any given hotels in Macau. A taxi would be around MOP 50 to the airport or ferry terminal.  Reception  Unless you are an SPG member, do not stay here as it could be a good hour before you get checked in. As a member, I queued for around 20 minutes which has never happened at any Sheratons I've stayed.  Lobby It was a very busy lobby with all sorts from shopping, caf√©, promotion, casino. This is something not preferred personally, as I expect some quiet moments but it is Macau so I should have expected it!  Room The hotel seems to have a few wings, and we were‚Ä¶",30
When we arrive we were led to a small check in area with three staff. All three staff had a guest but we were next in line. I swear 15 minutes later we were still waiting. I was so upset i was going to cut in and ask what they were talking about. Finally when our turn came I understood. The check in process was relatively slow anyway but then the receptionist went through a barrage of sales pitches. from flogging their loyaly card to wanting to provide late checkout on Sunday if we agreed to no room cleaning on the Saturday. really? I suggest Management review their check in procedure. Creating long queues of arriving guests is not a good start to the vacation.  Anyway that was the worst of our experience. The room was clean and large. We found the location very good. Very easy‚Ä¶,30
"The hotel complex itself is humongous! it is very impressive yes, but the attention to details get lost with a mega structure like this. I don't really have anything ""wrong"" to say, it is just too big and too ""mass produced"" Buy if you are into the gambling and shopping then the location is ok.",30
"Prior to 2016, Sheraton club lounge was one of the best in Asia.  It used to provide lots of selection of hot and cold dishes for breakfast and evening canapes.  They have revamped the club lounge by giving out noodle in soup and cold sandwiches.  In addition, they will hunt you down and charge for your children.  Pay a bit more and go to JW Marriott Hotel in Macau instead.",30
"On my  third stay in Macau I decided I would stay on the Cotai Strip for the first time. I have previously stayed in Macau (Grand Lapa and Grand Lisboa). So I discovered a problem with Cotai, there is no such thing as a 7/11 or supermarket anywhere in Cotai, so if you want a snack, or a drink you will be paying Hotel, restaurant or bar prices. In central Macau this is not a problem, as there are stores everywhere.  The other problem is it was raining non stop, could I find a reasonably priced umbrella anywhere in Cotai -no. This became a problem meaning I had to take the free buses between the casinos (even if they were just across the road.  I guess I can't blame the Sheraton for that, the hotel was everything I expected, room was large with full bath and shower, everything was‚Ä¶",30
"I would never choose any mega size hotel in the future unless there is a better solution for check-in. I moved to this hotel from another hotel on Cotai Strip around 12 pm, and hotel front office was very strict that check-in only starts from 1pm, so after I stored my luggage in concierge and came back around 3:30, I have to wait in line for 50 minutes to check in. The lines are just crazy as airport checkin counter, the craziest I have ever experienced. I understand such wait I s inevitable for a 4000 room hotel like this, but they could had been more flexible on taking check-in to reduce the waiting line.  Apart from this, I booked my room through Agoda and I was assigned to a room with poor amenities. There is no drinks in fridge, and the minibar is at economic hotel level.‚Ä¶",20
The check in and check out took forever. The lobby is too crowdede and most of the staffs do not speak english. The breakfast was great. Many food selection that we can enjoy and it very close with shopping center,30
"I always have a preference for SPG hotels when I travel. However, I stayed in Sheraton Macao for 1 night and it was highly unsatisfactory, and from now on I will always second guess myself when I book a SPG hotel.   First, the room was quite old, and although the room description said there would be refreshments provided - they were very minimal and highly unsatisfactory - there was nothing in the fridge and there were no snacks - only several tea bags and instant coffee were provided - this is definitely not up to standard of a luxury SPG brand hotel.  My most unsatisfactory part was that the next morning at around 10am, the next room was under renovation, and I have heard people drilling and banging the wall at 10am and I could not sleep at all. I really did not expect a‚Ä¶",10
"This hotel is a very ""cold"" hotel. Check-in process takes forever and staffs are pretty ""plastic"" and have no sincerity in helping you out. I have no complaints about the hardware of this hotel BUT the software of this hotel is absolutely disappointing. Location wise, it is definitely in one of the best areas in Taipa and there are plenty of shopping and F&B outlets around this place. I am disappointed that this property is nowhere near the high standards that Sheraton Hotel group has set. Massive rooms for improvement.",30
"The hotel has got a great location; attached to the huge Sands Cotai Central mall, a walking distance to the Venetian, Parisian and Studio City. However, the quality of service crushed my holiday experience. I am an SPG member and there is a special place to check-in for the SPG members. The receptionist did not greet me, not welcoming and not smiling; might as well check-in online; I felt like talking to a robot. The room is quite spacious with a nice pool view, but there was a weird smell in the room. The only decent experience I had was during my workout in the gym. The gym staffs greeted and smiled.",30
"Experienced the longest ever hotel check-in ever, took almost an hour and the front desk was pack of people. Never had this experience before where the front desk was so full of people waiting and sitting on the floor in a 5-star hotel.  But once you got over the check-in, the stay was decent. The room was clean, comfortable and rather big. The gym was spacious with enough machines to satisfy most gym junkies.  A good stay if it wasn‚Äôt for the long check-in.

Let's start with the positives - big rooms and nice ambience and unfortunately my list of positive stops there. Having worked for this brand in the beginning of my career, I find it very hard to believe the bad attitude of the staff at reception desk and the restaurants. They made us feel that the only thing they bare interested in money, not the service they should give us. We don't get water served till we order something.

Pros: Hotel is wonderful.Rooms are convenient and breakfast is lavish. The location is perfect . Cons: Front Desk staff  Their attitude is completely unacceptable. They are unable to communicate properly in english . I asked them for their manager and the staff bluntly replies that the manager sits behind in the back office without lifting his head. Their policy of 5000 HKD as deposit is from the 17th century . There is however a better way of enforcing this than allow their untrained front desk staff communicate. Somebody needs to drive the fact to their front desk staff that hospitality is all about being pleasant and warm especially when we arrive after a long humid day. Never would i visit this hotel again nor recommend it to anybody,10
"Very low quality hotel for a Sheraton brand. For few MOP more you can stay in other much better and newer hotel. This is old most foreigners don't choose this hotel anymore. Room facility is not good, very low quality products on the bathroom. Towels are small and hard. Minibar was EMPTY. They put a notice to call the room service in case you want to fill the mini bar. This is not acceptable for this hotel standard. Breakfast was poor at most. And if you pay apart, it cost you U$ 23 per person.  Don't recommend at all.",20
"We paid for a room with view and the view we got was another building right next to us. Although, the bathroom is big but we are not sure about the cleanliness because we found hairs in the baht tub and pieces of snacks on the floor for over 3 days!

"Background: We are regular patrons of spa getaway overnight stays in Macau. As my wife and I are based in Hong Kong and 10 minutes away from the pier, we nip over for some pampering whenever the mood calls for.

"We stayed in the Deluxe suite, it was clean and big. Personally if travelling to Macau again I would look for cheaper options because not sure it's value for the expense, the lobby was v crowded and the hotel lacked a personal touch. Also having booked the room for two people with breakfast I was a bit surprised that the breakfast was for only one and I had to supplement the extra cost.  Location was good though.",30
"I chose the SGM for its pool area, and was assigned a room in the Sky Tower. Found the rooms to be smaller than comparatives, clean but my room had a musty smell.  Our water was shut off without notice one morning for about 30 minutes, with one of us amidst a shower.  Not cool! Will likely stay in the Venetian next time around.",30
We stayed overnight and it wasn't really our scene. Massive casino / conference type accommodation. Asked to come back to check in 3 times (and SPG members) because it was fully booked. Good average. Room was grand. That's about it. I'd probably stick to day trip to Macau unless you enjoy casinos...meters away from reception check in.,30

I have no choice need to remain on the spiral long queue myself!  As a brand hotel, I felt so disappointed on the holiday arrangement as simple as just for check-in & manpower! I have been told most rooms are still waiting to be cleaned & tidy up!  Room is clean and spacious, the bed is big and comfort. My kid loves the pool.

Good value when booking from India. This is the most basic Sheraton I've ever stayed in. But in Macau you spend less time in the room and more out in the casinos or shopping. The rooms have everything you need. Wi-fi isn't great but the handy phone is very useful. Coverage inside rooms is poor. I stayed on floor 30 in Earth 2 tower. Some rooms have bathtubs and some only showers. If a tub is required please do ask specifically.   Located opposite the Venetian and adjacent to the Conrad and St Regis. There's is nice shopping mall on the ground floor. Also shuttles to Macau pier are available from the East Lobby. A small walk away is where shuttles to the old Portugese town start from.,30

"A 40th floor suite is awesome at all times and ours here does not disappoint. Being at the front of Earth Tower views of Studio City and The Parisian immediately in front and China beyond are priceless - a wide window seat offers endless moments to just take in the view. A roomy lounge, full bar and powder room caters for guests, the bedroom beyond features a very comfortable kind-sized bed with luxurious bedding. Marbled walls in the ensuite with its free-standing bath in the middle is very decadent and double vanities with separate shower and toilet lend to that luxurious feel. Being at the end of the long corridor means that we are away of midnight foot traffic and closing doors.

"Stayed two nights at this hotel with the wife and three kids.  Booked the family suite as it featured a bunk bed for the kids.  Hotel lobby area is a quite hectic and I think they should have more staff in this area to guide guests.  Breakfast area was at a different tower and so it took a good 10-15 minutes to get there, which is not a great way to start the day....  All in all, not recommended!",20
"A 2 day break from HK with the kids and in-laws.  Too many check in zones on arrival, but grateful for email to the right desk on the 4th floor.  The staff at the lounge were very attentive - almost too attentive!  Arrived early and was grateful room was ready, however the room had a faulty AC, after an engineer arrived was moved due to cold, would have been okay except I had a pair of in-laws in the adjacent room and we were moved to the opposite side of the building - no comp for this added inconvenience as babysitters were now so far away.  Macau still not family friendly, so struggled with the kids. The lounge was great, always plenty to eat and drink.

"Poor attitude at the counter for gold/platinum members! I didn't ask for or think of an upgrade at all so my comment is not related to any free upgrade request.   Amazing slow, yes, I don't know what they are doing!  Careless and heartless. I stayed for two nights but breakfast vouchers were missing for one of the days. I gotta queue up again at the reception for the vouchers the next day (I decided to get rid of the SPG counter this time. Surprisingly it was better. Don't know what's wrong with SPG!)

"I am a regular Sheraton customer in many parts of the world, but this Sheraton needs serious upgrade.  It started with a relatively bad reception where our group (all of them gold or higher members) was denied the usual room upgrade due to a booking through a website different from SPG.  The check in took amazingly long - no idea what they where doing there.  The elevators are miles away from the reception area due to the casino inside the hotel just in and around the reception. Rooms are very tired and nothing special certainly not up to standard for the price! Bathroom & Toilet wasn't properly cleaned.   Hotel is loud and crowded at most times of the day   On the positive side, we had quite a nice and tasty Chicken WonTon soup at the coffee bar between the reception and the‚Ä¶",20
"Really surprised by how dated and mediocre this hotel is, especially under the Sheraton brand name and on a relatively new property. Long queues to check in, followed by a lengthy walk from elevator to room (admittedly I was warned about this), keycards that worked pretty sporadically, especially in the elevator. The room was pleasant and spacious, but lacked even a kettle to make coffee. The minibar wasn't stocked (although I don't mind so much). The bright spot was a friendly staff member who took my keycard and told me I didn't need to wait in line to check out. Much better available for a similar price point in the area (inc Holiday Inn in the same building)",30
"Hotel itself is a very nice property but it is so damn crowded with ppl. So so so busy lobby and the casino is just beside the check in counter. Is a headache to move around the hotel lobby with tonnes of ppl around. But once we reached the rooms level, every noise seem to quieten down. Rooms were huge and clean and good view of the other hotels as well. Hotel is of walking distance to Venetian shopping mall through a link bridge. I find that there aren't alot of cafes or restaurants in this hotel. Have to walk over to the other mall (Venetian side). Hotel has shuttle bus service to and fro the ferry terminal and to the old macau where the ruins of St Paul's cathedral is. Have to ask the concierge.",30
"This is one of the busiest hotels I've ever visited. The lobby is a zoo and there are almost always lineups if you need to speak to staff. When checking in or out, I'd allocate an extra half an hour just in case. The hotel is located in the heart of where other high end resorts are situated. Rooms are spacious and pretty well appointed. Overall, a comfortable stay as long as you are ready to deal with the crowds downstairs.",30
"What an interesting place Macau is. Everything is oversized including the lines for everything.   Spent a few nights at this hotel over Christmas and the checkin lines were like no other I have seen. As a 4000 room property it's to be expected but waiting in lines of hundreds of people to check-in, best to avoid the 3pm check-in time altogether. Arrive late or well in advance and sign up for the SPG membership for a shorter check-in line.   Can't fault the hotel facilities, the pools and spa were amazing.   Food service and selections in the main restaurant were top notch. ",30
"I'm sad to say the Sheraton just isn't as good as a lot of the other Cotai options that are cheaper. It's very large, and I believe it suffers for that.   The rooms aren't as nice, you always get a smoking one no matter what you say, and the service suffers from the scale.",30
"At first the check in staff was really incredible and helpful with all the information needed. But at the cocktail time, the staff was very rude. In club lounge, we entitle for 2 person to have cocktail time in the lounge. My parent went to club lounge to had some food for dinner, and me and my sister just came back from shopping mall so we came to club lounge as well to take our room key because we left one in the room. So we come to the club lounge and no staff offer us to sit at all  (the table only have 3 chairs) and i need to drag a chair from other table to my parent table and even the staff see us, they dont even bother to help or anything.

Went to Macau for a hen party. There were 8 of us.  At check-in we requested an upgrade and were advised that we could get an upgrade for a total of 4KHKD. The clear understanding was that the price included everything. We insisted on that point. Once in the room we were called by the hotel and told that the 4KHKD was on top of what was quoted for the rooms we had originally booked.  To top it all  it took several hours to get a cable to plug in an iphone and they could only cater for Iphone 4!   Complaints to the hotel have lead me nowhere.  Overall I feel we were misold a product and I do not recommend this hotel.,10

This is the place to visit if you want to get a real feel for what it must be like to be a farm animal.  As one of the world's largest Sheraton Hotels they now have management of their guest stock down to a fine management practice.  On arrival you are greeted by a very lengthy roped off pen and staff to tell you 'check in is closed and you must return at 1.00' to be queued with 300 others to be processed.  In the meantime you may line up at another processing station for baggage storage.  In the afternoon when you return you are roped into a very long line for processing.  Once satisfactorily processed you must exit along a new rope line in accordance with their direction.  When you find your way to the rooms it is a reasonable size but quite basic.

"I have stayed in other hotels in Macau and Sheraton is just ok. Nothing fancy. Many tour groups from China and other mass tourists which probably cheapens the whole check-in experience. Noisy, crowded and just kinda crass behavior of guests. Perhaps because it is a cheap hotel compared to other hotels in Macau so I shouldn't complain too much. Next time I will stay at the Ritz or equivalent instead to avoid mass tourists who are just too loud and unpleasant. Room is old and lack character, very basic. Many other better and newer hotels in Macau, Sheraton is just too old for package tours only. Stay at your own risk if you don't mind mass tourists ruining your experience. ",30
"The Sheraton Grand Macau is part of the original three hotels (the Holiday Inn, Sheraton and Conrad)that initially made up the Sands Cotai Central complex. The St. Regis was added to the collection recently. This Sheraton the largest hotel in Macau and supposedly the largest in the Sheraton portfolio with about 4000 rooms.    Being such a large hotel it does has its advantages and disadvantages. One of the advantages is that the prices of its rooms do not fluctuate as much during off- and peak- seasons (such as Christmas, Chinese New Year, or Easter) ‚Äì when the prices in some other hotels could go up by 200% - 300% during peak seasons - because of the abundance of rooms available, which makes this Sheraton one of the best valued hotels in Cotai.

Too many people and in one occasion we had to dine in a ballroom, converted into a dining area. Not very pleasant. The room had nothing special, Club rate wise. It was mentioned that there were welcome drinks and fruits upon arrival; it didn't happen. The room wasn't cleaned and had to ask the housekeeping to make up the room.

"The hotel is very large and caters to many guests. Hence the service is focused on efficiency and everything that can be automated is, including the pan cake making machine.   However, the whole Sands Cotai complex reeks of cigarettes smell, including our non smoking room. They tried to deodorise whenever we told them of the smell, which only mask the smell for at best for 5 minutes. I can understand that the hotel is powerless when faced with clients that ignores the non smoking rules, which there were many. So I am not really faulting the hotel staff as the staff are hard working and tries to provide a service given the limitations. ",20

The hotel stay and the service was really great. Worst part is the membership which I don't recommend as they don't credit any points if you book through an agent.

They used a seperator to seperate both areas which completely ruined it. This was not what I was thinking, since I was with my family.  2.

First impression is very important for every hotel guests. It's our first time to stay at the Sheraton Macau Hotel and we were surprised to see how crowded and chaotic it was at the check in area. I understand Christmas is a peak traveling time and Sheraton Macau is a big hotel. But having to wait in line for 45 minutes to check into a hotel room is just unexpected. We walked around other nearby hotels but seems their check in process were more efficient and organized.   The hotel room is up to standard. Bathroom is spacious. Breakfast was pretty good. Staff can add a bit more smile to welcome their customers. Customer service was ok.  ,30

Check in interaction was non-existent but at least we got the keys without much hassle. Was assigned a high floor room at the Earth Tower, which is quite a trek from the check in counters.  Upon entering the room was the smell of air freshener, while we didn't bother changing the room, the smell took quite a while to ease off a bit, using full blast of air conditioning. The room was sufficiently sized, with a partial view on the Cotai Strip plus the Eiffel Tower at the Parisian. The bathroom was reasonably well-appointed as well.

Good option for checking out the Cotai Strip.,30
Reasonable ok with the room and bathroom. However upon check in the room was not ready and only after signing up as a member the room was available. Next day the room was not cleaned and after we approached a cleaner in the late afternoon and requested the towels to be changed we were told it would be done.

At the Italian restaurant Bene the seaters told us they were full even though we could see half a dozen empty tables. When we did finally get seated 50% of our order had to be re-done as they were out of much of the menu. The Filipino waiters were fantastic on the other hand.

Room was decently sized with a great sized bathroom but had a very old look and was facing another hotel. The biggest issue we had was the drain in the shower was blocked. We tried to call twice to get this fixed but did not have any luck. A bit overpriced for what you get.,20
"We spent the last weekend in Macau and stayed at the Sheraton Grand Cotai Central, because it is kind of new and within the complex of Cotai Central. From the moment we left the ferry terminal and waited for the shuttle bus, I noted that one from Sheraton was less frequent than others. We waited for about 15 minutes for a shuttle bus to get to the hotel. We arrived early and they could not accomodate early check-in because the hotel was pretty full. That's understandable. Our room was a delux twin. The room was clean, and the bathroom was spacious. But for a 5 star hotel, you couldn't believe that there was no comb in the bathroom for use. And you found that the staff at the hotel was merely doing their job and not enjoying their job. You found no one interested in you or any‚Ä¶",30
"We stayed at the mid-price range Sheraton during Mid-Autumn Festival. As expected the place was packed with Mainland Chinese visitors. The lines at the check-in counters were horrendous but the staff were super efficient and we managed to get our room in under 30 minutes! Our room was a decent size and comfy, and more importantly it was clean and didn't reek of cigarettes like some hotels. Breakfast was a disappointment though with lines at every food station. Next time, better  skip the breakfast package unless you like predominantly Chinese cuisine. ",30
"Unorganised arrangement when checking in today. We've a group of 12 people staying in here today. We've made a reservation a month ago requesting connected room for each one of us. However, nothing can be arranged (What if they could just arrange two connected rooms for us, it would be easier for us to stay close) and the hotel staff suggested us to stay separately in different tower of Sheraton Grand today. As a well-known brand hotel, the communication skill and interpersonal skill should be in a professional manner. Unfortunately, they cannot meet the basic service standard and it's totally disappointing everyone of us. We definitely won't stay this hotel anymore. PS: I am currently staying at rm 2527. ",10
"5 star hotel but terrible service! First of all, my mum and i reached the hotel at 1pm so we q-ed to check in like every other guests. There were at least 8 qs with each line were to assigned to 3 separate server. There were about 10 ppl infront of us BUT WE WAITED FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR! Turns out that the line on my right has 4 servers and the line on my left had 3 but my line had only 2! The guy infront of us found the ""mistake"" so when the first server on my right was empty, he went over, only to get shouted by that server to q up so he explained that our q only have 2 counter where theres supposed to be 3 just like how he observed from other qs(number of servers √∑ numbers of servers) but the server just rudely ask him to move and ask another guest to come. Fine, count us‚Ä¶",10
"I love the Sheraton brand, very loyal customer.  You need to understand that this is a casino hotel.  On our hall there was a room with many young girls staying in it and older guys coming and going.  Not sure what type of brothel was being operated but we complained to HouseKeeping.  We were told, they were paying guests and nothing could be done.  Great hotel if you are going there to gamble.  However, if you are not a gambler and a loyal Sheraton customer, you WILL be disappointed.  Finally, really not a family environment.",10

I booked through SPG and was expected to include breakfast + returned ferry ticket.  To my surprise, only the room + breakfast was included and for some reason the ferry ticket was NOT BOOKED.  I have asked the staff to check with the booking department but no one approached me on 7 Oct and NO ONE updated me when I checked out. Also the service from the breakfast in Xin restaurant was way below average.  No coffee / tea was served, in fact only 2 staff helping at 08:00AM.  The attitude of the staff was also UNFRIENDLY.

"My girlfriend and I just stayed at this hotel on a trip to Macau. This hotel is one of the massive glitter palace casino resorts on the Cotai Strip.  The facility is amazing. Two casino floors, multiple pools, a huge shopping area and food court, everything you could want. You can walk between this property, the Venetian, the Parisian, and probably others without ever seeing the sun if you wish.  Now first, let me say in all honesty, my stay was during Chinese Golden Week, which is probably the worst week of the year to travel in China.

"The Sheraton is a large, Vegas-style hotel in the Cotai district, surrounded by many other familiar hotel names.  It's comfortable and busy, with many eating options.  The room was comfortable and well appointed (although no tea-making facilities), but I suspect you have to upgrade to club rooms for additional comforts that would make the experience stand out.  The view from the window was a rather depressing building site, but with all the construction in Macau, that is hardly surprising.  It's close to shopping malls and other hotels (esp Venetian), all accessible by foot.  Staff were helpful and everything seemed to work.  Huge queues for taxis at certain times - although that is a regular problem in Macau.  All in all, it's a good hotel, but difficult to work out what makes‚Ä¶",30

"My wife and I spent 3 nights at the Sheraton celebrating our 15th wedding anniversary. We were very underwhelmed. It was our first time to Macau and booked this hotel based on the reviews of trip advisor and also the advice of a friend. We upgraded to the club floor for the breakfast and club access for happy hour. The room itself was fine. The view was not good. We looked directly out at the other tower, the roof top in between the towers and the construction that's going on in the area. If we look directly right we could just see the Eiffel Tower at the Parisian but that was all. On our first night we were tired after walking and gambling. We decided to order room service for dinner (not our usual but not uncommon for us either). The menu was very short so we decided on the‚Ä¶",30

"Yea; that's the highlight of the Sheraton :) that it's across the road from the new Casino-Hotel-Mall: The Parisian & 'The Venetian' and the City of Dreams. Just realized that being a SPG gold member did not account for much with them either as I was hoping for a room with a view at least.  What we liked as an experience was the Xin restaurant in the complex and their 'Hot-Pot' dining experience where one had to pick the seafood and meat they desired and have them dropped in the choice of broth. The breakfast or the dinner at their other restaurants were just average.  Like I mentioned in the subject, the proximity to the 2 major casinos is a major point as one usually comes to this part of the world for the casinos and maybe shopping -- even though I got lucky at the Sheraton‚Ä¶",30
"We stayed for a night with our little one. The room was very big, especially when we had just came over from Hong Kong. It was a comfortable stay, everything was clean and well-maintained. Called for top up of towels and they responded very promptly.   The property itself was huge, so the crowd at the various lobby areas can be quite daunting. At check-in, the queue was long but they had entertainment in the form of balling scrupling for my boy. at one part of the lobby, There was also a small booth giving out cups of marshmallow and popcorns for kids. My boy was given a cup of marshmallow which he didn't want so we asked for a popcorn on the spot but was rejected.  With the large property, one would have to be aware of the walking distance. It should not be an issue for older‚Ä¶",30
"It was my first time in such a huge complex. The hotel looks really clean and nice from the outside. It many different restaurant, a casino, an entire shopping mall attached to it, a spa.. It is a city inside the city. You can spend your entire stay indoors.  The room was spacious, but rather old. As my second hotel stay in Macau it wasn't my favourite place, and I wouldn't book there again.",30

"The hotel is situated on Cotai Strip with free shuttle bus provided. Check-in was unbelievably slow at 3 pm during the peak season and it took me over an hour to queue up in the lobby. The lobby was overcrowded with guests but front desk staff are helpful luckily. The room was okay and definitely worth its price (ard 700 hkd through travel agency). Room is spacious but it is just within expectation. Wifi was slow and disonncected regularly and I found it frustrating. Anyway, if you can spend 1000 hkd or more, don't consider sheraton macao.",30
"Surprising that Sheraton has such an average hotel and casino in Macao where luxury and style are common themes for any hotel I have stayed at Venetian and Marriott in the past and they are miles ahead in terms of everything   Very standard fare which you should not expect in 1500 hkd a night. Check in is a nightmare with queues miles long , wifi slow and disconnects when you move in and out like old technology and room just ok. If you can spend 1500 hkd or slightly more then Sheraton is not a place to be in Macao ",30

Upon one's reasonably justified  protests, and insistence to speak with the management, the delay was to some extent alleviated by a later checkout time authorized by the customer service manager in order to commensurate with the delayed check-in.

We ended up walking 10 minutes to the Hard Rock cafe for lunch on two days, which was very good. Dinners on both nights were at local Portuguese style restaurants.  Overall, not a pleasant holiday experience due to way too many people---we won't be back to this hotel or Macau ever again.",30

Apparently they can't find a suitable room even though we have included them in our reservation. When we landed a room at the end of the (long) corridor, its toilet has a sewage smell, probably due to old piping.   The taxi queue is so long mainly due to poor design. They should have multiple loading bays so we don't get stuck behind big families with many luggage.  Checkout experience wasn't perfect either. The bell service didn't even bother to address me when we took our bags from  baggage service. He simply handed me the bag tag and a pen without actually telling me what to do - apparently I had to sign it. Terrible customer service. ",20

However, ALL the hotels in this area of Macau are at this level, so what differentiate them is the small details.

Wanted a mini weekend getaway for wife's birthday. I booked the hotel via Ctrip and called their hotline to ensure they put down a remark it is a birthday stay. I also emailed starwood customer mailbox just in case Ctrip missed. I got a reply from starwood saying they cannot locate my record as of that moment and it is likely Ctrip has not send them the details so I asked for a follow up on this when details are delivered over to Sheraton's system. I thought this was sufficient but it is not.

We also enjoyed three thoroughly sound nights sleep and never once heard any noise from surrounding guests. The staff is well trained in customer service and in general are helpful but we found were slow to respond. Check-in was slow but we appreciated the calmness of the Club room check-in compared to the general check-in on the ground floor.  The twin towers of the Sheraton Grand‚Ä¶",30
We stayed for 3 night after a 28 days in China it was nice to get a comfortable soft bed we had breakfast included in our package it was ok but long Cues and had to wait for them to fill up they needed 2 chefs to do the eggs as there was always about 15 in the cue  Over all it was nice an central with free buses to the other casinos and lots of places to eat out  We went on the gondolas at the Venetian go early in the morning and you should get one by yourself ,30
Poor Service - Wrong room number provided by Front Desk staff. Assigned #3665 but inform us as #3605. Clarify after half hour. - No signature and notification for 1/f lift lobby which suspended after 2300. Escalators back to G/F lift lobby. Safety quest for wheel chair and baby wheels. Poor hardware - Poor noise insulation in Room 3601. Lift machanic sound all night long.,20
"We went as a family of 4 to try out their family room with kids bunk bed . The novelty effect wore off 10mins after we arrived. The mattress was essentially a thin piece of foam and the bed totally rock hard! Would probably be more softer sleeping on the carpets! Complained to room service and was told that the mattress on the top was  thin so that the railings would still be effective. Totally illogical reasoning as this should have been considered in the inital design stage for the comfort and safety of the guest. To give them their due, they did give us a rollaway bed after i complained.  Another factor which they should look into is their Spa. We usually spend alot of time in the hotel resturant and spa on family hoildays and have no problems charging it to our rooms to pay‚Ä¶",10
"The overall was a very lousy stay. We had a smoke free room,but was kind of small. We dun expect it to so small. BF was bad since day one, not choices at all, no refill,taste was off. We have a baby but bf was not suitable. Very nice room. Looking forward to stay there again",30
"The standard and service at the hotel has definitely slipped. Wouldn't stay again or recommend this hotel anymore - and I've recommended it to a number of friends over the years.   A serious incident at breakfast summed up our recent stay. My six year old son badly burnt his forearm on one of their hot plates at the Club facility. It was dangerously hot, with zero warning signs and caused considerable stress and pain. He has scarring two weeks later.  Had to chase the hotel up via email for an apology and to check they had put warning signs up at breakfast. Got the impression from the hotel that it was 'just one of those things that happen'!   Avoid - plenty of great hotel choices in Macau - and the Sheraton needs to show a greater care of duty to it's guests.",10
"We checked in on the Club floor which was fast and easy.  However when one of our friends left their key by mistake in the room and asked for another key card, the staff were not quite with it.  They kept insisting to see identification, as we explained it's in the room and since we have not key we can't get that.  It took 10 minutes before they understand and said they would follow my friend to the room to check the identification.  They really should have better trained staff who speak good and understand English!  Room service was slow took over an hour for food to be delivered.  We had a deluxe room which was fine - it was clean and comfortable.  For a weekend, it is not a bad hotel but I wouldn't say it is one of the best hotels in Macau.",30
"Hotel Nice and Neat. Extremely busy hotel. queued for at least 30mins to check in even as a SPG member. Hotel staff was directing other non SPG guests queuing to check in at the ""less busy"" SPG area - hence actual SPG members had to wait longer than usual. Many staff are hired from the mainland China, not as professional as staff in other Sheraton hotels elsewhere, didnt respect people queuing at the back of the line, just let other guests jumping the queue to check out. Room was neat & clean - although i found a hair on the showerhead...Breakfast was alright. Recommend to go early (esp on weekends) to avoid the queue. Overall I am satisfied with the price i paid for as I didnt have much expectations when i booked",30

If trip advisor.com need any proof that I actually stayed in this hotel prior to me writing a review, I  am gladly to provide them. Just ask.  Anyways, my mom and dad arrived Macau first and it took them sometime to check in as they were asking for my credit card because I made the booking, my dad explains that i will arrive later that night and the front desk reluctantly checks them in. Not such a big deal at the moment.  Upon arrival at the hotel, i notice that the corridor is quite smoggy, perhaps due to the fact that there are no air vents, at least not the distance we cover which is about halfway in from the elevator.   I enter the room, no big surprise given it was my‚Ä¶",10
"We have stayed at many other Asian hotels, but this one did not meet our expectations.  The staff at check in was very rude and not very helpful.  It took over an hour for us to finally get into our room.  The rooms were just basic.  The food was just ok.  The location was nice for Macau.  There was a mall attached to the hotel but not one that you could actually shop at unless you were a ""high roller""....very expensive!  We will not return to this hotel as you have many other choices in this area.",20

"We reached to the hotel at midnight due to delay of airplane, and stayed there 2N3D at the Club Room. We checked in through the Club Lounge. The hotel was huge and there were so many rooms, and it was not so easy to find my room. But, the hotel staff never lead me to my room, and it was quite disappointing.  Room was spacious and clean, but the toilet was not properly maintained. We called house keeping service to clean the toilet.  Food was fair, but I cannot say it was great. Room service food was also fair, but again I cannot say it was good.  There was available shuttle service, but it was not as convenient nor frequent compared to other hotel.",30

Rooms- I had stayed in Sheraton Taipei few weeks ago, and I found the room share the same style and design which is quite surprising that they did follow Starwood stand policy, the amenities are the same!!!! We booked 2 bed, the bed is quite big, but rather hard. The whole room is very classic Sheraton style. Sheraton Macao and Sheraton Taipei have one thing in common, the room have musty smell, Macao has less musty than Taipei.

It's an okay room, nothing more, i.e while Venetian suites gives you an awesome experience while Sheraton rooms just provides you with a simple nights sleep. And for the same price. Great location though. ",30

One minor bad point, which is the temperature of the water.  When I took a shower, the water cannot maintain with the same temperature, like 1 sec hot, 1 sec cold @.@ ",30
"Stayed at the hotel for 1 night in March. It took over one hour to check in (this does not even include the queuing!) which was incredibly frustrating. The room itself was very spacious and clean. We had paid extra to have breakfast at the hotel, but when we arrived there was a queue for around 60 people ahead of us. They just could not fulfil demand and we therefore asked for a refund. Luckily this was given without hesitation. The casino itself seemed a bit dated, there were other hotels on the strip which just felt a bit more glamorous. Unlikely to stay here again. ",30
"The Sheraton in Macao has sadly lost its way in an overly crowded cotai-side resort market. At one point, the selling point here was the incredibly personal, friendly, and professional service from the club lounge; but that has sadly dropped over the past few years (several other similarly priced resorts offer comparable or better service for the same or cheaper rates). The resort also went through a period where it attempted to cater to families, but now the JW Marriott is a clear preference to the Sheraton for any family wanting a western-quality experience that serves family (the JW Marriott offers the Galaxy beach / wave pool and a kids club on site). Now, with 4,000 rooms on offer, the Sheraton will most likely attempt to be the ""mcdonalds"" of macau hotels ... a‚Ä¶",30

Arrived, around 9pm, check-in process fine, go up to room (enduring brattish kids in the lifts) and find the room which has all one would expect of this standard of hotel, or so I thought......  Anyway, having unpacked and started to relax there were some emails I needed to deal with so tried to logon to the hotel wifi to no avail (neither my tablet or phone worked so I knew it wasn't me).

The staffs at front desk and operators are nice and helpful since we brought our kids with us and we had different kind of request.    We arrived hotel at 8:45am, since the checked in time not ready yet so we walked around and went back at 5pm finally.  The room  I stayed with kids was terrible, because when we took shower with my kids, the shower head was broken. Also,  the TV was mute by itself and even the volume is high, but no sounds cane out unless we restart.  Both of two rooms' wall were quite dirty as well.  This is so surprise for me Sheraton likes that.    We lived in 16th floor, my parent-in-law room can see the studio city but mine room can viewed the dirt.    ",30
"Stayed here for a few nights in December. Overall, this is what it is, a nice hotel that Sheraton is worldwide. It is fairly standard across the world. You pay fo what you get. Sometimes at this end of the price spectrum, it is the little things that sets them apart. Unfortunate there were a few out of date coffee/ tea and milk on offer. They were months out of date, not days.   Overall, this hotel is very crowded with tourists and service can sometimes be lapse due to overcrowding.",30

Her first words was, ""you can't show the credit card right?"".  I explained that it was not my point. She then asked me to show all the documents again, which I did. Finally, she let me go without paying again. Thank you for that.  At Check-out queue , the staff assumed that I will use my credit card for express check out. I told her I'm paying cash.

Then we booked Sheraton through booking.com for the same night. It was a Last minute booking.

"It's extremely convenient to reach the hotel from Taipa ferry pier with the hotel's own shuttle (as is the case with most casinos in Macau).

Luckily we found out that the rooms themselves did not have such added odours.   Staff at the reception is well-trained and take care of every little detail. In such a huge establishment they do not have the time to give a second thought to individual needs, however.

The breakfast ""lounge"" with space for several hundred people was gigantic, noisy and not well-equipped for being a lounge. But there was a lot to choose from!

The shuttles to/from the ferry terminals and Sands Macau were nice and convenient.  Check-in and concierge staff were friendly and helpful.  Room rate was good.  The upgrade to the executive suite was nice.  I'm not sure when the Earth Tower was built, but the room furnishings looked looked worn and tired and the decor was a bit of a letdown considering how the property has been advertised.

"Given that Macau is the las vegas of asia, expect the casino to greet you as soon as you enter the hotel.  The check-in process was quick and easy, the check-out process a little bit too easy - we just dropped off our room keys and that was it.  There was no opportunity if we were charged correctly or not.  The rooms itself were spacious and amenities were decent, nothing great but nothing bad.  Biggest disappointment was the distance from the hotel rooms to where the breakfast was being served - a good 10minute walk!  As well as the lack of cuisine variety within the hotel area.

"The location of Sheraton Grand is excellent if you want to stay in Cotai Central (which is the casino / entertainment district).  There is an interconnecting walkway (through many shops) to Four Seasons Hotel and then to the Venetian Hotel.  It does not have its own shuttle bus, but you can utilise the shuttle buses operated by other hotels to get yourself to and from the ferry terminal / airport (ie. There is a stop at Sheraton Grand).  What we found was that it wasn't so convenient to catch a free shuttle bus to do our sightseeing (where the old district is) - you effectively have to catch a shuttle bus back across the bridge to the ferry terminal and then catch a bus or taxi to your destination.

"Just back from stay last week over New Year. This was my 3rd time back over 2 years. By far the most disappointing stay, particularly due to the Exec Lounge amenity which has deteriorated quite amazingly. The evening food in the lounge was awful and basically 'mall foodcourt' quality at best catering exclusive for Asian guests with virtually no international choice (which you would not expect at a Sheraton). Small children running around screaming pretty much destroys any semblance of ambiance too in the lounge. If you aren't fond of big crowds/queues, Macau is not for you and Sheraton would be your least preferred option.",30
I stayed during the 1 few days before New Year and the lobby and bell drop off for luggage were like a zoo with very long lines and people occupying every open space.   They shouted check in at 3!  So we had to store our bags.  But check out was at 11 the next day.  Other hotels in Macau were much more sedate and well organized during the same period.   Obviously under staffed at the bell desk and check in and housekeeping or they could be like other hotels.  The rooms are small - they look like a standard city hotel or even smaller.

We were surprised that they didn't analyse their bookings and made better planning for the crowd.  On other matters: most service personnel weren't conversant in English. So it was really difficult getting help around. Majority of the hotel guests were from Mainland China and Hong Kong. Perhaps the hotel management could consider a counter for International visitors so that we could get appropriate help. The saving grace was the house-keeping service. The rooms were kept clean with all amenities topped up daily.",20
"We (family of 4) booked a deluxe twin room with 2 double beds. However, the two beds in our room were smaller than expected, and could barely fit 2 people each. The room was also very cramped, with little free space, especially after we had housekeeping set up an extra roller bed. Additionally, for the entire duration of our stay, housekeeping kept preparing the room for only 2 people (e.g. we were always only provided 2 sets of toiletries). This meant that we had to ring housekeeping every night to get 2 additional sets of everything.

As a result, she was told to go to different places, despite that a simple phone call was all they needed to do to help us. Second, we went to check out dining at Palms. When we asked for a  menu, the waiter produced a copy rather reluctantly with a stiff face. He then looked away from us, to make it obvious that he didn't want to be bothered with questions.

Had to call up and it took over 2 hrs until it was replaced. 3. Children's room service food inedible. If you were planning to book this room type for a family with children than I would recommend maybe booking a suite at The Galaxy as their rooms and facilities are more well suited.",20
"People seem to be raving about this hotel - as ever - but in all honesty, probably one of the most disappointing stays in a Sheraton I've had. No recognition of SPG status other than you get to wait in a different line to check-in... and they are so rammed that you are asked not to even stay with your partner, they want the queue to look smaller so it is one person only. Enough said really... nothing more than a massive block in the middle of nowhere. We wandered out later that night and aside from the collection of drunk Mainlanders arguing, found nothing open and were grateful for a little convenience store a few blocks down in another hotel. I guess this is progress... a hotel devoted to gambling and a particular clientele. Numbers win over character and quality.",30

Still had to wait a while, but it would have been faster than the snaking queue at the main check in counter. Staff at the SPG desks were friendly and helpful. The experience was let down by the fact that I was double charged for the security deposit.  Room: Hotel elevators do not have secured access to guest room floors, which is surprising as this is a relatively new hotel.  The room was large, clean and had all the usual amenities.  I had booked a room for 3 persons, but everything in the room was in pairs. I‚Ä¶",30

I reiterated to the usher/security that ""are you sure this is the right queue for club room guest"" - and he kept saying yes.  Fine - I queued. There were at least 5 check-in counter/staff, so I guess it would be a breeze, then to my dismay, Gold/Platinum members were served first while those on queue just had to wait and wait.  After my check-in was completed after 30 mins of queue-ing, was given a leaflet of 'club benefits' - and what does it say? Club Guest should have check-in at their club, and there weren't anyone.  WIth my family in tow, NO ONE EVEN OFFER to bring our bags to our room...  Well done Sheraton - you have made my stay truly MEMORABLE!  Another punch‚Ä¶",10

"Don't  even know where to start, was mortified by my experience with Sheradan in Macau.  1) checking In: the front desk, had a massive had time, almost walked out kind of bad. As a VIP SPG member, Never  received such bad attitude. Maybe she was just having one of those bad days. 2) cigarette buds inside of elevator, enforce and even after I return from my evening run (2 hours) 3) night staff did not check if I was a hotel guest just let me walk right in, and screamed out "" what floor are you"", from the other side of the corridor. 4) there were no water left in the ladies locker room, the cleaning lady said ""there's water outside"" that means we don't need to drink there, there's water outside of the locker room.

"I have stayed here twice now...once because someone else booked and the second time because our friends were staying there so we moved over from Banyan Tree (which is amazing).  Checking in is like a cattle market or a pig farm...being herded. No warmth at checking in.  Rooms are 3* at best and the pool is terrible...the ONE major strength was the spanish restaurant buffet..yet i had a jug of sangria spilt on me first time....no problem accidents happen.  Second visit the chefs gave such tiny portions and also i was pulling fat out of my mouth or cutting loads of it off....  Anyway, one thing will always stick in my mind.

"Arrived at the hotel and had thought arriving at the refugee camp. The foyer is full of people, maybe the foyer was not designed large enough to cope that large amount of tourists coming through, having the casino sharing the same entrance with the hotel. I arrived at the hotel at lunch time and there was 3 lanes deep of cue at the front desk with people wishing to checkin and check out. I went to have lunch first and came back at 1500 and the cue was still as long as before. All counters were open and slow checkin was not helping at all. We waited in the cue for good 30min. I booked two rooms for four people and our rooms were not pre-assigned, meaning they were prepared to give us our rooms on different floors, unless we take the smoking rooms.

I warned the housekeeping to take off the shoes because I am not sure how dirty was the water in toilet. The housekeeping simply didn't listen, all 3 housekeeping ladies were wearing shoes and I guessed it made the carpet dirty!  It's now about 12am, and I asked if they have a room for me to change, it seems no one cares in this hotel! My kids are still waiting for them to clean up!

"We didn't realize how huge the commercial complex was until we arrived. It was the longest check-in queue ever. Luckily, the waiting was not too long. Our receptionist seemed a bit restless, which made me a little nervous - did I make a booking mistake?! I handed him our booking voucher and IDs but he only took one look at my husband's ID, as if he was too busy to check the other things I handed him. Instead, he did some typing, stared at the computer and asked a few times, ""You are Mr. Ho and Ms. xxx? Booked for x nights?"" until he got the right one. How hard was it to just look at my ID and find my name as well in his computer? I surely didn't like being called different names and being asked if it was me at the start of a birthday get-away trip.   And then Sheraton saved it‚Ä¶",30
"This is the train station of hotels (though possibly not the only one in Macau) with little style, little service but a lot of rooms!.  I didn't have a room pre booked, and they said they were full (I was there with friends) but they suggested trying online agents - which I did in reception, where they had lots! Seems crazy to have to book online in front of the booking desk that was ''full''. I booked a suite, they didn't get confirmation from agency so I got a standard room which was OK and the following day moved to the suite which was HUGE.  they tried to bill me for both nights in the suite mind - sorted a couple of days later.  all seemed a bit of a mess.",30

"I spent 3days in Macau and 1 night in Sheraton.  This was to celebrated my husband's birthday.  I appreciated the hotel upgraded me to Family suite and the complimentary gift.   However, what made me so impressed was the integrity of the staff!  I checked out at the Sheraton and went to check in Holiday Inn immediately.  Afterward, I found my trouser was left in the room at Sheraton and came back to Sheraton 2 times in next day to ensure if it was possibly a different person would kept my trouser.   What the answer I got was ""It was not found."".  I was so disappointed cause it is the 5 stars international hotels group but some of their staff are dishonesty.   My trouser is not a famous brand nor a high value but why its staff are unreliable?   It was definitely in my black list‚Ä¶",30

Meanwhile i had phoned at 3.30pm to enquire if they checked in and when informed room not occupied i was a bit worried. I informed Guest relations and reservations on the phone that my family will be checking in and i will come later.

"I stayed at Sheraton Macau for 3 nights. We ordered coffee capsules which was scheduled to be delivered to us at the hotel during these 3 days. As we went with a group tour, our names weren't match with the reservation name because tour guide had rearranged new room for our family to stay on the same floor. We then talked to staff at the concierge desk about this situation since the first day that we had arrived. We provided them room number, our names, order number and pretty much everything. We reconfirmed with the staff many times but they refused to collect our parcels when it was delivered to the concierge desk. The reason given to the carrier company was that the name did not match with the reservation name even the room number and our names were shown on the parcel.  ‚Ä¶",20
"I have stayed here twice. Last year, I booked a room for 4 persons on SPG's website, made it confirmed by e-mail from the hotel that the room was for 4 persons. But, they gave me a room with just 1 king bed when I checked in. I was flustered, and the reception said that they don't have a room for 4 persons except for a suite. To make matters worse, they suggested me to upgrade to a suite with additional pay because all the deluxe rooms were fully booked. Anyway, they put some extra beds in a room and I had no other choice. I had complained, and Guest Service Manager offered me a complimentary room upgrade for next visit. I had another chance to visit Macau early in Jan. This time I'd booked a room and asked the Guest Service Manager if the last offer was still valid. He didn't‚Ä¶",20

"We booked this hotel after losing a passport; we originally spent the night at another hotel but the rates were not within our budget for multiple nights so we decided to move over to this hotel.  We arrived early but rooms were available so they let us check-in. We used room service and the food was mediocre but it satisfied our late night hunger. The rooms themselves are clean and pretty large but they could use some updating. The hotel is HUGE so there is not a very personal feel, but that was to be expected.  Added bonus for pictures with Shrek!",30
"While the hotel is clean modern and the rooms are good, it just feels like the hotel is not up to the standards of a typical Sheraton hotel elsewhere. Situated on top of a casino with crowds coming in and out every day, the place is busy and you don't feel as if you are in a luxury/Exclusive hotel (well they certainly have not priced it as a luxury hotel I have to agree). The check in queue was very long and you feel being rushed. Everything is some distance away, including the walk from the check in desk to the lift where your room is.   Other than that, there isn't much to complain about the room I guess, it is modern and clean.  There isn't much they can do to be honest, this is one of three (4 soon) hotels on top of a massive casino and is designed to provide affordable beds‚Ä¶",30

The room was clean, I had left a top in the room afte departure however no one contact me for the lost and found during my stay. Perhaps the Housekeeping was too busy? The room package included daily breakfast or lunch. The food and service in Feast was very good.

Sheraton Macau is one of the lowest grade hotel for this brand. Stayed there 2 nights and cannot believed they used such low end  products across the room. The shampoo and soap are unbelievable cheap. There is No security at all. Anyone can get access to all floor as they do not have lift control.  This is one of the lowest standard of  Sheraton in Asia,30
We had a good experience here despite the check-in line being ridiculously long. The staff were very accommodating. The room was great and we had a nice view of the pool. The bell boys helped us explain to the cab driver where we wanted to go and gave us a small card with translations to help us better communicate with the driver.,30

I don't think i will stay there again. ",20
"Stayed for 3 nights. Booked on a Club Loung basis. The check in located on the 4th Floor is designed to give a superior experience this was not the case. There are potentially 8 check in positions, at the time of our check in only 2 were in use. One of the two was dealing with a client on a protracted matter the other was the sole interface with the new registrations, the time spent waiting was in access of 20 minutes. I consider this to be unacceptable. Our Club Room was on the 31st Floor, for a 5* hotel this was dissapointing and the room  can only be described as basic and underwhelming, certainly not to the standard I was expecting. On a positive note the arrangements in the Club Lounge were very good with light refreshments , tea , coffee and sandwiches available in the‚Ä¶",30
"My family and I stayed in a family (2 bed) suite last month, and were incredibly underwhelmed by the Sheraton. We came on a busy weekend with a Bon Jovi concert in the neighbouring Venetian, so when we walked in at 3.30pm the queue for checking in must have been an hour long.  We were ushered to an upstairs check-in area, which was only a HALF hour long! Upon checking in we were told that our room was not ready yet, and were shown to the lounge, where we were provided 1 drink each - there was no food, and by this stage the kids were hungry and miserable.

It saved embarrassment that I am actually an SPG member...

Adjoining rooms were good and the kids' room was bedecked with Dreamworks themed goodies, which was great and one of the reasons we had chosen the Sheraton. We set out to explore lunch options. Poolside bar menu was sparse, as was the service so we elected for Bene, the Italian on the first floor. Generally pretty good although the waiter got a bit pushy when we only‚Ä¶",30

The hotel was lovely but our holiday was ruined and very disappointed with the check out service. We paid a deposit on arrival and were told we would have the amount credit within 24 hours back onto our credit card it was a moderate amount. 3 and half weeks later I was still trying to get that money back I could not get any satisfaction from emails etc. so disappointing from such a large well known company there was a huge mix up and paperwork missing not good enough I will never stay at a Sheraton hotel again I have never had this problem ever all over the whole world,20

I come back to hotel around 23:00, I go to pick up the key at SPG counters as well. Everything is fine. When I go up, I hear some noise inside my room, then I use my key to open the door.

The check-in line was very long, luckily as our group consist of 2 young children (1 was done with fever) and 2 late sixties seniors were directed to the express check-in.  I find the hotel concierege are really helpful whenever we approach them for assistance.  We would suggest that families with young kids to stay on the peninsula side and most of the tourist spots are located there.  The Cotai area is mostly for people visiting the casinos.  Our family enjoyed the fantastic House of Dancing Water show.",30
"This is my third time to stay at Sheraton Macao, I am fine with the hotel location, facility and the room is nice.  I had a very disappointing experience - when I check out, I told the reception Miss Chow/Zhou I loss my deposit receipt then she gave me a long face to calculate the deposit balance, then she ""throw the money"" on the reception desk. I felt embarrassing, I need to meet my friends so I didn't raise complaint to her manager.  Very disappointing service I hope Sheraton to improve their service level, therefore I have to give them only 2-star.  To clarify: this time my room is not complimentary by the Casino, I book thru agent.  ",20
"The problem with this hotel is that it is so massive and loses its exclusivity. It is becoming a really sleazy hotel. There are two towers with a casino at the lobby. I went there during the China National Day holidays, and boy oh boy.. It was so crowded at the lobby.   This is my third stay in this hotel, and I have no idea why I was put at Sky Tower again. From my observation, it seems that Caucasians were placed in the Earth Tower while Asians, which I am one, were placed in the Sky Tower. I have never been into the Earth Tower, and hence, can't really comment on the layout, decorations etc. But what I can comment on was the quality of guests in the Sky Tower.

Horrible stay. Save your money. This hotel had the dirtiest breakfast buffet I have ever seen. Also the service is far below the other hotels. I will never stay at this property again. Ask for non smoking king yet room smelled of smoke. Overpriced should be a one star motel not even hotel rating.,10
"Keeping in mind this is the biggest Sheraton Hotel in the World, in a tourist hub like Macau, you clearly have to make certain concessions. Clearly you're not going to get away from the crowds, nor should you really expect to, but certain things which could help aren't particularly thought out. The Sheraton Club for example is MASSIVE and there isn't a slight air of exclusivity - the dining area just feels like another hotel restaurant.   As a platinum SPG member I was upgraded to a very comfortable suite and the service was rather good. I ordered an item from the daily menu after 11pm and the staff had no issue at all bringing it to me.   I think if TripAdvisor allowed half ratings this would be a 3.5/5",30
"Honestly, I cannot follow many of those who posted the review here on Tripadvisor... but so be it! I just stayed recently at it was most likely by far the worst experience I had in a so called 5* hotel over the past couple of years. It starts already with the feeling of being a number instead a guest that you have to line up for check in...that alone is already not 5* but the fact the the check in process is slow and many counters are not manned is another fact. The check in was not organized at all and took over 10 minutes leaving the waiting time aside. The staffs was not well trained neither customer oriented.  That the lobby has no charm as it is permanently overrun by game machines is a fact that you have to accept when you are in Macau... The whole ambiance just feels odd.‚Ä¶",20

We also did tried to call the servicing line but the phone was spoilt.  We're not able to call out.  So we left a note in the toilet to request them to fix it.  There's no response and not fix.  So we bare with it for the 4 nights we stayed there.",20

The check in is fast, the lady upgrade me to suite and she was sweet and considerate, it got nothing to do with the elite status yet.   So few months later I returned and stay here for one night for the concert, it turned out to be a huge disappointment. I arrived at 1800 and it's packed, due to the public holiday and mid-autumn festvial, the place is totally packed. So I went to the SPG counter, the queue is long and there's only two staff at the counter, and they took ages to finish one check-in, one even keep chatting with the customers on and off.

Well we were looking forward to  the all round Sheraton experience and we were very disappointed. You can't check in until 1pm. Then at 1pm they cattle que you in long ques. Awful system. Why you can't check in and do all the paperwork and then just grab your keys and bags later like in normal hotels I don't know. Terrible experience. The restaurant is the furthest area away from the rooms so breakfast is a march. Set off 15mins before you're hungry. Nothing is sign posted well except the shops and gambling. Everything else you need to constantly ask for directions.  Good fitness and pool facilities.  Rooms are dated.  Breakfast is OK but nothing special.

It was so disappointing, this is the worst SPG property in the world, this is the third or fourth time I stay at this hotel, and I realized that the service quality at this hotel has been decreasing again and again. Friends, you may want to try some other new hotels around, unless only paying for the name of Sheraton.",20
Rooms are ok - what you would expect from a Sheraton.   The food options are pretty poor. Italian restaurant is below average. Even the Chinese restaurant is below average!!!  Pools are great - they serve better food there. Although they close the bar/food way too early in the evening!!!  Worst thing is that it's located in Macau - a poor man's Vegas. Doesn't have the soul or crowds that Vegas pulls. Really quite disappointing. ,30
"After a long flight and ferry across from HK, last thing needed was a 1/2 hr wait to check in. Only 2 staff at the counter ! gave up and wandered off to another part of the hotel and found a SPG only area where check in was swift and efficient. Room was excellent with great views and good amenities. Bed was comfortable Asked for a scissors and that did not arrive throughout my stay ...  Full of people and looked more like a shopping mall than a hotel. But that is true of all Macau hotels - wandered around the place as a lot of hotels are interconnected. Venetian , Conrad, Four Seasons all connected and easy to walk .

So I came back after the show, and what happened was we requested a room with king bed, but they said they ran out of room and can only offered us a 2xdouble bed bedroom and we were not happy with this arrangement at all. The hotel staff was not helpful and all they said was because they have too many people coming in since its a weekend and all the rooms are occupied and that's what they can only offer us.

I recently stayed at Sheraton  hotel for a birthday getaway which was ruined by an ATM eating my boyfriends bank card. The staff there were not helpful in helping us try and get our card back and never offered to call the ATM phone number for us. Instead they chose to stand around and watch us while they chatted amongst themselves. We then had to go back to our hotel room to make phone calls to our banks to cancel the card in case it did miraculously pop out somehow and someone tried to use it. We made a total of 4 international phone calls totaling 10mins to our bank to cancel the card.

You are forced to spend your money within the property.  Macau island is a 30-50 bus ride away (depending on traffic and which service number), rides are fairly cheap, 3.2 to 6.2 MOP per trip, just look at the machine when you board, it should reflect the fare you have to pay.

"Arrived via the free Taipa Ferry terminal shuttle bus to see a check in queue with at least 150 people in it. We were moved to a group check in counter (even though there were only 2 of us) and we figured this would be like an express line. It wasn't. Even with 3 staff on desks and only 2 people in front of us, we waited 45 minutes to reach the counter and then the check in process took about 10 minutes. It was just absurd.  It seems this hotel classifies you based on the price you paid for a room. I got an advanced 30% off discounted rate months ago which meant I was allocated a room in the 'Earth Tower' and almost the very last room furthest from the lifts on that particular floor. It was a ridiculously long walk to the entrance and even to the pool. I don't understand why the‚Ä¶",30

She told me maybe because someone smoked in this room before.

"I spent 1 night from Sunday to Monday at Sheraton Hotel Macau and it was great ! I am not going to complain about the service and the room because everything are fabulous. One thing that I dislike about the hotel is the crowd ! It was my 1st time seeing the queueing line like that with 20 front lines people just to do the check in. I spent about 30 mins just to do the check-in which is unlikely happen when I stay at 5star hotel. So I guess, Sheraton is one of the most popular hotel among tourist from China and you just need to be ready with the crowd and don't expect to enjoy the swimming pool peacefully either ! Eventho' they have a lot of pools the amount of guest just unbelievable, you can't expect to do swimming properly unless you just want to dip ur feet in the pool. I‚Ä¶",30
"Just concluded our family bonding in Macau and we had satisfactory experience staying @ Sheraton. Though when we arrived, it's so crowded at the concierge and I'm feeling uneasy already due to the long cue lines waiting for our reservation to be serve. Good, the room assigned to us was satisfactory to my standard. How I wished that reception area at the lobby were that spacious so as not to be bored while waiting for our room assignment. The hotel lobby were eaten by the casino and since I have kids we me we have no options but to stand and wait. Good that when we arrived at our room, I felt so relax and at home.

Two observations : no ' tidy my room' sign, so room service can arrive anytime. Romm tidy not to European standards - beds and towels, but not much else. Secondly, the the room safe was  not fixed into the wardrobe, so you could pick up and steal the entire contents ( if you could leave the building). Pool very nice, food fine (but pricey)  and i couldn't find a communal lounge bar - which is critical if you are to attract a western audience.  Shopping expensive.",30

Confirmation received, the usual standard procedure, all good. My sister arrives and is told that unless she can produce the credit card that was used for payment she has to pay again! There goes the gift and surprise out of the window. True to their mission they have certainly delivered a 'memorable experience', unfortunately the wrong one altogether. As part of the booking they had my e-mail address as well as my mobile number.

The swimming pool was disappointing and one side with the jacuzzi was closed, which was secretly open, but the pools were not accessible.   We were dropped with their bus at one side, but had to walk with all our stuff trough the hotel to another counter. Don't get why this was... since the casino floors are like in the middle, you need to walk around the whole complex to get there if you are with kids, really terrible after a bouncy boat trip from Hong Kong. To get to the breakfast restaurant we had to walk like 10 minutes every morning, service isnt great.

The lobby was great and a lot of Chinese people walking around. The Reception counter were separate four different areas for check-in. The front desk staffs were helpful. The hotel is separate into two towers. The security guard will cross check in front of the entrance of lift lobby for those suspect people. The room is fantastic but only think the front desk staff cannot put me to non smoking room king size bed. The room is smelly. The check out system is good as you can do by myself in the check out machine. Although we already reserved the breakfasts but they can allow you to choose to take breakfast or lunch buffet .‚Ä¶,30

Still 30 mins before they closed the buffet and they had many items gone.  Went to get some eggs and first: the station is just so dirty and disorganised that you don't fancy eating there, and second, the chef, while really polite, couldn't understand what I meant by fried eggs!  Great point: the people at check in were really accommodating! ",30
"There are heaps of hotels in Macau. Choosing  Sheraton was a family choice but personally I would not. 1. U would choose Sheraton because u r member of the hotel group. - Starwood. 2. Outstanding service?. ( not all hotel the same) 3. Value for money.? ( only the club floor that is all your meals are there) For my family it's the above 3. This trip we were upgraded to a suite so I should be thankful but the sofa bed that was supposed to be set up was not. This was done after 3 calls and it was past midnight n half an hour later tt they did. Bed springs was protruding... Sigh! Anyway. They give a rollaway the next night. Discomfort settled.

"Stayed over the weekends with some friends and the service was one of the worst I have ever encountered. While the hotel looks ok, it was let down by its untrained staff. The checkin took almost half an hour even without a queue.   First of all they couldn't find my bookings. When they have found it after 10mins, the reception asked me if I want to have the rooms that I've booked to be on the same floor, but then proceed to give us rooms on different floors because ""it was busy"". Finally, the staff said our checkout time could be extended to noon, but when I double checked the next morning, I was told it is 11am. All this and I never heard them apologizing and said a word of sorry.  Don't stay here if you want a relaxed holiday",20
This is my 2nd time staying at this hotel. Had to wait nearly an hour to checkin at the SPG counter. Completely shocking! Realised later its due to slow checkin system. We were also told to 1.5hr for in room food service  Really unacceptable for a 4 star hotel. It felt like Sheranton is under resourced to serve high volume of customers.   They do make it up with friendly smiles and initiatives to serve staff. We were there for the pool party at hard rock and were given complimentary water proof pouches! That's exemplary! We also asked for many bottles of water which was promptly delivered to our rooms. ,30
"We stayed at the club floor.  Access to club lounge was great.  Great variety of food and drinks served, although service was not great.  Staff were not proactive in serving.  We need to ask for plates to be cleared or ask again and again for orders to be taken.  Room was small for Macau.  I was surprised by the even smaller bathroom.  Smallest shower stall I'd ever been in.  Service was bad.  Reception at the Club lounge on 4th floor was friendly but nothing spectacular. Free welcome drink and cold towel was a nice touch.

Negatives: It's a casino so you have a lot of people everywhere on the property; long lines at check-in and out; breakfast was plain and not all that good.",30
"What we liked:  Good location. -Located near all the good casinos and entertainment buildings. You can walk over to city of dreams to catch house of dancing waters.You can easily walk over to the famous Venetian hotel. -Spacious and clean Room and bath room.  All hotels around that area seems to provide shuttle buses .  What we did not like:  -Strong kind of smell of detergent in the room. It was not pleasant, what's up with that! -You have to queue for so long to check in even on a weekday, we were quite surprised. The place itself is damn crowded, we had to queue for 40 minutes. -Customer service is alright, but unlike other Sheraton hotels we have been to before, everything seems to be done in a rush, but we can't really blame them, they have too many customers.",30

No kid friendly restaurants either, they all have high chairs but no kids menus or portions. Swimming pool is basic, no major kid features like slides or anything.

"Out of the three hotels at coati central, Sheraton Macao is perhaps the least impressive with their rooms. Rooms are generally spacious (so does holiday inn and Conrad) but the decoration is minimal at best. Amenities are adequate but seemingly made cheaply. Undoubtedly their suites are much better, but given the price paid for, Holiday Inn does a better job than Sheraton. What they lack in their rooms make up with their restaurants and service though. Sheraton has better restaurants (Xin and Bene) than what the other two competing hotels offer. And the service and buffet at the club lounge are quite good. Guests that are SPG members and/or have club access definitely have better service. Would recommend this hotel if it is on a promotion. ",30

The worst element is the stench of cigarette smoke on the family floor, which seeps into the rooms.

Staff were great, transportation from the ferry port was easy, never had to wait long for taxis, this place is great of all you want to do is gawp, gamble or shop. But, it lacked adequate restaurants unless you wanted the food court or mass production (there is an Italian which, I admit, we didn't try) and there is‚Ä¶",30
"The Sheraton Macau sits opposite the Venetian, owned by Sands. So it's a good place to stay if u want to be close to the Venetian but not be swamped by the large crowds over there. The Sheraton is one of three hotels occupying a huge mall development called the Sands Cotai Central, also owned by Sands. The other two hotels are Conrad and the Holiday Inn. Each of these hotels are not small, each having more than 1000 rooms each, with the Sheraton being the largest of the three. Price wise, it is cheaper than Conrad but more expensive than the Holiday Inn. It provides two shuttle services. One to the Macau ferry terminal and other to The Galaxy Hotel. From Galaxy hotel, there are shuttles to other points of interest like the Border. U can also walk about 15 mins to the Tapa‚Ä¶",30
"I arrived at Sheraton with great expectations. Having booked a great deal for their deluxe suite I was really looking forward to the stay.  Unfortunately my experience at the SPG counter completely ruined any good feelings of this hotel.  I made my way to the separate check in section where I was met with an extremely rude bouncer like attendant surnamed Yang who blocked my entry with a rope. He said check in? Go over there and pointed to the regular check in counter. I told him I was SPG and he actually asked me you are SPG with a very disbelieving tone. I told him yes I am (a second time!) and he asked me to produce my SPG card which I have never received. I said you can check my booking... I don't have my card. To which he replied this place is full, go to the regular check‚Ä¶",10
"We stayed a this property as we were part of a birthday group. There is nothing intimate or subtle about the property which one would expect from Macau. Thank goodness we are Starwood Gold which made the check in process quick and easy. We stayed in a suite which was spacious, the decor was standard. The Club was huge and an awful experience, the food was tasteless. The property is a stones throw from the shopping centre so if you're there for the shopping it's an easy walk.",30
"Just stayed 4 Conference days at the Sheraton. Met at Macau ferry and complimentary transfer to Cotai - excellent As a Preferred Guest we were checked in seamlessly and given a great room on 24the floor overlooking pool. Room size, bed comfort and room features all excellent. The gym and pool areas all excellent. Change facilities all excellent. Our major problem was the value of food and drink to our lower valued Australian dollar. When a hotel coffee shop charges over AUD 40 for coffee and an average tuna sandwich you know that eating at this hotel is going to be a problem. All speciality restaurants are to our budget far too costly. The hotel does have a MacDonald's and a Pacific Coffee venue for that type of product.

"Recently attended an educational conference here. The hotel has great facilities including the usual amenities, spa, swimming pool, shopping malls galore, plus the expected casino. However, there is little to do in Macau except for gambling, so if this is not your motive expect to be bored. With the exception of a very small old town, you will struggle to find the 'real'  Macau amongst of the glitter, tackiness and excessive lights and sparks.",30
"Nice large rooms. Housekeeping lacking. Everything --like with all other hotels on the cotai strip, or indeed all casino-attached hotels, for that matter-- is casino/gambling-oriented and the rest of the services are only secondary: restaurants serve good food but service is abominable, there are no bars, the hotel lounge closes at ungodly early hours, ... Besides the gambling & possible shopping experience, there's nothing that would attract business people in particular. The friendliness of the staff is also below par, but that is probably to be expected with the millions of guests coming thru the doors... Probably comparable to other cotai strip hotels...",30
"I'm not 1st time stay at Sheraton. But I would prefer stay at Conrad in the past due to room and service is better than there.

"In order to make the review easier to deal with, I will split it into several parts: 1. Overall 2. Room 3. Service 4. Food 5. Location  1. Overall impression.  We have decided to book that particular hotel because they gave quite a good offer for the time period we were going to stay, it was roughly 150USD/night with breakfast and ""all-day"" snacks included into the price.   Hotel has a free shuttle bus service from Macau Taipa Ferry, which was particularly convenient for us(we've arrived from Shenzhen, China by boat). The bus takes literally 5-10 minutes to get from the ferry to the hotel, which was awesome.  Now, in order to make it fair, I'd have to really clarify things before I go any further. Our trip has taken place right before Lunar(aka Chinese) New Year in February‚Ä¶",30
"Rooms are nice and very comfortable, but despite being reasonably new there are a few issues - the bath wouldn't plug so wouldn't retain water, a few standard amenities were missing and the entire (non-smoking) floor stunk of cigarettes, even inside the room. I liked the staff very much, they were very helpful and took care of any issues and requirements. Used the lounge, the free alcohol was very nice and generously served, the food is not bad but a little variable.",30
"Sheraton lives up to its name and its a beautiful property. The rooms are spacious and well laid out. So as far as hotel quality goes full marks to Sheraton.  However the staff leaves much to be desired. We took almost 3 HRS to check in(agreed we were a large group but 3 hours is a lot)... The bfast staff was, putting it gently, uncourteous. However the house keeping staff was super..  So if u leave aside a few irritants its a super property. They have a heated pool and a good gym and free WiFi... Overall it was a decent experience.",30
We stayed here (3 ppl) for one night. On check in I was told there were only 2 single beds and was not advised these were actually king singles. I explained we were three as per booking and did they expect us to sleep two to one bed and the word single is for one and she said yes. They said I van have another bed at extra cost and after some discussion said it would be free. On arriving in the room I realised it was a king single so cancelled the other bed. Overall as this place is so big with connecting walkways to three other hotels I feel the care you expect of paying what it costs to stay here is lost with so  many people and so a massive place. Would I stay again no.,30
I stayed here for 8 nights. The services was bad. The bedsheets was only changed on the 3rd n 6th day. The bathroom amenities was not daily replenished. The pen n paper was not replenish as well. The slippers was also not replenish as well. The toilet roll given only on alternate days n the what pisses me off was the soap bar n shower n shampoo not given daily. The free water bottle from 4 to 2. I mean i PAY for 8nights but was duly shortchanged by the hotel. To people who going to book this hotel... do remember the hotel is in a shopping center n the human traffic is really horrendous. Chaotic at the checkin n checkout counter. Cos though there is a  que line but jumping que by people is so annoying. Hopeless hotel staff at the reception who dare not stop those que jumping‚Ä¶,30
"Stayed for 2 nights at the executive suite of this hotel. We had stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel on our previous visit but I wanted to earn some SPG points on my loyalty card. Had access to Sheraton's club lounge which is huge compared to the other club lounges I've been to. The breakfast buffet at this club lounge was a full spread and not like the other club lounges where you'd tend to get a very limited buffet spread. Although it came with free WIFI, the connection was spotty and slow. The location is great for shopping and there are many restaurants at the attached shopping mall.   We stayed on the 15th floor and trying a find an elevator that took us to our floor was like trying to play hide and seek. This is a massive hotel and has dedicated elevators to certain floors.‚Ä¶",30
"The hotel is not at the city centre but we knew this. Shuttle bus runs to the city centre from the nearby hotels but there are always many people. Twice we needed to get a taxi which was not expensive. This Sheraton was quite a disappointment considering the standard of service of Starwood hotels. Too too many people that took us long time to check in even at the spg reception. We understand the hotel is big and you expect the number of guests to be huge but they could manage it better. At the reception the personnel was friendly though we could have a better room. We asked if our room was nice and on a high floor and we received a promising reaction from the receptionist. In the end, we were not on a very high floor and also the view of our room was blocked by the other hotel‚Ä¶",20

The hotel itself is not bad - rooms are good sized and you see the hallmark of a Sheraton everywhere.",30

"Normally staying at a Sheraton hotel (or any of its competitors such as Hilton, Marriott, etc.) can prove to be a sublime experience. Everything smells of mildew mixed with basic cleaning fluids. That's exactly how this Sheraton was. Because Sheraton Cotai is part of the Sands Cotai complex, one would expect it to be much better. But Sheraton proves that reputations do matter.  Here is the review.  Positives + Absolutely clean room. We had a two-bedroom suite that was kept in clean condition and definitely much better than what we were expecting from Sheraton + We had a suite and the dual bedrooms which were also very well laid out + The hotel's location in Cotai is very close to the Venetian Cotai and features lots of casinos and other entertainment within walking distance +‚Ä¶",20

There are two ferry docks on the way back. Employees at the hotel referred us to three different lobbies to catch the one back. Inbound bus takes you to a Sands complex on another island.

During our stay, we often saw people smoking, without discretion, throughout the 'non smoking' section of the hotel.........in addition our non-smoking room smelled of smoke and we actually saw guests in the neighboring room smoking away whilst their door was ajar.

"Booked a junior suite via Starwood SPG website.  Chose this hotel because it was the cheapest upscale international hotel in the Cotai area. By the number of guests rooms, it is also the biggest Sheraton brand hotel in China, perhaps in Asia.    In-room decor is acceptable considering the cheap tariff.  Pictures attached.      The service at Sheraton Macau is exceedingly impersonal, if not degrading.  It is the worst of all Sheraton or SPG group of hotels I have stayed in China.    1) No bell boy at lobby to assist with luggage into and checking out of the hotel.    2) First time I have been told at an upscale hotel that towels has to be exchanged instead of extra towels being provided.  This is insulting for myself who neither steal nor have the need to steal.  If Sheraton is‚Ä¶",20
"Stayed one night at Sheraton Macao due to the hotel next door was fully booked.  Since this hotel has over 3,000 rooms/suites, we had to be in a long queue upon check-in in hotel lobby.  Maybe we booked through online booking agent or we were the first timer of this hotel, we couldn't see or feel a warm welcome at all.  With 2 separate towers, i.e. Sky Tower & Earth Tower in Sands Cotai Central Complex, the Front Desk Officer didn't remind us which way we should approach while they gave us the room keys, and we just realized we went to the wrong tower until the advice by security officer at lift lobby.  The room is just enough for 2 persons, and no space for an extra bed.  Don't expect any turndown service in the evening.  Though the hotel states that they provide free WIFI‚Ä¶",30
"There is nothing wrong with this hotel, but there is also nothing exceptional about it either. The staff was friendly - after we resolved the disaster at check in. The room was a nice size - I had 2 doubles. And the bathroom was  a very nice size wtih a good shower. The location is not really in Macau proper - it is in the new part of town in Cotai, which is fine - just takes longer to get to when coming in from the Ferry. All in all, I had a fine stay...there is just nothing that really stands out about it and if you are in Macau, you want to be wowed!!",30
"Travelled from HK for weekend in Macau and stayed at the Sheraton on the Cotai strip. We were in a family suite which was spacious and suited our family. The focus of our weekend was to relax by the pool and around the hotel.   Unfortunately we found staff customer service to be quite inconsistent and raised concerns with a very professional Duty Manager in Reception during our stay. However, this is a higher end hotel and some of the following inconsistencies are not satisfactory.  Our experiences with inconsistencies in customer service started with the 'guest relations' staff on the phone once we had checked in and were in our room. There seemed to be a language barrier when the call was made to 'guest relations'  and our problem was not understood. It took several phone‚Ä¶",30
"Scanning the reviews of this hotel, you will expect luxury and a quality of furnishings and service that are common of the Sheraton and Westin chain of facilities. Our experience of Macau Cotai is no exception to these opinions but with the major exception that we considered even these attributes to be unacceptably expensive. The fact that this also applies to the surrounding hotels, is no excuse. Macau Cotai is in our opinion overpriced for what it offers. Certainly this is an exaggerated offering of all types and the thrill of the gambling casinos within this complex of huge hotels with all they have to offer is startling, dazzling and entertaining. If that is what you want to pay so much for, then you have hit the bulls-eye. If you are more discerning and less demanding, then‚Ä¶",30

There is reason why this hotel is Cheaper than other 5 stars hotel in Macau. Chose this hotel just because of the breakfast for my kids. And you can walk to the'Water show' hotel in 5 mins.

I find this truly ridiculous and in fact having stayed in hotels all over the world  this is the first time ever such happened to me.

"I spent 5 nights this month in a work trip that was held at the Sheraton Macau. I was looking forward to the trip despite not being a gambler myself. However this monstrous hotel, which has apparently over 3,000 rooms, was a real let down. Room quality was poor although the room was huge. The fittings and bathrooms were luxurious in about 1990 but dated and poor now, although the bed was comfortable. Worst of all, every available square inch of the common areas is given over to gambling. There is no nice bar or decent coffee shop, apart from a hopelessly inadequate one on the ground floor which is constantly full of families apparently waiting for the gambler to come out of the casino, for hours at a time. The staff show zero care or interest in you, and take no action to stop‚Ä¶",20
"We visit Macau several times a year and usually stay at the Galaxy, Holiday Inn Cotai Central or Galaxy.

Having stayed at the Venetian which is spread over a larger area than the Sheraton, we were not overwhelmed by the size.   The deluxe room is smaller than the TA photos would lead one to believe and lacking in character (see photos posted separately). The Holiday Inn Cotai has nicer and more inviting rooms than the drab and dull color theme of the Sheraton's deluxe rooms.

"This is a massive hotel with a massive mall and massive casino on massive Cotai strip.  Vulgar would be rather fitting.  There are about 3 million people in the mall and around the hotel lobby.  Once you get the elevator up to your room, it's another world.  Peace, tranquility.  But alas my room had a nice view of the building site next door.  Another hotel no doubt.  The highlight of my stay was the queue outside and opposite the lobby for the taxis.  It took 45 minutes to get one.  The taxi situation in Macau is a major headache.  There are far too many visitors for the infrastructure to support.  This isn't a Sheraton.  It's way too much below par to deserve the name.",20

Well, the hotel property is modern and clean, but apart of that there is nothing to commend about.

The walk from reception to the elevators was like navigating an underground station at rush-hour. The elevators were all full. The hotel lobby is more of a shopping mall than a foyer, with hundreds of people all about. Every experience also seems so mechanical with sign-in needed at the pool even. Actual sign-in. With a pen.

I was stuck outside my room since my key stopped working and it took all of 45 minutes and 4 staff including the manager to sort it out. I had already missed my meeting by then.

They can only do an exchange and is not allow to give extras.  I was so surprised by the answer that I just said ok and hung up.  I just feel so disappointed by being denied such simple request.  I could totally understand if its from a motel but from Sheraton? This experience totally changed my view on Sheraton.,20
Hotel is well appointed and clean. It meets the expectations of the Sheraton brand.  You had to show your key to security to gain access to the lift lobby. Guest floors were well maintained. The room was nice and well serviced. All areas of the room were clean. Bed was ok although the pillows were very soft. Room was quiet and had a nice view over one of the pools. I loved that the curtains kept the room completely dark even in the morning. Great wifi signal in the room. A solid 4 to 5 star hotel based on the room and amenities.   Pools were nice but a bit small.   Unfortunately staff were not very friendly at all on both checkin and checkout. Nor were the concierge and events booking staff very friendly. Front desk seemed to be unable to cope with questions and very grumpy.‚Ä¶,30

I should have saved the extra $ and have my breakfast in other outlets. We stayed in the sky tower on 32nd floor facing the pools.

Good food options were also very limited: fortunately, we know Fernando's! A strange hotel. Back to the Westin or one of the other Strip hotels next time. For the biggest Sheraton in the world (and presumably their flagship hotel), this place needs some work, as do the staff who were unable to comply with a simple request to leave a couple of water bottles outside the room, so as not to wake my friend up.

The room is just a normal size and it provides not enough towels and base rope. I think I'll spend more 100 USD to live in Hotel Okura Macau again, because the room size of Okura is triple size than Sheraton and everything in Hotel Okura Macau is better than Sheraton. You only need to spend about 100 USD and you will feel‚Ä¶",20
"This is world's largest Sheraton Hotel located in Macau Cotai area.  There are two reception area and SPG reception area on 4th floor. Try to avoid the reception area in front ot MacDonald which is rude and lack of SPG knowledge.  For SPG members, room upgrades are not given unless you strongly asked for it.. We booked suite room which is large and luxury with standard above typical Sheraton room.  Service level within the hotel is good except for those in reception area.   If you are looking for better service, go to Conrad Hotel.",30
"1 / The lobby having long queue and need me to wait at least 15 minutes.  The hotel have a lots of counters but no good signage or direction system just guiding by the staffs (seems higher level), specially I noticed a male who is short fat guy is the guiding staff, but he was talking with the mobile phones, then walking around and just walk away to the back office in sudden.  Why he came to guide us and ran away if he is too busy?  That is not a good service which Sheraton should be  2 / there have a lot of lanes, but the mainland Chinese always jumping the queue or just go directly to the counters from the exit area, but no security guards force them to lane back.

"Now we all know that Macau/HK people are comparatively rude compared to the rest of the world but I would never expect that the staff in a 5-star hotel are the same. I am talking about the staff stationed at the entrance to the lifts (those who check your hotel key-cards).  The manner in which they spoke to you made it seem like you were passing through a security check-point (gave off a vibe that made you feel as if you were someone trying to sneak through the security into a hotel that you could not afford). To top it all off, no smiles, no 'good mornings, good evenings'. Heck, even staff in budget hotels know very well that those are the basics in the hospitality industry.  While I have no problems with the rest of the hotel, this one blemish is enough to warrant an 'average‚Ä¶",30
"We made a spontaneous visit from Hong Kong during the Buddhist's Birthday holiday. This was our 3rd time staying in this Sheraton but we left with great disappointment.  Upon arrival, we noticed that the priority check in area for SPG members are already closed, so we had to queue up for quite a while at the reception. The staff was pretty slow and their English level was far from the proper standard. As a loyal member, we didn't feel welcome at all as there were no special greetings and offer etc. The staff started asking us questions like one bed or two beds, smoking or non smoking, higher or lower floor - I told him I already listed all my requests in my booking and it was shown in my member profile. This is ridiculous!  Then my issue with them was - since I made the booking‚Ä¶",20
"We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in mid-April.  First impression, it looked pretty good however that quickly deteriorated by the time we got to the desk.  I understand that I am in China - not back here in the US but the communication issue is so frustrating.  For a brand that I believe (pls correct me if I'm wrong) is based in the US, I would expect at least one person in the desk all the time that speaks fluent English. (This was an issue with the rest of our stay here). The next day - we had better luck asking for directions from the concierge  on one of the other hotels (Holiday Inn?) that is adjoined with this one.  The accomodations were pretty good.  Comfortable beds, great view of the city, nice bathroom.  At least we enjoyed the buffet breakfast, just do sign‚Ä¶",30
"I will start my review arriving in Macau, wow that was an experience ! Immigration was so slack that I still have my embankment card in my wallet as no one collected it or checked as we came through from Australia! We were confused as signage was poor or in Chinese which we can't read as to where to get our bags, could not find anyone who spoke enough English to help. Finally got our bags and went to find the shuttle to the Sheraton . Again we had no idea as other hotels had people with signs at the airport but not Sheraton. It was actually a tour guide from Whyn hotel who showed us how to get to the shuttle. Once there we had the rudest and most unhelpful driver I have ever come across who just pointed and grunted at us. We arrived at reception and got checked in and shown to‚Ä¶",30
"I am a SPG PLATINUM member and used to love staying at the Sheraton group of hotels around the world..  I have had long stays at stays at Sheraton Hong Kong,  sometimes up to almost a year at a stretch. I used to greatly enjoy the hospitality and efficiency of the staff and the quality of the rooms and other services.   So it was a shocking experience in Macau Sheraton. Though the staff try their best to look courteous and attentive, there seems an air of utter chaos every where.   The moment you enter the main lobby, you are lost in the sea of people and the chatter and clatter reminds you of some over crowded flea market. Chaos seems to prevail everywhere and in everything you want to do.  I  Maybe it's because of the large number Chinese mainland tourists??  No I don't think‚Ä¶",20
"Had stayed in the sky tower on its opening and now am in the Earth tower . Service is deteriorating - no welcome drink but luckily the check in reception service is good. Upon entering room, no room slippers, one table lamp and two ceiling light bulbs blown, no bar soap. Nice coffee provided but no fresh milk capsule - only creamer which really spoilt the drink. This should not be a 5 star standard. Leave message on table on above so that housekeeping can do the needful but too bad the staff cannot read English and message was left unattended. Also after cleaning room no bath mat and no refill for shower gel. Need to call and request staff to bring. Typically there is no supervision to ensure everything is properly in place. This is really shameful!",30
"I was told that this is Sheraton biggest hotel property in the world with 6000+ rooms! This place is huge but soulless. I don't feel like a hotel guest but a shopper in a huge shopping mall with casino. The room is spacious but of standard design. I hardly get to interact with hotel staff at main lobby and concierge because they are located so far from my Sky Tower room. Due to too many hotel guests, one can do an express check out by dropping the room card into a box at lift lobby. As a result, hardly any chance for human interaction. As a SPG, the hotel offers a room wifi service at MOP 30. I won't recommend purchasing any wifi service because the connection kept dropping and the speed, well... there was hardy any speed I guess... Compared to Galaxy Hotel, free shuttle bus‚Ä¶",30

"We went for an overnight stay in Sheraton. We chose this over the others because they seemed to be the most child friendly on paper. Turns out it was worse than picking a hostel. W arrived by ferry from Hong Kong and upon arrival, I immediately went to the information desk and asked where the hotel bus transfer was and was told to cross the underpass and find them there. While the other hotels had clearly marked buses, Sheraton had a print out of their logo on a piece of paper mounted under the steering wheel. Suffice to say it took us some time to find that one bus among the dozens randomly parked. Then when we did find the us, the attendants couldn't care less that I was carrying my 4 year old with our backpack and pulling 2 strollers with one hand. Awesome... they didn't even‚Ä¶",10
"We visit this hotel again since last July and realized services continue to be poor and no improvement has been in place at all! We moved to Sheraton after spending a night in Grand Hyatt. Nothing to be compared as it is a 2-star versus 5-star.   We were diverted to another side of the lobby for checking in without realizing we were club patrons and ended up waited 10 meaningless minutes before heading to club lounge check in. Nobody acknowledged us while sitting down at the club lounge, not a smile and of course none service at all. Unclear message was given upon check in and we eventually went to the wrong side of the hotel and tried opening a wrong door. Housekeeping girl provided nil service and only told us about the wrong direction and we have to deal with this through‚Ä¶",20
"We were awaken in the morning (that too after a late night sleep) by continuous attempt of opening our door even when the DO NOT DISTURB was turned on (we guess they could not ring the bell as DND was on). We were too annoyed by the noise and opened the door to find out some random guests thought that it was their room. Mistakes happen, so no big deal. However, what we could not believe is that they were accompanied by a hotel staff who took them to our room not realising their room was in other tower. Not only the staff did not check their room number but also he did not respect any value for our privacy (neither the red light for DND on our door bell). How pity!",10
My girlfriend and I stayed here for our one night in Macao to experience the casino atmosphere.  Unbeknown to us this hotel is combined with several others all under one roof and is linked to The Venetian across the road via a flyover walkway. The hotel is designed so that you never need to leave the complex which is fine but not what we were looking for. The gambling arena and shopping facilities at The Venetian are pretty good but I felt that we were on the outskirts of the action. We got a cab to the MGM grand at night and visited The Wynn and The Grand Lisboa. This seemed much more central and where the action was at.  Notwithstanding the above the rooms were very nice and the hotel itself fine enough with plenty of good eateries to choose from. There was also a free shuttle‚Ä¶,30
"We ordered and extra bed and blankets for our room. Someone came in 20 minutes and brought the blankets but no bed. When we called the front desk and asked where the bed was they said we first needed to pay at the front desk. They could not just charge the room. When we wanted to use the internet...same story, come to the front desk and pay for it first. When we wanted to have a coke from the mini bar it was locked. Guess what they said?? Come to the front desk first to pay for it first. All the food was high priced Asian crap except for Bene. The problem with Bene was the hair I found. ",10
"To start with: while the rooms are nice, the location is just wrong. Construction sides all around, and a rather poor casino in the complex. Rather recommend to stay in Galaxy (much nicer inside) or better stay on Macau side which is more authentic and less clinical. If you go for Sheraton, upgrade to a lounge room, the premium is worth it. ",30
"Whereas the room itself was fairly modern and tidy, got few points to note -  1) There are areas in the pool side which are full of exhaust gas smell from the adjacent kitchen(?), which brings cooked burned oil smell in the pool area. Fairly unpleasant - we ended up changing our seats twice before found a spot where there is no ventilation noise or smell. Just poor design really.  2) It was a slow service to order food to pool area, drinks took borderline 15minutes and pool snacks about 40 minutes. Suggest bring your own drinks & snacks.. easier. There's a McDonalds nearby :)  3) Wi-Fi connection non-existent to poor - tried and tested in the room and also on the pool side. Perhaps cable connection is better (provided in the room too).  4) Overflow of rubbish along the hotel‚Ä¶",20
I have been to Macao for business conference and got a chance to stay in Shreaton Cotai Central. Checkin formality was managed by our company event management team hence that was okay.  Pro: Rooms are good with all the basic facility provided within the room. / Size of the room is also big enough good space. / Bathroom is also very big and good. Cons: Staff is not well aware on the English. / Almost no option for Vegi like me. / Very difficult to get in to room being a very big hotel and confusing ways. Do think twice before visiting with family. be ready to walk a lot within the hotel itself.   Overall its a mix experience to me. did not find cool feeling.,30
"With the Sheraton name you expect a little more from a Casino resort. As soon as you walk in the hotel is confusing. The SPG check in area has no ramp access from the front so if you have alot of luggage that's going to be an inconvenience. The woman at the check in counter lost our initial reservation and tried to make up for it by offering free wifi. In reality my entire hotel floor has free wifi. Laptop connection is just fine however, it will kick you off after 5 min for inactivity on a wireless device fyi. I would have rather paid for  my own access to avoid this.

Our room was utilitarian compared to other five-star hotels. The breakfast buffet (included) was the best feature, we felt.

We took the shuttle bus from the Macau Ferry Terminal and were very impressed with how easy it was to get to the hotel and check in.  I'd booked through an online site and on arrival was informed that neither breakfast or WiFi was included in the booking, but that I could add this for a cost as an SPG member, which I did.

The rooms are clean enough, but lacks that opulence that one searches for the extra detail which made you feel that ""thoughts been put in to make the guest as comfortable as practicable"". I'm not rubbishing their affair, but it is just a bit lackluster.  Rooms are acceptable size, not cramped, but lack the touches that make it a true 5 star hotel. ie: lack of fruits/paper/refillable‚Ä¶",30
"May be it was due to the high season, we found the service level not on par with other 5 star hotels in the area.  As SPG member I got to check in at the special SPG counter which was nice, but the lady who served us seemed inexperienced and it took awhile for her to confirm our room and details.  Most of the other staff we met throughout our stay seemed cold and never greeted us.    We did enjoy our first stay at this hotel though.  The location is convenient with easy access to shuttles and taxis.  There's a covered footbridge which leads to the Venetian complex too. The casino is relatively new and the staff there was professional.  We got a deluxe room which was large enough (especially the bathroom) and the bed was quite comfortable.  However just as I was looking forward‚Ä¶",30
"A bit disappointed with the room! We had two joining rooms, to my surprise, I think the hotel was opened a year ago, the carpet in one of the rooms was torn and the door locks already looked tired!  The lobby was so busy that you would not like to sit at their lounge for a cup of tea!  Staff are very polite and helpful!",30
"We recently visited the Sheaton Macao hotel.  I found the hotel to be too big and confusing for people travelling with kids.  We are SPG members so we checked in at the SPG counters.  We were the first in line, but waited at least one hour before the room keys were handed to us.  It's a long walk to the swimming pool and to restaurants.  We visited in the second week of December and the swimming pools were too small for the number of rooms and guests at the hotel.  I will only stay at Mandarin Oriental Macau if I go back and visit Macau again.",30
"I find this hotel very confusing to commute around... Though it's confusing to go between the 2 towers, it's a nice hotel to do shopping and restaurants... too many options to choose... too difficult to find the right choice... I presume Macau is like that too short at the same time too confusing... keep surrounding the same place time again...",30
"The third time checking in this Hotel,  Funny issue no. (1) :check in and check out still a problem. It was a bit better in the SPG special area but should still be expected to wait for 4-5 guests before your turn, which means at least 30 mins. Staffs are polite and tried to be helpful, but as some other viewers said, they are very busy with their computer keyboards, I had no idea why they need to type so much items. Funny issue no. (2) :staff like to tell you that as they got more than 2000 rooms, guests are expected to wait in various areas, says, lift, breakfast, room service, even your call to the front desk. This "" We are a huge hotel with over 2000 rooms "" was heard most during my single night visit. Funny issue no. (3): No matter how Non-chinese looking you are, hotel‚Ä¶",30
"I am a passive and lazy reviewer, but if I write, it must be either superbe or shameful. And this time is the latter.  The experience is so bad that should warrant the attention of a Sheraton management who better cares enough about the hotel's reputation, especially when it can cause dishonest sales and promotion.  We spent a bit more for the Club Lounge package under which guests are supposed to be entitled to a series of benefits including breakfast at the lounge, late check out, welcome drinks / food, a higher floor room etc.. Freebies aside, I assume a hotel should understand that guests spend extra with a purpose - to have a relaxing, less disturbed stay. But the truth is we suffered more than what we paid.  We couldn't get a seat at the Lounge during breakfast time two‚Ä¶",10
"With almost 4,000 rooms, the hotel is expected to be busy during our visit from 19-21 Dec 13 with my husband and 4-year old child. Arrived via ferry direct from HK airport. Took a quick 15 min cab ride, costing ~ USD 10 though there are free shuttle buses to hotels in the Sands Cotai area (Conrad Macao, Holiday Inn Macao, Sheraton).  Service Check-in was relatively queue free but the reception basically lied and gave us a room with 2 beds instead of a king sized bed on a smoking floor even he specifically told us that our request isn't a problem. Thank goodness we got to change to the room we wanted but it was unnecessary and extra work for no reason. Take note Sheraton!!  As expected, breakfast line was long at even 10am but it was breezy and service was speedy.   Room Dingy‚Ä¶",30
"I went there early this month(december), and was surprised. It is the worst hotel i have ever visited. First, let me tell you about my check inn experience, the lady at the desk was so rude she refused to even pass a smile and welcome. I told her it was our first wedding anniversay and she did not even bother to wish us. Secondly, the whole place is such a mess..so many people everywhere and no one is managing the crowd. Thirdly, the hotel staff is super rude, each time i went to their casino i was asked to show my passport,even after telling them i am staying there, they did not bother. Forth, every morning we had to stand in a queue for breakfast outside their restaurant. that was disgusting. i mean a five star treating you like this ????? Fifth, the room service was utterly‚Ä¶",20
"Sheraton Macau is a mess with no system / no character what so ever. They are so big that they cannot handle it. Lets start with checkin. It is nightmare, if you are not SPG you have to stand in a really big queue. I was staying in a club room, and I could have checked in the club lounge, however, there was security on the ground floor who was very rude and did not allow me to go up and did not speak English, thus had to checkin in a big queue.  In club I had made request for some special meal requirements, which was duly acknowledged, however when I went for first day during evening hours, my request was not fulfilled, and rather it became very embarrassing for me. After some harsh exchange of words, they treated me well for next 2 days. On last day in breakfast the same story‚Ä¶",20
"To be fair, the hotel was nice, the rooms were nice and very clean. But my experience with Sheraton was scarred by my checking in and checking out process.  First, I got an email in September to thank me for staying with Sheraton Macao and I was in shock. Did I book the wrong date? So I wrote to them and after two emails, it was due to a lapse in their system and they mistook another Audrey for me. So I tot the episode is over. But in December, when I checked in at the counter... the same boo-boo happened. The staff took very long to verify all my details and it was not a smooth check in. The next day, when we checked out, I was not able to get back my 1000HKD deposit. The staff insisted that I havent given any cash deposit and refused to give the deposit to me. It was a‚Ä¶",20
It was my first leg of a week long vacation. The room size is considerably large and loads of amenities that are linked between hotels. Many free shuttle buses to take. I only wished that info is more made available to tourists once we step out of the ferry terminal.   Travel to the tourist attractions are mostly free and getting around is not difficult.,30
"Honestly, we didn't really enjoy the Cotai strip at all, shopping and gambling isn't our sort of holiday - we only went for one night to have a look around Cotai but really just to have access to old town Macau. Everything on Cotai is completely soul-less, distances to get anywhere are huge because everything has been built on a seriously large scale; maybe that helps with the volume of guests in high season - but I can only imagine it would be a horrendous place to be if everywhere was full. Off season, it was just like walking around a big almost empty shopping mall. Nothing new for casinos but they all seem to allow smoking which is just downright unpleasant for non-smokers like us, so we didn't stop to spend in any of them.",30
"Spent two nights there as a weekend break to see the Taboo show as all other hotels nearby were fully booked for the boxing fight. Hotel rooms are nice enough and service is ok. Swimming pool and gym are hard to find if ok. However the lobby lost in the casino with throngs of people checking in and out at all times, smoking cigarettes inside and the rest, plus the very confusing layout of the ground floor and the long queues at breakfast are NOT ok for a 4 star hotel. Thank god we had the SPG card so had some advantages and took refuge in City of Dreams across the road . Would not stay here again ...",30
"18/11 checked in and front desk staff told me to show my credit card for deposit guarantee. I have never signed any slip with my credit card.  Then checked out next day at express check out counter. The staff just asked me if the minibar was used. She did not tell me there was already a chargeable bill to my room.   When I got back to HK, I found there was a bill of HK$380.59 charged to my credit card by Sheraton Macao. I was absolutely amazed and wondered how my credit card can be used w/o my authorised signature. My card issuing bank suggested this might be a criminal fraud!

We turned around and had to find out that just behind us they were spraying the plans with chemicals. Despite the very bad smell they were not able to tell us with what kind of chemicals we have been sprayed, we've just been informed that it's 'fertilizer'. This is absolutely not acceptable!!! A decent hotel management should be aware that the Club Lounge is open until 22:00 and therefore no chemical treatment should be done before 22:30.  But I'm honestly not very surprised about such a mismanagement at this hotel: after check in we came to our room and saw a lot of long black hair on the carpet and on the‚Ä¶",10
"Despite the hotel and rooms being very nice, the food served at the pool cafe was by far the worst meal we have experienced in Asia. The menu only has 6 items and we ordered 3 of them so it is fair to say that we had a fair representation of what was on offer. The salads were caked in mayo and the 3 sandwiches we ordered were bordering on inedible. All deep fried till they were like rubber, on rock hard bread, and again covered in mayo. Unbelievably disappointing, we won't be back ",10
"I found the location to be an issue. This hotel is based on a small strip with some other hotels (Venetian, Holiday Inn etc.). It is far away from the main strip with the really good/fun/well-established hotels (eg. Grand Lisboa/MGM Grand/Wynn). You need to get a taxi or shuttle bus to get to the other area. The shuttle buses stop running at 11pm.  I found the choice of restaurants and bars limited and mediocre in and around the Sheraton. There was only one bar open after midnight in the hotel, and I was charged more for a Tsing Tao there than anywhere else on my week long trip to HK/Macau. The room was comfortable and quiet. The breakfast was good - a very wide range of options. I was staying again I would stay in the central area of Macau. You have not only a much, much better‚Ä¶",30
"It was my second time staying in this hotel and would be my last time. I have no complain on the hardware there but the staff were below the average. 1. There were more than 10 used towels left on the floor of changing room of swimming pool.   2. The staff in the restuarant have no intention to give way to you for breakfast but cut your way.  My table was next to their cupboard  and one of them placed the whole tray of folks and spoons on my table before they put them back to drawer. 3. I used the express checkout and wrote down my email address for official receipt but i could get it after 2 weeks.  I chased for SPG for another 2 weeks without any action done, until i gave up and went to Macau again.  I got it in person and SPG communciation sent me the receipt on the same day.‚Ä¶",20

Not a good place. Concierge is always busy to pick up the phone. Casino dealers cannot speak a word of English and don't follow requests appropriately. This hotel has a long way to go to meet international standard of a quality hotel. Room seems like it was renovated in the 90s.,10

During the check-in, there's no SPG line, no matter whats your grading is, and there's loads of people at check in, and whatever we asked the staff at check-in, he wasn't quite listening.   Sheraton featured the 3 impressive outdoor swimming pools, that 2 of them are warm as 28 degree. However, we found out that the 3 impressive outdoor swimming pools are split into smaller pools, like the one on 8th floor is split into 4 small pools, and on 4th floor, split into alot of pools....... and out of the pools, only 2 small pools are warmed, which is very disappointing.

The room rate per night is quite expensive, about HK$1,600 including tax without breakfast and it's already a promotional rate. OK, it's like other 5 star hotels in Macao, they have a nice & big lobby area and the shopping mall is connected to Conrad and Holiday Inn. Of course, there's a casino down there too.

After 5 min waiting at the lobby, the staff informed us that payment was validated and we can drag back our luggage back to our room. This was really ridiculous and we were really unhappy about that.

Usually we stay at the Westin as it still is (even though a bit outdated) a very nice family oriented beach resort.

Once we checked in, I was welcomed by a nice german manager to the ""world biggest sheraton"" Well, when I heard that I was a little bit concerned.

Hotel/Room: A new hotel in Macau equipped with comprehensive room facilities. Room is clean and tidy Easy to access by taking free Shuttle Bus nearby Pier. Hotel provides free breakfast. I must to say that the food provided satisfied different people from different nationality. Good Job!  The hotel is too crowded. Everywhere is people. No matter doing check in/check out.,30

We had to take our luggage to our rooms personally, no porter service was provided. The bathroom was extraordinary excellent and had shower in it with wall as well as hand... which is quite comfortable and missing in many other hotels. Hotel is quite big and have good ambience.",30
"I had a very brief stay at Macau and was very disappointed at the service provided by the hotel. The room facility was barely a three-star, though the hotel claimed that it is a 4.5 star... This asides, my biggest issue is with their concierge. The staffs were not helpful at all when I asked to purchase boat tickets to get to HK airport. They were very stubborn and suggested me take the shuttle 2 hours before the boat departure time. I questioned whether I needed to prepare that much time in advance, but she insisted. I took her advice and waited at the port for 1.5 hours...  I think they should provide more realistic suggestion to tourists as it's their job to provide guests with a good travel experience. Maybe it is just Macau style, but I am very unhappy about the stay there.",20
"We stayed here for one night so we could see a show. Location was good. We were offered an upgrade for the room and breakfast included. The room itself was very good but hotel guests obviously don't look out of the window! The view was over a lot of building rubble! The breakfast was, in a word - terrible! We ended up going out to a coffee shop. If you want to go to the casino and see a show then the hotel is fine abd rhe front desk staff tried to be very helpful. Just don't  have breakfast! ",30
A nice and clean hotel but possibly not 5 star. It's felt like a 1km walk from the coach drop off to the reception desk and another 1km walk to the room. Maybe OK if you have no luggage but exhausting with three cases. The room view on the upper floors over Cotai Strip are fantastic. The check in at 3pm and check out at 11am make this hotel a sleep place only if staying one day. The Italian restaurant on the ground floor has great food and wine at reasonable prices.,30
"We stayed in this hotel for vacation during the summer. Some points that people may consider before making the choice:  1) Very small and crowded swimming pool.  2) No lifeguard on duty at the swimming pool. This is stated on the stainless steel signage in the swimming pool area.   3) we have complimentary buffet breakfast provided at G/F restaurant. However, there was too many people queuing up even at 10:10am ( the breakfast time will end at 10:30 am), we were led by the restaurant manager to have breakfast at 4/F function room. No need to queue up there, but the variety of food choice are much less than the ordinary restaurant .  4) The hotel room is cozy and clean. The bed is also comfortable.",30
"The hotel was packed when I arrived. The check in queue snaked all over the reception area. Since I had booked the club room I hoped to skip this queue and check in at the club level. Advice given by the staff was confusing. They have two towers and the staff who told me the floor failed to mention this. Of course I had to go to the wrong tower and it took quite a while to get to the club floor, lugging my big suitcase too.  Checking in at the club floor took quite a while. Soft drinks were available but no hot drinks! I was told hot drinks would only be available from 11 o'clock. I think this is the first time a club lounge offers no hot drinks outside scheduled time.  After checking in, there was no one to show me to the lifts to my room. Again I had to lugged my bag around‚Ä¶",30
first impression was poor with the hotel check in being a mere 5 metres from the casino floor and the smell of smoke was very strong coming from the gaming area. If you're not coming to Macau to gamble i would suggest to choose somewhere other than here. On the plus side even the standard rooms are massive and the beds are super comfortable and with the complete blackout curtains and soundproof walls it was easy to get a peaceful nights sleep. Try to request a view overlooking Cotai as the view at the back of the hotel overlooks a desolate swamp and is a little depressing. Also be mindful there are limited good western food options outside of the set breakfast/lunch/dinner times.,20
"This Hotel is decorated in 'Earth'  tones, which has been fashionable in the hotel industry in the last few years.  All that brown makes the hotel very dull looking and it would seem contributes to the  bored looks on the face of the staff.

My friend thought that her massage at the Spa was excellent  We were on a one night package, in a standard room. Very average. I would not visit again",30
"First off, when you walk in, all you smell is cigarettes. It's ok to smoke in the casinos and the casino is the forefront if the lobby. The lobby feels tiny because it wraps around the casino.   It's hard to find where to enter to check in. Hoards of other mainland chinese block the entrance to the check I'm entrance. There was a worker standing there and could see I was looking for something but completely ignored me. The front desk check in was easy and painless. When I asked about wifi in the room, they said pay $30 an hour or you can have it for the whole day for $120. That was a huge disappointment.   The next morning we awoke to a tiny dead cockroach on our sheets. I was furious. When I brought it up to the staff, they said it happens and would gladly switch rooms for us.‚Ä¶",10

As I was told it will be fixed soon right after I left the room. Not to mention the bathroom was extremely fun and modern. A nice bathroom that we had, only cons is there isn't any hot water when we are getting our  shower.

The Sheraton is sadly poorly organized with unmotivated staff and lack of basic training. Maybe it's the gambling environment that makes all staff so disinterested and slow to act.   A very disappointing experience for the normally fabulous Sheraton chain,30

I know, I know it's free, included with the room so I shouldn't complain, what can you expect from a free service. Well, I expect better.  I travel a lot and normally stay at a competing chain's hotels but they don't have a property in Macao yet. So, I booked at Sheraton expecting similar level of service.   The problem was just a lack of choices. They had waffles but only syrup for toppings, limited breads & salad choices and the bacon looked like a pile of undercooked soggy noodles. Bacon should be crispy for heaven's sake!  I ate a plate of fruit and left. This morning I chose to skip it altogether. For me the breakfast‚Ä¶",30

In addition, I stayed with my room for 2 nights, however, the housekeeping rang the room bell twice to wake me up at 10:00 a.m. on the 1st morning for cleaning up, a 2-star service?

"We were very excited about the DreamWorks holiday advertised and booked a family suite and unluckily, the weather was stormy and we arrived during Typhoon 8. While the hotel was not responsible for the weather, the entire experience was far below average and where do I start?   The room was fun for the kids but that was about the only good thing about this entire stay. Service was dismal and everywhere, staff seemed reluctant to help, disinterested and overworked. Towels and amenities were not replenished daily; one day we were missing hand towels, another day, there was no bath mat.   We have family holidays in Macau often and we usually stay at the Galaxy. After this experience, we will steer clear of Cotai. I never appreciated the design, layout and service at Galaxy as much‚Ä¶",20
"Having stayed in Macau numerous times, I can say that this hotel falls short. This hotel opened up less than a year ago so the standards should be high being that Macau is continuously growing becoming more competitive.   First off, I was put off by the fact that the wifi here is not free. Free in the lobby but you have to pay in the rooms. $30 an hour or $120 a day. Quite ridiculous. So needless to say, it looks like waves of hoarders in the lobby. They sit wherever there is room to, which is already limited, with their faces glued to their phones taking advantage of the free wifi. So no sitting room in the hotel. This leads to the next turn off:  The lobby is set up oddly. The casino is dead center so the rest of the hotel sort of wraps around it, leaving a narrow walkway that‚Ä¶",30
"the hotel offers quite decent value for money, although do not take the club lounge benefits, as there are no benefits and really not worth the extra money.   rooms are decent size, clean and has all you need for a couple of nights.  The hotel is part of the Sands Cotai complex and it's easy to walk around and get to adjacent City of Dreams and Venetian / Four Seasons.   There is a casino in the hotel which is pretty average too.   It was August and must have been peak season school holidays - the place was so busy with huge tour groups and kids everywhere.  Breakfast was a real free for all and due to the amount of people, a lot of the dishes were quite often empty.  Worst egg chef I've come across.  Food is very average to say the least.",30
"Extract from Sheraton Macao website: ""For adults wanting a break from the cheery chirping of children, the tranquil Tiki Pool is the place to go. The adults-only pool is bordered by sun lounges and 18 private cabanas with fans and daybeds and peers spectacularly over the buzzing Cotai Strip.

We just checked out today.Our Room no.23139. in earth building.There are some truth experiences happened to us for your refrence, you have to know before you stay. 1.First, the check in service is very slowly, according the hotel manager speaking, there are more than 3000 guests live in high season, they cannot help about it. According my understanding, as a five stars hotel, it is NOT a reason to make your customer keep in line for 20-30 min. 2.There are bag carrier services after check in, but not for all the people due to many guests. I thought it is basic service for a Sheaton standard. 3.The bed is too‚Ä¶",20
"You stayed at the family suite with 2 young children while they have the big summer Dreamworks promotion. The rooms are perfect for families, it has bunk bed, tv and games. Kids enjoyed it a lot. When we arrived, front desk staff accommodated us with early check in. Front desk staff needs to be more familiar with the own promotion package. I was missing free wifi, qube tickets and breakfast for the children. Their also comes with a welcome packet for kids. Unfortunately, they kept telling me only one per room. I have 2 kids, are they supposed to fight for it? After I talked to the staff on the phone, they sent another staff to bring us another welcome packet and qube tickets.  I asked the about the activities for kids when they gave me the promotion card. It was very confusing.‚Ä¶",30
"Hotel is clean and modern, very convenient sitting amongst the Sand's Cotai complex. Shops, restaurants and of course, the casino.  It is a big hotel, and span's across two towers. Check-in was slow, as an SPG member since 1999, it was the first time I had to wait 15 mins in queue to actually check in.  Arrived around 4 pm on a Friday, if that makes a difference.  They never tell you  that there are two lobbies to check in, which could have made it easier.  Also, the directions to your room are not clear, particularly if you come off the ferry bus at the back of the building you need to walk through the arcade for quite a distance to find the lift lobby.  My only negative feedback here is the breakfast, I was allocated to the Caspian Room on the 4th floor, which is a function‚Ä¶",30
"Spent a night with the Executive Suite which was nice, well-equipped and relaxing. NO argument on facilities and provisions as they are the first class.  However, services are the issues, especially for the club lounge and spa reception.  The club lounge is not that private as it is like a restaurant serving big crowd of people during breakfast and cocktail. Not the type of privacy you could find normally on a E Floor. The individual quality of staff there need improvement.  Spa treatment was good but the greetings of reception was poor. Time to improve.",30
"We booked this Hotel just for the family suite which included a child bed and wii. Overall, the Hotel is spectacular and the staff is awesome. There are 2 reasons why I would rate this Hotel average and not excellent:  1. Had a very bad time getting to the Hotel. Once you get out of the ferry terminal, you can see signs and people from almost every Hotel in Macau. What you could not see is a sign of Hotel Sheraton. Carrying luggage up and down to find the right shuttle was a real pain. The management should do something about this.  2. Bars and Restaurants are not open late night. We came back at around 2 AM after watching the IIFA awards and we could not find a place to eat. Restaurants in the casino are open till late but not for 24 hours. Very difficult to have a quick snack‚Ä¶",30
"At the time of writing this review, after midnight, a pool side private party in the Sheraton still continue and the noisy music keep my family, staying on the 17th floor, awake including my eight months old baby.  so this is the behaviour of Sheraton which sacrifices the interest of its guest and could not offer them a good night sleep.",10
"Built as part of Sand's latest Cotai Central property, this place will sure awe it's guests at first glance. Tropical lobby and luxury conference/expo facilities. Being a Macau resort, luxury furnishing and deluxe amenities are expected and are delivered at this hotel.  This place takes loyalty very seriously, they have a mezzanine lobby, just for its SPG members, they get a special keycard and personalised welcome. And of course, their casino VIPs get the same.  Having stayed at this hotel quite a few times, I understand how some reviewers experienced a 5 star stay and some who would have regretted their choices. It all depends on the staff you meet, they can become very inconsistent. When it's busy and lots of casino guests are checking in, you may be greeted by staff with an‚Ä¶",30

Upon check in, i was referred to their normal check in counter to wait for my turn even i was SPG member. (the staff told me ""it was the same""). For your information, the Starwood Preferred Guest check-in counter has nice sofa and complimentary drink for our partner or family to sit down comfortably while waiting for check in procedure to complete.

Breakfast is included in the package, but we did not eat in, so could not comment on in.",30
"Family of two adults and two young kids stayed for one night. Big hotel in cotai area close to other hotels and casinos.   Seems that Sheraton pools were all closed except for one small pool. Not good. Kids wanted to swim but it was just too crowded which takes away from the enjoyment.   For a weeknight we paid quite a bit. Could have gotten room at larger Venetian.  Rooms clean, ok size.  but no wifi. A bit strange for new 5 star hotel.   Unless prices come down, we will stay at other places in cotai next time. ",30
"First time to Macao so wasn't really sure what to expect. Chose the Sheraton as the deals they were offering at the time made them around 30% cheaper than any of the other hotels. Situated on the Cotai side, it's still only a 15 minute ride by taxi over to where the Wynn, etc are all located, but being on the Cotai side it's 5 min from Macau Airport and the Tapai Ferry terminals as well as Caesars Golf Club. It's also connected by a walk bridge over to the Venetian.  Living in Singapore, so used to Marina Bay Sands and also having done Vegas a few times, the Sheraton is like a mini cut down version of any of the big hotels on the Vegas strip. First things first, it's not overly busy so check in and check out is nice and easy and you avoid the usual 'Vegas-esque' queues.‚Ä¶",30
Visited the premises on a business trip. My hosts booked me into this one since it was the closest to the Venetian which was our daily meeting point. Walked into the room where to my horror the wall that separates the bed from the bathroom was covered in spit. The rest of the room was quite dirty but the bathroom looked fresh. I immediately informed them and they came to clean it. For my 4 day stay they changed the towels but never really cleaned again. NO WIFI in rooms and even if you want to pay its only available on LAN. Ridiculous if your on business just with a smartphone. The lobby offers free wifi but with the casino attracting hundreds of people at all times you have no internet and your phone bill will kill you.

I make every morning some exercises and yoga and doing that I have to lay down at the floor. Being in that position I looked around and saw the chair in front of the desk. And I saw the dust from the last weeks or even months! The chair was so dirty that I got a very bad impression about the cleanliness of this hotel. Talking to my chinese friends they told me that this is just normal in China but for a me used to the eurpean standard this is not acceptable.

"I have to be honest, I was not that impressed with the Sheraton Macau. Service was a bit slow....I requested a non smoking room, and the room REAKED of Cigar smoke. I called to complain from the lobby because even the phone was unhooked in the room. So they sent someone up 20 minutes later who also agreed that the rooms smelled like smoke. It was really nasty that they even put anyone in that room. Other than that, the rooms are typical Sheraton rooms, dont expect fast room service, the hotel is so large that it takes them forever just to bring ice. Location is pretty good since its right across the Venetian which I stayed at the month prior....I think if you can spend the money, go for the venetian, their smallest room is 75 sqm.

"The Sheraton itself is a largely anonymous hotel that shares a casino and shopping mall with the adjoining Conrad and Holiday Inn on the newly developed Cotai Strip...supposedly the Macao Vegas. The problem is, it has the buildings but zero atmosphere...something further exaggerated by the now ubiquitous designer shopping mall (I counted 4 Omega shops, 2 Dunhill stores and 4 IWCshops in 3 adjacent hotel / casino/ malls). As you can gather this review is as much coloured by the Macao strip as anything else. Where as Vegas has a unique character to it, Macao is soulless. The casino floors have no vibe and are often half empty. Clearly the move towards a smoking ban hasn't reached Macao yet and despite requesting and, after some negotiating, getting a non-smoking room, the‚Ä¶",30
"This was my first and probably the last time staying at the new Sheraton. I travelled with my friend for a girls weekend away and booked the Club Floor deal so we could get some peace and quiet. Sadly, this did not happen for us.   We were escorted to the Sky Tower Club Lounge..it was quiet a walk from the shuttle bus lobby...It is huge and looks like a restaurant bar more than a business lounge. One end is the dining area for bfast and cocktails and the other is a large relaxing space. In the middle is a smaller bar area where afternoon tea is served. We got checked in quickly by a friendly staff and our room was ready.   Our room was on a high floor but nothing special, it was just their standard room type. It was small compared to the Venetian and we were rather disappointed‚Ä¶",30
"The shuttle bus from Macau Ferry Terminal dropped me off at the east wing instead of the main lobby of Sheraton. When I walked in, I saw the big sign of SPG from the left hand side of general check-in counter. As there were a lot of non-SPG members, I asked the staff if there was any available staff dedicated to SPG customers. The staff told me that I would have to walk all the way to the main lobby.   When I walked towards to the main lobby, I found another SPG counter. Again there were no staff. I asked another hotel staff for help and he told me that the counter was closed as it was lunch time. But I had never seen any staff at that SPG counter during my stay. The same thing happened to another SPG counter near to the Earth Tower. The only available SPG counter was in the‚Ä¶",30

We spent one night in the executive floor with club lounge facilities.  The hotel room was not too big and the decoration was just average.  The white paint on the washroom door fell off and made the room looked dated even though it should be quite a new hotel. We went to the lounge that had very dim light and it looked like a bar rather than a business lounge!   Both the cocktails and breakfast offered large varieties of food but the environment in the lounge was noisy and looked like a buffet restaurant!  The swimming pool was not big and was crowded with people!,30

However, after all this time, I am still regretting my decision to stay at the Sheraton Macau.   We chose this hotel over the Holiday Inn because as SPG members we have always been impressed with the high quality service from the Sheraton brand.   However, if I ever go back to Macau then I would definitely choose the Galaxy or the Holiday Inn over the Sheraton.

After many painful discussions with the Sheraton they were unwilling to refund our additional night. We weren‚Äôt happy but ok with this especially since we‚Ä¶",20

As a Platinum SPG member, I was upgraded from my standard room to a Deluxe Suite that approached 1000 feet, with a media room, full living room, and enormous bathroom. Suite upgrades, from what I can tell, are far from uncommon, and the materials in these rooms are literally shiny and new. Everything is glossy and modern. These are some of the best rooms you'll see within the Sheraton system.

Both times we went to the club lounge we had to queue up for tables and the staff were rushing around trying to seat people. Tables were cluttered with dishes and they were under staffed, lining up beside the toilets was not pleasant.

The facilities are all very good. The bed is extremely comortable and I slept very well both nights we were there. The bathroom was large and had all of the essential facilties.

We got rooms on the 13th floor and on the side facing the pool which looked to be on the 10th level or so.  Beware though of rooms 1333 upwards as the view is not directly of the pool but of the power generators etc on the roof top next to the pool.

It was very comfortable but the decor was really tacky. Service was not bad, especially when you think of the sheer number of guests that they must have.

Indeed, it was kind of confusing upon arrival at the hotel. We didnt know which reception area we are supposed to check in. There were a lot of guests in the lobby and at the same time, hotel staff guiding first time guests. It was not a breeze during check in time. And it was a relief when we were done with the check in...there was no waiting area for family's who wait to be checked in.

I can confidently tell you that all three hotel buildings were built by the same developer with very similar layout, perhaps a slightly different design and interior color scheme, so my tip is, check all three of them (Sheraton, Holiday Inn, and Conrad) and see which one gives you the best deal.

The deluxe suite was massive, would be a size of a 3 bedroom apartment in Sydney It had a separate powder room on entry. The living room and dining area was very spacious. A large flat screen TV was in living room, another TV room with fold out sofa and main bedroom with king size bed and‚Ä¶",30
"We enjoyed a well appointed Executive Suite - great space, comfy bed, fantastic view. For such a large hotel, the staff are well briefed on the hotels amenities + extremely polite & helpful. These are the highlights - the Club experience is the low point of the Sheraton. Having traveled extensively  and experienced many club floors the Sheraton needs to re-think how this is achieved in a 4000 room hotel. Space is odd - feels like a cafeteria, little natural light & uncomfortable furnishings - due to over crowding a ball room was pressed into service - food sub-par - staff overwhelmed with the hordes of guests. I have never had to queue behind 150+ people to get entry into a lounge - requested breakfast vouchers for the main restaurant Feast on both days - food is better here -‚Ä¶",20
"We booked an Executive Suite with Club Floor privileges.  The suite was very nice and well appointed, but that is where our happiness ended.   This hotel has 4,000 rooms so we thought a Club Floor would provide a more personal service and less crowds - we were soooo wrong.  The whole Sheraton Macao club experience was a disappointment.  The club lounge looks like a converted ball room, the food and  beverage service feels like a slightly upscale cafeteria. It was noisy not enough chairs, no service, and uncontrolled children running  around the lounge.  We couldn't even get into the lounge for breakfast, day 1 as it had a queue of 200 people (I am not exaggerating I counted them) waiting to be seated for breakfast... !   Day 2 was the same so we queued in the shorter queue in‚Ä¶",30
"When we booked the family suite we saw pictures on tripadvisor that included two bedrooms and a living room. When we checked in, alas it only contained two bedrooms with adjoining door. The check ins were very slow. Having say that, Nash Wong the receptionist had been very helpful trying to meet our expectations. Overall the front line needs to improve on its service, speed and communication. ",30
"The experience was memorable but in the negative sense. We were there for on Sunday (Dec 16) for 1 night stay with my in-laws & 2 sisters in laws & spouses. We were told at the check in at the regular 2pm check in time  that out rooms will not be ready until 4pm. That was a bit of shock but we let it go so went  out for snack & sight seeing. Once we got out rooms, we went to check it out. My in laws & sitters in law's rooms got to their respective rooms fine. For us, it was quite surprise when we found our room got luggage and underwear's hanging in the bathroom. So we called the front desk & they dispatched a customer service manager up to see us while we waited in our in law's room.  The Customer service manager asked us to check the room with her & the first word she said was‚Ä¶",20
"Staff is lack of experience; I was offered free local call & leave them the coupon when checking-in. However, I still have to clear those questions when I check-out.  Most staff cannot speak English or Cantonese, difficult to communicate.  When I was back to HK, I found out I was being ignored by the hotel. I check-in in the 4th floor (notify by email) for being SPG member & booked a Suite Room, I do not have Relationship staff/ manager to coach me to the Suite, I had to bring along all my entire luggage to the room which I was lost during my findings of the Suite. I bit confuse & anger. Also, I wasn‚Äôt told about the Club stuff, I need to ask them every questions like breakfast arrangement, of course they don‚Äôt even mentioned evening cocktail which I have totally missed during‚Ä¶",30
"Stayed in the twin bed room for a nite just before the christmas. Front line staff serving at the SPG counter are well trained, all my requests are being taken care of. Rooms are large comparing with the New Holiday Inn at the next block. However, only two tiny kids' dipping outdoor pools are available for guests, (a lot facilities are still not yet finish), while the ""heated"" water are too weak for winter's time;  construction noises could be heard in most of the areas includling your own guest room. Bene the Italian restuarant serves very good dishes in bargin price, and its unexpected quiet during lunch hours.",30
"We have booked (and paid through a single agency) for 3 rooms, 2 of which are for 2 nights and one is for one night.  Here is our bad experience with the counter staff.  Our check in took at least 10 to 15 minutes, the hotel staff was busy with the computer keyboard all the time until he finally figured out all the room numbers.  Normally, we expect this to take 5 minutes or less.  The hotel staff has also forgotten to give us the breakfast tickets which should be included in the package, fortunately we remembered to ask for that before leaving the counter.  However, later that day we discovered the key jackets for all 3 rooms wrote we need to check out the next morning.  When we returned to the counter for clarification, another hotel staff said such mistake may be because we‚Ä¶",30
"Everything I am going to share below is truly based on my feedback from the customer's perspective for a family with a child and I see that this hotel is very nicely built with malls connected but as a new hotel, there are a lot of areas for improvement.  I stayed the weekend before X'mas and my wife and I and my 2.5 year old came with a ferry from HK.  I am a SPG gold member. When we arrived at the ferry, we didn't see sign where the Sheraton shuttle was but no big deal and we found it at the end.  I had a luggage and a stroller while my wife was holding the kid.  There was no help offered by the staff to help with the luggage...ok...fine as I thought they might not be direct hotel staff.

"Sheraton Macau was recently opened for business, rooms were no doubt clean. The rooms were comfy with 2 double beds.  However, I find the location of the hotel a little too far from all other activities and attractions. Furthermore, there is no free wifi in the room, you have to pay for it. We were told their free shuttle service to Macau island starts about 11am, which is too late by my standard, would be better if it can be slightly early. Obviously from the above, their main aim is to try and make you stay in the casino and gamble the whole day. If gaming is not your aim, I suggest you get another hotel. I also found their pricing a little steep, at the price we paid, we probably could have gotten a better deal nearby.",30
"I booked 2 rooms at this hotel for me and my colleagues. However I came across a few questions and would like a respond from the actual hotel itself rather than the central res (1800 number) or Agoda (which is where I booked through).  My first attempt was to call the hotel's number +853 2880 2000. The phone keeps ringing and ringing, not even the promo message or what-so-ever. Totally not within the industry standard of ""answer within 3 rings"".  My second attempt was to call the central reservation 1800 073 535. I was assisted by a young lady, I asked her why is it impossible to get in contact with the hotel directly, which the lady laughs and said ""maybe they were too busy"". I asked whether free wifi comes with my booking, she told me Wifi is free only for certain room types,‚Ä¶",20
"Just stayed at sheraton for 4 nights - would not have commented at all about my negative impression - until finding out that I have been double charged for the stay (pre- paid, then charged the entire amount again in error after departure without my permission or signature or even invoice).  A few specific gripes: The service was mediocre - many staff did not speak English (including the waiter whom brought room service - but did not understand instructions when I was half dressed after a shower and needing some privacy. )  Wifi not included in room fee - had to be bought hourly/daily.  Even budget cafes have wifi - why can't this so called luxury hotel.  Full of non hotel staff soliciting and approaching you to sell services and accommodation at other hotels! - somewhat a‚Ä¶",20
"I was excited to try the new SPG property as Westin is just so old and so far away from everything. Spent one night over a weekend. Overall I would say it's quite standard - rooms, amenities, etc. Nothing wow as a brand new property.  Several things that bothered me:  1) Hotel is huge but the sign is not clear. 2) Sound proof - people and kids walking around. it was quite noisy inside the room. 3) Checkin line - waited for a while even as an elite member. Staffs need more training.  Good points:  1) SPG points 2) breakfast at SPG Club is good (but super crowded)  I think Holiday Inn nearby is for better value and Conrad might be more luxury - which makes Sheraton's position a bit awkward.",30
"Day 1- nothing in any of the material I had been sent indicated there was a shuttle bus from Ferry terminal to hotel. People from the Venetian Hotel graciously assisted, as not a sign, or person was in the arrival area to guide. Most major hotels had some form of information posted in arrivals area. - checked in Club level room, and 20 minutes later, 3 giggling young people walked in the room with no warning, knock or any notification while I was in the bathroom. ""Checking on water"" I was told. Nice room overlooking a construction site with pile drivers banking away most of the day.  Day 2- Long line up to the breakfast lounge on Club level. It was suggested I proceed to main restaurant where the food was said to be better, but at a $20+ cost. Room cleaned at 4:30pm Day 3 - It's‚Ä¶",30
"This is a HUGE hotel, presently approx. 3'000 rooms - of which 570 are CLUB rooms, soon upgrading to 6'000 rooms. And doe to this everything is huge and very, very crowded, the reception, the lobby, the ""Club Lounge"".  If you don't have any SPG tier - good luck, you'll wait. If you have Gold tier you'll wait some minutes. I do have Platinum tier with SPG so normally I would be entitled to check in at the Club Lounge. Sadly they told me this when I already went through the line at Gold tier check-in (even I told them that I do have Platinum status).  Okay, up to the lounge. Everything is huge, but missing style and flair. Just nothing has any style, just like the standard 3* US chain hotel.

"I have spent one night in this hotel and was really disappointed, the quality of the service and the organisation was poor for such a Hotel which pretends to have 5 stars. I had to wait an hour in the queue to check in then 20 minutes to get my bag at the concierge because they have lost it. When I finally get to my room the keycard was not working. The room was Ok, swimming pool was small and without any charm. Another issue, I had to pay for the breakfast which was included. I had to negotiate another 15 minutes to remove it from my bill (by the way the checkout took me 20 more minutes). It cost me 400.- USD for one night. Even a nice Palace is not that expensive. My recommendation is definitely‚Ä¶ do not go there‚Ä¶",10
"The hotel was just one-month-old when I visited there.  When the coach arrived at the doorway of this new hotel, I was impressed as it gave me a subtropical resort feel.  When we stepped in, dancers in Haiwaiian(?) costumes were performing.  Behind them was the casino.  The room is a standard one, yes, a very standard one.  All elements of a hotel room you would expect from a Sheraton group are all included, no surprise at all.  What bothered me was the lighting control.  Like many other hotel rooms, one cannot control all the lights from the bedside.  Service is good, the hardware is new at least.  Not very easy to get a cab, it takes time.  So you may want to remain in Taipa for most of the time.  Tried breakfast at Feast, no good.  If it is not included, I think you may give‚Ä¶",30

How can we ensure the hygiene of it? 2.There was only one used sheet in the memo pad. The housekeeping didn't notice and replace it. 3.There was a UNICEF ""check out for children"" promotion card but it was full of scribbles. The housekeeping didn't notice and replace it. 5.We stayed for 2 nights.

"Stayed one night on an SPG points and cash award. The hotel was nice but the service was problematic beginning with a door key that wouldn't open and ending with a 20 minute ""normal"" checkout. Also my wifi amenity didn't work and after 20 minutes trying to rectify it I gave up. In the 12 hours I spent in the hotel, I spent over an hour dealing with service related issues. Although I don't expect  service agents in another country to speak perfect English, the agents English skills were challenged anytime something went off script and made solving simple problems an ordeal. I trust these problems will iron themselves out over time but for now I give the hotel 3 stars for room quality but 1 star for service.

We would expect that the room would stay open for guests to sit around or use the internet, but I suppose you should all be going to the casino? The buffet breakfast looked good but there were flies in the seating area outside while the inside AC was freezing cold.

Then after checking in, no one to show where to catch the lift to room (spent a little time to find), then literally from lift to room took 2 minutes to walk to. Room was dusty and dimly lit (even when lights were all  on), no view from window (looks at a piece of construction land), toilet was basic and plastic bags were hard to open (for tooth paste and shower cap etc). Bathing amenities felt cheap. Slippers were also paper thin.  I found it particularly bad value with Sheraton's brand. Disappointed.",20
"Despite the more prestigious hotel brand name, this is fundamentally just a slightly nicer version of the Sands and Venetian hotels. Same fundamental approach. Ie Big, noisy, cookie cutter service. Rooms are bland and basic (we were already in the more expensive suits), amenties basic, no sense of real luxury. Strongly targeted for the mainland crowd. It wasn't that full and even then the SPG Lounge was not able to cater for us at Breakfast. The Spa was the only brighter spot, despite facilities not being finished, the treatment was quite good.",30
"There are so many hotels in Macau and it is very hard to be the best one.  Sheraton said this is the biggest hotel in the world.  I am not sure about this.  There are 2 towers (one is not open yet) but it doesn't seem like THAT big.  We've stayed at the executive suite for a night. We checked in at the club lounge.  Service is good but I think it takes a bit longer than I thought. The room itself is spacious.  The decor is very modern. Our room is facing the other tower but there's nothing much to see.  When you look down, you see the swimming pools plus a lot of big machines.  I don't really understand why they don't cover up those big machines at the podium level (same level as swimming pool).  50% of the room is looking at that and it doesn't seems like the best thing to see.‚Ä¶",30
"When we stay there, Sheraton just opened a week.  They really need to think about to improve to meet 5-star standard. Room - Nothing special, room space like other Macau hotel.

Pool area divided several small pool, you will not like it if you really want to swim! Club Lounge - Breakfast & happy hour at night is okay.  However, afternoon tea is really disappointed!!  Only prawn / fish / rice crackers & marsmallow everyday...no hot items nor petit cake!  They should consider to provide finger sandwiches / toasts! Casino - very small and not connected with Holiday Inn/Conrad one Food - only tried noodle in the food court.  It is okay but not much‚Ä¶",30
"Bottom Line: Would only recommend staying at this hotel if you get a very cheap packaged deal. Otherwise, it's definitely not 5 star quality yet, and still lacking in service. Besides the kind greetings in the lobby, ""hi and welcome"" the staff are not experienced enough in english, making it a very frustrating experience. Try asking anyone where the food court is, or how express checkout works, where the shuttle bus is, etc..  and you'll see a bunch of blank faces.   Cons:  - HORRIBLE view, despite being a SPG member. Got a view of the back of the hotel facing all the ventilation systems, pipes, you know what I mean etc.. That's what happens when you book a cheap promotional package. They give you the worst rooms. - Swimming pools are not all opened. The one that is open is‚Ä¶",20

Not luxurious and 5 star at all. It makes it a lot worse when I had paid $2861 HKD, equivalent to $366 USD, for it.. WiFI is unstable, on and off every 10-20 seconds. It was really frustrating! When I booked, the hotel was not opened yet, so no review was available. As Sheraton was a brand name and never stayed at one, I gave it a go believing it could not go too wrong with a five-star hotel. How wrong I was as the room was so ORDINARY! It definitely had turned me off the Sheraton brand forever.",10

Waited for 1/2 hour and very frustrating our special request were not noted down in the system with the staff accusing us of making it up until we showed her email which confirmed our request. Still unable to fulfill a simple request and unapologetic. Very impersonal service and staff seemed frustrated. Other staff encountered was ok, best customer service were the greeters at the lifts.

I paid almost double of the promotion price launched by the hotel for a regular twin room so that I can have 3 guests sharing and requested for an extra bed, but the hotel staff said the increased payment was only a deal between myself and Hotel.com, and I would need to pay additional fees for the extra bed.
