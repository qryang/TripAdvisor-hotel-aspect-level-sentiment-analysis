"We stayed for two nights. Minutes after we entered the suite right after check-in, a playing/sleeping tant with kid‚Äôs  amenities were delivered together with a handwritten card with our daughter‚Äôs name on and Princess Elsa‚Äôs image ( which she treasures like crazy during the stay, holding it to sleep, even after we checked out, believing that‚Äôs from Elsa saying ‚Äúlet‚Äôs have fun together‚Äù!) We had several room service and the experiences were all nice. Though it happened that some of the order taker were not so familiar with the wine by the glass list, and some items were out of stock, but the room service staff were very helpful to make it up, making sure the entire dinning experience was perfect.  The breakfast downstairs in the Ritz Carlton cafe was also good. We have dined there several times before, this time is as good as always.  Front desk service was efficient upon check in and check out, and there‚Äôs a little kids corner to entertain young kids while waiting, which is very useful! Housekeepers at evening were quite helpful too, being very friendly and thoughtful. Offered us the bath service by seeing us being tired from the day and brought us the lavender bath-bomb.  In general, it‚Äôs one of the top choices among so many hotels in the region. No matter the facilities or service. Highly recommend!‚Ä¶",50
"I seldom stay in Macau hotel but I chose Ritz Carlton to celebrate my birthday this year. And this choice did not disappoint me but WOW me!  All of the staff in Ritz Carlton Macau provides their excellent service. Especially the Duty Manager Antonio who arranged my room for me with birthday decorations and also welcome fruit prepared which totally enhanced my staying experience. Thank you so much for his sincerely preparation and arrangement.  Also Laura who assisted me for in room check in with professional etiquette in introducing the hotel facilities and room features. During the night time, your team also bring me the birthday cake with singing birthday song to me which was very impressed for the service. Last but not least during check out. Pedro also provided a warm farewell to me to make this birthday become unforgettable!    Oh! Also the crafted photo frame as my gift!  Definitely will come back!‚Ä¶",50
"Just wanna say ""BIG thanks"" for everything that RC team (Haruka and Kate) has prepared for my birthday and my family. My wife had booked a book at RC to celebrate my birthday, and we were just amazed for what the team has done - They knew that i was staying with a kid, so the first surprise we received when we got into the room was the RC signature kid's safari (kid's tent) along with kid's amenities; next were the birthday decoration and the arrangements (cake and chocolate, etc); last but the the least was a heartwarming gift - a handmade photo album with wishes from every team members, I was really so touched when seeing it.   Words just could not describe how much I appreciated your efforts, what you have done just blew me away.  Believed that there were already thousand of reviews that  talks about the hardware and software so I am not gonna talk about these here.  Good job and well done, thanks again RC team!‚Ä¶",50
"My stay at Ritz Carlton with my boyfriend was definitely the best experience ever. Ahead of the check-in, I got a warm greeting email from the team. After they knew this stay was for our anniversary celebration, they prepared a memory book with room decorations, chocolate cake, champagne etc. for us. We were definitely surprised by their arrangement, their great attentive services.   In particular I would like to highlight the memory book that they prepared, it has over 13 pages, lots of our photos and their hand-written warm messages. We loved it! This is by far the best hotel experience I've had.   Highly recommend this hotel for everyone!",50
"This was my first but undoubtedly the best staycation for me and my girlfriend. I was planning for a memorable anniversary celebration, and The Ritz Carlton Macau is definitely at the top of my list for a staycation. The location is perfect, the rooms are very well designed and appointed with fabulous, luxurious bathrooms and with an amazing view of the Grand Resort Deck. I would like to thank the Guest Relations Team, specially Melanie and Laura, they stayed connected with me prior to our arrival in preparing the whole celebration details for me and my girlfriend including a delicious cake, champagne and even Ritz Carlton lion plush embroidered with our names ! I was blown away by their level of care and customer service. And what made it extra memorable was the level of care given by the Guest Services Supervisor Rev, he truly went above and beyond and took such good care of us during the whole stay. I was planning to decorate the room by myself while my girlfriend was enjoying the hotel facilities and Rev just offered to help me with the decorations.. and guess what? it turned out better than expected!! His outstanding service and attention to details really made this wonderful holiday memorable. It's been a wonderful experience celebrating this special day of our life in your hotel. Looking forward to be back soon!‚Ä¶",50
"Excellent service, big room with very nice view, splendid swimming pool.  Every service I encountered was done professionally.  The only thing I felt weird was when delivering the newspaper in the morning, the staff rang the bell or notify me, which I though he could just put quietly at the door. ",50
"Check-in and check-out were really efficient  Staff in general are really polite and friendly.   Room - size is really good. The room was really beautiful and elegant.   Facilities- the indoor pool is really great during winter. There are sauna and jacuzzi in the changing room. The gym is well-equipped too.   The only thing one may criticize is its location for not being that close to Galaxy and Venetian. As a non gambler, it fits me really well. Actually the hotel itself has a casino.   ",50
Had a relaxing stay at the waterfront king room. the panoramic view was perfect overlooking the macau/taipa bridge especially at night. The room was larger compared to most hotel rooms in Macau. The pool and the service were excellent! Front office staff were nice and informative. would definitely return ,50
I would like to say thank you to the whole Altira team as they made an excellent job in making their guests meet beyond their every expectations even at this time.  To Michael from Front Office who surprised me with the customized luggage tag. Thank You! No wonder Altira is a Forbes 5 Star Hotel. Excellent staff like him deserves to be appreciated. Thank you for being kind and approachable   The the one from In room dining who arrange my breakfast (sorry I didn‚Äôt get your name) Thank you for your excellent service!   To Bella also from front office who arranged my check out Thank you for your patience as I have so many questions.   ,50
"All staff and section customer service is quite good, so could enjoy hotel very much, especially guest service group is very polite and follow up is quite immediate and nice made me very satisfied , and All Concierge Team staff is quite polite and friendly and addressed me by name is quite good service and made me very happy!!",50
"The room is very spacious with living area, bed area, closet and the bath room is amazing. As I was visiting in December, weather is chill for swimming. But with indoor swimming pool, I can still enjoy it. A minor disappointment for me is that, the casino has only 1 type of game with table, Baccarat, other games like roulettes has machine game only. The hotel has shuttle bus to go to other area in Taipa, please check with the hotel.",50
"Thank you to all the staff at Altira for their help and understanding as a marathon runner competing in the Macau International Marathon. Everyone was very supportive from luggage storage, check in, room service and check out.  I felt this was a far nicer overall experience than my previous stay a few years prior.  To aid my recovery after the race, I appreciated the large bath and bath salts and the use of the gym for stretching as well as the indoor pool.  I look forward to staying again. ",50
Every staff was very kind and helpful. The room condition was very good and I liked the bath tub. The breakfast was really nice and I really enjoyed my stay in Altira. Would be my no.1 choice when I revisit Macau.,50
"The hotel situated in the heart of Taipa which is an ideal place if you want somewhere far from the casino area. The hotel itself is amazing and every single staff is very professional and well-trained.   We stayed here to celebrate our anniversary the only drawback is that the hotel only offers special amenities to those who come for birthday or honeymoon only. Somehow we think that it might not be fair to those who really come for real anniversary.  However, the hardware of this hotel (i.e the room view) ‚Äúcompensated‚Äù and we ended up having a very pleasant stay.  The room is spacious enough and the view is one of the best in Macao I am sure. A big window with the Macao Peninsula view. I will suggest travellers to order breakfast in room, what can you ask for to start your‚Ä¶",50
"Sublime!   If I had to think of words to describe the Altira and the wonderful staff who do such an incredible job, it would be:   Awesome,  terrific, jaw dropping,  serenity,  sheer beauty, glorious,  pure luxury.... I could really go on! ü§óüòç  This is the best hotel I have ever stayed at in my life!   The service is outstanding. The facilities in the pool and spa are mesmerising.  The Restore massage was absolutely pure heaven!  Orpha,  the masseuse,  was brilliant.  She made me feel like a Queen.  This is the best massage I have ever had.  She gave me a foot scrub before the massage which is a lovely touch. Their ginger tea is divine.  They have luxurious treatment rooms with your own personal Jacuzzi,  a king size bed for relaxing on,  a rain shower along with side shower‚Ä¶",50
"We reserved breakfast package, but we did not receive any requests for breakfast, and we called directly. and we woke up at 4 a.m. in the bathroom, and we woke up and saw the sound when next-door customer was using shower in the next room, so I couldn't sleep until the sound stopped.",50
"From arrival, bell man was very kind to us. He was a Filipino. The FOA was very friendly too. The room service waiter was a Filipino too and was very kind and friendly. Room was very spacious. I had the king size bed with living room and a huge bathroom with separate bath tub and toilet and shower. The bathroom had a small tv where you can watch while dipping in the tub. In room dining has a large serving good for 2 persons. Great hotel, great service! :)",50
"The hotel has excellent views over the sea. There is a great choice of restaurants both inside and outside the hotel, and the fitness centre is outstanding.The staff are friendly and professional. My room was very quiet and services were prompt, courteous and efficient. Luxury indeed!",50
"We say FIRST IMPRESSION only happens once. ATIRA MACAU makes first impression a lasting impression.  I checked in at 7:30 pm in the evening, quite tired but happy to have learnt from Linda, the reception manager, that there was a one-star restaurant in the hotel.  I just say ‚Äúyes, perfect‚Äù and she made the reservation for me.  Once I stepped into the hotel room,  the pleasant welcoming fruits were there waiting for me. üòä But real delightful experience was that a hotel staff brought in welcome tea soon after I walked around the room and started to admire the night sea view from the room.   The check out service is very nice and asked me how was my stay the night before.  For a long time I have not heard similar caring message from many other hotels.    The room set up is very‚Ä¶",50
the place was very convenient to every one..the room was big and very relaxing even the view from our room. the cleanliness of the room in altira is perfect also even the attendant who give the requests to us theyre very polite.,50
"Best hotel service in Macau from start to finish. Wonderful rooms, with beautiful views and every amenity; pool also one of a kind. Superb restaurants, particularly Ying and Tenmasa. Warmly recommended!",50
"From the minute I arrived at the hotel the staff were friendly and helpful. The reception is on the 38th Floor. Then you need to go to another lift to go down to your room. Once inside the room was huge, well equipped and a fantastic open view of Macau, Spectacular at night. There is no Restaurant to have breakfast but I chose a Breakfast package. This was actually room service. They delivered the chosen breakfast from the menu, with a folding table where you could look o or to Macau and enjoy the view with your breakfast. The Bed was big looking out over the water and there was L shape sofa to carry on relaxing. Big Circular bath in the bathroom with seperate shower. Fantastic",50
"I have been wanting to stay at Altira Hotel for a few years but for one reason or another it hadn‚Äôt happened.  This year me and my husband finally stayed at Altira. Loved everything! The room was wonderful with a luxurious bathroom design I hadn‚Äôt seen since I was a kid.  All in all very spacious and inviting.  We went twice to the Spa and swimming pool facilities to enjoy the view and serene ambiance.  At night we had a great meal at Aurora restaurant, which we already new and enjoyed great meals in the past, and ended our night at 38 Lounge listening to a great band.  As I said before, all in all, an exceptional stay. Definitely recommend for couples.  To all Altira staff that were so nice and obliging, a sincere thank you for the experience.",50
I had great experiences in this hotel for sure. Good location to enjoy the quietness yet not too far from the major sites in Macau. Not too much of shuttle buses but the concierge is always helpful with a taxi for you. And the area is full of tasty local food.   I‚Äôd love recommend it to other friends and clients for the implacable sea view in the room and its excellent services.,50
"The staff were absolutely amazing, rooms and facilities were spotless. The rooms were very nice, comfortable and luxurious with great views looking over the city. Definitely would come over again. Shu",50
We jumped to Macau from Hong Kong for one night. To hang around and to gamble a little at Casinos. The Altira hotel was chosen as the one providing best price for one night. We were absolutely amazed by the luxuriousness  of the room as well as by the kindness of the personal. Great choice for the value. ,50
"The bellboy on the first floor was so kind. The reception view is so nice, the hotel is clean, the room view is so nice, the swimming pool is so quiet, the sauna jacuzzi facility is great. I couldn't use the fitness room because I didn't have enough time, but I should go again next time. The location is a little remote. I need to use a taxi.",50
"Room design and Resort (inner swimming pool and jacuzzi) quite good!! Staff service quolity especially Concierge and Room service is excellent. Up to now only one problem was Transportation from Terminal (=Shattle Bus), but introduced this time. So now complete for all service, suppose one of best hotel in Macau!!",50
"During my first visit, I thought the location of the hotel is not favourable since it is far away from other attractions . In fact, it has become its unique attraction. I can explore local cafes and Macau people life style by visiting nearby areas. Taipa has many good restaurants and they are just walking distance from Altira.  Staffs are helpful and always ready to assist. Should  visit roof top bar and it has outdoor area for smokers like me!  Excellent!",50
"It is absolutely a pleasant experience to stay at Altira, the best stay I've had so far! Right from the point you check in, every little details is well taken care of. Not to forget the amazing view from the room and indoor swimming pool! Service staff were all helpful and friendly. Highly recommend everyone to stay at Altira! ",50
"Excellent services and room condition, outstanding waterfront view, michelin starred restaurant, but You might feel inconvenience moving by free shuttles. Using public transportation is better choice.",50
"The service and the location was ideal for our couple of days trip in Macao.  The staff are very helpful, prompt, and polite.  The hotel and its facilities are top notch and I love how spacious the rooms are.  I love how space you have for the bathroom as you can even enjoy your own bath and movie time while having your free drinks/beer each night!  The facilities are always kept clean and well attended! The spa, gym and pools are top notch with great facilities. We will definitely come back in this hotel again!",50
"Bravo experience in Altria Macau with appropriate price But didn't like the odor in the hotel, too strong and the bath amenities were not fit for me.  The facilities and design is great and feel relaxing during the stay.  Good service and nice staff during the whole stay.",50
"The atmosphere of the hotel is very worth it, i like to stay in Altira, beautiful hotel,clean and up to date,a will repeat again, will recomend to those who want to come to Macau. the staff was so kind, verry friendly and so helpful. ",50
"We had an excellent stay overnight.  A very friendly welcome from a guy at main door street level, and so was at the time leave. Same person, unfortunatey cannot remember his name. Staff extremely professional, friendly and very attentive  to satisfy our request focusing details.  Very clean room with astonishing view on the sea wtih Macau skyline.  Morning breakfast in room 10/10.  Very friendly and attentive waiter who also exchanged few Italian words  with us. Food was very good and abundant pottion were served. Spa service and pool was very good too, had a such good relax between sauna and steam room. Infinity pool amazing, but water temperature could have been slightly warmer in my opinion, anyway 10/10. Lounge staff was very attentive to the service, always smiling and‚Ä¶",50
I think Altira is a very nice hotel. The room is big and nice. The staffs of the hotel are so nice. I only think location is quite far from Sand Cotai Strip which is the centre of entertainment of Macau. Altira should provide more shuttle bus to Venetian Hotel or Galaxy Hotel and the operation hour of the shuttle bus should be longer than now. Thank you,50
"I stayed for one night only. Yea~ as expected it was fabulous! We may say it was a amazing stay! The standard room is good for family already, just add a extra bed . We ordered a room service food also , it was okay. Service is great. They offered a free shuttle to cotai. Super market is just nearby. Altira is highly recommend for those who want travel macau. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è",50
"I was happy to make happy memories with my mom before I got married. Although I am not good at English, I thank Skyo for being accurate and kind. Because the Portuguese restaurant I want to go is fully booked, Mr. Jacky recommended another restaurant to me and I was able to have a delicious meal. The view of the indoor swimming pool was magnificent. And it was nice to relieve the fatigue of the trip at the spa in these cold days.The hotel was fragrant, and the amenities and the prepared tea were excellent. It was unfortunate that there weren't many shuttles, but it's convenient to take a bus or a taxi. It was nice to have many restaurants on foot for about 15 minutes. If I go to Macau again, I will stay in Altera without hesitation.",50
"this boutique like hotel  has a wamr, high class feel. staff are super and very attentive to your needs. the restaurants are faboulous . but what I like is that unlike some of the bigger hotels with thousands of guests, Altira is warm and after the bustling lights of macau you can return o a wonderful room in peace",50
"We attended an event at this hotel and stayed one night and were pleasantly surprised.  As this property primarily caters to high roller gamblers, this was largely free of noisy crowds that plague other Macau hotels.  The entire hotel has great ocean views (for the time being), guestrooms are relatively large (50-60 sq m) and well designed.  We had a good Spa experience in a ""Couple's Room"" (for a MOP500. surcharge) that featured a private sauna and Jacuzzi.  Service was very prompt and courteous.  The only downside I found is that there is no dedicated restaurant for western breakfast, so in-room dining / room service is the only option.  While not the most economical hotel, it was an oasis in an otherwise crowded and noisy market in Macau; I would return again.",50
"We stayed at some airbnb nearby and went there to store our luggages after  check out, suggested by the owner. I wasn't quite sure if it works because usually hotels don't allow non staying guest to store luggage or some hotels in Macau, they charge for each piece of luggage stored.   We went thinking that we ll get rejected, but they were so friendly and accommodating. I met Keith and he assured that we got our luggage kept with no additional charge, and even for a group of 8 with more than 10 luggages, he was happy to assist us. Getting our luggages back was no hassle. The team helped us to call for taxi and load our luggages in.   We were wowed by their hospitality and we really appreciate it. I couldn't get all the names and thank each and everyone, but a big thank you to‚Ä¶",50
"Could enjoy amazing view of Macau side from this hotel room, and staff service is quite good, so that enjoyed hotel itself 3days!! And could enjoy Free Bar (too many) and very wide and panorama view jacuggi!!   ",50
"Altira serves professionally more than 5 star quality! All employees have been well trained, being attentive, friendly, professional, make me feel like super VIP all time during my stay. Each and every bit of Altira, even a tea pot and cups, are high end quality. Altira surprises me in all aspects, in fact more than I could expect. A 5 star hotel however serves more than that, I think Altira should be rated 6 Star!",50
"if you want to go Best Spa & Pool, you must experience Altir Hotel.It have best service, cleaness room, huge room, etc... Best condition.But Casino is not recommend. Because it have not Black-jack game..It's my favorite game.",50
"What a fantastic spa, hotel and restaurants! The service was Five Stars Plus! Love Ying and their Michelin Star Menu. The spa and pool are the best. Forbes 5 Star in every way. The views are spectacular and it is difficult to find a staff that is more service oriented than what we saw at Altira. If in Macau, impress your significant other with a night at Altira - Ying and 38 Lounge (on the 38th floor). ",50
Highly recommended hotel in Macau! The most beautiful view of Hotel in Macau!. Tasty restaurant and comfort SPA service!  Everything is wonderful except  no shutter bus available from airport to hotel. People need to take taxi or bus from airport to this Hotel.,50
"First, All staffs are very kind. They were always smile and said Hi. So I had a happy time in Altira. Second, room was Greeeaaat! my room was ocean view, so on the bed you can see the beautiful Macau ocean view day and night. I thought night view is fantastic. Plus, room size and bathtub were big. third, the hotel was calm. Altira is not in Cotai, so you feel transportation is not good. but It has shuttle bus goes to COD and etc, and many bus stations are nearby so you can move everywhere of Macau. I recommend Altra If you want to have happy memory in Macau",50
The room is a great surprise facing Macau side and observing with detail the huge structure been build to accommodate the bridge Hong Kong -Zhuhai- Macau. The indoor pool is gorgeous and very well maintained. All experience from check in /check out was wonderful. A must see,50
"This hotel was without a doubt just incredible!  Where to start? Firstly when we arrived we got scammed by a taxi driver charging 200HKD for a 10-minute drive. I knew this wasn't right so I photographed his ID and vehicle's licence plate. (In hindsight, tell a driver who does this and not by the meter to either switch on the meter or take you to the police station where you will be reporting him). Anyway, we told the staff and they immediately got on the phone and got the ball rolling with reporting the man to the transport bureau and to check their own CCTV of his vehicle. They were very helpful and efficient. We didn't want the money back, just wanted this conman of a driver to pay for his sins and hopefully he got what he deserved!   Now let's talk about the suite! Wow, what‚Ä¶",50
"After my chemotherapy journey finally we can stay in hotel again. This stay is for my boys actually. Who graduated in primary 6 and my other boy was top 2. To reward them i booked one night stay. The moment we stepped on the vicinity of hotel Emman the bellboy gave us a smile and a helping hand. He introduced the hotel to us until we reached to 38floor, the check in area. Then Glenn in check in area was very friendly and professional as well. We are so satisfied in our corner room. Fantastic experience. The view on our hotel is also awesome. At sauna Fara is very friendly an smiles a lot. David assisted us on our check out.  This forbes hotel was excellent all the staff‚Äôs attitude was consistent.

"Not so many hotels offer a cake for birthday celebration but Altira does! It is not about money but its courtesy and care! How can you go out and buy a cake in a city you are not familiar with? At mid-night, room service staff sent us the cake ( as we requested ) in professional manner. All staffs we saw were courteous and nice! We will come back for another celebration soon!",50
Got a free room from friend who is a casino member. This small hotel really amazed me and surpassed my expectations! I think one and only casino hotel that provides such tip top service. staffs are polite and attentive. Room is superb with fantastic seaview! Hope I can have a chance to stay again. ,50
"This is my second stay and one thing always attracts my heart about this boutique hotel is the panorama view of bridges and beautiful skyline from top floor. Service was seamless and offered late check out since my ferry time was 4 pm.  Porters seemed busy but did not fail to run and get a taxi for us with cheerful smile , I think he is Filipino or maybe Nepal? Overall experience is perfect. Will be back!",50
They have the best service in Macau. The room is bigger than most of the rooms in Macau with a huge bathtub which fits more than one. The service is absolutely stunning and the view is just shocked. One small thing is that the light switch for the window lights are hard to find or maybe it doesn‚Äôt really exist that i need to sleep with the a bit lights on. Perfect service from front desk Andrew. Great in-room dining selections and food quality as well. Highly recommend.,50
"Had an amazing stay and experience at Altira. All the staff were courteous and professional. They prepare the room in the evening as well. There is also a range of pillows to chose from. There are ample drinks in the fridge, the bathtub and shower is excellent. The swimming pools and facilities is excellent and toiletries supplied.  The view of Macau is very nice. There is free shuttle to the harbours and city of dreams and studio city. Excellent way to travel around whilst avoiding the horrible taxi. The neighbourhood is safe and shops/restaurants available.",50
"I was in Hong Kong and decided to visit Macau and stay one night. I have booked at Altira Macau Hotel because it was near to the ferry station.  The hotel is just unbelievable!! When you arrive you feel that starting from the first step through the hotel door to the lobby for check inn to the stunning room.  Location:  The hotel location was in Taipa Island, near to the ferry station is you will use taxi or bus. Also it is near to some other attractions in the south of Macau. If you will go to the north you can use the bus station which is only 5 minutes waling and go direct to North Island.  Room:  Best part in my trip was the hotel room.

We booked the corner suite room for celebrating my 1 year old son birthday. The view in the room and the infinity pool was amazing it's over looking at the bay and macau side but what I impressed the most is the birthday cake surprise for my son !

Thank you so much for making us feel like is our second home and given us a memorable birthday celebration .we are looking forward to return back again soon !    ,50
"Stayed there for a family vacation.  At first, I wasn't familiar with the location as it is off to the other side of Macau (away from the casinos).  Checked in at the 38th floor and went to our room.  Room was very spacious, the mini-bar had complimentary 2 beers, big double beds, and a spacious bathroom with a big bath tub and 2 sinks.  The swimming pool was great.  It is an infinity pool in the middle of the building where you have a view of the city.  They also have a huge spa, steam room, saunas, and locker rooms.  Very clean and it was quiet.  Will definitely stay there again when I go back to Macau.  Lots of restaurant choices around the hotel and a local market in walking distance.  The price is very affordable but high quality hotel.",50
Booked 2 Nights on a Waterfront view room for our Wedding Anniversary was the best thing we did. From the welcoming front desk Staff Andrew that checks us in; from the Accomodating Fitness staffs at the 16th floor like Carlo and the other Filipino Staffs(sorry if we didn‚Äôt got all your names); From Elaine at the 38th lounge that took care of us and the magnificent Housekeeping staff that kept our room so elegant always. Me and my wife had a memorable experience and the best Anniversary Stay ever thanks those staffs; They are all wonderful gems of this hotel.   Will definitely be seeing you guys again soon. God bless and more power!,50
"We had a really relaxing stay here this weekend, with the couples retreat(?) One night stay package which included a 1 hour spa treatment. Hotel room was beautiful, and breakfast is in and was really nice; the only issue for breakfast is that strangely the website only offers the choice to add 1 breakfast to the package, which caused confusion and delay at check in where we then had to add an ADDITIONAL breakfast. The only other criticism of the room was that there was only 1 large towel.... Maybe this hotel is popular with singles? The spa couples room was really nice, we were treated very well and had the room and jacuzzi to ourselves for an additional hour after. The trip was finished off with a dip in the award winning indoor infinity pool that has the same view as all the‚Ä¶",50
"It‚Äôs my second time staying in this hotel. I like tranquility as it‚Äôs not located in the busy area of where the major hotels are in Taipa. Though most people found it inconvenient, the shuttle bus takes you to the City of Dreams, Studio City and Taipa souvenir street.   The restaurants inside the hotel are excellent. It‚Äôs also easy to take a bus to the main island, which is just 2 minutes away from the hotel.   The room gives you the beautiful sea view with the Macau Tower and the glittering hotels. I especially like the indoor pool which is well equipped with spa facilities.   I was very happy with my stay! ",50

Very large comfortable and stylish fitted out accommodation. Great bed  huge comfortable couches with views across the water facing mainland Macau. The indoor pool is great when other hotels have closed outdoor pools for winter and it has fantastic views over to mainland Macau. Sauna and steam room within the gymnasium floor and fully equipped large gym with free weights and machines. Overall a very convenient hotel away from the hustle and bustle but close to everywhere in Macau and I would stay again.,50
"Incredible hotel, a different calibre from the mass-catered hotels that Macau has been recently known for. The check in on the 38th floor was seamless, with charming team at the front desk made sure we were well taken care of with a stunning room on the 21st floor. The room itself was lush, a soft bed with beautifully pressed linen and a super cuddle-friendly couch if you're enjoying the stay with a special someone. The giant bathtub was icing on the cake, with even a small TV on the top of the mirror so we'd have something to watch when soaking in the tub. The bathroom was wonderfully spacious (one small criticism is that the mirror isn't very friendly for women to apply make-up). We used the pool once, which has nice spa facilities and changing areas. Everything was nicely‚Ä¶",50
"Reception is on level 38, with stupendous views over mainland Macau! Want luxury? It abounds here...  starting with the friendly welcome by the conceirge who escorts you in the lift to reception. After formalities, to the room ... again escorted where room details are explained. Then the welcome from the floor butler, was it‚Äôs green tea and sumptuous. Chocolates and canap√©s. It just gets better and better. Though a business I was accompanied by my daughter. Ideal as our luxurious room had 2 king size beds! A dressing room and separate wet room and WC! Ideal!!!",50
We spent a non-chaotic but kinetic energy to have long lunch here. This restaurant locates at higher floor can absorb sunlight; heard that watch fireworks is fantastic here. Dessert is well presented and surprisingly by the container to display such a magical piece. Also found a gadget of toothpick. ,50
"We did the deluxe relaxation package, a massage and then a room for the night. We ordered room service which was excellent service and food.  There's not much in the to do in the hotel, but we did hear the pool was good.  The spa was wonderful, there's a shower room and spa pool to use before or after the massage. ",50
I stayed in one hotel on my first day and was not comfy. Then I transfered to this hotel. I felt comfortable. Specially the staffs are well mannered and very friendly. The Filipino staffs are always smiling. Always makes my day specially  because I came here for business and need the extra motivation. ,50
"We've just got back from Macau and our stay at Altira was amazing. It's a pity that we only stayed for 1 night, because the room was big and luxurious (note that we're used to Hong Kong apartment standards) and the view was stunning  Some of the best restaurants are in walking distance.  As we like to walk, we visited The Venetian, The Parisian and enjoyed the House of Dancing Water at City of Dreams",50
"My friend & i celebrated our birthdays here & it was unforgettable. The moment i came to the reception, my friends (2 of them) & i were welcomed with water, we were given a tea set as we entered the room. We went to the pool and as we came back to the room, fruit plate was served to us. A lot of drinks on the fridge were free. I was quite disappointed with a particular guest that was with us on the pool as she kept complaining about us of just about anything she sees. She was kind of an irate guest, and wasn't minding her own business at all. As if she owned the building. Nonetheless, the staffs handled the situation very well and we were treated nicely and very welcome. The staffs are all smiling and warm towards us. The view was amazing! And the movies were free inside the‚Ä¶",50
"I was staying in this hotel on 2 Feb for 1 night. I booked via online travel agency and i was expensive than the normal day as for the chinese new year. I arrived from Taipa Ferry Terminal to the hotel, which only take us in 10 mins. During checking in at around 4pm, i was informed my room was assigned on 36th floor as per my request and in very detail for presenting the facilities and ordering in room breakfast. After check out, the front office lady saild happy birthday to me and I felt her sincere so much. When i got in the room, the view was stunning. I can see the panorama of the sea and the Macau peninsula. The room is spacious and simple decoration with style. Even though the room rate was expensive for me, I felt it was worthy. The hotel is not very far from the tourist‚Ä¶",50
"Though the location is little bit inconvenient and without shuttle bus to major tourist attractions and ferry terminal, the nice hotel staff with 5-star service will let you enjoy the stay very much. Sure will stay there again next time. ",50
"Our stay at the hotel was a 5-star experience in every respect. From the moment you check in at the sky lobby, you will be awed by the drop-dead view of the entire bay and downtown Macau across. You will have both a day time and night time (city light) view. Our room had the same view. Everything in the room was quality. Maid service was good and paid attention to details. The indoor pool and spa was impressive and with good service, and yes another great view as well. We noticed that a lot of things in the frig was free.   The only thing is that the location of the hotel is not at the heart of Cotai Strip and it does not offer shuttle service. So we ended up having to take a cab everywhere we go. There are a few acceptable local restaurants nearby that are open late. The‚Ä¶",50
"From the moment we stepped out of the cab we could tell the Altira was going to be something special.  The staff were friendly, professional and immaculately presented. We were escorted up to reception on level 38, offered water and checked-in promptly. We were then escorted to our room.  We had a waterfront view king room and were frankly surprised at how spacious the room was and how spectacular the views. We entered into a wide entry way, walked past the enormous bathroom with double vanity, separate toilet, walk-in robe and amazing (and very large) tub with views of the waterfront, into the bedroom and sitting area with lounge and desk.  Breakfast was included and was lovely; fast wifi was also complimentary. Water, soft drinks and beer from the minibar were also free of‚Ä¶",50
"I have stayed in more than 10 difference hotels in Macau before and this was the first time I stayed at Altira and was really impressed by the services, the facilities provided by the hotel as well as the hotel room. Check in / out at the 38 floor was fast. Complementary breakfasts were offered to us even though my booking does not included breakfast (in fact I booked at a very very low price).   Late check out at 2 pm was also granted in less than one minute after I requested. The water front room was big, comfortable and with a very nice view (I stayed at the 35th floor). The mini bar for drinks and beers, the movies on demand, internet are all complimentary. Indoor swimming pool is at the 16th floor and the counter also offer free drinks which included fresh fruit juices‚Ä¶",50
"We spent two nights in this hotel toward end December 2015. I must say that this is one of the few hotels that gives you a cozy environment to hide away from city life if you want to, or a base for you to explore interesting locations around.  Our room is on the 35th floor which is only two floors below the front desk. Rooms in this hotel spread from 37th floors all the way down the tall building with restaurant on the 10th floor. Security is very good as you have to enter the hotel concierge on the ground floor before taking a lift all the way to the reception desk on the 38th floor. Being on the high floor gives us very good view of Macau both day and night. Room is spacious and mini bar is stocked with soft drink and beers for yours free. If you want to stay all day in the‚Ä¶",50
"Well.... i`ve been traveling the world, and visiting many cool hotels over the year, but the room in Altira blew my brains... AMAZING!   the service is impeccable , HUGE rooms, super well designed, every little detail is thought off and to top it off the minibar is FREE yes.... FREE! beers/soft drinks/water... and the view of the bay oh wow.... bawler hotel.  A M A Z I N G!",50
"Room was clean , whole hotel experience very good.  Had a swim in there wonderful pool, very helpful afterwards took us to the spa pool, had a sauna , and after wards u could shower and had everything from cream to hairdryer.",50
"best place to live for a luxury stay in macau. costs as much as other hotels but the rooms, views and the space is amzaing. the morning breakfast is to die for. just absolutely divine. If i have the budget definietly is on my list for macau.",50
"Best hotel in Macau I've experienced. The staff are all extremely polite and professional. Unlike several other luxury hotels in Macau where we felt like we had to fight for attention in order to get help, in Altira we were addressed by name and every staff we we met were ready and willing to offer us help whenever we needed, such as with directions, explanation of amenities, restaurants, taxis and luggage.   The hotel side is separated from the casino so there are no noisy guests around and it is not packed with tourists (which is one of the main reasons why I wanted to stay here over the other hotels in the City of Dreams area). The lobby on the 35th floor is breathtaking, as are the suites. I especially loved the large, round bath tub and the floor to ceiling windows which‚Ä¶",50
"If you want to be spoilt, this is the place. From the moment you arrive staff run to push elevator buttons and to service every need. The room was very large and spacious with nice cosmetics. Much of the mini bar is complimentary, fresh fruit each day. Breakfast was the only downside as they just begin to change the way it is served. High recommendation for this hotel. ",50
"I came here to watch the Fireworks and it was a good location to enjoy the Fireworks Show here. I went to lunch before I check in and they arranged to pick me up at the restaurant, it's really a six stars service! We were warmly welcomed by staff of the hotel and the room is clean and comfortable, all the snacks in the bar is free including a small bottle of red wine. After a wonderful evening, we have breakfast in the room enjoying the spectacular view. We went to swim in the indoor swimming pool and surprisingly we can enjoy music while swimming. After lunch, they provided the limousine service and we arrived at the Ferry Pier just in time. What a wonderful escape!",50
"One of the best hotel stay we had for a long time! Spacious room with a great view.  F&B:  Japanese buffet choices/ selections are very good.  Front service staffs are great, nothing is too much for them. They even went all the way to arrange someone to escort us to a nearby restaurant we wish to visit.  I will definitely choose Altira again for my future visits to Macau.",50
"We visited Macau with a family and nice hotel away from the crowd been the must. Beautiful rooms with a lot of living space amazing view and breakfasts in room, we got everything what we paid for. Stuff is very helpful and always there for you. One thing that annoyed me is air refreshing in the corridors the smell is very strong.",50
"We needed to get away for a few days so that my husband could get off the ""hamster wheel"" of work. From the moment we stepped into the Altira we felt the stress just slip away. Having breakfast served in our room was a delight, the underwater music of the infinity pool was soothing and the large comfortable room with amazing views meant we were very to content to just laze around all day. We did go to the workout room and the locker room with the Jacuzzi, sauna and steam room meant that I didn't use our huge bathtub in our room as much as I would have liked. The couples message was one of the best we've ever had (and we've had a few!) We stayed in to eat at the excellent Italian restaurant and had drinks on the patio prior- very relaxing and romantic. Best of all was the‚Ä¶",50
"We have visited this h√¥tel during 2 days last week and really loved it. Very Nice room, gorgeous swimming pool and outstanding service. Thank you very much for your hospitallity, from the Bellmen, the people at the entrance and exit of the lift, to the receptionist, and Head sommelier of the cantonese restaurant. Very good team! A luxury place. Only thing that could be improved, pick up service at the airport.",50
"All rooms only faced one direction and there is no need to request for a room with view. Countless photos have shown you how much u can laze in bed to witness the sunset and city nightlights.   Separated toilet & sink from bath is the biggest plus point.   You must visit and enjoy the pool with the accompanying water facilities. Never, ever miss that.   Did not partake in the hotel's f&b as there are various affordable options on 3 sides of the hotel. You can walk in to a local coffeeshop (cha chan teng) for breakfast set. Choose a hotpot restaurant for lavish dinner/supper. Seafood restaurant for lunch with local folks. These added plus points for a hotel that sits in a local residential district.   It was much fun too to take local public bus rides from the stops dotted along‚Ä¶",50
"Though located outside the city center, the hotel gives guests five star service all the way, from check-in to check-out.  Staff were friendly, in-room breakfast was great, all rooms have a great view of the Macau Skyline.  Not our first choice when we booked but was recommended as an alternative by the hotel group and we're glad we tried it.",50
"When you arrive at Taipa Ferry Terminal, you might feel disappointed as you would see many shuttle buses to the different hotels but none to Altira. The only way to the hotel unfortunately is via cab. Any unhappiness though will be gone once you see the room. When you step into the room, the first thing to notice is the full length glass window offering a superb view of the Macau island. A few more steps in and you will marvel at the amount of space in the room. Other than a king-sized bed, there is a large bathtub with a separate rain shower, a walk-in closet, a long work desk and a living area with a comfortable sofa. Quite a contrast to the hotel room in Hong Kong that I had just come from. The hotel also offers free soft drinks in the mini-bar as well as free in-house‚Ä¶",50
"This hotel has it's class. The building design, the building concept, the friendly and experience staffs, the casinos, the rooms, the indoor swimming pool, all the F&B outlets, the spa, and other facilities. All has class. The Japanese Restaurant called Tenmasa and the award winning fine dining restaurant called Aurora top it all. Dining experience here is can never be the same in any part of the world I have traveled. The room I stayed has a fantastic view of Macau. The room is fresh, clean and well maintained. I was treated like King at Crown Macau.",50
"My parents and I really had a restful, memorable, magnificent overnight staycation at this hotel. The CLEAN MODERN INTERIORS, SPACIOUS AND PRETTY BATHROOM, MINI BAR packed with FREE DRINKS and instant noodles, and wide selection of HOLLYWOOD MOVIES (FOR FREE) are all wonderful points. But here are the highlights of our stay...  ‚óè The POOL: This made such an impression on us that we still talk about and miss it till now...the water is really soft and light (great to swim through); there's spa music underwater; it's indoor and has an amazing view of the city (you can see the Grand Lisboa and MGM from the pool); and they give you mixed nuts and dried fruit as you relax poolside. The sauna, steam rooms, and jacuzzi are all spacious and clean as well.  ‚óè The complimentary BREAKFAST‚Ä¶",50
"The Good -The rooms were very spacious and well designed. I spent the first hour or so upon checking in just lounging on the sofa and staring out the windows. -Because all of the rooms are on such high floors, you get a great view overlooking the Macau bridges (There is some construction going on nearby though, but I expect that to be completed soon) -Everything was spotless. Even at most top notch hotels my wife is capable of finding strands of hair here and there but not at this hotel. Kudos to housekeeping. -The inbuilt TV above the bathroom sinks. I'm always bored when I brush my teeth, so having something to stare at was fantastic! -The minibar (minus wine and hard liquor) is free. How many hotels in the world has this? You get snacks, beer, and sodas. I could spend many a‚Ä¶",50
"This hotel is the best hotel I have ever stayed at so far. All the staffs were very passionate and dedicated. We were escorted to the concierge located at the top floor once we arrived and our luggages were all carried by them. The staff at the concierge kindly gave a lot of advices on what to do in Macau. We stayed at the executive suite on the 36th floor which is the top floor for the guest room. It could be that I have never stayed in a 5 stars hotel before, I found the room too good to be true. It was way more than I expected: stunning city and water views looking over the harbour and casinos on the other side, spacious room with a cloak room, the bathtub (OMG) in the bathroom can probably fit 6 people inside, and complimentary drinks are just more bonus point on top of my‚Ä¶",50

"We spent two nights at this faultless hotel. The staff are just amazing,remembered  Our name and greeted us every time we went in or out. The rooms are a super size with stunning views over Macau. There are plenty of taxies and and a very good bus service to all areas very close by. There are some very good Portuguese restaurants within a short taxi ride to Taipa, especially Antonio's don't miss the House of Dancing Water. We shall certainly return next time we visit Macau.",50
"I travel all over Asia for work and i have to say that this is the best hotel i have stayed in bar none. The staff are exceptional, the rooms are fantastic, the view is simply stunning, the pool area is so peaceful and the service is excellent. I look forward to my next visit!",50
"We had a great time in this hotel! The rooms were huge and extremely luxurious. The bath was a treat and the beds were soft and comfortable. The pool facilities were fantastic, but there are not many pool chairs so if they are full you may need to be a little patient. There is even music playing under water!   Free movies in the rooms and about 10 non-alcoholic and 5 beers free in mini bar each day.   The view on the Macau facing side is amazing at night. Just an easy and very inexpensive bus ride across the water. ",50
"This is a beautiful boutique hotel with great service. The rooms are huge, with a lounge area, enormous bathroom and wonderful views. The pool is lovely and the breakfast room service was great. However, the best part about this hotel is the service, everyone, from the doorman to reception to the pool attendant are friendly and respectful and go above and beyond. I've stayed in many international 5 star hotels for work and this was by far the best. Well done to a great team.",50
"Visited there during the Black Thunderstorm signal in Hong Kong, such a beautiful escape since Macau was totally dry and chapped that day. The hotel lobby was located on the roof of the building which shown a wonderful view of Macau.  We booked a room with a river view which shown a whole full picture of the city.  Room is super spacious with amazingly huge bath tub (you can even fit in 4 people i guess..). The hotel has no official casino but its attached to nearby hotels.   I spent the night at the 38 Lounge, singers were good. Wine selection was okay but it can be better.   The best is you can escape from the main stream tourists in Galaxy Macau and the Venetian and experience the real Macau here.  Will definitely visit here again.",50
"Overall review: Stay three nights with two rooms (thanks a lot for arranging on the same floor). Great view! We all like the hotel very much with its comfortable, modern and comfortable rooms, top class facilities, friendly staff and strategic location with easy access to taxi and public transport for sightseeing. Absolutely a gem for sightseeing in Macau.   Location: before the trip, I was concerned that the hotel doesn't have any shuttle bus and is not close to any other big resorts. Don't worry at all especially I found guests need to wait and sometimes there is a long queue for most of the shuttle buses in those big resorts. Also it is a smaller but high quality hotel which makes it easy to commute within the hotel. If you leave the hotel in the morning / noon and come back‚Ä¶",50
"Altira is hands down the best deluxe hotel available in Macau if you want to stay away from the Cotai Strip due to the outrageous number of tourists there. Altira is set in the more residential and quite part of Taipa, overlooking the peninsula. The view itself is worth the cost. The service was tip top, couldn't ask for better staff! Everything about this hotel was beyond my expectation. Loved my stay there, and we've planned to visit Altira at least annually now!",50
"The Altira Macau is the epitamy of opulence and the perfect place to be pampered. The King Waterfront rooms are very spacious and want for nothing. The views to Macau central are panoramic and the hotel is well located to the temporary Ferry Wharf, Cotai and the various other Casinos and sights. The friendly and professional staff at the Altira made our stay an extremely pleasant one and we would highly recommend this hotel.",50
"Spectacular Rooms and Service  Their infinity pool is really spectacular with a 180 degree of Macau Penisular.  Special mention for the view from our room, one of the best I've seen in Macau. Memorable and romantic night view. The Japanese Tempura restaurant is very good and famous. The hotel is undoubtedly one of the best in Macau. Will definitely stay for another turn.",50
"First Impression: All the staff dress smartly, fully alert, attention to details with great customer service.  Room: Welcome tea and the complementary birthday cake that serve to our room is impressive. Not only the super comfort bed, the big round shape bathtub inside our room is something worth to mention too.  Dining: Ask hotel concierge for map. They can show u very yummy local food within walking distance if Japanese & Hot pot restaurant in the hotel is not your choice. (I personally don't like the buffer as the teppanyaki make the whole environment so smoky & smelly)  There is a very nice local food: ""feichaiman"" within 5 min walking distance from the hotel. Crab porridge and fried fishball is something special to try.  Internet at Macau: There are CTM (the local telco‚Ä¶",50
"Got a really good deal for a night in this hotel, didnt quite expect it to be this good since the hotels in Macau are mostly catered for the hungry gamblers even if they are 5 star hotels, there is always something missing.  Altira is the only one ice experienced really really good service. Could not fault anything from the moment the concierge took my bags, he started up conversations even in the elevator. Everything was very swift and efficient. Everybody spoke good English and always make a point of addressing you by the name. Everyone seemed so sincere! And the pool is just beautiful with crazy views perched up high. Would definitely come back to this property. Even if it is a casino hotel, you won't see those crowds at all and the service is really top notch!",50
I am currently staying at the hotel. The hotel is amazing and the service one of the best.

"We decided to see the sights of Macau and stay one night to make it easier. The Altira hotel is a casino hotel but you wouldn't know it! We had an enormous room with a spectacular view and the service was impeccable. Immaculately clean and every amenity you could wish for. We've stayed at 5 star hotels before, but this was way above anything we've experienced before. We will certainly be going back! Be warned though, the food is very expensive, so we ate out.",50
"This Forbes-rated hotel is superbly located on the Taipa side near the two bridges linking to old Macau ,  providing an awesome panoramic view of the Macau  city skyline especially at night. And to capitalize on the great view, the hotel provides breakfast in your room as part of the room package.  The service was great -  attentive & genuinely courteous staff from the Front Desk to the Bellhops to the Room Service staff. The  well-furnished room was very spacious and the toilet was the probably the best amongst all the hotels I stayed in this region. The Bar Lounge on the 38th Floor and the Japanese restaurant on one of the lower floors offer good entertainment & Japanese cuisine respectively but were slightly over-priced when compared with similar class & type of F&B outlets‚Ä¶",50

"Staying at this hotel was an incredible experience. We were treated like ViPs the whole time, with the staff being very helpful and professional. The swimming facilities were fantastic and it had a stunning views. It was my friends birthday, and they arranged a delicious cake for him. The room itself is massive. I highly recommend this place.. Once you stay here every other hotel seems average!",50
"I was very fortunate to book during the Easter break and receive a great deal on an excellent room with a fantastic view and and hour long Spa treatment.  When we arrived, we found it odd to have to take the lift to the top of the building to find the lobby to check in, quite unique but again, slightly odd.  We were greeted with a fantastic view and friendly staff.  When we arrived in our room, and it was breath taking.  We could see the sea, bridge and casinos (Imagine what that looked like in the evening!).  The room was equivalent to a suite, furnished a king size bed, a choice of pillows, sofa, desk and large TV.  The washroom was large with a private toilet, walk in wardrobe, large round tub, showers and a his and her washing basins. The facilities are quite impressive too.‚Ä¶",50

The selected free mini bar and the welcome tea on arrival were lovely touches,50
 The room is perfect in every little detail its spacious and has a huge sofa and amazing bathroom with a bathtub and great view. Its just perfect The checkin was so smooth and they housekeeping were really good. Everyday they will keep a little thing on our bed like foot lotion or face moisturizer.  The location of the hotel is not exactly at the tourist attractions its a few minutes drive which was perfect because it was calm and quiet away from the other busy hotels and noisy casinos.  The in room dine in was good but a bit expensive but the Aurora restaurant didn't taste as good as I expected.

"My fianc√© and I have travelled to Macau several times before, preferring to be away from the larger casino hotels. We stayed one night in a Waterfront View Room which was beautifully designed and very spacious, with a separate lounge style area, ideal for eating in room or relaxing in front of the amazing view of Macau. The deal through Trip Advisor meant this was excellent value for money. The bathroom features a large tub and shower room. The large pool has a panoramic view of Macau. We ate in Ying, the Cantonese restaurant which has great dim sum, and had drinks in 38 lounge (again overlooking the amazing view). At all times the service was excellent. The breakfast is ok, but not the best. It is a short taxi ride from the Cotai Jet ferry terminal at Taipa and just 10 minutes‚Ä¶",50
"Although the hotel has a casino (with a separate entrance from the hotel), what I loved about it, as a non-gambler staying there as part of a visit with our son and family who live nearby, was that it was small and calm - a world away from all of the tremendous glitz and gawking tourists in the bigger hotels and casinos.  Our room was beautifully set up with a separate large seating area and plenty of desk space.  A full wall of window overlooked the harbor and mainland Macau.  We had a room package that included breakfast in the room, and we found the various egg dishes we chose, as well as the yogurt and fruit and fresh juices, very good.  After one day of the ""bread"" basket, with only very sweet Danish and muffins, we asked for toast and were brought fresh white and whole‚Ä¶",50
I highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to experience another level of luxury. Perfect for a couple getaway. Spacious room with amazing bathtub and spectacular view like nowhere else. Definitely get a breakfast in room-delicious food and hey how often do you have breakfast overlooking Macau? Amazing! The service is very attentive and you will feel like a celebrity the way they treat you. We got a limousine pick up and drop off and it was all worth it! Nice new cars (BMW) with wet towels and water provided. We also tried their Kira Japanese buffet and it was the best Japanese buffet I've ever tried! I would recommend this hotel to everyone. And will definitely stay there again.,50
"Chic, comfortable , good service, very very good SPA!! The massage was awsome !! The breakfast gorgeous. The room is cosy, practical and elegant design..ask a hight level, the view is fabulous! The only negative point, a bit far from the main interest of Macau. We recommended",50
"This Hotel is just perfect... The Casino is so so, but the venue is superb. We went to the Chinese (YIN) Hot pot restaurant and we have been surprised by the package offered by this venue.  Nothing is perfect but here, we have had one of the best Hot Pot in Macau... The price is there to remind you the all experience. This hotel offers you one Italian restaurant, Japanese restaurant, this hot pot restaurant and an amaizing roof top bar named 38... Just go there and enjoy the view and of course the food.. The service was ok and professional with some issues which are easily forgivable... Do not miss this hotel if you are a food lover...",50

Limo pick up service & drop off was efficient & on time & luggage was dealt with as soon as we were picked up. We were greeted by name from pick up to front door to reception which is a nice touch, but bit weird.   The room has everything incl a lovely view of Macau- all amenities you need are here- products used are Aigner in Leather, slippers are velvety & dressing gowns are silky!  In the evening, they do turndown service & hey leave Aigner foot gel on your bed, super cute.  Room service is pretty good- they even give you an etd for the room service and are on time! Breakfast in bed is the best thing especially with the view‚Ä¶",50
"I stayed at this place 2 times after a number or visits and stays at about 10 other Macao hotels. It is incredibly good value. It is not very downtown, but everything is close in Macao and btw, Macao¬¥s downtown is not really where you want to be in in the evening. You visit the places, casinos etc. And get back to your room, where you get absolutely the best view over Macao. The room are huge and very fancy, as well as the service. The roof bar garden is the best roof bar in Macao. The breakfast is served in your room and is amazing. Don't miss the swimming pool, again it gives you the most amazing view. Check the hotel's website and you will understand what I mean. And yes, it a really place for a romantic weekend:-)",50
"Stayed for one night while taking a vacation in Hong Kong. AMAZING hotel. A limousine service comes to greet you at the Ferry Terminal, and while not a limo in the traditional sense, it's IS a luxury van. Bottles of water are provided along with fresh minty cold towels for a quick wash up. The rooms are huge (I'm guessing close to 700sq ft.) and coming from the microscopic expensive rooms of Hong Kong, it was a very welcome surprise. Our room (3510) had a crazy unobstructed view of the water and city, as i'm sure almost every other room does as well. The room had a foyer, large comfortable queen size bed, a desk area and a large sectional couch by the huge picture window.

The limo is more of a toyota alphard or similar car which is quite popular in hk/macau. Nothing much to complain about the ride as it is complementary. Some unexpected things happen during the check in. We check in at 3 pm and was told that we have to wait another 1 hour for our rooms to be ready. Was really upset with the staffs. I suppose the check in time was a standard 3pm and since they expect me to arrive at 3, i expect the room to be ready by then.

"From its stunning views, competent and attentive staff and its large family suite this hotel cannot be faulted. Relaxing swimming pool and a sauna and steam room that actually worked - many a 5 star hotel weakness. Concierge spoke perfect English. We even were provided an extra-early room service breakfast free of charge as we were missing our breakfast to get the ferry to HK International Airport. This is one 5 star hotel that lives up to its billing and more and I would recommend this hotel without reservation.",50
it was great good service.The staff were really friendly and the swimming pool was awesome i particularly the music every time you went under the water it was really relaxing. Overall it definitely deserves 5 star.,50
"I recently visited this place on a romantic getaway weekend with my wife and we were both blown away by the service and our room itself. The staff was incredibly professional and very heplful, plus they all speak very good english. It is a beautiful hotel and our entire experience was great. I would suggest this place to anyone. Especially couples. Plus, they have great package deals!  The room was very modern and well layed out. It is not a huge room by western standards, but by eastern standards I could live in it happily. The bathroom has a shower, dual sinks, and a tub big enought to easily fit 2 adults. My only complaint of the entire stay was the bed was a bit harder than preferred.  Our package deal came with a round trip ride from the ferry terminal and breakfast for 2‚Ä¶",50
"I booked thru the hotel website and stayed for 2 nights. We liaises thru email a lot and they very prompt in replying email.  We're greeted at Macau ferry terminal and the personnel attendant was very professional. He started by asking if I got places I like to visit and they'll try the best to arrange for us. And they did !! They helped to booked a restaurant and arrange the taxi so once we're down to the 1st floor, the taxi is ready in front of the hotel. No need worry if you shop a lot as the bell attendants there is very helpful.  Upon arrival at the hotel, we go straight to 38 floor for check-in and once we reached there, we greeted by the staffs with a genuine smile.   We booked waterfront room and the room is spacious for 3 persons. The view is magnificent. The fridge is‚Ä¶",50
This was my second stay at the Altira. We booked it on short notice but had no problems at all with our reservation. We arrived at the lobby and the staff still remembered my name and when I was there the last time. Very impressive. We got to our room right away without waiting at check in at all and everything was done in our room. The view from the room was very nice and the room itself was spacious and clean. We used their restaurant for brunch which was excellent. They combined the Italian and Japanese restaurant for brunch which was interesting. Using the Spa was just icing on the cake and so relaxing. They have an amazing couples room which I can highly recommend using.,50
We stayed for two nights mid week in October. We booked a harbour view room and a couple of days before arrival we were notified that renovation work was going to be taking place in some of the rooms. We were naturally concerned so we contacted the hotel and we were immediately offered an upgrade to a suite. Upon arrival at Macau ferry terminal we were met by a hotel rep and quickly transferred to a waiting car. The hotel is away from the centre of Taipa Island but two minutes from the middle bridge to Macau - we found this a very convenient location. The hotel has two entrances - one for the casino and restaurants and the other for hotel guests - excellent. We were taken to the reception on the 38th floor and then to our suite. The suite was enormous - a spacious living /‚Ä¶,50
"I travel all over Asia for work, and when I went to Macau last month, I managed to get 3 nights at this hotel.  Just to say it didn't disappoint.   I don't write many reviews but this hotel was worth the time to come here and write one. Everything from the spectacular view from my room to the service to the amazing Italian restaurant exceeded expectations. Even the bar/lounge on the 38th floor and band were great. Great value for what you get. If you want the best place to stay in Macau this is it",50
"I normally do not write reviews as i am not very good at writing them, but this hotel has compelled me to do that for all the good reasons.  the moment i booked the hotel the things started to roll, I got a mail stating that we should inform them about our travel plans, which we did, and as promised everything happened well on time.  The moment we reached the hotel the personalised service was so great that i cant put it in words, we were upgraded to a corner suite the moment we checked in the suite is a pleasure to stay in, the service and courtesy and helpfulness shown by the staff is the best i have experienced so far in all my trips around the world.  We had dinner at tetmasa which was again as good as i have had in japan of not made better by the attention and care taken‚Ä¶",50
"Wow, that is all I can say. From arriving at the hotel, checking in at the 38th floor with an amazing view to a huge room (57 sqm) this was an excellent stay.  The staff treats you like you want to be treated at a five star hotel. The room had an amazing water view and the decor was great.  This hotel has everything you need and the location is so close to everything that you get there in minutes. The restaurant and spa which is included in the hotel is excellent.",50
"Macau is a bizarre place, feels really fake and ghost-town like, but the Altira is brilliant.  We stayed there with another couple of friends last year and loved it. We stayed in a suite on one of the top floors and the view was incredible, service is great and very attentive, the spa is really good and the swimming pool is very relaxing although not huge.  I really liked the minimal decor and the size of the rooms. We had drinks on the roof terrace and dinner at the Japanese restaurant, we enjoyed both very much. The food was great (strongly recommend the Japanese hot-pot), and the view from the roof terrace bar was pretty spectacular.  I wouldn't go back to Macau as it is void of any atmosphere or character, but I would love to move the Altira to somewhere a little bit more‚Ä¶",50
"We've been to Macau several times and stayed in various newly opened hotels such as the Venetian. Our recent stay in Altira is the BEST experience, bar none.  We were upgraded from a Corner Suite to a 3,000 sq ft 2-bedroom Villa. Fabu-tastic! The rooms are spacious, clean, smartly designed, tastefully decorated, and well maintained. The 270 degree view is simply spectacular. There are a treadmill and jacuzzi in the master bathroom, about 6 or 7 TVs in total, iPod dock, Acqua di Parma toiletries, the fluffiest white towels, mini bar, espresso machine, an impossibly large fruit basket ... the list goes on...   The staff were the friendliest and most professional. Our butler (!) was a polite and efficient young man, who seemed to be committed to providing us with the best‚Ä¶",50
"I have seen many hotels around the world, and about Altira I can say that it is the best so far. It has a great sea view, conveniently located near all the attractions. Very close to the center too. Spacious rooms equipped with everything you might need. Very kind and attentive personnel. Really the best. The only thing I did not enjoy is the fact that the swimming pool is only indoor.",50
My fiance and I were in Macau for the day and had a couples massage at Altira Spa. The room was above and beyond anything we could have imagined. The staff were very friendly and professional. Our massage started off with time in our spa suite to use the jacuzzi or shower/steam room as we we liked followed by a foot scrub and 1 hour massage. Afterwards we had more time to use the facilities and enjoy a spa lunch. We also ate at the Aurora Restaurant and the meal was phenomenal.  We highly recommend this to anyone looking for a relaxing day at the spa or a romantic getaway.,50
"Frankly I wasn't interested to stay in Altira before I came to the hotel because of it's location. My friend had booked a package including 2 tickets of Dancing Water Show. We were warmly greeted by the hotel staff at ferry port. It was seamless. From the time we arrived to hotel until stepped out, staffs are amazingly friendly, attentive and helpful. I did not have enough notes to give taxi fare and they solved my problem. Visited swimming and it was fantastic!!! Encountered one problem only, cigarette smell in the lifts. Overall we enjoyed and come back in future.",50
"I am a seasoned traveller and stay mostly in 5-Star hotels throughout Asia.  The Altira is by the best hotel in this area.  Rooms have a spectacular view of the Macau peninsula, but more importantly, is the management and the team that are always available to meet your needs/demands, and always with a smile.  Once could not feel more welcome anywhere.  This is certainly ""a home away from home"".",50
"I go back to Macau every year but this is first time at Altira,  Altira doesn't feel like any other hotel in Macau, the staff are really polite and professional, the hotel itself feels a million miles away from Macau, its really relaxing!  The views from the room are incredible at night, really beautiful. The Spa is a must try, we had a winter package and it was such value for money, the suites are amazing with bed, jacuzzi, monsoon showers with mood lighting, tea etc. etc. The only down side is the location is a little far from Macau main bit but as we only stay for 1 night and we have a driver it didn't really bother us!  Would really recommend this hotel",50
"Words fail me. They told me that they were upgrading me, but when I realized they had put me in a $4000/night villa instead of the $300/night I had booked, my jaw dropped. I have never stayed in such a place before: A massive suite of rooms with a full-wall skyline view, everything very tastefully designed, not tacky like in Vegas. It's a beautiful place. I was unimpressed by Macau generally, but if you must visit, definitely stay here. The staff was attentive but not imposing. Somehow they always said my weird last name exactly right, something even people in my home country can't do. I still wonder how. I splurged and got the chef's recommended five-course meal at the Italian restaurant, and loved it. Thank you, Altira -- You've spoiled me, and no other hotel will ever measure‚Ä¶",50
"I've been to Altira a few times and it has never failed me.  Friendly, genuinely helpful staff that work very efficiently (which I find rare in Macau sorry to say...!).  Room quality is great, clean, sleek, modern and feels spacious.  I had an air con problem with my room and the staff efficiently resolved this within 30 minutes in the middle of the night around 1am.  They provided a complimentary later check out time for the time loss in resolving the issue which was a sensible touch.  I had a limousine transfer but was quite disappointed that it was not what all others were describing as Benz, but only a city of dream Nissan minivan - which even turned up late!  Not sure if they are cutting cost or...  Other than that - fantastic!  Hotel restaurants - stick to Aurora, Kira is‚Ä¶",50
"Everything about the hotel is classy and made to perfection. From the limousine pickup to drop-off, we thoroughly enjoyed each moment in this lavish hotel. We were a group of 2 couples, and booked 2 normal rooms, but were upgraded to a 2 room villa upon arrival. The villa was something we had never imagined..it was so grand and luxurious that none of us felt like leaving the hotel to see any of Macau...!! Furnishing was tasteful and immaculate. There were 2 jacuzzi, steam room, treadmill, 10 TVs, home theaters, ipod docks, kitchen, personal bar, walk-in wardrobes and study rooms, all within the villa.. spanning some 3000sqft. Villa was on 36th floor with a grand sea view and amazing view of the casinos skyline at night. Buffet breakfast was good, not great variety but fine food.‚Ä¶",50
"This is the best hotel I have ever stayed at - it's not even a contest, and that's saying something.  I always wondered what ""world-class service"" means, and now I know.  On arrival, we were upgraded from a corner suite to a villa.  Yes, a villa.  The staff was amazing:  from the porters to the management, the service was consistently great without being overbearing, even for us average Joe's.  The spa was superb - the private room is well worth the extra 500 MOP.  Breakfast at the Aurora is wonderful.  Housekeping is pristine.  The concierge staff could not do enough for us.  They even found the eyeglasses that we left behind.  No hidden charges or discrepancies on the bill.  A PERFECT hotel experience.  A few tips - wait until Macau to change money if you can.  I found I got a‚Ä¶",50
I will give this hotel a six stars.  First class service from the moment we were met at the ferry terminal. Hot towels and drinks were served during our limousine transfer to the hotel.  Speedy check-in and hot tea were served by our personal porter once we were in the room.  Spacious room with beautiful habour view that overlooking Macau main island.  Complementary fruits and mini bar with choices of beers and soft drinks.  Huge bathroom where the boys enjoyed soaking themselvesin the huge Japanese bath tub every night.  Excellent spa services and massages that make me want to come back to Macau just for that.  Stayed for two nights and will be back soon!!,50
"we have travelled extensively however this hotel has set a whole new standard for us. This (waterview) room has a stunning view and the service is impeccable.  Walk in robe, large bathtub, living room area, flat screen TV - we had to force ourselves to venture outside from relaxing in our room. Highly recommended!",50
"I booked this hotel on recommendation from a friend and was blown away. From the moment you take the elevator up to the top floor lobby, you know you‚Äôre somewhere special. The view is fantastic panorama of Macau harbor and night lights and the hotel is designed so that every room has the view. The d√©cor in the lobby and restaurants is artistic and engaging, but also makes you feel relaxed and welcome. Front desk staff very friendly and helpful. The room layout makes the most of the spectacular view with bed and sofas all optimally located to soak it in. The bathroom is opulent and romantic. The gym and indoor pool are also very impressive ‚Äì it feels great to float on infinity pool high above the Macau skyline. The bar on top floor also has good atmosphere for a chill drink and‚Ä¶",50
"I am the tourist from Hong Kong and my boyfriend chose Altira as for our accommodation in Macau~  Altira's staff has a high quality of service, they are really helpful and thoughtful, sometimes even humorous. ^^ They know how to impress their customers~  From the very first step to your hotel to the end we left Macau, we can feel the warm hospitality of Altira. Also, all other facilities in the hotel are well-equipped, we spent a nice evening in the lounge and a delicious breakfast in the Aurora. (the restaurant^^)  After the trip, I wrote the first appreciation letter of my life to Altira (No kidding!)  I hope you guys can experience the same wonderful stay as mine in Altira!",50
"The Altira is one of the best hotels I ever stayed in. It was luxurious, spacious and very comfortable. I was always happy to return to the hotel after a long day outside. The spa is actually the best in Asia. The restaurants are very good. The rooms are very spacious and finally, the service is top notch.   After arriving at the Macau Ferry Terminal, we were greeted by the bell hop who was very kind. He allowed us to buy ferry tickets and waited patiently for us. The car was pretty roomy too. When we got to the hotel, everybody greeted us by our last names. Check in was fast and done in an interesting manner. The lobby was on the 38th floor facing the Macau peninsula. Since the lobby was on the 38th floor, there was an express elevator to the lobby, but no express to the rooms.‚Ä¶",50
"We chose the Altira Hotel purely on the reviews of Trip Advisor which turned out to be a sound choice. We arrived at the hotel after a late flight to Macao. We were met and returned to the airport by the hotels airport shuttle service (personal driver and car) which was excellent. On arrival at the hotel we were checked in by friendly and helpful staff that quickly registered us and showed us to our room, which was a pleasant suite of quite reasonable size with stylish and well fitted bathrooms. This was our first time in Macao and had a wonderful time.... The staff made our trip very special....including a bottle of champagne...it was my 60th birthday and they noticed that on my passport. Step above and beyond. We would recommend this hotel to any traveler; yes it was costly‚Ä¶",50
"what can you not say about this hotel,  We have stayed at many great 5 star hotels around the world, Peninsulars, orientals, etc, but the service in this hotel left them in a wake.  From the Lovely S class Mercedes-Benz to the housekeeping, totally faultless.  You arrive or should I say swept up and cocooned in service from the minute  the car arrives to the time you depart. The rooms were wonderfully appointed, restful and believe it or not for a casino, tastefully decorated, best bathroom I have ever seen. Only point  that may have let them down, is  the breakfast buffet, but I have been spoiled  with amazing breakfasts at resorts, so it would be hard to live up to this,  The presentation on the plate of cooked food was good only the buffet part was a little lack luster.  We‚Ä¶",50
"The Altira is first class all the way. The red carpet treatment started at the airport where a hotel employee greeted us on the ramp of the airplane. Yes, literally on the ramp. He took our passports and said, ""Follow me"". He ushered us to a private passport agent. We could hear people saying, ""Who are they"". Our luggage didn't arrive and our personal assistant was on it. We arrived at the hotel and check in already knew our luggage was missing. They asked what we needed to get by until it showed up. I had enough for one night, so I was all set. My associate had nothing. They got his size and preferences for toiletries and within 30 minutes returned with designer clothes, cologne, and other items! We've never experienced such service. They couldn't do enough to make us‚Ä¶",50
"From the moment you arrive the doorman leads you to a private elevator that brings you to the 38th floor for check-in. The staff is well spoken in every language, I speak 7 languages and I was fooling with them but I was amazed that they had staff members that spoke 5 different languages aside from mandarin. I won't get in to every detail regarding this hotel, if you are looking for luxury this is the place to be and be seen. Don't expect crowds, this is all about high-rollers who wish to go unnoticed. This is perhaps the most private hotel and staff you will ever encounter in any city in the world. Certain floors cannot be accessed since they are private for those who wish to not be seen when spending hundreds of thousands on single hands of baccarat. The rooms are immaculate‚Ä¶",50
"I'd stayed here for 2 nights recently, and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I got their winter promotion package, which is a relative good value.  It includes 30-minute massage in the spa, breakfast for 2 and limo transfer (in a Mercedes sedan) from/to the ferry terminal.  The room is spacious and decor elegant; it has the feel of grandness when one first walk in the spacious corridor in the room.  The separate vanity, bathroom and walk-in closet area is about half the size of the room!  The L-shaped couch in front of the floor-to-ceiling window is very comfortable, but has some stain spots that couldn't come off.   It is great for lounging and watching the big LCD TV (provided that you are not distracted by the Macau view facing you ;-). The facility in the spa is no doubt first class. ‚Ä¶",50
"Most amazing hotel I've stayed at! Located just south of Macau Island on the Taipa side. It is the tallest building on Taipa. The view is spectacular both from the lobby and the Seaside view rooms. The beds are super comfortable and spacious. Swimming pool is great as well. Not  very large, but is indoors and has a great view. Breakfast is excellent as well, though the buffet selection is a bit limited in terms of main course items. The hotel staff are warm and helpful.",50
"We stayed here in December 2009 during a visit to Hong Kong.  What a stunning hotel!  Downstairs doesn't look a lot as the lobby is up on the 38th floor, and when the lift opens it's just wow.  We stayed on the 32nd floor, so it was back down 6 floors in a different lift.  The room was large, clean and extremely comfortable with the biggest bed I've ever slept in!  The wet room had everything we needed, and when we went out in the evening the maid came in for the turndown service and replacement of any toiletries we had already opened.    The minibar was all available free of charge and there was also a well stocked fruit bowl and tea and coffee box.  There was a comfortable seating  area and huge cable TV  The staff were attentive and friendly and we'd have loved to stay‚Ä¶",50
"As we got a very valuable package with tickets from HK, we chose Crown. The location of Crown is not near old urban district nor new developed area, but this resulted a peaceful environment around.   The room is large and well equited. It is one of the most fancy one that i have even stayed. Big bath tub and rain shower. The bed is very comfortable. The lounge area is one of the best of my experience.   One thing I would highly recommand is the infinity pool. It is over looking the whole macau Peninsula. The view is absoultely stunning. The steam and sauna and Jacuzzi in the changing room worth a visit~!  The breakfast we had inroom is very nice. Arrive sharp in the order time. Nice presented and taste excellent.  Staff are all friendly, but some of the service attendent came‚Ä¶",50
"I have been staying with those very famous 5 stars hotels in macau..This is absolutely the best one that I have ever stay with. I didn't like their location a lot...but other than that...everything was almost perfect. I love their room the best..nice suite.. very cozy, so homelike they offered free high speed internet access..free softdrinks. newspaper service, fruit plate.i-pod stand.. we just stayed in the room reading ..surfing online... we ordered a room service ""club sandwich"" very delicous.the staff was always there for us. to help us. We also tried their french restaurant , nice food and good service I do believe this is the very best getaway hotel you can choose in macau We stayed there 2 nights ..there are some comments about their room cleaness..which didn't happened‚Ä¶",50
"In november 2007 I spent 2 nights at The Crown Macau. I must say it was a very pleasant experience. In the other reviews it was mentioned dat this hotel does not deserve a five star rating. (or a six star experience) Although I agree, ik think that the Crown is one of the best hotels in Macau. Food and service are very good, the design of the hotel is very special indeed. What the hotel spent on design, they saved on materials. Shower, toilet, taps, tables, walls don't have the quality you would expect. If you look closely you'll see they used cheap products with the lack craftmanship. It all was fine now but in a year or two I would expect a refurbishment would be needed.  The service was perfect, staff is very friendly and all spoke English. This I would rate 5 stars.  At‚Ä¶",50
"This was my second trip to Macau for business purposes, and the Crown is definitely the most luxurious hotel in Macau (I've also stayed at the Wynn, Venetian, and Westin in Macau). The spa is gorgeous, restuarants great - although pricey.  Much more of a boutique feel than staying at the other casino properties.  The only negative is that its in a strange location with not much around it.  There also isnt much mass gaming going on, since its mostly a VIP location, which is fine with me since I dont gamble.",50
