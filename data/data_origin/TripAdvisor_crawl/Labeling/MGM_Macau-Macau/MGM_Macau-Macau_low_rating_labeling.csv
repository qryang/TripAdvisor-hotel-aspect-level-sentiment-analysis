c15000000,s1,The staff at MGM Macau Pastry Bar was so rude
c15000000,s2,I purchased a birthday cake online
c15000000,s3,Then I went there  to pick up the cake Today
c15000000,s4,"I didn't go there on time, so they called me for 4 times"
c15000000,s5,But I missed the call as I was in the meeting
c15000000,s6,When I arrived there I showed my purchase order to the staff for picking up the cake
c15000000,s7,When the staff was packing the cake another staff spoke to me and said that she had called me for 10 times today but I didn't answer the call
c15000000,s8,The way she spoked to me was so rude and like telling me that I have created a lot of trouble bother work and that is my problem I didn’t answer the call
c15000000,s9,Is that mean I have to stand by there and do nothing to wait for your call??  In truth that is so annoying the phone is buzzing when the meeting is ongoing
c15000000,s10,In fact that…
c15000001,s1,I kept my luggage at the MGM concierge
c15000001,s2,They gave me a luggage tag so I can retrieve it
c15000001,s3,"But due to certain circumstances, I was unable to retrieve my luggage by myself at that time"
c15000001,s4,So i gave my passport to my friend to retrieve my luggage for me and as per concierge the luggage cannot be retrieved and questioned why my passport is with my friend
c15000001,s5,So my friend called me to talk to concierge staff to prove that I gave her full permission to retrieve the luggage in behalf of me
c15000001,s6,"After wasting one hour of conversation and procedure, the staff requested me to write an authority letter and attach passport together and email them, so my friend can retrieve the luggage"
c15000001,s7,By the time they receive the email from me and the authority letter it is still not enough
c15000001,s8,They still keep on…
c15000002,s1,Hi  This place has all the bells and whistles but the restaurants are way over priced for average food and even to gamble on the tables is way more than any other casinos we have been to world wide
c15000002,s2,If there minimum table limits were a little lower it would of made the gambling experience their better
c15000003,s1,I just checked in to MGM at 3pm (checked in time) and was told I can only have 1 room the other one is not ready and they do not know how long it could be! Then we took 1 room and went up and the key did not work and could not access the room then had to go all the way back to reception from 20th floor and had to stand and wait for them to issue a new key! And finally was told the other room will be an hour for it to be ready
c15000003,s2,The first receptionist staff was awful
c15000003,s3,Good job I went back downstairs and got someone more helpful
c15000003,s4,I expected more from MGM I am very disappointed with the service and don’t think I will be coming back!!!
c15000004,s1,"When our friends came at around 4:30, nobody assisted and welcomed there even there were lots of staff near the buffet"
c15000004,s2,The staff who gave our bill do not know about the price mentioned in the website
c15000004,s3,"The staff did not asked if we have membership card for discount, we have to ask her if they offer discounts"
c15000005,s1,We visited during Chinese New Year
c15000005,s2,No matter the new MGM Cotai or MGM Macau service were all slow
c15000005,s3,"The staff seems new, and don't know what they are doing"
c15000005,s4,"Try to avoid Janice Wong Cafe and Cake shop, and all kids areas"
c15000005,s5,"Compare to Wynn, MGM is really behind"
c15000006,s1,"I went to MGM with some friends for the octoberfest event, and a random caucasian pushed me when I am standing next to my table, I said that's not a route and that's guy push me like crazy"
c15000006,s2,"And the security came to separated him and then act like nothing happened, I requested for medical attention as my friend was hurt during the incident, the security seem don't care what I am asking for until I mention PJ (Macau special police)"
c15000006,s3,They arranged the guy for apology but I don't think the guy was told what he is coming for and seem the security told him I am going to say sorry to him
c15000006,s4,"And I requested to call PJ again but this time the security let the guy left and I requested the security to check CCTV for the incident, after waiting for 20 min they came back and said the CCTV was…"
c15000007,s1,This hotel is absolutely depressing
c15000007,s2,The whole place needs a revamp
c15000007,s3,The lighting was absolutely awful and the design barely fit for a gambling addict
c15000007,s4,"That said, VIP services were excellent, and the food was yummy"
c15000008,s1,MGM pastry bar
c15000008,s2,"A quite worse impression for me to invite a friend who came abroad to have an afternoon leisure time, the staff offered bad manner for us, who should have put the stuff on the table lightly"
c15000008,s3,"as well when we asked sth about the drinks, she even got no idea for that, I meant compared what's difference between two type of tea, a simple information the staff should have known who worked in a hotel, isn't that?"
c15000009,s1,"need to take ticket for shuttle bus when other casino dont need,you can see how stingy they are,better dont play there and play somewhere else"
c15000009,s2,"inside very gloomy and environment sucks,waitress very rude,disgusting place,worst casino in macau"
c15000010,s1,"I booked a room on a week in advance, check in on late afternoon and i had to wait for a room for 25 min"
c15000010,s2,", and i had to sleep on a single bed"
c15000010,s3,"I was very disappointed, after a long day i was expecting to be treat as a guest in a 5 start L hotel, but didn't happen"
c15000010,s4,I hope service will improve to be avoid in those accident
c15000011,s1,I go to macau with my family last weekend
c15000011,s2,"We book two rooms at MGM for $3,XXX for each but we only got two standard size rooms!!!  We are very disappointed about the hotel as follows:  1"
c15000011,s3,The corridor of the non-smoking floor is smelly
c15000011,s4,2
c15000011,s5,The room size is only standard
c15000011,s6,3
c15000011,s7,The decoration and design is old style and not deluxe
c15000011,s8,4
c15000011,s9,We need to walk more than 15 mins to the main attractions
c15000011,s10,5
c15000011,s11,"Check in time is late at 3pm, but check out time is early at 11am"
c15000011,s12,6
c15000011,s13,The blanket have stinks
c15000011,s14,Dirty!!!  7
c15000011,s15,Someone suddenly go inside your room to make up in the afternoon
c15000011,s16,8
c15000011,s17,The curtain of the transparent bathroom is control outside the bathroom!  9
c15000011,s18,"The quality of the restaurant chefs is very poor, they can't cook well even a fry egg!  10, The quality of the breakfast is not good, but…"
c15000012,s1,"This is my second time to stay here, grand deluxe room"
c15000012,s2,I came back because Wynn fulled and I was satisfied with my first stay in grand studio
c15000012,s3,Everything was fine and the lobby was not as crowded as some other Macau hotels
c15000012,s4,But my nightmare came before check-out! Hotel checkout time is 11:00 which is earlier than some of the Macau hotel at 12:00
c15000012,s5,"At 11am sharp, when I was packing my thing, the hotel staffs keep ringing my TOILET room phone for 3 times without saying a word, I think this is the way they use to wake their guest up from bed"
c15000012,s6,"After 5 mintues, a hotel staff (a man) open my room door without permission"
c15000012,s7,"Yes, he has knocked the door but at the same time opening my door"
c15000012,s8,"Within 2 seconds for me to reach the door from bedroom, he has already opened the door and ask me…"
c15000013,s1,Nice hotel with a very relaxing room
c15000013,s2,the buffet restaurant was better this time and the staff are very helpful
c15000013,s3,The patisserie has a very delicious pastries but the staff working at the lions bar small dark guy was rude to us and has an attitude problem
c15000014,s1,The worse Spa experience ever
c15000014,s2,"After checking in, I was taken to the Spa area and left to my own device"
c15000014,s3,The attendant just disappeared without explaining to me the facilities available
c15000014,s4,"I felt tempted to try the ""Experience Shower"" but as soon as I pressed the button for the small jet I felt a burning sensation on my face"
c15000014,s5,"I initially thought that I had touched something not clean and therefore I pressed the bigger jet button in order to rinse off, but then the pain got worse"
c15000014,s6,"That's when I realized that the water of the shower contained a high concentration of mint, which was causing the sensation of burn"
c15000014,s7,"With difficulty as I couldn't open my eyes, I exited the ""Experience Shower"" and took a warm shower for 10mns to rinse off the mint concentration"
c15000014,s8,"During this whole time,…"
c15000015,s1,Stayed for 5 days in Mar 2013 with wife and one and a half year old baby girl
c15000015,s2,Not the first time staying in this hotel but the bad experience has not changed a bit
c15000015,s3,"Check in at 12 pm, was informed room not ready until 3 pm"
c15000015,s4,Try my luck again to check in at 1
c15000015,s5,"30 pm with a sleeping baby, room is still not ready but the Chinese nation man beside me with just a MGM red colour membership card and no passport identification was able to check into a City view Grand Room within 3 minutes which was the same room type that I book"
c15000015,s6,"Finally at 3 pm, check in again and the room is still not ready"
c15000015,s7,"The MGM cleaning staff must be having a very long lunch plus tea break! Finally, front desk checked with her manager and ""ofter me an upgrade"" to a sea view grand room"
c15000015,s8,Nothing to say about about…
c15000016,s1,"We took a complimentary bus from the ferry station to the hotel and checked into MGM around 2:50pm was told our room was not ready yet and it would be ready in an hour's time, when the check in time was at 3pm"
c15000016,s2,So we weren't happy and then the staff asked us if it was ok to have a smoking room but we refused as we asked for a non-smoking room
c15000016,s3,She then went onto say if we could just check into the room first and then could transfer to the new non-smoking room in an hour's time
c15000016,s4,"We were upgraded to a room with the view of the sea, which wasn't very nice anyway"
c15000016,s5,"The room was very spacious with alot of storage, mini bar, refridgerator, Tv, clock, safe, complimentary drinking water, slippers"
c15000016,s6,No free wi-fi
c15000016,s7,"The bathroom was very spacious with separate shower and toilet, with a…"
c15000017,s1,"This hotel is at a good location, right next to the Wynn and a nice walk to the old part of town, but sadly, that is all that is good with this property! The Casino was ok, but then again, none of the casino in Macau can stand up to LV"
c15000017,s2,"Macau is more like Reno then LV! Our room was poorly maintained, bathtub did not hold water (really!!), bathroom was not particularly clean, shower floods the bathroom floor"
c15000017,s3,"Overall disappointing for a room that cost almost $300 US a night! On the other hand, staff at the front desk and bell station was extremely polite and efficient!"
c15000018,s1,Staying at the MGM Grand Macau for 4 nights was a really bad experience for me
c15000018,s2,I had the biggest suite which was something about 138m
c15000018,s3,"When I have just arrived to the hotel lobby, I was redirected to the ""Vip Lobby"" for an express Check-in, but unfortunately the check-in took about 30min, because I had in front of me someone that didn't understand what I was saying (I was talking english), that person had a very cold welcome and was releasing a very negative energy that was making me feel uncomfortable"
c15000018,s4,"Once the long check-in process finished, I was pleasantly surprised by the room size and facilities, to be honest it was just outstanding!"
c15000018,s5,"Jacuzzi in front of a sea view, huge dressing room, comfortable bed"
c15000018,s6,etc
c15000018,s7,During my whole stay I had experienced some other good things…
c15000019,s1,I went to the countdown party with my girlfriend
c15000019,s2,The cost was $500 hk p/p and you get 2 standard drinks
c15000019,s3,It had a live band and some good music
c15000019,s4,"My problem and the reason why I felt rip off is I went to buy a drink, each drink is worth $60, But you cant pay with cash"
c15000019,s5,So I had to buy a cash voucher
c15000019,s6,"The only cash voucher is only $100, I asked if i can buy $120 So I can could have 2 drinks and they said No"
c15000019,s7,The cheapest bottle was $600 hk which I didn't want to buy
c15000019,s8,"I did my maths, I have to buy $300 worth of vouchers just to get my moneys worth so I don't lose a  cent"
c15000019,s9,"The voucher could not be exchanged for cash, and I could not get my $40  back,   I made a complaint, complementing the hotel on their sneaky way of rip people off for 2012, They told me they didn't think of…"
c15000020,s1,"After being told we had been ""upgraded"" imagine the surprise when we were billed for the upgraded room"
c15000020,s2,"Even after disputing this fact, they tell use that we in fact asked for the upgrade and they would not budge and still charged us"
c15000020,s3,The receipt even shows a handwritten amendment to the final price
c15000020,s4,I'm still shaking my head in disbelief
c15000021,s1,I went to the patisserie with my mother on 4/15
c15000021,s2,"When we ordered from the menu(Chinese & English available on the menu),a waitress came whose name is Richie Wang"
c15000021,s3,"I ordered in Chinese,funny how she spoke english(pronounciation is not good) to me"
c15000021,s4,So i need to changed my language
c15000021,s5,That's 1 point
c15000021,s6,"2nd,when we asked for the bill,she just  tell me the total amount verbally without showing me the bill"
c15000021,s7,I have no idea if this is 1 of the hotel standard
c15000021,s8,"When i ask if i can have a look of the bill,she said "" same""in chinese and i can see her not willing to get it even it's only few steps from the bill counter"
c15000021,s9,I was very angry after all
c15000021,s10,Then i made a complaint to 1 of her senior(philippino lady)
c15000021,s11,She was polite and apologised
c15000021,s12,"When i made the complaint,Richie Wang was standing beside the…"
c15000022,s1,We stayed here for one night and I am surprised to find all the good reviews MGM receives
c15000022,s2,"This is not a 5-star hotel, the toiletries, the bath amenities, the beddings, lighting all spells cheap"
c15000022,s3,"3 light are out in our room, and the lighting in general is very dim"
c15000022,s4,"The toilet door / shower door are badly designed, and they could bang into each other, or you could bang into one of these easily"
c15000022,s5,"Never seen a smaller pillow in any other hotels in the world, and we both had neck pain after a night's sleep"
c15000022,s6,"The painting on the wall is slanted because there is not enough room for the lamp (doesn't really bother the functionality, but this is just not what you expect from a 5-star hotel)"
c15000022,s7,"No spare towels, no bathrobes unless on request"
c15000022,s8,Swimming pool is not heated
c15000022,s9,Sofa is aged…
c15000023,s1,"The interior of the hotel is nice, but the service rendered is definitely not up to it"
c15000023,s2,The service at Aux Beaux Arts Restaurant is horrible
c15000023,s3,"Food is so-so, but the attitude of team is way below acceptable"
c15000023,s4,"Note: if you are food person, go stay at the Venetian where you will be spoilt for choices; here, you only eat at the few expensive restaurants"
c15000023,s5,The operator forgot our morning call request and we missed our early ferry to Hong Kong
c15000023,s6,There were 2 power blackouts on the first night
c15000023,s7,We wrote a feedback to the hotel but they don't seem apologetic
c15000023,s8,I guess they just lost us
c15000024,s1,"we went to visit the venetian on a day trip from hong kong on the hydrofoil,liked what we saw of macau and returned for 3 days at the mgm grand"
c15000024,s2,when we arrived in the free shuttle bus from the ferry (should guests with bookings be offered a minibus) we checked in
c15000024,s3,"there was no offer to take our bags to the room,something that happened religeously in hong kong no matter how much we paid"
c15000024,s4,"at the end of our stay we checked out and asked the concierge to arrange a taxi he replied our chances were nil,when we enquired about the shuttle he said that it only operated from the back entrance"
c15000024,s5,"we were then forced to carry our bags throught the casino with the added insult of having our bags searched to get through the casino,no one offered to help with the bags"
c15000024,s6,The mgm grand is a bit more…
