Enjoyed our staycation at Venetian. Beautiful and huge suite with Cotai strip view. Lots of options for dining and enjoyed the tickets for Teamlab too. Choice of TV channels too limited though. Would recommended. ,50
"I had a great stay during my anniversary stay-cation! Front desk staff, i think her name is Sophie/ Sophia was very helpful and accommodating. She is very patient with my inquiries and the bellman Sam is also very nice to me and very entertaining all the way until we arrive to my room. They sent me a complimentary cake for my celebration which is very thoughtful and sweet. Got an upgraded room as well. I was treated very well and i loved the breakfast too!  Hope to stay again soon!",50
"I reached casino city Macao via ferry, upon exiting the ferry station I could see a fleet of hotel buses provided complimentary to pick up hotel guests. A swift 20 minute ride  to the hotel. The Venetian Macau resort is truly enormous ! It houses a hotel, casino, several malls and food courts and special attractions for tourists. One section of the food court is built exactly like Venice, complete with a water body and operational boats. We had a booked a king suite for 5 nights. Check in was smooth and quick. The suite was impressive, with an ensuite bathroom complete with a shower area,bath tub,dressing room and separate toilet. The suite also had a huge drawing room with comfortable couches, big screen tv, study desk, coffee maker mini bar etc. and a killer view ! Housekeeping understands basic English and service is fast. Breakfast buffet has many Indian food options to cater the guests. Casino is fun to try entry age is 25. The hotel buses are very convenient for sightseeing and they drop you off to other resorts and hotels free of cost. …",50
"The canal and the shopping areas make  you feel that you are in Italy. The sky is  realistic. Overall, beautiful decorations. The shops are very sweet.the steets is very beautiful and also very lovely .",50
"A worth it long walk! Roaming around the Venetian Macau Resort Hotel is exhausting if it is your first time and you are looking for Venetian Grand Canal. Boat Operator was a great singer too! I loved their voice, echoed in the area.",50
"Among the many five-star hotels and resort Macau has, the Venetian is probably the pick of the bunch. The hotel is more than just a hotel and just a resort; it's like a mini-city, where once inside, one may not know whether it is day or night; such is the activity that happens here.  When we checked in, we were given a 'passport', which came with breakfast vouchers and complimentary tickets to a show and other attractions inside. We did attend them and they were more than worth it. We spent time at the many casinos in the hotel and enjoyed, though we did not win anything.   The hotel is so big; it's easy to lose your way. We had a tough time finding our room. However, the room itself was awesome; it was more a suite. Everything from the decor to the facilities to the large…",50
we had a good three nights here  the hotel is huge! but very nice the staff were helpful and nice the room was nice and big and very clean. the place was so big we got lost few time but it was fun .  breakfast was good and if you pay in advance in the reception they give you a better price for it . there were plenty of taxis to take u to old macau. we did that 2-3 times,50
"Its a mini Macau with all attractions inside the complex - from Hotel to different restaurants, shopping arcade, entertainment arena including a Venetian canal for boating, Multiplexes and Casino to mention just a few of attractions. Just 10 mins from Macau airport with very good transport 24x7 to all directions of Macau, it is the best place to experince Macau.   Stayed for 3 days in the hotel's East lobby - rooms are excellent, breakfast is superb with variety & quality.",50
"Really love it every detail! Surely will come back again with my partner! Friendly staff, nice service :)) worth every penny. The place is huge. Very clean, cozy, luxury, and makes me want to stay longer! Hahaha",50
"The  Venetian Macao is a great hotel with huge room and good amenities. Thanks to Yutki Mehra for accommodating our requests and upgrading our room.   The location of hotel is quite good since it is near to aiport. Unfortunately, we arrive late evening that’s why no hotel bus is available for transport from the airport. But one thing is good, there is no que when we arrived that’s why we’re able to take good pictures without people on site. Our room is welcoming with nice city view.  We were able to ride the Gondola and it was fun. There are many shops and good to have a bridge to Parisian Macao, which made our transfer so easily.  This is an overwhelming experience.  Be back for sure!",50
"We did not stay at The Venetian Macau as we had originally planned for this upcoming Lunar New Year because of personal reasons. However, I would like to commend the staff and the hotel for their professionalism and graciousness from the start when we made reservations to accommodating our special requests to the unfortunate cancellation of our stay. We are definitely looking forward to travelling to Macau at another opportune time and definitely booking and staying with The Venetian Macau when the chance arises.",50
"Simply loved it. This hotel has everything. It's one of the most popular hotels in Macau. You'll surely find long queues at the check in counter, but not to worry, they have many check in counters. They have amazing restaurants, my personal favourite is the golden peacock which serves amazing indian food. You can use your breakfast coupons to either have breakfast or lunch at participating restaurants. They also have a mall inside the hotel with various shops. They also have a food court, which gives you a variety of small food outlets offering various cuisines. The hotel interiors are beautiful and they have a massive casino. Rooms are huge, they have all suite style rooms, with all the basic amenities. Staff is super supportive and helpful. Loved my stay with family, and will…",50
We stay in 2 night in Venetian room was so nice . Great shopping mall area with great restaurants around the hotel area . Good facilities proved by hotel with free shuttle bus in Macau can go anywhere.,50
"Visited this hotel twice this NY trip and thrice from 2011. It still hasn’t lost its charm. Shops are aplenty, food court is a life saver, transportation is ever ready.  Just to share our experience on the shuttles we took from Macau Peninsula to Venetian (Cotai). We took the City of Dreams and Studio City  shuttle buses going to the City of Dreams (just in front of the Venetian Hotel). The station is located a few meters away from the waiting area of the shuttle buses of the Grand Emperor Hotel.  There is also the Venetian shuttle bus route (Cotai Connection) which brings you around Cotai. The connection will also bring you to Wynn Palace which also has a shuttle to Wynn Macau located in the Macau Peninsula as well.",40
"Getting there by sea bound double decker over the fantastic HKMacau bridge was faultless and a tribute to Chinese endeavour. I can think of few bridge crossings that evoke such memories such as the Tay Bridge Scotland or River Seven M4 bridge. Half an hour of perfect harmony zooming cross the 70 km separation of Hong Kong SAR and Macau with options to visit ithe  PRC. Ticketing, queueing and helpful boarding instructions were  smooth beyond compare and whilst arrival at Macau was a little different with not so much brilliant signage, exiting was swift and conveyance to local transport  either free bus to the casinos or taxi or local car hire services was good.",50
"Hotel consider clean and nicely renovated .. but seriously overcrowded with people all over the place , service at the reception could be improve . This resort have everything and easy access to cab , ferry and busses . ",40
"Venetian Macau is huge, amazing and unbelievable. A small city within a huge building. It’s not necessary to get out. The rooms are big. We really enjoyed the stay. In general: Macau is completely different to Las Vegas. While in Vegas huge restaurants, bars and nightclubs are part of the Hotel, in Macau is still the Casino and the Shops the dominated part.",50
Nice hotel but the service orientation of the employees could be improved. Rooms have been clean. Casino and the shopping mall have been average when compared to other hotels in Coron. Lunch was ok but not more.,40
"A surreal place to spend any amount of time in Macao.  The Venetian is just gigantic, everything is larger than life.  The 70 sq mtre rooms are so big, with a huge bathroom and 2 televisions!  The complex is based around gambling, but the amount of shops in the huge concourse is unbelievable.  You could stay for a year and probably eat at a different place each night!  An amazing family experience.",50
"I wanted to spoil my wife and daughter during our overnight stay in Macau and there is no better place to do that than at the Venetian. There isn’t a bad room in the hotel. Our suite was huge and luxurious. But as much as I wanted to stay in the room, there is so much to see and do at the resort that we forced ourselves to go out and explore. I appreciated the free shuttle to the ferry terminal and to the Sands. ",50
Amazing  and huge Hotel  Like Las Vegas in USA  The view was stunning and can see other hotels  nearby like Parisian and Sheraton  The breakfast was rich and delicious  I was very satisfied about the cleaning  And the staff,50
"So impressed with the cleanliness and beautifully made up beds during check in.  Also, Moon, the Room Attendant served us well with a cheerful heart and smile to our needs and request.  Hotel public areas are spick and span with shiny floors.  Will definitely come again.",50
"we enjoyed our stay, especially due to a staff - Moon. she paid great attention to the little details and ensured cleanliness of the room. She was helpful and even helped us solve our issue of a broken luggage. Her action was definitely well-noted of and helped enhanced the experience of our stay. Whenever we needed help or any amenities, she would be quick to respond and provide us with the amenities needed. She is definitely a great staff that have enhanced our stay experience.",50
"We booked The Venetian Macau for a special celebration and the experience exceeded our high expectations thanks to exceptional service and especially the personal attention and action by Yukti Mehra and Anita.  Even as an IHG Ambassador members and frequent travellers who are used to special treatment, my wife and I felt that Yukti made us feel extra special and went the extra mile to ensure we had a memorable  The combination of pre-stay contact, warm VIP welcome, allocation of a high floor suite with a great view, super tasty cake, fruit, framed photo gift, personalised recommendations and follow-through to ensure we are having a great time, made us feel we could not have picked a better hotel in Macau to celebrate our anniversary.  Following Yukti’s recommendation we also…",50
We stayed at the Bella Suite for 3 nights with my family. The service was very quick. No hustle upon check in. Everything went smooth. Thanks to Ms. Kimmy at the reception. She made everything she can for our stay to be perfect. She was a detail oriented person. It was indeed a great experience.   The only thing I could suggest is to have a bidet shower inside the toilet room.,50
"It was my 3rd time with this hotel. Always proves to be a good decision. You think of anything and the next moment you’ll find a related shop. Amazing food,super amazing staff. They are always one step ahead to assist. In love with the hotel and would highly recommend to friends and family!",50
"Venetian staff are very accommodating, especially Julienne at front desk or check-in desk.  Also, Jeff and Gerald of the concierge was really helpful, my mom was able to stroll around and dine with ease. Mom really love to shop so having a wheelchair to take her around with is a superb plus 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼.",50
"Nice Integrated resort for family....Gaming, Shopping, Food and basically hang loose. Walking distance to other Gaming resorts like Galaxy and Paris . A number of high tech gaming stations  if you don't wish to play with others at the table games. Free high speed WiFi for 28 days. ",50
"Stayed here for one night while on an adventure across Asia.  Having been to Vegas many times I expected the same from Macau.  The hotel looks and feels almost identical to Vegas.  Very nice large rooms just as those in Vegas also.  All very similar until you get down to the gambling.  No drinks while gambling, not even a bar on the floor!  Only Asian themed slots.  Had fun but do not expect Macau to be a party or have the energy of Vegas.  We enjoyed it however we wouldn’t need to go back.",50
"Amazing architecture, we visited the Indian restaurant (golden peacock) and the staff especially Jen sen was courteous and helpful. The food was delicious and spicy as requested. We would love to visit again.",50
My favorite hotel🍓rooms are really spacious but this room is my favorite it has its own lawn and the bathroom was amazing all the amenities was excellent its is a get away place for me for it includes a lot of amazing activities inside the property  🍓🍓🍓,50
"The rooms are huge and comfortable with great views of the city. Premium services, exclusive amenities, make you feel like a king throughout the stay all in all a wonderful experience. Worth every penny. ",50
"The Venetian is like teleporting to Venice. Only, a more sophisticated version of the much loved Italian city. Enjoy some amazing views of gondolas, cityscapes and the grandeur of the Venetian Macao.   Shoppers and dinners will also be spoilt for choice, as the Venetian hosts many international clothing brands and food chains.   A must see for visitors to Macao. ",50
"Some of friends told me to stay here before i die :) so i tried it and i they were true. I enjoyed every second of my stay there. The building was so huge. Lobby was super duper sophisticated. not only the architecture but also the service. they served us very quick but you didn't feel in hurry. room was outstanding. 40sqm room with big and comfy bed, luxury bathroom, sofa and event dining table inside. so i can say it's a 7 stars hotel",50
Rooms are spacious and gives palatial feel. Staff if very helpful nd friendly.  They have kids play area which is paid. They have temperature controlled swimming and also provide floats for kids. Hotels has everything that one needs.,50
"I hotel and surrounding area is unbelievably opulent and hence ridiculously bizarre. Many ways it resembles Las Vegas in terms of tone and feel, but I would say it is even more extravagant and, of course, has a distinctive and omnipresent Chinese flavor.    I had dinner the other day in a Korean restaurant in The Venetian, served by Chinese people who spoke Portuguese, under the Skies of an Italian Piazza.  I found the hotel itself to be impeccable, and the rooms impressive. Because of the high humidity, some rooms might smell a slight bit musty. The casino is perennially crowded making a lower-floors busy, but it's not overpoweringly so.",50
"Great hotel! Rooms are amazing, very large, super modern and luxurious. There is everything and more. The service is super professional, attentive and friendly. The food of the restaurants was super good. I loved it here!",50
"Great service throughout the hotel, it made our trip memorable since it was my mothers 80th bday.  Thanks for the cake Venetian! The adventure started upon check in when front staff was very accommodating. Dinners were fun as well. Best check out the food court for your cravings/",40
"One of finest luxurious hotel I ever had . What a royal room , super spacious, fully modern, fully functional equipped . Food was super amazing. They welcomed us with some amazing cupcakes. Poolside area was mesmerised us. Bonus is casino. ",50
"We arrived at the hotel on 29/10 The buggy process was not fast and professional even after the credit card problem The problem was created because the card with which the room was paid was in my possession but did not work because it was declared stolen after receiving the room We noticed that the bathroom floor was broken We called immediately to the hotel reception The treatment we received from clerk Joy was prompt and wonderful after dinner we were given another room on the higher floor and of course without any problems  The suites are large and spacious, there is a possibility for smokers, the cleanliness of the rooms is good, the service is excellent, the restaurants are nice especially the red dragon noodles, the casino is huge in size  Thank you so much for a great…",50
"The suite we had was amazing and beautiful. The view we had was the city of dream. The room was super luxurious, and spacious. plenty of room. the bathroom is heavenly. I used the bath for a good soak and it definitely took my stress away. I think the only down side to the hotel was the mall, plenty of walking and there aren't enough directions and signs. However, if you love to walk and looking around, you will enjoy going around the labyrinth of a mall and see a variety of stores and branded shops. Go on a gondola ride as well and listen to the gondoliers sing you a song.  For me however, the hotel was more an adult escapade rather than family. It may not be child friendly as there are more activities for adults rather than children but there's a playhouse which you have to…",40
誕生日に合わせて宿泊することをホテルの方に事前にお伝えすると、 眺めの良い部屋にしてくださり、素敵な滞在になりました。 サプライズのためにお願いしたバルーンアートやワインなどもスムーズに準備してくださり、 とても喜んでもらえました。 西洋風の素敵なホテルで、マカオ滞在ではまた伺いたいです。  I told the hotel in advance that I would stay for my birthday. It was a nice stay with a room with a view. The balloon art and wine requested for the surprise were also prepared smoothly. My husband was very happy. A nice western style hotel. I would like to visit again in Macau. ,50
"I was here for 3 nights, the rooms are pretty spacious as they all are suites. Staff is okaish helpful. Hotel is pretty big and lots of shops to spend your time and money. Many hotels inter connected. Concierge was very helpful. Check in and check out process was pretty smooth. They even allowed early check-in.",40
"Though the checkin process takes longer but the rooms are big and comfortable. For Indian food there is s Indian restaurant inside and others as well close by. The hotel itself is quiet big and beautiful. Gondola ride is a must, it’s a good experience.",50
"This is one of the best hotels I have ever been to. Such huge ambience, beautiful place . The rooms are so luxurious and beautiful. We had an amazing stay there. The mall and casino inside the venetian are just amazing. Must visit place.",50
"Despite a not so welcoming check in (Venetian staff quite unwilling to allow us to change from double to twin suite cos we made booking via external providers), we had a wonderful 3 days.  Choi, the conceige, was very helpful in assisting with booking the Water Show for us on the same night, explained how to get around shuttle buses and provided advice on quirky restaurants and not so touristy sites. Thnx so very much, Choi  We were at the pool and there was hardly any one there, so the pool staff reall6 friendly and chatty (in a veyu respectful manner) and offeted to help us take photos. We had a really relaxing and enjoyable time.  The suite was fabulous and so was the bathroom and toilet. Can't fault the location too - a 15min walk to Taipa street stalls. Don't miss Lord…",50
"This is our 3rd stay here and the longest as we made Macau our homebase. The civil unrest in HK made us stay in the former British Colony for just day, review of that later. As always luggage deposit, check in, provided you reply to the express checkin that they will send to your email address a few days before your checkin date, was breeze. You can roam around the place knowing your luggage will be in your room when you get there. The hotel is big...keep a map handy ( from concierge)  and mark the shops you might want to go back to. There are touch screen electronic maps strategically located around the area. If in case you need something that room service cannot deliver, there is 24hr Noble Convenience store. I would have given it a 5 star if weren't for one thing. They have…",40
"I booked a one stay for my parents 50th wedding anniversary. We were greeted by Stanley as we got off the shuttle bus. He was super friendly. The queues for check in looked short so we checked in. Kenny at check in was also friendly  and efficient. He wished my parents a happy anniversary. Our rooms were spacious and clean with great bathrooms.  The hotel arranged for an anniversary cake to be sent to my parents room. They were very happy about this.  We loved the hotel and thought the staff were very friendly. The only reason I haven't given it a 5 star rating is because of the food  choice. We could not find anything suitable to eat at the food court. Apart from a burger bar, the rest of the counters are all Far Eastern/Asian restaurants. My family do not eat Asian food and…",40
"It’s not the first time I stayed at the Venetian Macao. Rooms are a great size and better than around the other hotels. Check in it’s kind of complicated and you need to walk a long way through the Casino where they check your bags to get to the south wing. Rooms are nice and clean but towels in the washroom are old and not fluffy anymore. Overall a good hotel once you checked in. Security not sure about it, what’s the point if you have a big bag and they ask you to open it and only look on the top, they can’t see what’s below or in the other bags. Doesn’t make much sense ",40
"""The Venetian"" Macau was like a Dream come true. Mesmerizing place and Very Beautiful rooms. It is a grand property with Mall, Hotel , casino, restaurants and food court with different cuisines.  We stayed at Bella Deluxe Suite with 2 queen size beds, a living area and grand bathroom. One must experience ""The Venetian"" when in Macao. Macao is one hour ferry journey or 3 hours bus journey from Hongkong.  The Gandola ride is done in a small lazy river kind of water body inside the mall which makes the place feel active and vibrant.  Casino experience in itself was a great one, it is a 24 hour casino.  You can actually spend good 3 days inside exploring the place. ",50
"Definitely had the highest expectations for this hotel because of its price. Fortunately, my expectations were met and even exceeded. Their Premio Royale Suite was the best. Well maintained and writes luxury all over it. Everything was 5 star. You would not wish your stay to end really. The casino and the mall was amazing, you could definitely spend hours upon hours just roaming around. If you're goal is to experience the luxury, then this could be a nice hotel to consider in the midst of all the luxurious hotels in Macau.",50
This was by far one of the most luxurious hotel we stayed..! Macao is mostly a city of Hotels and Casinos and this is where most of the action is.   The canals inside the property was worth a visit and created an extravaganza with no parallel.,50
"We booked a room here unexpectedly as the original hotel we arrange to stay in was too small so we treated ourselves to a superior room the standard in here is absolutely fantastic two TVs, sofa a desk a very large bathroom and a massive bed.  The hotel itself is massive, if anything too big; trying to find your way around is difficult I struggle to get my head around the enormity of it here and what makes it frustrating is that so many staff do not speak English so cannot direct you when you get lost which is quite often.  There are computerised boards which you can punch in the shop or restaurant which you are looking for and it is meant to give you directions but does not.  My one complaint though has to be about the casinos themselves I enjoy Poker, however the number of…",40
"Out of this world experience. very clean room, first class amenities. Excellent hotel. i would highly recommend this hotel. Awesome bathroom, having a royal touch.Huge property having everything under one roof. finally i would rare it with a 6 star.",50
"The hotel itself is huge. Very easy to get lost however we had a very helpful guide and our check-in staff were similarly helpful in explaining the layout (along with a map of the complex).  The room was lovely. Very clean, spacious and luxurious with an amazing view.  Facilities were great too. The pool area was lovely, and almost deserted (most people were in the casino!). The gym was also quiet, clean and very well stocked with great equipment.  Lastly, we’d like to give a special mention to Yukti Mehra in guest relations. She was brilliant in giving us helpful advice and went the extra mile to make us feel extremely welcome. She is an asset to the hotel and really made our stay extra special.  Would definitely recommend a stay here if you’re heading to Macau. ",50
"The hotel itself was stunning, however the check in process was terrible.We had to walk through a massive shopping center to find our room armed with a map of how to get there. This was a very bad experience. The Casino had the worst, rudest, slowest and unfriendly dealers I have ever come across. They treated the players like second class citizens and were painfully slow. For Gambling I would never visit again.",40
"The Venetian is a huge property and getting to and from your room to anywhere else is a long journey. However, the Hotel itself is excellent, well maintained, friendly and helpful staff, beautiful rooms and all of the facilities you could want. We used the Pools several times, there are several including adults only and were very well managed and maintained. Given the sheer scale of the resort, there's no bespoke service and it's not luxurious, but its a well run, high standard hotel with excellent staff. Location is superb on the Cotai strip.",40
"We had a great time at the hotel. It is huge without a doubt and you will get lost a couple of times, but the rooms are large and you cannot hear a sound from downstairs mall and casino. It’s a unique experience and I recommended staying here",50
"From sheung wan ferry terminal (hongkong island) you must have cotai turbo jet ticket , this recomended you must buy together with hotel voucher from agoda or booking.com, thats very cheap deals ticket for 2 ways and 2 people acomodation following hotel room,  From sheung wan go to taipa ferry terminal around 1 hour, and after imigration pass you can go to bus stop at same level building, please find Venetian bus for free shuttle, you also can use another hotel bus but please check the circle route that also drop at venetian hotel west lobby.

Very pretty hotel with a river throughout. Only thing it is very busy. lots of shops to browse through. feels like you are in a different world similar to the one in Las vegas. free shuttle bus goes between the casinos in the area,40
"The mammoth scale was apparent from the build up en route but nothing prepares for the actual experience. It is a case study for hospitality in clockwork precision from check in, housekeeping in-room service. It is more of a city, than a hotel. Loved the rooms, generously endowed with space and lovingly furnished, with a lovely view of a golf course below- sight for sore eyes. Specific mention for the response times to service requests, the unending food and retail options.  They could help with signs and directions, because it is a place where you could easily get lost. The icing on the experience was checkout, they took the card asked if anything had been consumed from mini bar, then dropped the cards into a dispenser. Checkout voila... impressive.",50
Stayed at this hotel in last week of June 2019. I must say that the hotel lives up to its expectation.  Breakfast at the cafe is awesome for Indians and the suite is spacious and beautiful. Everyone comes to Venetian when they are in Macau and therefore it is the best place to stay for full use of your time. Don't miss the Venetian pools for a lovely experience.,50
"It was our first time traveling to macau-hongkong. We were group of friends and we really dont have an idea where to go. So upon arrival in macau, we ride a free shuttle bus going to Venetian Hotel. When we got there, we were all shock because the Hotel was so fancy and huge. It was so amazing to be there although we did not book a room. So just as expected, we were all lost and don't know where to go. Then I decided to go to the concierge and a Filipino staff, if im not mistaken he's name was Juban. He provided us will all the detailed instructions on how to get to Hongkong by bus. He also informed us what bus should we take when we get to Hongkong. We had an amazing stay in hongkong and when we went back to macau i tried looking for Juban just to say thank you, but i couldn't…",50
"The hotel is a massive and is even bigger than the version in Vegas. It looks very similar, but the hotel itself and especially the casino area is huge. They have free shuttle buses from the Macau airport or the ferry dock so getting there is easy (just be aware the buses are not 24 hrs).  Check-in was a little tough since the line to check-in was really long and had to wait for about 30 minutes to talk a front desk person. The staff spoke English well, but just like the Vegas version, I had to drag my suitcase across the casino to the elevators which was a pain. Also unlike the casinos in Vegas, the Macau casinos all have barriers and guards who sometimes will check ID as it seems minors are strictly forbidden even from going through the casino.  The rooms were almost identical…",40
"We don’t need to say how beautiful, dazzling, comfortable, luxurious the hotel is, everybody comes here to experience the magic. So a word about service , which is excellent- from office managers, concierge to their manager Sherin , everybody was super courteous! Sherin was especially helpful with his suggestions which helped us navigate our way through the hotel & the city. Also very humane- we had to extend a night’s stay in the hotel because Macau was hit by typhoon & our ferry to hongkong cancelled, so they gave us the extra night at a marked down price. The restaurant are very good , the Golden Peacock for fusion Indian & others for Asian.",50
"I visited The Venetian with my family in August, 2019 and stayed for a couple of nights. It was one of the best properties that I have stayed at. The rooms are not just spacious but rather huge. The food was good with vegetarian options also. The staff was friendly, polite and a special mention for Mr. Sam Ahmed, at the front desk who was very caring and cooperative and ensured that all our needs and comforts were taken care of. Highly recommended.",50
"Even though our teenage daughters are not allowed to get in the Casino they can enjoy themselves by shopping,eating,and relaxing in the recreation area of the resort. The VENETIAN architecture is excellent designed consist of beautiful big bedrooms with nice decoration and clean linen,provided with all kinds of facilities and ammunition. Two Big Screen TV , working table,dining table,comfortable sofa. Moreover Artificial Sky in the food court seems like we are not indoors of the hotel. For me myself the taste of several kinds of international food in the food court is the best provided.",50
Venition Macau ..... beautiful ambiance gud food shopping boating everything was awesome in the hotel property. Casino of Venition is super class . it is look like a puzzle . Totally venition Macau is heaven on the earth .,50
I am looking for a hotel for my marriage proposal and Shirley Chua of The Venetian can respond my request in an efficient way and offer me different proposals to ease my worries. I want to express on my appreciation on her helpful in all my request and providing on time services.  I am looking forward for this trip to visit this famous hotel.   第一次預約威尼斯人度假村酒店感覺十分滿意，還未到入住已經很期待。職員熱心幫忙，回覆電郵很迅速，能提供額外服務和幫助，令我感動。,50
"If your in Macau do not miss this, not the best from outside but be blown away once you step inside it’s unbelievable, your going to spend a few hours just walking around taking in the magnificent building and shops by the hundreds. The food tends to be aimed at the Asian side but still great if your hungry don’t forget the camera.",50
"Very highly recommended place for stay. Rooms are very spacious and clean, very good views and the service is fantastic. The only thing was lets say not very good for, us we were traveling there and you have to pay for fast wifi, the other works very slow and is not the best quality. In rest all was nice and great stuff. Definitely I will stay there again. Location is very good too. ",50
"The Venetian is simply amazing. The hotel is so huge that you definitely need a map to help you navigate, and still may get lost. The room is impressive, the service superb. You can do almost anything inside the hotel, including shop in the middle of the night. If I go back to Macau, I will always stay here.",50
"We came to the Venetian Hotel because Westlife was performing at their Cotai Arena! We got the cheapest room and it was huge! Very spacious and there was nothing regular about it. I also felt the hotel is very clean, aside from my pillow being very smelly for some reasons.. I hope the hotel staff can have a look at their pillows.. maybe the sweat of someone with very smelly hair leaked past the pillow cover onto the actual pillow. So I suggest you bring a towel or your own pillow case to sleep on. My hair smelled so bad the next morning even though I had just washed it before going to bed.   We left our room for the concert and when we returned we discovered that our door had not been properly closed! We called reception to inform them of the situation for fear that someone may…",50
"Total luxury 5 Star hotel, excellent location close all other hotels and casinos. Irish bars food, drinks & Staff make it a must during your stay. Reception staff could not have been more helpful on arrival, room staff very efficient and happy to to work in with our daily routine. next trip to macao will definitely stay again.",50
"The hotel is huge and grand, an impressive impression of Venice, down to the decor in the room, which is lovely, luxurious, spacious, clean and comfortable. Staff service is top-notch, cheerful, friendly and helpful. We felt so pampered...",50
Good Hotel to stay in if travelling to Macao as it is the center of the busy area on the island. Walking distance to all the other hotels although you don’t need to leave this hotel as there is everything you need in it from to designer shops to a great food court and a lively Irish bar on the ground floor. If I was to come back to Macao in the future I would definitely stay here again. ,50
"Stay 5 nights during early July. Have 4 swimming pool and powerful jazucci but too bad don’t have steam/sauna room. Staff very attentive and good service. Mostly speak Chinese and minimum English unless it’s Filipino. The gym is great, staff speak English & Mandarin. ",40
"The venetian  Huge hotel, everything was excellent.  Pros: - Big room around 70m. - Well decorated hotel. - Fancy bathroom. - Great outdoor pool. - Heated jacuzzi. - With the offer, either breakfast or lunch. - Nice restaurants. - The golden peacock restaurant is must to try.",50
"It is a bigger clone of the Venetian Las Vegas (includes a casino, a shopping mall). The rooms are amazing, very spacious. We had a great overall experience. It's located close to the House of Dancing Water theater (that's why we stayed there). The hotel is huge - it's realy easy to lose your way (almost a million square meters!).",50
"Stayed here for 4 nights while in Macau for a business conference.  The rooms are just massive, as is the whole property.  Would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't for the smokey smell in the hallways.  The room was okay, but it seemed like people were smoking in the hallway, and it permeated the whole place.  The overall resort is really nice, really big feeling with tourists everywhere.  If i'm ever back, would recommend the venetian.",40
The Venetian in Macau is one of the great hotel with lots of amenities. We were upgraded to a suite with the nice view of cotai. The upgraded suite was a 2 king size bed and enough room for my family with beautiful linens and fluffy comforter and pillows. I would recommend this hotel for a quality experience where the worthy prices are balanced by the service you receive.,50
Really loved the bathroom and the bed. Super comfy and relaxing.  The bedsheets is a little low quality for the price though. It is rough and scratchy. So are the bathrobes.  The other issue was the staff constantly knocking on the door and calling my room which I found pretty annoying even after I have requested not to be disturbed.,40
"The whole hotel building itself is an art, and you can take a lot of photos around.  As it was a surprise trip by my boyfriend, I had no idea where I would be staying. So I was stunned when I entered the hotel and the room. The design is white and blue color which I really love the combination. The room is spacious and super clean. Everything looks perfect for me especially the bath room.  The location is also very convenient, casino, shopping, the Venetian river, the Portuguese tart etc. The staffs are nice and will patiently explain the places that we wanted to go. ",50
"Had a great night sleep here, the room was quiet. The hotel itself was so big and overwhelming it was easy to get lost which was frustrating. The food wasn’t great in the buffet restaurant and very expensive. Not much for western options plus no brown sauce. We found a ‘pub’ just before we left which did nice western food wish we knew about that for dinner. Was great to see marks and Spencer there. ",50
"visit this big complex of shopping area, casino,  dining,  buy macao's snack,  have some coffee or just killing time around. We hv short visit there,. Can try venitian canal gondola. Had a good time there. ",40
"good service, tidy, beautiful room and delicious food, nice hotel for relax holidays, easy for shopping too.   The pool is very nice and good view.  a nice hotel to go again, we been there many trip for past years.",50
"A short stay with family and booked through the hotel website. As connecting room was not available at checkin, they directly upgrade to a large suite, exceeding our expectations. However, the breakfast was below standard, quite a contrast to their room and that’s why I can’t give it the top rate.",40
"We stayed for 2 days in Venetian and it was the best part of our tour of HK, China and Macau. The rooms are really spacious and even their bathroom is also huge. Room overall gives a regale feeling. Best part is the theme of this hotel. When you go for shopping in cotai then you will feel as if you are in Venice. You can walk in that area for whatever time. If you walk out of Main lobby to exit you will see the entry of Parisian, COD, Studio City, MGM and Wynn palace. All these hotels are in walking distance from the exit. Overall a very good stay. Only disappointment was breakfast time as it was not as per the standards",50
"Great hotel, very large room, delicious food and very good service!  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. The bedroom was lovely and bed was super comfortable!   The hotel is right in the centre of the strip - easy to explore the hotels and visit the shows.",50
"I remember back in 2012, this hotel was probably the most grande hotel. Nowadays, I feel like this hotel needs renovation already.. but that's just me. But overall stay is pretty good! All Suite room is spacious. Bella Deluxe Suite has 2 Large Beds.",40
"We booked the Cotai ferry packaged with Royal Premio room, and it was nothing short of spectacular. The return ferry was included in the room cost, and prices were excellent for what we received. Red Dragon noodles in the casino is a must dine experience, Eric was a fabulous waiter, catering to our needs.",50
"Took the taipa jet from Kowloon to taipa and then free shuttle from there to Venetian . Our luggage was quickly picked up from our bus and token provided.  Check Inn was quick keeping in mind that this is a huge hotel. 500 $ deposit kept and luggage sent to our room.  It took us 15 mins to walk to our room which was there south tower. Beautiful resort with ofcouse Casino but as we were traveling with kids so avoided that section .  Room and bath section was huge, clean , and beautiful. EVERYTHING 5 star ..  There is food court and a mall inside the hotel  The mall is connected to other resort malls. U can walk to Parisian if u like through the malls.  This is a shopping heaven   The resort has 5 pools which are exceptional as well .  There is a express checkout drop box and free…",50
"My husband loves Vegas and goes a few times a year, so when booking our trip to Hong Kong I surprised him with an overnight stay at the Venetian.  We were so happy with the location and accomodation.  The room was amazing and the hotel too.  All the shopping and dining are there too.",50
The shopping mall is better than other hotel. But most of the stores are luxury so I think it’s hard to visit if you want something normal. Macau is full of luxury stuffs so don’t be surprise.the inside decoration and light are still beautiful,40
"What a hotel!! Had a super stay. Large suites and immaculate interiors.  Special special thanks to Elmer and his supervisor(forgot the name) because of whom we could enjoy our stay a little longer. Elmer was instrumental in getting us a ferry to Taipa ferry terminal a little later than what we were kind of scheduled for the day of checking out. He liased with Cotai executives and got us the revised tickets even when I had placed the request at the nth hour!! Thanks so much.  While Cotai is good, Suggest other travellers to get their return tickets for ferry confirmed from the Venetian Hotel concierge just for the prompt service they provide. ",50
"Its one of a kind hotel with no limits to your pocket expenses, you can stay in a royla suits or a presidential suites the rooms under all categories are really to look forward too. There are lot of shopping brands available but only few have some discounts or schemes. Moreover there is no exchange for INR available so make sure you carry currency in dollars accordingly. Casino is also a must go and play activity but one must know the amount to spend.",40
One of amazing Hotel of Macau. Also has a huge casino. Where you can play as much as you want beacuse it covers game from low cost to high cost games. Also visited covered lake with in the hotel premises. Many hotels are connected internally.,50
"WHAT WE LIKED Room - Luxurious and spacious as promised. Came with 2 queen beds and one couch that doubles as a daybed. Sleeping area is different from the sunken living room area with one TV set for each. T&B is also huge with separate powder, bath and toilet sections. Got the Cotai Strip view.   Service - consistent with its related hotel in Singapore, service is superb and friendly. Kid celebrated 10th birthday, so as expected with Sands, a strawberry cheesecake came in along with a greeting card and monkey plush toy souvenir  Design - the Venetian-theme adds a touch of luxury to the stay  WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER Hallway - Carpet needs fixing, esp one at the 26th flr South. The gaps in the aging carpet are slowly becoming tripping hazards  OVERALL - a memorable birthday…",50
"We went to Macau as a last minute plan with our other friends and booked at Venetian Macau. I guess the biggest hotel in town. After long journey from Delhi we reached your hotel and met Mr. Sam Ahmed, Manager at front office. He was such a gentleman with genuine smile and care for his customers. We are elderly couple and had an issue with our PAYMENT. Mr. Sam bring me to the nearest ATM and guide me with the machine functions to get some local money. He arranged a nice room near lift and great view. Show us the elevator and even gave his card to contact him anytime for help. Our stay was most enjoyable because of Mr. Sam. Please pass our gratitude to him. If we visit again we will stay in Venetian.  Mr. & Mrs. Magon",50
Stunning casino as soon as you walk in.the ceiling was painted like nothing ive ever seen before and the casino was something else deffiantly my place to go for a game of poker seems to be the place that runs the most gamesin macau in all hours for poker.didnt really play any other cash tables and things could of changed from when i was last there also but worth checking the place out if your up for a sightsee or a gamble,50
"Macau has nothing much to offer other than casino & probably Venitian Resort is the best casino resort there . Huge property with more than 2000 rooms spread across 4 distinct inter connected wings. We have stayed in the south wing ( 14023/36) , wonderful large rooms with very spacious bathroom with mini bar, tea/coffee maker & amazingly fast service .  Large breakfast spread & one can opt for lunch too instead of breakfast which is even better . The wifi connection works all over the building .   Those who lived in marina bay sands in Singapore will find a lot of similarities with shopping arcade , artificial river , food court & casino .   It’s a nice property & wonderful experience to live & spend time inside this property with plenty of entertainments .  Will I wish to be…",40
"I lost my mobile phone on the bus going back to the Venetian when I left it on the seat. Despite not eventually finding my mobile, I appreciated the efforts put in by the security team to retrieve. The security personnel Simon Cheong was professional and put in all efforts to check on buses coming in and leaving during that period to attempt to pinpoint the bus.  Great service and I’m sure it is a representation of the culture of the hotel. ",50
"Really impressive rooms, large and luxurious. Loads of shops which are easily accessible from the hotel. However, it's quite a mission getting around after check in; rooms are really very far from reception. And the enormous casino is packed and chaotic as compared to quieter options at the Sands Cotai. I'm glad I experienced staying at The Venetian. Will definitely opt for Sands Cotai in future. It's also lovely but easier getting around. ",40
"The hotel is very gigantic and very difficult to get around in. Everything is very far to walk in. Even getting from the check-in desk to the suite was a long endeavor.  Nevertheless, the suite was very spacious, and the facilities inside are great. Around the hotels are many shopping establishments.  What bothers me during the stay here is the lack of inexpensive food establishment. Anything related to getting meals seemed overpriced.",50
"Upon arrival check-in was very slow, but reception was very pleasant and helpful.  I was very pleased with the room's layout and the view was great.  Then, in the mornings the hallway was very busy and loud. Perhaps a better insulated door would serve the hotel well. This is a great hotel with restaurants, shopping, and casino.  They are connected to several other hotels, so you can walk and shop for hours. ",40
"Everything under one roof..hotel, shopping mall, shows, restaurants. Plus the staff is extremely helpful and friendly. Would definitely recommend staying here and enjoying its splendour rather than coming in for a day visit.",50
Heard a lot about this hotel but the real experience was even more fantastic. The rooms were very big and spacious. The service was excellent and the Casinos were fantastic. It had a pickup from the Ferry terminal which was very convenient and the buffet had some Indian food which was excellent.,50
"A very spacious room despite being the basic room type. Well maintained furniture and public space, very welcoming and comfortable. More remarkably is that the staffs are consistently all very polite and helpful. The front desk agent (Louie), the guest services team, Concierge/Limo services team (Peter). Despite abit of language barrier, they were still very patient in trying to understand us and offer help. For such a big property, the baggage service is quite efficient too. A little downside would be the lack of gaming information available. We had to physically head to the different lobbies (parisan/cotai) to check out if its less crowded for gaming. For visitors who are there to take some good pictures, a little tip would be avoiding the mid-day peak crowd. There’s…",40
"fabulous hotel rooms more like a apartment that a room with separate living area bathrooms fab also quite a experience only downfall is breakfast which you have to go looking for hence the review title like a theme park resort not a hotel, everything else  about it is fabulous",50
"Hotels in Macao are very famous for their Casinos,Free shows,Huge sized rooms, cleanliness,food options and even free shuttle service. Each hotel represents one beautiful marvel of the world. Venetian represents the city of Venice. Its structure is fascinating. Thousands of visitors come inside without any restriction to look at the beauty of this hotel. This hotel is located in Co-tai strip and surrounded by several other luxury hotels. The rooms here are I think mostly or only Suites. Its very big and beautiful like a Suite is supposed to be. It has a mini golf course, good swimming pools with a hot pool tool. Wide options for food with Indian food also available. Lastly since it's a big hotel don't forget to carry a map if you don't wanna got lost.",50
"The place was pricey but was an experience. Luxury living with lots of high end shopping, casinos and also a food court with a variety of food! A cool venice style boat ride and kids lodge. Near to other venues such as city of lights, galaxy and etc. Lots to shop see and eat!",50
"Royal Deluxe Suite is very spacious and perfect for relaxation. Food served at Cafe Deco needs improvement in terms of taste, presentation, and variety (does not serve beef). Stationed near the airport, hence far from various tourist spots (i.e. Senado Square, Ruins of St. Paul. Fisherman's Wharf).",40
"When you are in Macau, don't even think of staying anywhere else but Venetian. It's simply out of the world. Big spacious tastefully done rooms, great in-dine options and courteous staff. The hotel is so big, that it seems like a city in itself. It has a huge casino and is a shoppers delight with stores of all the luxury brands in the world. ",50
It was a great Place to stay with suite rooms spacious and 2 level room which create separate leaving and bed area. The hotel has Casino too. The Food at Cafe Deco was Amazing for breakfast. They also Have Indian verities for Indian guests cooked by Indian Chefs.,40
"We booked this hotel for one night during our stay in Macau, we went hotel hopping when in Macau because we want to experience different services and facilities of Macau hotels. This hotel did not disappoint us. We checkin early around 11am and our room is ready. The very nice lady in the reception put us in the 25th floor with a very nice view! When she learned it is our first time in Venetian Macao, she extended our checkout to 2pm (yes,she is very nice!). The room is very spacious and clean. We book twin room suite and it is large enough for our family. In the morning we went swimming, Im not sure but I think I saw 3 big pools and one jacuzzi. There are plenty of towels to use, the changing room is very clean, the shower area and bathroom area all clean and with free shampoo,…",50
"What an incredible hotel. We took the Cotai Water Jet from Hong Kong Sky Pier to the Taipa Ferry Terminal (see my review on the Cotai Water Jet). There was a free shuttle bus to take us to the hotel. Check in was a breeze, the front desk personnel spoke perfect English. They were friendly, thorough, and very helpful. The suite was probably the nicest and largest hotel room we’ve ever stayed in. From the comfortable bed to the large closets, to the bathroom fixtures, the suite was amazing. Make sure to visit Level 3 where you’ll find the  the canal with the gondolas, walk through the shops and there’s a  gigantic food court. The casino was busy, but there were always video machines available and the machines all had a button that allowed you to change the buttons and instruction…",50
What we can say about this place. It s a little Venice in Cina. There is everithing you need. You could spend all day in the resort without going out if you want. The casinos are massive everithing is very impressive. The gondola ride is also a must. ,50
"My friends and I stayed at the Venetian during our short stay in Macau and absolutely loved it.   The resort has a free shuttle from the ferry port every 5 minutes and the check-in process could not have been easier. Because we booked directly through their website, we got a free upgraded room, free premium wifi, and free late check-out. The staff were all extremely helpful as well.  Our room was beautiful and came with so many nice perks/amenities. The beds were comfortable and everything was spotless.  The gaming floor was chaotic and fun. We had never been to a casino before and didn't speak any Mandarin/Cantonese so we didn't really understand what was going on but it was just fun to watch.  We ate dinner at Red Dragon Noodles and it was some of the best Chinese food I have…",50
"Venetian is a all new world within. Huge in size, world class interior, king size rooms and Casino world. The most amazing place I've ever visit.lnfact the must visit place there.You will feel like you are a king when there. ",50
I did not regret choosing this hotel.  What I liked: - easy to get to from the airport and ferry terminal via hotel buses - quick check-in/check-out - big room - many things to do/attractions within walking distance,50
"We stayed one night , wished we stayed more. Our rooms were massive , Bath huge . You step down into the lounge which has a huge window that gives you awesome views . The resort is massively huge, get a map , you will need it. You check your bags in first , the staff are super helpful , then it’s a short walk to reception, which doesn’t open until 2 pm . There is a bar close by if you need to kill time. The Venetian has a shuttle bus that picks you up and will take you back to the airport, make sure you book it beforehand. Across the road , towards The Galaxy Resort is the bus stop for the Hop on Hop Off. And of course, the Gondolas are a must ! ",50
"Just being there makes me think that I might be in a place of fairies, goddess. The ambiance is really great not to mention the staff. The casino is a great place to look into full of fun! I like the most is the architecture of the hotel, very interesting.  ",50
"Thank you to all staff and hotel personnel. We stayed at the Venetian Macau hotel and it was Awesome. The hotel is absolutely stunning, there are many shops, many restaurants and many other activities. We enjoyed our stay. Our luxury room met all of our expectations, this is the best hotel we have ever stayed at. See you soon Macau!",50
"Beautiful hotel, good location.Check in ,checkout was very smooth.Clean. Large property, decent restaurants. Breakfast buffet excellent. Excellent service all around! Nice casino, lots of games I did not recognize. Definitely recommend!",50
"Our travel agent failed to confirm the booking, hence could not stay. However, based on recommendations, visited the property in the evening. The Venetian Macau is a massive 39-story luxury hotel and casino on the Cotai Strip, Macau. Attractive architecture, able maintenance, great facilities like Accommodation, Casino, Shopping, Entertainment, Dining; everything are available within the resort. A busy place with lots of people roaming around to enjoy the facilities. We visited the Casino, did some casual shopping, had Gandola ride and dinner at an Indian restaurant. The most enjoyable attraction was Gandole ride under sky painted roof, which provided a feeling as if the entire arrangements have been made under the open sky. Free shuttle bus services from hotel to ferry pier is…",50
"Beautiful hotel and surpassed expectations. The room was huge, we had booked for 4 people and we had plenty of space. The entire grounds of the hotel was lovely – we didn’t leave it for the 1.5 days we were here – so much to do there. Lovely lady working at reception. Staff were very kind and welcoming. Upgraded the room and gave late check out for free which was a lovely bonus upon arrival. Would highly recommend staying here if you are ever to visit Macau.",50
I love Venetian not only because of their suite rooms but the grand canal as well! Theres a lot of beauty and designer shops there! The ambiance is so good!! You can also use their free wifi while roaming around the resort.,50
"The venetion hotel, casino and resort macao, is the best hotel, casino and resort in macao, this place very recomended to visit when you are in macao. Anything you need are available here and provided, also luxury .....",50
"Beautiful, stylish hotel. Comfortable beds and roomy suites.  Massive selection of shops,  boutiques,  food and restaurants. Even have its own casino. A smaller and ckeaner version of Europe in a controlled weather environment, all air conditioned.  No cobbler stones to trip over or pick pockets to worry about.  Bright colors every where you look.  The shops are designed to look like European architectures. Small man made canals for gondolas. A must visit!  The only negative: no benches or chairs to sit on when you're tired from all the walking and shopping. ",50
"In Our first visit to Macau, we stayed for four nights at this vast hotel , with a beautiful canal that resembles the ones in Venice, with a very large shopping promenade, the hotel is so big that takes one a good time to his way around, very busy especially at weekends , I would choose a more compact hotel , the suites where spacious, with excellent service , it has many restaurants and cafes, breakfast was good with a lot of variety. ",50
To start our check in took 3 hour and so stuffing around with the rooms but once I gave my feed back the hotel manage was quick to act and fix our concerns by upgrading our rooms and making us feel comfortable.. the rooms where spacious and relaxing with fantastic ammenities,40
"I highly recommend staying at The Venetian Macau. Yes it is a bit of a circus with thousands of people in the attached shopping mall, restaurants and casino but it is interesting people watching and makes for free entertainment. The staff at The Venetian were so friendly and helpful - I can't praise them enough for helping us in any way that they could. Really great service!  The room and bathroom were spacious and sparkling clean. We loved our time at The Venetian and wouldn't hesitate to stay again if we return to Macau. I think the price we paid represented great value for money and wouldn't hesitate to recommend to friends, family and my clients.   The amenities at The Venetian were great - excellent gym and pool, lots of great options for getting dinner. Plus lots of shops…",50
We stayed for just one night at the Venetian and for us that was plenty. We are not gamblers so it’s fair to say the main event was somewhat lost in us. We were visiting Macau to see a close family member who is half way through a 12month work contact there and she kindly arranged the stay at the Venetian as a gift and to introduce us to the full Macau experience. The hotel is astounding with everything you might want and more. We stayed on a very busy Easter Saturday when every one of the 3000 rooms were booked and all the communal areas were teeming with guests and visitors that were passing through. Our room and the facilities were from my experience second to none. The staff especially room service were polite friendly and very efficient. If you’re looking for quiet and…,40
Well needless to stay the place is fantastic. Only drawback is when it’s a weekend the prices are nearly 100% up... for us the issue is we don’t gamble so the casinos were of no use. But the facilities and suite we booked was fantastic! We request if the management include some stalls in the food court area catering the south Asian travelers as there is only 1 restaurant catering the food. Other than than great place!,50
The stay inside the room was nice but it was staying in mal. Venice like setup in the mall with gondolas rowing in the stream singing . Fashion brand shops all around . Casino making you greed for money and beautiful paintings in ceiling were mesmerising,40
"it was one of the greatest hotels we stayed in. the place is massive, our room was upgraded and we liked the room. the breakfast was huge and crowded. The hotel is located in a shopping mall and its difficult to find the way out and in.",50
"This was my favourite hotel in Macau. The staff were super friendly and attentive. It has everything- casino, shops and an abundance of restaurants and offers a free shuttle service to the Sands, the Taipa Ferry Terminal and the Macau ferry terminal.",40
This is our second visit to the Venetian Macau and we stayed for 3 days . The room was comfortable  and clean and housekeeping was good . It has a large casino  downstairs  and by large I mean massive . The breakfast was included in our room rate and was good . The decor of the entire resort is splendid . Only minus point is the  huge crowds of noisy tourist  all around the hotel .,40
Beautiful place. Extremely courteous staff. Had informed them before coming regarding the belated wedding anniversary. They gave us a cake to celebrate and a heart symbol on the bed with towels. It was nice. Thanks to the staff for it. Worth visiting atleast once in a lifetime. This was our second visit. And if you like gambling its a great place. Huge casino.,40
"While it is not that unique anymore since we have it in Philippines as well, still it's one of the go to places for all around Macau experience. Very good selection of shops and restaurants and the best part is that they have their food court and that makes it easier to order all the different dishes you want.",50
"Very well made , Hugh property and excellent recreation of Venice in Macau , be it the building architecture or the canals or a gondolas, treat for shoppers, the artificial skyline looks so real , even the food court is great",50
"My mother and I went to Macau last December for 2 days. We stayed here for 1 night and I remember that I booked a room for a queen bed. But to our surprise, we were given a 2 double bed room! We also availed the express check-in and were given a complimentary wifi for the whole stay. The room was really spacious and well maintained. They also provided a mobile phone that guest could use when travelling around Macau which was a surprise to us as well. The staff in the lobby were really accommodating and nice despite how busy it was when we arrived (we came on a weekend so it was really crazy in the hotel lobby). The hotel itself is really spacious and since we went there last December, there were a lot of Christmas decors. There's a lot of shops and restaurant inside the hotel so…",50
"it is an absolutely great experience, the rooms are superb, the food is excellent, the Gondola ride, shopping plaza, Casino  are simply fantastic ; a great place to stay and enjoy. You can have a great time with friends and family .",50
"The Venetian’s room went one of the most big one that we already saw. The bed and sofa are very comfortable and all was clean. Our views was just OK, another hotel that we stayed had better views. I have a negative point only about the breakfast. They don’t have many international options, it’s more asiatic if you don’t like to eat Asian food during the morning I recommend don’t book the breakfast and eat in another cafe store inside the Venetian, like the Starbucks.",40
"The property is huge... it takes you a while to get used to the layout. They give you a map & the staffs are always helping you explore. It's so much to see & do in the property itself. You feel like It's a modern-day emperor palace where you are a guest, but not the emperor himself, as the scale & size of it makes the thing very mechanical & impersonal. A great thing which I liked as a late riser is you can decide to have the lunch instead of the breakfast. That helps with the little more sleep in the morning. I hope this idea catches on with all the hotels. The only thing we didn't like is that bathrooms were a little dated & untidy. No shaving mirror in them either.",50
"First things first. This is a big place. Really big. Having said that though, our royal deluxe Cotai view suite was incredibly quiet and well appointed. The room was huge and well presented with a palatial bathroom and separate mezzanine lounge area. The connectivity between resorts means you have the dining facilities of 3 other resorts available without having to step a foot outside. Plenty of different food styles are on offer including everything from formal dining through to food courts. Staff were friendly and our room well maintained. Certainly a destination not to be missed when travelling to Macau.",50
I have been to Macau many many times and it’s the first time I stayed in Venetian.    Transportation to the hotel is very convenient and there is free shuttle to the hotel.    The only cons is that it takes a long walk to the pool and when you are tired enough it will take you forever to go back to your room from the lobby.   Recommended!,40
"Even the Venetian is not a new hotel, I was still looking for staying in it. It is in good maintenance and the most important is the Venetian is a hub of the Parisian and Sands Cotai Centre, so the most number of bus routes and shops are there!",50
"I was here in mid March 2019 with my family. The hotel is Big and Grand. We had taken the ferry from Hong Kong to reach Macau. From Macau port we had Shuttle bus to Hotel. Once we reached the Hotel, we had given the luggage to the baggage collection point and went to reception (with a big queue of more than 40 people).The reception in the main lobby has more than 15 counters and still it took me more than 40 mins to check-in. They receptionist was well mannered and very efficient. The receptionist gave a map of the hotel to explain the way to reach our suite in the 28th floor - south block. She also took the luggage tag from me and informed that the luggage will be sent to the room in 20-30 mins time. By the time i reached my room it was 3.15pm. There is a very good Indian…",50
"We were here to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. Special thanks to Ms.Yukti Mehra from guest relations for giving us a memorable stay. We love the bed towel decoration,  complimentary birthday cheesecake and the special gift arranged by her. The special gift is our photo printed inside a beautiful glass photo frame. It is the best gift that we have ever received from a hotel. Ms. Mehra also helped me personalize the birthday card for my boyfriend. Her service was exceptional.  We stayed at the Premio Royale Suite which was a complimentary room upgrade from the hotel (Ms. Mehra and Mr. Salangsang). Since we booked the room on their website, we were eligible for a late check-out and the receptionists (Johnathan and William) even extended our check-out time from 2pm to 4pm for…",50
"Had a few days off during the Chinese New Year holiday so wanted a quick getaway with girlfriends.   Was worried we couldnt get anything affordable for a nice 24 hour day trip but with research and luck we were able to book a beautiful room here at the Venetian.   Check-In and Check-Out was convenient. Had an amazing time although due to the CNY season it was busy, noisy and of course as expected it was basically flocked with visitors from the mainland. But didnt stop us from enjoying our stay. We ordered room service for breakfast and we loved it. Thank you to the Venetian for making our visit truly comfortable. ",50
"The venue was very nice great seating with a ton of audience participation.Human NATURE Was awesome. They got the crowd involved they did a great job entertaining everyone. If you like Oldie’s  and like to dance., You will love human nature. They were a blast!!",50
"I don’t have much to talk abt venetian since i stayed there only for 1 night. And to enjoy venetian, one must stay there for 2-3 nights atleast. However, i have a lot to say about Mr Bruce Wang ( Ground Supervisor ) at venetian. He made every single effort to make out stay comfortable. Don’t have words how he helped us in such an expensive property. If Venetian hotel hires such an expert and Good hearted employees then it is certainly a Good hotel. Vulienne, Christine ( at Reception) , Penn , Junny ( Conceirge ) , Guilio ( gondola rider) are the few names who tried their level best to make our stay comfortable.. Thanks Mr Bruce Wang for everything 👍👍👍",50
"It felt like staying in a shopping mall. A very glitzy, glamorous, high end shopping mall with a massive casino.  You must try the egg tart at the ferry terminal though, you wont be able to stop at just one. oh and lovely rooms. One day I was given the amazing view of the Bay and lights. Next day, clouds covered my windows. It was quite an experience. ",50
"We are on the 33rd floor gorgeous views and we was upgraded to a Royal Suite without even asking, very helpful staff, had a ride on the Gondalar.  The only downfall was the casino minimum bets on the tables were $300HK approximately £30!",50
The room is actually really huge. Ideally for 3-4 people in a single room usually. They do give complementary water and have bus stations with buses taking you to other hotels (Shuttles).The mall connected is so huge that its an experience itself.,50
The best five star hotel i have come across.  Room size were generous check in was hassle free. Loved everything about this hotel u really don't need to go out of the hotel as everything you need is in the hotel.,50
"We enjoyed shopping at many of Venetian's Gondola gift stores filled with very unique and stylish t-shirts from local brand ""Loving Macau"". They have kids and adults tees at a good price, high quality and is a great gift to bring back to our friends and family. They offer same day delivery on their website store as well if you want more options and can deliver to your hotel.",50
"The interior of the hotel was superb and the stay was amazing. Ours was a standard room , but it was worth it had an excellent view from our room. Its has mall inside the hotel , there is a gondola ride inside the hotel , It interconnects the other three hotels .Food is excellent. ",40
"We were not big on gambling but stopped here and were quite amazed. The slot machines were in Chinese, we won some amount and spent it on eating and shopping. On the 3rd floor is a mini  Venice with a canal, gondola ride and the blue sky. There is a Parisian Macau which has also come up. One can visit the copy of the Eiffel Tower and the lock bridge here.",40
"a must-visit, a must-never- to -miss to include in macau itinerary. a cozy, amazing, and spectacular experience.... goods are a lot to choose from. gondola ride is an extraordinary experience. we definitely will come back.",50
"Nice spacious rooms with great views, Hotel bubbling with excitement 24 x 7 . Long check in Lines waiting period during peak season 20 mins. We went just after Chinese new year, but guests should arrive after 12:30 that is  when the Rooms are allotted otherwise hotel was jam packed . Food and service is excellent and the adjoining food court has fabulous dishes to offer . Due to currency pegged with strong US Dollar pocket pinches as over all it is expensive .",50
"This is one of the most beautiful mall I have visited so far. You can find (almost) everything here, attractions, food, view, and of course Casino. It's just like Last Vegas of Asia. Everything here is beautiful to be captured and instagramable. You can also ride gondola with your partner or your family, they have such good-looking gondolier (gondola driver) who can sing beautifully when you're on your ride. Make sure to visit this shopping mall once you come to Macau, it's definitely a must visit!",50
"All i can say is it's very amazing experiences start from check In Process, the Very Helpful Staff who help us to storage our luggage and help us to get info the we needed.   The Room is very large, worth every penny i spend. The mall very nice check out process very quick just need go to drop key box.",50
"Our room was upgraded to family room, my kids had their own space and the staff were just superb. The front desk staff as well as the concierge were just superb to help us. We had an amazing stay. The hotel itself has all the amenities so you can just stay and chill in the hotel. They have shops and food court so everything under one roof.  There is heated pools as we stayed in the cooler season so it was just perfect. ",50
"A lot of positives about the hotel:  Luxurious rooms, extremely spacious, great view from the balconies. Check-in, Check-out process was quite smooth. Casinos within the hotel is great. Hotel staff is quite polite.",50
"The moment I entered the hotel I was amazed to found out that it's less of a hotel but an entire shopping mall rather not just shopping mall it also has theaters, casino and much more.  We had a deluxe family room and I must say it was one of my most luxuries stay. The washroom was build very properly all the accessories were mind blowing. My washroom also had a bathtub. The room had 2 gigantic TV, very spacious almiras. The hotel also gave us a mobile phone for both local and international calls. It was the best stay ever for me.",50
"Venetian , Macau is amongs the best hotels in Macau. Sands group has never been disappointing for us be it at any place in the world. Everything in Venetian was pitch perfect. We book Sands hotels through their official website always and they give great perks as compared to booking through any other online booking site. We had late check out option then we had a choice to either take lunch or breakfast buffet which is generally not possible otherwise. All in all it was the good staying experience.",50
"The positive Side:  The property is exceptionally well maintained. The rooms are all modern and very clean.  There is security everywhere, no reason to ever feel insecure. The staff is very accommodating and friendly.  The other side:  if you are going to Macau for a Vegas like experience in Asia you will be disappointed.  The casino table games are ALL expensive to gamble, most minimums are $400 hkd about $50 usd.  Most of the table games are pai gow poker and baccarat.  Very few blackjack table and one craps table ($200 hkd minimum).  It is very difficult to get an alcohol beverage while gambling.  Coffee and water a fairly abundant. You can ask the coffee/water person for a beer, but I would not complicate it beyond asking for anything more than a beer.  The casino atmosphere…",40
"This is not what I would rate a hotel it’s more like a palace. We visited Hong Kong and went by ferry to get a feel for Macau as it’s compared to Vegas, we weren’t disappointed.Everything was superb and can’t wait to revisut",50
"We flew from Brisbane to Hong Kong then took ferry straight to Macau where we stayed 2 nights. This hotel needs to be seen to be believed, very big rooms around 70 sq mt, spacious bathroon. We stayed in North Suites, with few to Coatai Strip, stunning at night. Hotel very large, but only takes a day to get bearings. Bed was amazing, had great sleep. Great shopping options within complex which is super handy. Only issue we had, which should not have been, was milk for coffee and tea, we asked around 6  staff and no one would assist. We ended up buying in noble mart, but for price of hotel, this should have been provided just like tea and coffee.",40
"This place is kind of palace, huge spread over large area. The moment you enter start feeling a kind of top class luxury which is not very common. Huge reception area, big statues, huge shopping area, eateries & a water canal where one can ride on boat. Same canal we experienced in Qatar at Village mall.  The whole experience is top in class & must visit place when in Macau.",50
It is beautiful place with false sky lightings is awesome. Best place for international brands with discount sale probably all the time. Kids enjoyed the Gondola ride and he sung a old Bollywood Hindi hit. must see place.,50
This is one of the biggest hotel I ever stayed. We get lost a bit to our room since we can not use elevator near casino. We need get to our room via MALL. The room so spacey and very good toilet. The bed was so good I could sleep all day (unfortunately not). The price is not that pricey compare to others hotel.,50
"Venetian Macau  have ala grand facilities. And Paradise for ammeter and hard core gambling fans.Free shuttle bus services are available from ferry harbour and airport to Venetian. Rooms and ambience is very good,excellent services.",50
It is a grande hotel and a must see in Macau. Has gondolas rode and a superb shopping complex inside.  There are buses that take you to the hotel and drop  you back. The ferry ride from HK is about an hour and a half and then a 15 minute ride by bus to the hotel.  The casino is great. There is also a food  court available with food from around the world and also a pizza joint run by an Indian where you can get veg food.  On the whole a grande experience ,50
"This was easily one of the best casino hotel experiences we had anywhere in the world.  Starting from the bus ride from the Ferry terminal in Macao to the moment we checked out of our room, everything was easy and exceeded our expectations.  The room was the highlight. It had a great view of the city and the mini golf course below, the room itself was huge and on 2 levels, with a living/dining space and the bedroom space and lavishly furnished.   We ordered in a couple of times, and the way the food was set up up on the table for 2 was beautiful, complete with an orchid in a vase.   There were at least 4 pools and a couple of jacuzzi's in the large pool area. One could lounge around for hours here, beautifully maintained and very relaxing setting.  Another highlight is the…",50
This is by far the best property to stay in Macau..the fake sky across the hotel gives the place a crazy Venetian vibe.. u can enjoy the gondola ride and feel like ur in Venice.. it's a beautifully themed hotel with a great casino..   On the flip side..their check in takes really long u could get lost in that property it's that huge,50
Much better and more beautiful than Vegas.. it is big beautiful and outstanding. Easy to gamble or not. No pressure but you must take pictures. Of the water the gondola s and the inside. No One asked me not to take pictures and everyone was . So go ahead,40
Excellent Hotel and room. All rooms are like suite and if on high floor get very good view. Enjoyed the stay but the shopping mall at the hotel (Where had heard that may take full day to explore) is such a waste as is full of High Brand ONLY and took just an hour to stroll through all the shops and stoped only at Gondola - Which is good but........ If one enjoy Casino (Actually it is suppose to be for people who want to play at Casino) than is more fun. Had Indian restaurent - Golden Peacock which was not bad and not as expensive as I thought. Enjoyed their lunch Buffet which was for HK$245 with taxes per person (can have it once and not that expensive considering in 5 star hotel) or can also order from room servise but have limited Veg option in Hotel menu. Hotel also have a…,40
"The facilities and rooms were immaculate, from the spacious Bella Suite to the manicured gardens of the mini golf course the Venetian boasts a lot, with good measure. Their customer service however, did let the stay down. We had poor service before and throughout the stay. From no email responses to being sent to three desks to re-issue room keys, their communication was disappointing. But the property as a whole was incredible and recommended.",40
Have been visited the said location for many occasions and this is the first time to stay in for one night. On arrival around 1430 hrs the reception counter has already been queued up for reception (around 30 - 40 persons) and gives me the impression of my good old days when making registration at Las Vegas. It take me an hour to queue up. During which time the receptionists do serve bottles of water.  I request for a non smoking room but will only be ready in one and half hour later. The Staff promises to give me notice by email or phone message when ready; but unfortunately no message has been received after two hours and have to return to the reception for enquiries. The Staff then gives me the room on the 33rd floor. I am given a Premio Bella Suite for three persons. The…,40
"It's huge and you'll walk a lot. But even then whatever you order to the room reaches you in minutes. It is a management lesson in how size and population need not  hamper efficiency. Is it crowded yes, but it is a tourist attraction. And we were there during Christmas.  The Christmas celebrations and decorations were awesome. We were there with toddlers. Anything we asked for was there. The room is the largest hotel room, I've been too. My toddlers loved it, as they could run around as much as they wanted. The Venetian is a shopper's paradise. Plus it has lovely restaurants, a food court.  It is truly an integrated hotel stay. But what stands out is the efficiency with which they manage the service. In such a mammoth property. No waiting time at lifts, Everything is fast…",50
"A must-visit, at least, when you are in Macau. A bus or taxi takes you to this island, and you can stroll around. The Venetian is one of the four major attractions. There is an area to walk around the hotel, then a huge lobby inside, with a large casino. The ceiling and the decorations are interesting. There are some shops, too.",50
"As you enter in this hotel, you feel you are in heaven. Very nice ambiance and lightning. All are in gold color. You feel you are in Rome. Once in a life time experience. Big Casino. Its not a hotel its city in-self. Thousand of shop inside hotel. Worldwide Brand store inside hotel. All types of food are available in food court. You need minimum two days to explore whole resort.",50
The venetian Macao resort hotel one of the best hotels in the world   Luxury room and entrances perfect big room size Great furniture and designs  comfortable room and beds  one of the best room service in the world,40
Experienced Italian feels at Venetian Hotel Macao Casino and Resort. The place is surrounded by souvenir shops and restaurants like a mini-mall. Their ceilings showcased the artworks of worldclass famous artists in the romantic era worthy of your IG account! Plus their gondola ride with singing drivers that will serenades you throughout the short ride.,50
"A one hour ferry ride from Hong Kong (costing approx $370HK per person return), Macau is not only a gambling paradise  but a jaw dropping array of opulent, themed hotel properties.This review is really about a day trip to Macau rather than an in depth review of a hotel. Having said that, my favourite property was the Venetian which attempts to replicate the Grand Canal in Venice.My husband and I took a gondola ride - price was $135HK per person for a 15-20 minute ride. Our gondolier was Stefano and he was marvellous. He was friendly, funny and engaging and serenaded us with the most magnificent voice. It was almost like being in Venice! Macau is great for designer shopping (if you can afford it!). Whilst Macau is probably best known as a gambling haven, there are other touristy…",40
"Our first time in Macau and was a great experience though we didn’t expect all the customs n passport checks etc. We caught the Cotai jet ferry across n hopped onto the free shuttle to the hotel. The Venetian is as you see in all the photos- luxurious and grand. Long delays at the main lobby to check in and took over an hour with no where for the family to sit and wait except on the floor ground. We had two suites and there was more than enough room for our family of 6. All staff were very attentive and helpful especially the concierge staff. Security staff were at all the suite entrances throughout, and only time we felt unsafe was when we walked to the pool. As we were in the north suites it was a 750m walk along empty corridors to the pools (only small issue). The pool was…",50
"We came with the expectation of experiencing something very similar to the Venetian in Las Vegas.  The first impression was exactly that: a massive hotel with an impressive decor and a lot of shops within the hotel.  However we discovered a major difference right after getting to our room and wanting to have a small bite to eat: the food options were not as good as in Vegas. Here you could choose between formal restaurants, room service, a food court with mostly Asian options, McDonalds and Starbucks. There was no convenience store for buying small snacks, nor moderately priced sit-down family-style restaurants. Unlike the Las Vegas Strip, the entire Cotai Strip seemed to have none of these. As a result we ended up spending quite a lot on food.  As the hotel is huge, a lot of…",40
This hotel is situated within a Venetian type of city. The room which is the Bella deluxe suite caters for a family of four. The rooms are very neat and tidy. So much restuarant and food court within the city. Would recommend for family visit,50
"One of the best properties in Macau if u r looking at a luxury stay with high end shopping. Suites are very spacious, fitted with luxurious furniture and fittings, have a bath tub and all the facilities for a comfortable stay. Staff is nice though donot understand english completely. Transportation is free as they have their own bus to all most all locations if macau. It also has indian food restaurants which is hard to find in macau otherwise.",40
"Hotel is amazing. Super big with lotsa of eateries & shopping. From the outside, the hotel looks plain and boring. But inside it was beautiful. The design and everything is just beautiful. The room is super huge. Bed is big and comfy and it comes with a living room.   Only downside, there are too many people. The lobby is forever pack.Besides that, amazing place to stay",50
A Lovely place to spend a few days to unwind... Yes. Not like VEGAS... But Really VERY SIMILAR. Thoroughly enjoyed the  drive as well as the casinos.  And All The Major Hotel Casinos Are interconnected. It's Simply Amazing.......,50
Fantastic upgrade and stay at The Venetian hotel two nights ago. Fantastic service from JC.  Upgraded to a suite from a basic room. Absolutely stunning room and service all round. Thanks for having us!,40
"The Venetian is a very beautiful place to be, very vibrant atmosphere. The hotel room i stayed in was huge! Lots and lots of shopping places within the premises. Food is triple the price from Hong Kong but understandably so. They also offer free shipping service to and from the airport and ferry longer hours than Galaxy Casinos or Parisian etc.",50
fantastic room we were upgraded to a junior suite. it came with a phone buddy to use free while there we could go out and about and have free wifi and maps e-mail on the go.lots of new casinos are being built so we may go back to visit these.,50
"We booked a suite which was huge and cheaper than the Novotel in Hong Kong at the same time. Lots to do shopping, Gambling, Dining and Bars. Close to other newer casinos and you could spend a few days going through all of them .",50
"I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your helpful staff, I had an unforgettable stay in The Venetian Macao.   It was a long story. I went to Macao with my family last month, including my mom, dad, brother, sister, 90 years old grandpa and grandma. It was a short trip, just a one day tour from Hong Kong to Macao, so we could not get the chance to stay in the hotel, but my father said visiting the Venetian is a must. So we make the Venetian as our last destination of that trip. After that, we’ll going back to Hong Kong straight away. We went to the casino and played on the tables. My grandma found a bit boring so she decided to leave casino and went to Starbucks to meet my mom and sister. When we went out to the Starbucks after half hour, we could find our…",50
"This is undoubtedly one of the most luxurious properties in Macao. Everything with this place is just WOW.  Pros: 1. This is an all suit hotel, rooms are huge and bathrooms are loaded with amenities.  2. The sleep quality here is fantastic and beds were really comfortable. 3. Its a huge hotel, close to 3000 rooms and you need to fins your way in and out else you get lost. 4. The shopping area within the hotel is mind blowing and you will probably get each and every recognized brand at this shopping mall. 5. Casino is huge and well maintained, a casino lover will go mad with the options on offer and the way it has been handled.  Cons: 1. Check in process was way too slow but it is understandable as the hotel is huge and you will always find people standing in queue. 2. Too…",40
WE Went To Macau in Jun 2018 and Stayed in Venetian for 2 nights.The Property is too big And it has 3 more interconnected hotels.Lunch at Golden peacock is also very good but less variety for vegitarians,50
"Now what to say and what not to say! Everything was just wow for us. It was a royal stay for us.  The room was huge and extra luxurious.  The Shopping areas inside was just jaw dropping. We went mad! The casino was huge and very well maintained. If u don’t visit, you will not be able to understand what kind of hotel it is! Wow wow wow! The staff right from check in to check out was very helpful and extra courteous. It’s like a palace and very well maintained.",50
"Stayed for 2 nights at this hotel and I was impressed with the deco and facilities of the hotel.   Hotel is huge with 3000 rooms with casino and shopping malls.   Would recommend to do online fast checkin before arrival as you would be given priority in the line.   Checkin was attended by Ivy and she was really helpful and nice to offer us the free upgrade of room with high floor and nice view and late check out.    Had booked a Belle suite room and the room was huge and grand.  The bathroom was big with seperate room for toilet and bath and a dressing table.   Hotel is also within walking distance to the famous taipa village from the hotel west lobby and you can also take a bus outside the hotel to Senado Square.  Do check with the Concierge, look for Kiki, she is very helpful…",40
"Wow.. What to say about this landmark in Macao...  To sum up it up in 200 characters..  Very Impressive, Very Luxury, Very Photogenic, Very Big, Very Tiring and Very Expensive Place.. Must visit. Try the eggtarts near the hotel.",40
"If you're planning for a romantic ride with your partner, Gondola is the place to be. The guy who assisted us was very friendly, jolly and has beautiful voice--he sang, played a guitar while ""gliding"" the boat.  We booked this activity at Klook for PHP1498.00/ HKD221.72",50
"You should be here when you visit Macau! One of the biggest and iconic integrated resort in Macau. Beautiful Resort at the heart of Cotai Strip, easy access from the Ferry Terminal (complimentary shuttle services are widely available). We had stayed with Venetian for 2 nights during our recent visit. We were warmly greeted by the front desk receptionist, Nick and the check-in process only took less than 10mins. We would like to express our appreciation to him as he offered us an early check-in and upgraded our suite to a bigger suite. Thanks a million for his hospitality and kind effort. We really enjoyed our stay and will definitely come back again!",50
"I have been to Las Vegas and seen the Venetian hotel there many times, so I decided to try and stay in this Venetian. We had a wonderful stay. The room is spacious and the staff is friendly. The hotel is extremely large and can very easily get lost in so make sure you're not on a tight schedule to get anywhere.",50
"amazing beautiful and spacious suites with all necessary items. well done and maintained interiors. would love to stay again. Hotel is having everything inside, si you do not need to venture here and there. Food is delicious and reasonably priced.",50
"It is a luxurious hotel. The tariff are high but it is worth it. The rooms are excellent spacious and provide  all kind of facilities. Prior to booking hotel or prior to check in whenever I wrote to hotel, I got answer immediately and a satisfactory answer. the communication system is very good. Upon check in they were providing water bottles as much as you want, a good gesture. Now I have a complaint also. After check out , the concierge asked where will you go. I replied to Hong kong by Ferry. He again asked whether by hotel free shuttle service or by Taxi. Obviously my answer was by shuttle service. The shuttle bus left us about 1.5 Km before ferry terminal. The driver showed the way. We were group of six persons all 65 to 76 years old. Walking 1.5 Km with all luggage was…",50
"If you are not gambling, you can still have fun strolling around huge concept mall with flashy restaurants. The mall itself its an attractions including photo taking.  The gondola is nothing unique but should be okay with children. Try the egg tart at Lord Stow.",50
This is not just a hotel... It is  a city.. You get anything and everything you want in this place. The suit room was the last word of luxury. The breakfast was Awesome. The casinos down are the best of the world standard.,50
"This hotel is truly amazing and it does as it says on the label. On arrival to the hotel our suitcases were kindly handled and delivered to our room. The check in process took a bit longer than normal even after doing online check in but to be be fair we were asked if a smoking or non smoking room was required, we required a non smoking and were given a free room upgrade to a Cotai strip view room, nice. Everything else about the hotel was amazingly huge and is as described on their website. The reason I title it with the word individual is because during our stay I suffered an injury in our hotel room and required a hospital visit, (the hotel has thousands of guest and tourists daily but to them I was an individual and not just a number) the hotel staff were very helpful…",50
Very huge room with nice sitting area.It is big enough for four of us! smooth check in.The casino is close nearly.Also many restaurants and shops inside the mall. The shuttle service is very frequent to the pier!very convenient!,50
"Honestly if you ever get the chance to go to this place, it is amazing. We were told that it is the largest casino in the world and we can believe that. The actual casino area is huge with what looks like hundreds of tables and slot machines etc. The shopping experience around the canals (remember it's Venice) is designer, designer, designer and expensive. St Marks square is there and the ceilings are designed to look like a summers sky. Honestly brilliant. Didn't gamble as couldn't work out what to do as most of it is in Cantonese. Didn't see one other Western face in the resort and there were thousands of people gambling, quite nice to get away from the norm. Enjoy ",50
"This hotel is one of my favourite hotel to check in whenever we are in Macau. The service desk as always helpful and willing to do anything to make you satisfied. On our last visit here, I had a problem with one of their lobby guards. The hotel response to my complain right away and they make sure I enjoy the rest of my stay. Well of course they did not offer me any discount or any free accommodations in the future, but knowing someone is looking forward and taking actions to a problem really quick makes everyone comfortable and satisfied. Thank you again specially to Miss Lord Faith who provide us with quality service. ",50
Housing the worlds largest casino and being the seventh biggest building in the world by area with 3000 suites this luxury hotel is something and definitely worth a visit and stay. It’s like a self contained town. Foods courts. Shopping. Entertainment. Incredibly fine dine options. The mind boggling large casino. The beautiful luxury rooms. They have simulated the entire ceiling in the central court area to resemble and evening sky and a gondola ride to imitate the one in Venice. The ceilings and general theme is designed for the renaissance. Beautifully done. The only very big flip side is that it becomes a very large property crowds are worse than a mall on Black Friday and the check in delays are sad. Getting from anywhere to anywhere within the resort is confusing at the…,40
"It is a wonderful fancy Hotel, part of the Sands Resorts. It is one of the first hotels on the Strip n is rated at the top. Just like all hotels have, this too has free pickup buses from the Ferry terminals. All rooms are Suites n splendidly done up. Try to get one with a Cotai view of the Strip. The busiest Casino is in Venetian. The Canal shops and a gondola ride can transport anyone to memories of Venice. The restaurants are gud and serve International cuisine. There is also a Michelin star Indian restaurant, Golden Peacock, just near the Check in counter at West Lobby. There are some nice Bakeries close to it. The place is an exact replica of the Venetian in Las Vegas. It is interconnected with the Parisian Hotel.  On the downside, it gets too touristy and swarming with…",50
"Definitely the high light on a day trip from Hong Kong , everything about the hotel is impressive ! Casino is amazing and also going for a gondola ride the staff on the gondolas are fantastic !! We spent at least 3 hours there and could of spent more ! ",50
"In our trip to Macau this was the biggest attraction on our to do list. As we entered the hotel, it was absolutely an experience. The largeness, the vastness and the architectural appearance was simply great. When you enter it just feels like one is entering in to a Roman chapel coz of  design and the fresco paintings on walls and ceilings.  The next was when you move inside slowly by absorbing the place suddenly you are hit by an shopping area which is totally like a any Hollywood film set design. You must have an appetite to look around and not get tired of it. The brands, the displays, the shop decor, music around, lively cafes and importantly the water lagoons where we can take a ride in a gandola. Also what attracts the most is the sky view from the hotel. It is so…",50
Spend good times at casino with so.much fun loosing and winning money. Riding busses easy excess everywhere in Macau.  Shopping really makes you crazy especially all branded shop all corners. Remember to check on hotel map as all access to each hotel with all kinds of things you.like to buy... really enjoy walking and eating. Pricing sure a bit expensive but its ok if you happen to win some cash to use it. ,40
It was really a memorable experience to have stayed in Venetian. I travelled to Hongkong and then took the connecting ferry from airport to Macau. The journey is approximately an hour. You have free shuttle service from the ferry terminal to the hotel.The property is huge and there are high chances of you getting lost. The check in at times can take hours since it has huge number of tourists flocking in everyday! The room was really marvellous. Had an amazing view of the Galaxy hotel from the 26th floor. As such City doesn’t have much to offer. Suggest you do take trip to the Macau tower which is a paid visit. Other then that its the high end shopping malls which are interconnected and takes away most of your time. Evening you should just take a stroll down the nearby properties…,50
"This hotel is ""Grand"" by any definition. It is a huge property in every respect. Rooms, casino, shops & food venues are oversized.  If you are looking for something intimate/boutique style, this is not the place for you. Basic rooms are actually mini-suites with separate seating area, 2 large screen televisions, extra large bathroom with very nice amenities. This is the Asian version of Vegas so you will be in constant contact with significant numbers of  Asian gamblers. They have separate smoking rooms off the casino floor so it is a better environment than the older casinos in city center. BTW, the casino experience is very different from the US. The staff is excellent and goes out of their way to accommodate. English is spoken throughout the property and hotel restaurants.…",50
"A complete destination in itself - hotel plus shopping plus dining plus entertainment plus casino! And dripped in luxury & opulence.  Excellent suites, great room service Courteous staff  Good dining options (though a bit difficult for vegetarians), including the Indian Restaurant - Golden Peacock  The hotel is so big that it has its own map.  Don't miss the Gondola ride & heated pools!  Surprisingly, I find it value for money, when compared with hotel prices in Hongkong.",50
"If you are looking for a place that caters to everyone in your group or family, then Venetian is it! The moment you arrive at the hotel, you are greeted with a stream of excited visitors and smiling staff. There is a lot to do but we particularly enjoyed the casinos and the gondola ride. The endless choice of restaurants is worth trying. Also, the shopping arcade, sprinkled with cafes and eateries, will keep you going. The suites are spacious and clean.",40
"Hard to find any other cities in the world that can rival Venetian's space, opulence and luxury. Their rooms are one of the biggest in a city and their service is great! Even toilet rolls are delivered to the hotel rooms by their room service in a nice Venetian paper bag. Be prepared to walk a lot though, as this is a really huge building!! Over-the-top size for a hotel and round-the-clock entertainment. Recommend this place as one of the top hotels to stay in Macau!",50
"My 5 nights in Venetian were very pleasant and comfy. I booked the Royale Deluxe Suite room of size 70sqm, got the room at South wing which was right above the shopping area and food court..  Wide varieties of selection for shopaholic.. the place may be a little confusing for first timer, because the mall is big. After a day or two, we will be better in the directions 😬 Bus from airport to hotel is easy and hassle free. Buses 🚌 are available to many locations at the hotel West Lobby. Plenty of taxi 🚕 too.  Free WiFi is available, but not user friendly. We need to select the Venetian WiFi every now and then when in room. Even I have specifically click to Venetian WiFi my phone keeps tapping on back to my own WiFi gadget. Probably WiFi will break off once our device snooze for…",40
Venetian is all about experience and you will feel that the moment you arrive! It’s huge and unimaginably beautiful. The staff is friendly and the food is good too. We were with kids so could not use the casino.,50
"This massive property was over-the-top.  Huge gaming, shopping,and eating.  This has something for everyone and worth a visit.  Some of the most incredible, luxury shopping you will ever see.  The gold jewelry for Chinese new year was amazing.",40
"My second visit in this property and I love the spacious rooms and accessibility to shopping, gaming and food outlets. Interior Designs are outstanding!  Our  room floor however, though non smoking, smells cigarette fumes.  Maybe the hotel needs to be more strict with the guests who violate this.  Housekeeping may still be improved.  Stayed for 4 days and was requesting for a linen change but this was not accommodated until the day we left.",40
Visited the Venetian whilst on a day trip to Macau to see how it compared to Las Vegas - not disappointed as this seems to be bigger and we loved the shopping and the opulence of the place as well as the gondola ride!,50
"Spent New Year's Day here. Not quite as nice as the one in Vegas, but nevertheless amazing. Beautiful decor, and so much space. We asked for a non-smoking room but you could smell a hint if cigarette smoke. Got a really decent package that included tickets to the Monkey King (not quite a Cirque du Soleil show..) and breakfast. Breakfast was good, huge selection. Would definitely stay here again.",40
"Among all hotels in the Cotai area, Venetian remains to be my favorite.  Shopping and having the biggest foodcourt in the area is a plus.  But i missed the cast members who would dress up in european costumes. I enjoyed having our pictures with them during our visits in the past. The living statues are no more.  I was able to see one in the Parisian Hotel ",50
My wife and I had a great week here. 14 pools to pick from. Wifi was great. Food court offers everything. Many many shops. We loved the gondola ride in the hotel shopping centre. Rooms were spacious and lux. Room service was great and service was polite. Check in was a ordeal as 1000 people were checking in. If you want to check out hong kong take the high speed ferry they offer. Worth the money.,50
"Big is a under statement the third largest building in the world,over 3000 rooms, over 300 shops, food to suit anyone's taste , rooms large, bed was a dream to sleep in , the entire complex clean as, not one thing to complain about by far the best place I have ever stayed at.",50
"Everything was perfect. The check in, the check out, the food, the casino.  First we a bit worry for the check in because we heard that the check in process could took an hour but it wasn't. They have plenty of counter for check in. They provide shuttle to almost everywhere. Just can't get enough of this hotel. Just ask for an upgrade. If you're lucky you'll get one just like us. Not so luck with the casino tho...",50
"The hotel is great with it's grand entry to the hotel, one may get lost into the attractive lights of the hotel. The hotel has got everything, from shoppers streets to restaurants of almost all cuisines. The name venetian is enough for anyone to understand the uniqueness of the hotel which is based on the Venice city and truly lives upto the expectation. The rooms provide all sort of facility with a suite huge enough to accommodate 100 people and with the 24x7 gambling you will get every chance to lose money (I lost too).  The best thing was the detailing of the hotel with which things were made. I personally like the top of the shoppers street which looks like a sky and you can not make out whether it is real or artificial, and in galleries the paintings on the walls as well as…",40
"Yukti took care of our checkin and she was very nice, accoodating, friendly and gave us a lot of tips, which were helpful. Overall experience was very nice and she gave us a nice room. The room was comfortable, above average luxurious and has a nice view of the Cotai strip. This hotel has some nice experience, including the streemosphere performances from 12pm to 6pm daily on the hour except during special events. The gondola ride was also enjoyable.  Yukti's service made the difference in the stay! Thanks for a memorable stay and experience!",40
Excellent service at the front desk Pick up from Macau ferry point was smooth Checking was smooth Huge rooms very spacious  Breakfast is too good  Excellent value for money One of best hotels to stay in Macau ,40
"Macau is a must visit place for all of them who would like to give their luck a try. And this hotel is gem of all. Designed on theme of Venice this is a self contained Hotel where you can stay, shop, eat, enjoy the feel of evening at midnight, and over n above play at the Casino.  The rooms give you the feel of real luxury. The service is to the expectation.",50
"I have to say the room was so spacious and huge, really beyond our expectation. There was a good unobstructed view from our room and the stay was so relaxed and comfortable. The room was equipped with all the facilities/accessories that a guest would need and there was nothing that I could fault or complain about. Coffee/tea making facility, ironing, fridge, safe deposit box, complimentary mineral water, slippers, gowns, 2 big TVs, huge shower/toilet area etc. The resort has many shops, restaurants,bars,Casino and a food court to keep the guests entertain and occupied.  Anyway, really enjoyed our stay and will definitely come back again to the Venetian Hotel on my next visit to Macau.",50
"Came to the Casino section (only) as part of a tour. The place looks unbelievable as soon as you step in. You’re not allowed to take pictures inside the Casino area though.  The most beautiful part is the shopping areas that looks like a miniature version of Venice, even the little canal looks awesome.  Totally worth a stop. ",50
Nothing here is real. It is all a fantasy including the sky over Piazza San Marco complete with canals and gondolas and blue cloudy sky. Shops no body can afford to spend money in. Bars where a beer is $80.00. Cotai arena was amazing. All inside a single massive building. Gambling tables with $1000 minimum and $2000000 maximum bets. A great experience but just not real,40
"This is my first and only impression.   The room is so big that would fit up to 4 adults The room comes with a big bath room, living room.  There is Handy phone with few counties that you may call at no charge.  Check in counter was always packed , it’s recommended to resister the express checkin before hand    ",40
The Venetian has a very nice and energetic feeling about it .We loved the spacious room and a very elegant bathroom with his and hers washbasins .The casino was a great experience and it is a great place to enjoy while on a holiday .There is decent vegetarian option in the buffet for breakfast in Cafe deco .The Golden peacock restaurant also has good choice of Indian veg items .,40
What’s good  The property is massive and has amazing facilities. There is a gondola ride at third floor and a golf course at 5th. Pools are plenty. Main part is the casino.  What’s not good  Prices are steep and unlike Vegas they don’t offer you free chips to start in the casinos.  What to do  Enjoy the casino and the various restaurants. Galaxy is around the corner and Parisian is a stone throw from here.,50
"What can I say to Venetian? Feels like alone in your big mansion... Its a room like a condo unit. I like the bed it's comfy, sofa, bathroom, everything inside. I like the idea of having 2 television, one in bed and one in living room. It feels like home. There is a mini bar and complimentary water which is good. The price is quite expensive for me because I'm in a solo but good for family. Its like living in a luxurious life, atleast for one day hehe. The free shuttle is outside the hotel and it's good for tourist. There is food court a available which is more affordable than eating in fancy restaurant. I can say that I spent good night after long walk strolling around the place. ",40
"This place is huge, and i mean huge ! we stayed for one night and the room was very big, clean and well stocked. The shopping centre and how it interconnects with other casinos is cool. We ate a lot of different cuisines and everything was good.",40
"This hotel is nothing short of spectacular. There is only one thing i can pic on about this hotel and its location related. Theres free buses to drop you off to the hotel, the inside is an enormous building with large hallways of roman proportions. The hotel itself is surrounded withing a maze filled with shops and its easy to go around in circles. Finding reception was equally difficult to find , it is hidden behing a large set of escalators. The hotel entry has a north and south entrance each is on opposite side of a food court. The shops surroundings are high end stores mostly. Now The hotel and room are quite spacious , has flowing spaces with a touch of class. my room was on the 30th floor with a great view of the galaxy across nice to see at night. The ensuite had both…",40
"Great and grand hotel to stay in , very elegant and spacious , the room is clean ,the staff are very friendly  ..i like also the grand mall connected  with the hotel .also the huge entertainment area which satisfied all ages. We had an enjoyable time there ,worth to visit and stay",50
Great hotel to stay with so many facilities and friendly staffs. Easy to access food and shopping. Free shuttle bus back and forth from the ferry terminal. It's really value for money. Try to avoid peak period coming to Macau due to many tourists are mostly coming from mainland. ,50
Venetian Macau is an execellent hotel worth staying it. Very nice huge rooms clean neat and tidy. Each and every corners were best. Rooms and bathrooms are excellent up to the mark. The entire property is worth. It’s huge one we need atleast 2 days. Morning breakfast also good vegetarions have good options no need to worry. Personnel at receiption was nice polite Mr Allan I really appreciate. ,50
"the only word for ""The Venetian Macao Resort Hotel"" is GRAND . I am back from my holiday but am still aww struck . Every one should get this experience one in a lifetime. In love with the is property .The staff is helpful and polite . Put this on your must visit list .",50
Best & Biggest Hotel I have visited in the World. Really Venice like feel! 😍 Superb Casinos & Amazing Showrooms. Lots and lots of Restaurants  and Bars. You Must need at least 2 days just to visit only Hotel!,50
Luxury Rooms and Very Nice for stay with family and Kids. No need to go out for any entertainment. Full pack resort with fun and happening. Very nice when you with kids and family. You need more than 2 days to completely go around the resort,50
"Superb experience at this hotel.Need 2 full days to explore the place.Nearby Parisian also very nice.Mind boggling shopping experience.The Gondola ride can be experienced here...truly a memorable experience..romantic.. Amazing food spread,had a beautiful view from the suite,luxurious bath products,...had a wonderful stay.looking forward to visiting again  ,",50
"Checked in during a super typhoon; we were caught off guard about this incident. Still, we pursued our plan. Water leaked from our window due to the strong wind and heavy rain. Super typhoon 10 afterall! The maintenance staff quickly responded to our need and check the condition of the room. Good thing that the damage is not that serious. They offered us a room transfer but we chose to stay on the same room since the damage is not that big and its a hassle on our part to move our things to another room.  Despite of the weather condition, we still manage to enjoy our staycation in Venetian together with its sister-hotels. Parisian Macau, Four Seasons Hotel and Sands Cotai Central are just around the corner. Sands hotels are connected to each other by bridges. So better use your…",50
"Room - recommend Cotai view Location of the hotel - the heart of the luxury. If you have Ctai view, you can enjoy the view to the performance lake of Wynn palace, flashy City of Dreams, the brotherhood of St.Regis, Sheraton and Conrad. Pools - outstanding. Breakfast - delicious. Staff - very attentive, professional and caring. Thank you for making visit to Macau exceptional and memorable.",50
"We took our tour from Hong Kong so travelled by a fast ferry and were met by a shuttle bus.  The Venetian Casino area is just enormous and a replica of Venice in Italy ... even St Marks square, and with a canal on which garbed gondoliers punted their craft and sang Italian love songs. The (artificial) sky above was permanently blue and well lit.  Shops abound and one could get lost quickly in the many beautifully tiled arcades.  Macau has over 40 casinos but we thought this one worth a mention.   The old town with Portuguese architecture, winding streets etc provided for an enjoyable walk amongst the history.",50
"Location is convenience , but the shuttle bus stop is so far away from the main doorthe staffs are very helpful, it provide express check in, it is more convenienceSpacious room with clean environmentFacilities of Gym room and swimming pool are quite good",40
"I booked the Monkey King package and the whole experience was great. The hotel staff are very friendly, hotel room is huge and clean, perfect location and good food selections. Definitely will come back again. ",50
"The Venetian hotel is an Impressive mega hotel resembling the city of venice with all the canals and waterways surrounding the hotel, the san marco square, and the san marco cathedral...The hotel has wonderful interiors.",50
"Really cool hotel, although it was a bit of a bugger's muddle getting checked in (so much for fast track!!) We signed our lives away to join the ""green club"" so that we could get a free trip to Level 7 of the Eiffel tower at the nearby Parisian (this turned out to be a great photo op, and you can walk there from the Venetian without going outside).   Our City View suite was amazing. Huge... big enough for 6. And with a view of (part of) the Cotai strip.   No real need to pay for breakfast as the food court was really good (as was the Macau Beer), although it was always a fight to get a table due to the sheer volume of people (the shops were a relief in comparison, something I never thought I'd say!)    Really near to some fun stuff too (like the light show and cable car at the…",50
" The Venetian is a beautiful landmark hotel on Cotai Strip.   Our 29-70 room which is across from The Wynn hotel, provided us a great view of the dancing fountain show without leaving the room.  The Bella suite is huge and beautifully decorated in European style.  We made a reservation for 3 adults.  The Bella Suite has 2 Queen beds and big sofa bed.  The hotel arranged an extra set of bedding for the sofa bed.  Thank you to Namata, the front, who provided excellent check in service and gave a good impression of the hotel.  She kindly gave us a 4 p.m. late check out due to my handicapped 77 year old mother.    The hotel has 3 big pools thus it was great for my daily lap swim exercise.  No running tab bar at the pool which I found to be inconvenient.  The mini-golf is great as…",50
Heart of the city and amidst several other great hotels. Great and big rooms. Hotel being huge and with several entry/exit points it is always confusing to locate guests who come to meet. way to the rooms from the main entry is through casino which is a maze and you tend to get lost.,40
"Is a huge resort that has a casino on the ground floor and too many dinning options. Suites are luxury ,very big with all the amenities ,super clean Breakfast area is also very big with many many options that cover any taste",50
The service here was out of this world! Everyone from check-in staff to staff on the hotel floor to room service was A*. I paid a bit more for service and luxury with this hotel and was not disappointed. There is so much to do that we did not ever leave the hotel grounds on the first day. The food for room service was delicious and the service given by the staff for setting up the room for dinner was just amazing! I will only be staying here when visiting Macau in the future! Thanks for an unforgettable stay! ,50
"Sometimes copying works well and originality must be put aside. The Venetian in Macau is one example of it. Its Las Vegas style is simply everything a luxurious casino has to be like. Apart from the casino itself, hotel suits are clean, comfortable, big and with a wonderful view over the city. Pool is cool too. Waiting service is nice, friendly and ready to help you. The building is enormous filled with shops, restaurants and even a Venice-like canals area. A must visit when in Macau.",50
"Stayed here for just 1 night, as we were keen to see how Macau stacked up vs Las Vegas. Check in was smooth, our room was huge, free superfast wifi, free bottled water, in room safe, tea/coffee making facilities and they sent up cake for my birthday. Pool area great with a 18+ area. The shuttle bus to and from ferry is a great help. If you've been to Vegas, Macau has a totally different feel. If your looking for somewhere else to eat and drink away from the expensive restaurants and bars of the strip there is a great area a 10 minute walk from front of hotel, which has many shops, bars and restaurants.",50
"What a great great place. Stayed here for a night with my family and it was too less. The hotel is so huge that you need 3 days just to explore it. Amazing rooms, good food and great shopping this is your one stop when visiting Macau.",50
"We stayed on a room overlooking Cotai view of Macau on Sept. 2-5, 2018. Just like any other hotels, hospitality is a basic commodity deserved to all guests. When the staff do not just welcome you as guests but treat you like friends and family, they are hitting it to the next bar. That's where our Venetian experience stood-out. Lovely from the front desk was very polite and accommodating. Most of all, Faith Lord was very pleasant, thoughtful and a high-spirited staff who consistently delighted us from the time we arrived until we left the hotel. Their efficient shuttle bus service made our way to the hotel more convenient. Everything was just astounding!",50
"We stayed in a suite for 2 nights in a newly decorated room , it was really nice very large clean and comfortable. We will definitely be going back . A big thank you to Yukti I rang at last minute to see if anything could be arranged for our friends Anniversary,our friends were so pleased with a lovely towel art on there bed and a really nice cake thank you so much .",50
"Everything was great from arrival at ferry terminal they have shuttle service which has very comfortable with Wi-Fi. Check in was very quick and guided us to our room with map. Location, check in, concierge, food, staff, Wi-Fi, checkout and shuttle service back to ferry terminal was great. I will definitely visit this hotel again.",50
"We stayed 2 nights at the Bella Suites, newly decorated, Clean and Spacious. The hotel is located at the center the strip and is so huge that you actually need a map to navigate the hotel. The hotel has the famous Gondola ride and provides free shuttle bus service which is well organized. Cafe Deco is the ideal place for a breakfast The hotel's Casino is huge and nice.",50
"(+) We booked a Royale Deluxe Cotai View Suite and the room was amazing, very spacious and nicely decorated. The hotel is massive, great casino and plenty of shops.  Loved the gondola singers. Pleasant staff at reception   (-) we were asked to wait 20-30min for our suitcases to be delivered to our room but We waited over 1hour and had to follow up with them a couple of times. Delivered after 90min Breakfast was definitely far from the standard I would expect from a 5* hotel. Very bad coffee, cold/warm food and not great. They had a live egg station but still pre-cooked the eggs so you get warm(ish) eggs. Not sure what’s the point of having a live station. asked for a hairdryer as my room didn’t have one and again, over 1 hour waiting and several follow up calls. ",40
"I like this hotel with all the detail .. im stay in royal suite . The room so big and clean comfort . If 3 floor there is big shooping center with all branded stuff u need , there is LV, gucci, dior an many more . Really love it .  Also the casino so big 🤤🤤🤤 .   Note: dont forget to checkin from ur mobile so u can checkin fast . Also for checout there is beside lift place for checout instant",50
"We’ve stayed there twice. We would say this hotel’s one of the most marvelous place in the entire Macau. Hotel decoration and the theme is amazing.  We’re very much sure that every tourist would loved to see the concept of “Venetian Macau” and which would impressed us very much. Specially the engineering and unique design.  We would definitely visit during this this year, again. ",50
"I would like to commend Manager Faith Lord who was very efficient in managing the long queue.  Able to maintain her warm and pleasant smile amidst peak hour situation (not an easy feat!).  I was very happy with the newly- renovated room that we stayed in..had a great view, spacious, good smell and nice interior design. We had a great stay and would definitely come back! :)",50
"Since the shopping mall is so large that I spent a lot of time to find the shortest routes to go.I think it'd be a special experience if there's an app, like google map, works only within your hotels' group.",40
"It's been two years in a row that I have been travelling to Macau and it was 6th time to stay at The Venetian last month. Indeed, I consider it as my home away from home.  Chose to have a staycation over the weekend and as expected as ever the hotel guests were over flowing and lining in queue upon check in process. Assigned hotel front office in charge Kenneth Ling welcomed me with the warmest greeting, sweet smile, quick to assist and tried his best to accommodate my room view preference request yet due to the bulk of guests arrivals the view that I wanted was not made possible.  And the quick recovery plan was made possible by JBoy (ID 41596) of Concierge. Who I met since my 1st visit and consistently never fail to deliver immediately the needs of the guest even without…",50
It’s huge .. one of the best hotels in Macao   All shops are here . I am staying in south wing .  Floor 33.  Great view . Great experience . great fun . Everything is in walking distance.all shops are there in this hotel.  ,50
"I was a project foreman of this Job, building the hotel tower of Venetian. After the job, this is the first time I enter the hotel room as a guest to truly view this magnificent masterpiece. Although ten years passed after the completion of the Venetian, it is still one of the best hotels in Macau.",50
"perfect trip. Room is very nice and comfortable.My father ,mother and son like it very much.Just arrived ,they already take the photo show on the wechat friend groud.so exciting.they like this hotel very much.and tell me the food is very delicous.",50
"Overall I didn't really find Macau to be intriguing but Venetian blew my mind, what lovely rooms! and to top it up great views outside the window. They were kind enough to upgrade us while checkin. The only problem I faced was LONG que at the checkin counter, it approximately took us 45 min to check-in. Thats too much",50
"Probably one of the best rooms I’ve ever stayed in. It was spotless and very well equipped with everything you’d need. Pre check in was great, basically jumped the quite long check in line and took to VIP check in room to get room keys. Free upgrade to a room with a better view too. Couldn’t find any blackjack on the casino floor but that doesn’t mean it isn’t there as it’s huge. Express check out and shuttle to ferry terminal was very efficient. ",50
"Venetian macau is one of the best hotel i've ever stayed. aside from having a spacious room their staff are very accomodating,friendly and always had a ready smile especially Lovely from the front office. everything you need is inside the Hotel so no need to worry b'coz different kinds of food is all there. My daughter enjoyed their pool since i can let her swim on her own(with me beside her) since they have available life vest for the children.",50
We stayed at the Venetian hotel over the August summer holidays in 2018. The hotel was amazing the architecture on the ground level was extra ordinary the golden globe feature in the main lobby is really pleasing to the eye. We used the Macau bus shuttle to get to the hotel which was efficient and free  When we checked in the queue was really long omg but maybe that was because it was a peak season nonetheless I wish we didn’t have to stand on hour to check in 😕 . When we finally did check in we stayed in the north suites a walk away from the lobby our bags 💼 where delivered to our rooms within half an hour which was effective. The Venetian hotel is truly an architectural marvel the third floor had a maze mall and we often found ourselves in circles but good job to the guys in…,50
"I stayed with my parents and brothers during 2016. The Venetian Macao Resort Hotel and Casino, is one of Asia's most exciting entertainment destinations. It had more than 30 stylish restaurants serving international, Western, Chinese, or Japanese cuisines, and many bars and lounges. You can enjoy the outdoor swimming pools, mini golf courses, gondola rides operated by singers.  It has V Gym, Malo Spa and nice shopping mall linked to it.  Towards the end of my stay, my wife and kids joined me and I had to reserve more rooms at a fi hotel.  If you’re planning to stay at the hotel with kids, I advise you NOT to! You wouldn’t be able to go to your room via the lobby if the hotel because of the Casino. Instead, you would be asked to use an escalator on the left side of the main…",50
"Venetian Macau is one of the best hotel I've stayed by far.  Despite losing my wallet in Macau, I managed to enjoy my overnight stay here in Macau mainly because of this hotel.  Kevin who was the manager in our suite wing helped us get through some bumps while being a guest (without wallet) at this hotel.  We were given comps and other special benefits which we truly appreciate.  Most of the staff here do speak English which is another plus.  Strong free Wi-Fi everywhere esp. in the room.    My girl booked us a Bella Deluxe Cotai View Suite.  Our suite was absolutely amazing and huge.  It has a grandiose design of gold, maroon, beige and brown with two queen size bed, living area and massive window that showcase the stunning night lights of Macau.  Service was also tops.  Room…",50
Awesome hotel. Rooms suites room all were awesome. One thing i would like to request you is luggage issues please solve it for the more faster delivery of the luggage golden peacock restaurant bestest everything was awesome casino a place to visit for. Shopping ia great,50
"The Venetian hotel at Macao is a copy of the one in Las Vegas, so if you want to live the entire experience, I would suggest to try the Vegas one. However, the Venetian has excellent service and the staff are both welcoming and always there in case you need them. It has a nice and big casino and lots of restaurants and shops for all tastes. The room we chose was overlooking the Macao ""Strip"" and was really spacious.  There is no negative for The Venetian. Unfortunately, Macau was a big let-down for us as the casinos offering was limited and with no special shows as happened in Vegas. It seems that Macau moves to become like Atlantic City...",40
"Very good place for stay and lot entertaiment for kids, also have a lot food place so excited, and shoping center all brands, and have casino to play its a very very good place to spend time with the family, im so gratefully and happy to stay at venetian macau",50
Excellent property. Very good rooms. Staff too very helpful. Casino one wishes English language help is available. Food was again well above average. The ambience was very captivating. Initially lifts were confusing though later one gets accustomed to,40
Fantastic awesome...superb...Indian food is better than India...never had Bhindi...n Biryani like that....Great view.. Golf course..Casino...Out of the world shopping arcade...More than anywhere amenities for kids in Family Suite...,50
"This is the biggest casino in the world and easy to see why. The main floor is wall to wall with people and slot machines, card station etc.   The shopping centre is massive and you could easily get load on the several levels. Whilst I didnt stay here, it did seem a world away from the real Macau, so visit it on your day on the island, but remember there is more to the island then this newly made establishment. Just remember to try one of lord stows egg tarts here in the grand canal area as its easy to find then the mainland.",50
"Staffs are smart and very kind.  Room is clean and good lighting.  Not too bright and too gloom. Concierge staffs are also very helpful and pleased. Generally, this trip was great and excellent quailty. Must visit again if come to macau with my friends and family.  And, will introduce for my friends.  ",50
"We stay for a weekend holidays in this large luxury hotel in Macau. Of course, the suite is very large, clean, comfortable beds, 2 large TV, sound-proof, good view. Large and full equipped bathroom. Beautiful swimming pools. Large shopping mall, restaurants and casino.",40
"Very spacious and clean room, with a nice view of the mini golf course and Cotai. The Venetian itself is really massive with lots of shops and a beautiful canal. It is a short walk (abt 15mins) to Taipa Village.   Staying at the Venetian was very convenient as they provide free shuttle buses that bring you to the airport, Sands Cotai (over at the Macau peninsula), Zhuhai border, ferry terminal and other hotels in Cotai. It can be expensive to take a cab to cross over the bridge to the 'old Macau' side. So you can consider taking the shuttle bus to Sands Cotai, or take the Cotai connection to either Wynn or MGM and take their shuttle bus over to their sister hotel at the other side. From there, you can walk over to attractions such as Senado Square/ St Paul Ruins etc. Do take…",50
"Amazing the Premio Royale suite everything and more than we expected.You will just find everything is absolutely perfect and great, bedroom is spacious area and matrass is comfortable, and Front office staff IVY provided us expected  experience and  high-quality services",50
Great hotel with an obsession on cleanliness.They make sure that your stay is smooth. We had a business conference and found the arrangement to be flawless.great place to relax and unwind.The staff is helpful and all of them speak english,50
"Very spacious and clean room, nice view toward the main road and mini golf  course. We got a nice room decoration and soft cake to celebrate our anniversary..  They also provided a Handy phone which you could bring around for city tour. Elegant lobby area, and big gaming floor for those who enjoy it..  However the canal is very dirty, plenty of leaflets and empty water bottle floating around... Plus the facility started to look aged.. there is a small crack in our bathroom tile where it seems water seeps into it..  We tried the swimming pool, and it took some time just to walk there. Nice clean pools (they got 3 plus 1 jacuzzi) But some of it are heated, so not so comfortable to swim in during day time..",40
"This is quite a replica of The Venetian at Las Vegas. A mobile in the room, two TVs, separate sitting area from bedroom, nice view.. I quite enjoyed my stay here. The resort property is huge and is connected to other properties around. The shoppes were nice. Loved the over all feel of the place. The food served during our 4 days convention was very delicious, esp the Indian food. Loved being there. ",50
"We came around 9am in the morning and found out that the check in will only be accepted at 3pm. But then we politely asked the staff in the check out counter and he said that we can come back around 11:30am and they'll try their best to have us checked in as early as possible. In the meantime we just go for shopping which is just right at the hotel, we also had our lovely lunch and came by 12nn. The staff then confirmed and check us in. Although it was like a treasure hunting to find out suite but then once we arrived at our room, our hearts was filled with delight with how comfortable it is and how luxury it feels.",40
"What a experience ! They upgraded us to same suite but a better view and bigger beds . A must stay at Venetian If visiting Macao . The shuttle service is well organised and we saw all the hotels in the vicinity. The casino is just amazing , In room dining offers good food !what else one need on a vacation . Highly recommended 👍🏻",50
Only for the experience of this large hotel n venitian theme. Very crowded in the walk ways with tourists do would not try again although the rooms are huge.  Pool was great all 4 of them n service by the pool was excellent. If staying make sure u pre book your arrival as the lineup is Long n slow. Parisian next store is part of the same hotel group also newer I expect do could be a better option without so much hype n crowd,40
"In the course of the hotel's stay, it still experienced high-quality services, including the service of the hotel staff, the hotel's various facilities, shopping malls, catering services, and hotel shuttle buses. Hope to have the chance to stay at the Venetian hotel again.",50
"not bad, but just a little bit too old, would be better if the room are more clean, the place would not be so crowd, food are not bad, but just too expensive. i like the service and would recommend people to go there.",40
"I went to macau with my family between 22 and 25 July. We stayed three nights in Venetian. The staff were nice. Room was clean, tidy and spacious with a handy phone provided which was very convenient to tourist. Though this hotel was opened for more than ten years but its maintenance was good. Food was quite good as well that we have tried Japanese and Chinese restaurants. Highly recommended!",50
"The room size is good. toilettes is adequate.The swimming pool side staff is good as I was scratch in the Jacuzzi, he responsed positively that he dropped his work and led me to the first-aid place for treatment. I appreciated it very much Which showed a customer-oriented service.",40
"It's a city in the palace. Too many people roaming around you in the lobby, corridor and shopping area. But once you enter the residential suits area, it's peace peace n peace.   It's very crowded place but worth visiting and staying. I can say , it's a city in the palace. Multiple shops, restaurants, cafes , bars, brands, all togather at one place.  The area is huge and you can not find one place another time when you search. It's highly decorated place.   Rooms are amazing. Not a room but it's suite. Nothing to ask more. Simply amazing.   All the shopping area is highly glitter. They have created Venice like feel and artificial sky roof. Both are mesmerizing.   It's not a hotel but it's a palace with the city inside it.   ",40
"1. There were some problems at the check-in, but I was impressed with the staff's efforts to resolve them quickly. I don't remember the name of the check-in counter staff and manager, but I want to thank them again 2. I wish I could pay with a credit card on the food court",40
The hotel is quite big but overall it was great experience staying here.  The staffs are helpful especially the concierge.  Will stay here again next trip and hopeto spend more time here to explore more.,50
This is an awesome hotel. In this hotel there is a biggest casino in macau. We can enjoy this venetian. They have many shops to shopping (like mall) They have starbucks if you want to relax or enjoy the coffee. They have small venetian which makes you feel like in italy. You can take gondola and portuguese people  will lead your boat while singing some beautiful songs. Also so many restaurant inside the venetian. We can find it easily.  In macau we can use hongkong dollars. So if you plan go to hong kong and macau. Just use hong kong dollar. Because we can not use pataca macau in other country.   We can go to macau from hong kong or from shenzhen (one of city's name in china) by ferry. ,50
stayed for 3 nights in November 2017 biggest casino in the world amazing booked a suite and very big room  but for the price you pay there is better options in macau like Banyan Tree  Room service quick  check in and out quick because i booked suite room  all complex very nice,40
"This was one amazing hotel. My suite was of a good size, staff very friendly and helpful. It is a massive place but well worth a stay. You are separate from the casino and shopping so no noise in your room but everything is accessible by lift. Room service was never any trouble and was quick and efficient. I stayed 4 nights and wish I could have stayed longer. Room was maintained everyday with everything replenished. All the little extras were much appreciated. Hope to stay again sometime. Thank you to all the staff at the Venetian for a lovely stay. I was traveling alone and  felt very safe here.",50
"This is my 4th or 5th time in the Venetian.  As the hotel is huge, it's impossible for the staffs to know anybody by name.  Since it was for business we didn't use much of their facilities except the conference (but that has not been taken into account in this review).  Check in was quick and smooth.  We asked for a room with nice view and they did not disappoint us.  Room was spacious and well maintained.  It had undergone refurb 2 years ago, the decor is less ""baroque"" and more modern.  What I really appreciate is the ""mobile"" with free internet and local calls which guests can take out with them while they explore Macau. Very thoughtful.  Bathroom is clean, love the aromatherapy amenities.  Bed and pillow were superb, some of my best sleeps away from home. ",50
"This is our 2nd time to stay here. Apparently the lady manning the line at the check-in counter was very irritating. She stopped me and my husband from queing, she could have explained in a nice manner that only one person can line-up but instead she stopped us as if we couldn’t check-in, until few guests have passed us and when i call her attention  if I can go back to the line, she was like smiling as if she was happy on what she did. Luckily our whole stay turn out to be wonderful.",40
"Sheldon,the founder and developer of this paradise, got the idea from the dream. Then, he immediately got to work trying to copy his other hotel, The Venetian Las Vegas. His dream was truly made and now it stands as a beacon in all of China!! My experience is  little compared to what this can show us.",50
"there is free shuttle bus from the airport and easy to take. the pre-deposit luggage service is nice and  after I check-in they sent my luggage to my room before I arrive, they are speed, the suite is high cost price. I had perfect experience in The Venetian Macao Resort Hotel",50
 Based on Venetian theme from Venice city Italy this is the largest casino in the world and is packed with thousands of hotel suites and hundreds of casino tables. Hotel offers great luxury but of course it comes with the price. The place also encompasses a small artificial lake and offers gondola rides for a small fare. This ride must be the best part about this place and in the evening it’s really romantic. ,50
"Good service, spacious room, excellent sleeping quality, and excellent facilities, with nice swimming pools, perfect playing areas for kids. It is too noisy in the food court, and too crowded in the lifts to West Entrance.",40
"Can't complain - it's a very good hotel that rightfully earned a good reputation. But it is not excellent in my view, especially because it's huge and impersonal.  The breakfast at the deco cafe was disappointing, we are vegetarian and there was little we could eat, the fruit wasn't peeled (you had to cut out the melon and pineapple peels yourself), the bakery selection was poor, and the coffee wasn't good.",40
"I came to Macao three times and chose Venetian every time.Everytime. Left me a beautiful memory.The pillow is so comfortable, but the air conditioner is too noisy.The cold air in the mall also made me shiver with cold.Some waiters in the casino were a little arrogant.Still wish the Venetian  get better and better and  I will come again next time.",50
 Tissue box  seems not enough and just on  the table and toilet. If the toilet has the air refresher would be better. Sometime the toilet quite smelly indeed and no machine for the air to be drew out. Everything inside the room just have two set but we have three persons. I think you should checked the reservation detail before making the room. It become inconvenient that I make the call everytimes I found something is missing because missing one set of the tools. IF THERE IS SHUTTLE GOING TO THE CENTER PART OF MACAU WOULD BE GREAT BECAUSE SOME MANY VISITOR GO TO MACAU EVERY DAY AND THERE IS INSUFFICIENT TRANSPORTATION FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE THE SIGHTSEEING. IT WOULD BE GREAT HELP TO HAVE HOTEL SHUTTLES TO GO AND RETURN FROM HOTEL,40
"I have tried other hotels in Macau and Vegas over Venetian, but no one can beat Venetian for that touch, u must try different suites like rialto and panorama, even though it's base room is very spacious, the marbles in the bathroom would leave u awe struck, food options are there but all inclusive thing is always missing, I love the Venetian epoxy floor in the grand canal shoppes area, no one can beat the ambience in that area,lot of shopping options are there but it is pricey.",50
Great Excellent :) It was the best hotel I have ever visited. I was so impressed that I could meet such a hotel again. I would like to recommend it to people visiting Macau. I am also going to visit this hotel again.,50
The hotel is huge with a large numbers of shops and dining options.  It is also connected to several other hotels/shopping areas.   The shopping is aimed at the upper end market.  The hotel is also nicely decorated with a Venetian theme.  The rooms are big (just like everything at the Venetian) with a separate lounge area and a large bathroom. Again the decoration is Venetian and has a luxury feel. We did find the soundproofing was lacking particularly the entrance door to the room.  Noise from the adjoining room was audible at times as was noise from the hallway.  The Venetian is a huge complex.  There are lots of people milling around and with so much happening at the complex it's easy not to venture outside too much. We would recommend the Venetian for the experience but if…,40
"This is a massive luxury integrated resort, and the rooms are large and luxurious. You get exactly what you expect to get for the price and theme of this hotel.   The free shuttle bus to and from the ferry terminal is not only helpful but necessary as this hotel is quite far from the downtown. But then again if you are staying at this hotel you are likely planning to spend your time within the hotel boundaries. ",50
If u are in Macau this is an ideal hotel to stay .The rooms are excellent and the service provided by the hotel is very good .You will get all u need for staying within the hotel itself right from shopping best brand to fabulous clothing .You will get restaurants that cover international cuisine .Cafe Deco is the ideal place for a breakfast here.,50
"The size and detail of this hotel is spectacular. The price is amazing for the room you are given. The room is absolutely huge with a small living space, massive bed and grand bathroom. The resort itself contains its own indoor gondolas around canals which make the whole resort look amazing with the decor. Must visit if going to Macau.",50
"Venetian  is indeed a 5 star  hotel. We stayed 1 night for birthday celebration.  Samuel from reception was so nice  . He gave us free upgarde to bella suite  Room  is spacious , clean and well kept Joy also gave us a free cake  and late check out as we travel with kids. She  She is so professional and helpful.  Thumbs up on her service .. really exceed my expectation. Her smile and kindness gave us so much happiness. We will come back again for sure and will recommend  to my friends.",50
Joy from Front Office attendant was so helpful and nice she help us a lot and have a good product knowledge. Me and my family where looking forward to comeback again as soon as possible. My sister was so happy today on her birthday they also give us free birthday cake；) Me and my family enjoy a lot. Thank you again Joy..  ,50
The Venetian Macao Resort Hotel is a family resort hotel. The standard room has 2 Queen size beds and 1 sofa bed so it is enough for parents with 2 or 3 children. The price is cheaper than using 2 rooms,50
"We stayed at this property in last week of May 2018. We were a couple with a 4 year old. We were mesmerized with the service provided to us at the hotel. We were there to celebrate a special occasion and Ms. Yukti Mehra, a guest relation officer at the hotel made sure that we had an experience to cherish for the lifetime. We were given room upgrade to a Premium Bella suite which was extremely pretty along with club room access. We were escorted to the room by Yukti who also arranged to book our dinner at the Golden Peacock ,  an Indian restaurant at the hotel and introduced us to the restaurant Manager as well. This restaurant serves the most delicious food ever and is not so costly. The room was huge. We were welcome'd in the room with a Yummy cake, flower decoration and gifts…",50
"Wow. What can I say. I've stayed in the Venetian in Las Vegas, but the Venetian in Macau is just spectacular. The rooms are 70 square meters, which is the size of an apartment back home !!! The beds were so comfortable, the bathroom was huge and gorgeous, and the amenities were excellent.  The hotel itself is like a whole town - you need 3 days at least to see everything, but unfortunately we just had 24 hours. The shops, restaurants (we tried 2), and venetian canals, were wonderful.  Would definitely come back again if we pay another visit to Macau.",50
The awesome place I have ever visited awesome architecture beautifully interior one of the best resort I have ever seen and my lucky resort too I visited second time here love coming here best of macao 🇲🇴 ,50
"Many people visit the Venetian just to see it ! Others to go to the casino.  But the Venetian is worth a stay.  Rooms are spacious, modern and comfortable.  And everything is close by - great shops, restaurants, shows .... and Lord Stow’s egg tarts.  Nothing more needed ....",40
"Undoubtedly the best hotel I've ever had the pleasure of staying in. As compared to the other 5 stars I've stayed at, this one tops the list easily. It's like a city on its own. It'll take you at least a week to explore the entire hotel and all the magnificence it has to offer. Be it shopping, entertainment, the suites, the service everything was fantastic. The suites, especially the suites and of course, their incredible CASINO! The casino is a must visit even if you plan to gamble or not. Plan a stay, you won't be disappointed. Cheers",50
Such a big place....amazing need at least two days to explore the property completely.. Gondola ride was fun....for shopping best brands under one roof... food wise restaurants to suit every palate..Indians can feast at Golden Peacock restaurant.excellent buffet..Casino was huge ..,50
"Beautiful hotel, staff were great, rooms were stunning and extremely spacious. However, even though we requested and were placed on a non-smoking floor, the hallway and room had a very strong smoke odour which made our experience that bit unpleasant. Wish management could have done something about it, but apparently everything was fully booked. But overall, still a great experience.",40
We stayed at this hotel for one night on our way back to Hong Kong. We really liked the hotel as it was central to everything we wanted to do. The hotel was clean and and the rooms were quite similar to the rooms at the Venetian in Las Vegas!,40
"A fun place with all the amenities, Starbux, McDs, local restos,  craft bars and steakhouses, Boutique jewelry, DFS even. Very neat and clean. A great overnight getaway if you live in HK or China. Free buses take you point to point, border, M or T ferry terminal, airport, so very easy ingress and egress. Staff is very friendly and very Filipino. Rarely saw actual Macau people doing any 'work' there. Gambling tables are loaded with Chinese flipping HKD $500 notes all day long and not wanting to be disturbed. The indoor, man made canal upstairs is interesting, along with painted blue sky ceilings. Carpets are typical Vegas, swirling colors that irritate after a short time to keep you eye on buying, or gambling! Beware however of high prices: tip, there are some pricing anomalies…",50
Venetian hotel is even better after the renew.  Room is always clean and glamorous! My kids like staying here very much because they can play in Qube kids park very happily. The restaurants are also good taste. Good experience! Expect next trip!,50
"Recently visited Macau, and stayed two nights in this hotel, it's very big hotel 3000+ rooms, very good WIFI, breakfast has some option for Indians, but it's only one or two option rest you have to take fruits only, my was cotai royal deluxe suite, so it was very big room, room was nice and very good view. if you want to see entire hotel you have to spent one day at least,",50
"A good place to spend time with friends. We stayed there for 2 nights with 2 rooms, the rooms are pretty big, and they have queen size beds in the double-bed room, other hotels in Macau and Hong Kong usually give double or twin beds only. The front desk lady who helped us check in is very nice, she gave us the connecting rooms which made things a lot easier. Love the shipping area in this hotel! We four were all able to find things we like! Had two meals in the hotel, one at the dim sum place and another one at the food court, both meals were okay but not that impressive. Not to mention, the price at the dim sum place was a bit over our expectation although we knew hotel restaurants are usually more expensive. Overall it’s a nice and decent hotel ",40
"I booked to stay at the Venetian in Macau as I am a BIG fan of the Vegas version.  We stay there quite often so felt confident booking for Macau.  Everything looks eerily similar - I mean near exact lobby and rooms!  I kept sending pictures to my Vegas travelling buddy as you wouldn't know where I was as the decor was so similar.  That's where the similarities ended though.  The Venetian Macau, whilst beautiful and expansive, missed the ""buzz"" you get in Vegas.  The hotel is near stoic as was the casino but this is what you expect when gambling in China - it is serious business and most are focused on playing the odds and not having fun!  There wasn't the same availability of post-evening drinks places - the sole bar (Irish bar of course!) we found open at 11pm only had one…",40
"Very impressive large building. It is now around ten years old. For the age of the building and amount of people coming and going it is almost in perfect shape.  The service at check in was most helpful, making sure we as a family get the best room fitting our needs. Thank you.   The pool area is fantastic, unfortunately it closes at 8pm.   The breakfast at the main breakfast area is huge, however not so impressive that I would recommend to there in the first place.   There is also a kids area/playground for a fee.   The food court gives you plenty of dinner options and a gondola ride at one of the canals is fun to do.   The free shuttle to and from the ferry terminal are very well organized, with little waiting time.   For us the venetian is a classic place to stay in macau. ",50
Its real. Its original. See it to believe it. Words cannot express the efforts taken to establish this beautiful property. The rooms are superbly designed. The washrooms are state of art. The shopping mall below is like a fairy land. The staff is highly cooperative.,50
"Huge gambling resort. I was there as a non-gambler. Suites are huge (standard rooms are 70 sq. mr.) The place is ran a little like a factory, but a very efficient one. If you have mobility issues - choose carefully the room at check-in as distances are quite long. I think that the Southern Tower is better located for the pool and the breakfast restaurant. The shopping is great. The food could have been better.",40
"Too grand and lavish, everything was awesome from food to shopping to bedroom decor. Do visit connected Parisian and Eiffel tower as well. I loved the condola rides and also the monkey king show. The casino is world's largest casino.",50
"It is a small city, not just a hotel !! Hotel map is provided, still difficult to find the way.  Reception was crowded, took a bit of time ( should have used the online check in facility) There is no sitting area in the reception, possibly most of the people in the area are not hotel guests. Rooms are massive, with two tvs. Very well maintained.  Swimming pool has a water slide for kids. Food court has many options. Used the express check out facility (just drop the key card in designated areas - if payment is made in advance and nothing taken from the mini bar) Free shuttle service available.",50
"Asian hotels by far outshine US hotels, and The Venetian is no exception. The only problem I had was that I was assigned a non-smoking room, but it was clearly not. Room 9019 had an ashtray in it and a distinct smoky, stale smell so it was definitely not a non-smoking room.",40
"If you prefer a big room, The Venetian is the way to go.  Our King size bed suite is awesome.  Huge bathroom and a big sitting area.  Each area has it's own TV, perfect for the world cup games.  We each get our own TV to watch what we want!! The bed is comfy but I wish the pillows were firmer and fluffier.   Our view is of the Galaxy.   The check in took a little longer than usual but overall it was a pleasant experience. So far service has been quite nice.   We were also allowed late check out which is perfect since my husband will be watching the 2am world cup game.  The only thing that can get a bit annoying are the massive amount of China tourists.  It seems to be more overcrowded than other hotels.  It's expected but The Venetian is just more crowded. From the lobby to…",40
"Online check-in before you arrive at the hotel can save lots of time! Remember to check-in online!   The room is big enough. Two televisions in a room which allows to watch two different TV programmes in one hotel room, reduce the argument of watching what TV show with your partner.   Enjoyable! Very GOOD!! ",50
"Stayed here for Bruno Mars concert! The room was big, the bed and pillows were clean and fluppy. It was just relaxing inside. Room service was fast too. Breakfast was included in the room rate. Food was okay, nothing special.",50
"Venetian is a great Resort property in Macau.Must stay once to experience it.Although there were many reviews on tripadvisor of long check In or Check out queues n waiting time, fortunately we were provided immediate assistance and there was no waiting at all on Thursday noon around 12 when we checked in.To our surprise all our email requests of early check in,south wing,upgrade etc. were adhered too and we were overwhelmed by their hospitality in this regards.Luggage was also sent to our rooms within few minutes.We had the option to choose breakfast at Cafe Deco or Buffet Lunch at Golden Peacock in our package.Being late risers with kids we chose to eat Buffet Lunch at Golden Peacock which was amazing as there were lots of varieties to choose and it was totally paisa vasool…",50
"The room is sapcious. Bathroom very good size., 2 washbasins.  If you have small kids, there is plenty of space for them to run around but watch the steps to the sitting area.  Extra roll away beds can be added to the sitting area.   The door of the toilet - it opens out and would hit the person using the basin nearest the toilet.  Walking through the casino to the North Wing. We did not like the breakfast (Café Deco) that was included in the room rate.  Would have preferred breakfast on our own expense.",40
"The Venetian Macau matches in its opulence with its counterpart in Vegas. We had a two day stay with my 2 daughters and stayed in their family suite ! The suite was luxurious with two queen sized beds and a lower level sitting area complete with two television sets!  The height was luxury was to see the toilet paper wrapped in a beautiful bag with “Venetian “ embroidered on it . With hotels like The Parisian , Galaxy and the newly built Morpheus in its neighbourhood, Venetian is a delight ! Their Indian cuisine restaurant “ Golden Peacock “ offers fantastic food but please remember the last order is before 10 pm.. You can avail a10% discount if you have their casino membership card!  The shopping arcade around the canal with the gondolas has all enough boutiques to keep you…",50
"One of the biggest properties I have stayed in and very well managed. Check in process could be streamed lined for a better experience, probably addtional deployement of warm staff members and counters will help the process. ",50
"Very good experience with my family, 70sqm split-level suite. It is spacious and comfortable with the large living area. It is Euro-style designed and elegantly furnished, which will make my family fell like being in the room of a Italian aristocrat. Meanwhile, hotel offer the free wifi inside the suite",40
"I visited Macau in the month of September with my friends and absolutely enjoyed the stay. We booked on their website where they have good deals running throughout the year (Around 15K in September for a suite). The hotel is brimming with great restaurants (with both veg and non-veg options) and there are a lot of things to do. The check-in and check-out processes were seamless. Staff was helpful and courteous. Overall, superb experience - one of a kind. Can not miss it if in Macau!",50
"Wonderful place, highly recommend staying here. The staffs are very friendly and professional. The accommodation is very enjoyable. It is a great place to relax and plenty of facilities near by to do.",40
"I have visited this hotel around 5 times for work.  The rooms are huge, all equipped with bath tubs and a separate lounge. The service is great and the shopping really is fantastic Only comment is, it is hard to leave the building, make sure you get out for some fresh air!",40
Stayed for three nights and it was not enough time to explore the hotel. Check-in takes some time but after that everything is great. Rooms are of good size and are very clean. Staff extremely polite. Breakfast or Lunch was included in the room price where you could choose either one and both were fantastic. Was so overwhelmed by the shopping and casino that totally forgot to visit the swimming pool. The view from the room was fantastic.,50
"I stayed with my family. The big hotel with very wonderfully decorated, the children were also excited in the space where we can not usually taste. The room was very clean, but the view from the window was a construction site, so it was a little disappointing. The children were happy with the pool and QUBE. The shuttle bus is very convenient.",40
"Hospitality is a difficult business, even more so for large luxury hotels with customers expecting only the best, and I think to truly assess the quality of the service you need not to look at the mishaps but the way the team is able to recover from them. When we arrived in our Suite (standard size), the room was not serviced. It was not cleaned and to our horror it smelled of cigarette. I called reception as soon as I stepped in the room and they immediately transferred us to the huge 170sqm RIALTO suite which was a considerate gesture given the experience we had. Next day, when we ordered breakfast in the room it took 90min to get to us... with 2 kids not holding in place it was a hard toll on us. The team apologized and gave us the breakfast for free.  I mean, I hate…",50
It was a awesome place to be . The rooms were luxurious nd huge . Amenities were of very good standard. The hotel was beautiful and well maintained. It was great to stay here . The casino was also very good .,50
"This is the great hotel in Macau, Mall, Shoppes, Casino.  This room is wide, 70 m2.  They have many rooms and it is easy to find the resort by free shuttle bus from ferry  terminal or airport.  Check in and out the hotel are very fast and the staffs are friendly. You can go the gondola port, too.  The room is cleanness, exclusive suites and unique.",50
"The property is simply wonderful.  A bit pricey but the overall experience is definitely worth it. From luxurious suites and full blown shopping malls up, everything is juts about perfect.  Strongly recommended!",50
"This is my first time to stay at The Venetian Hotel. I was very impressed with the luxury of this hotel, the service was excellent and the staffs are very friendly. i would stay at this hotel again if visiting macao. ",50
Great Hotel to stay and a memorable visit. Rooms are spacious and luxurious. Very responsive team right from reception onwards. Excellent amenities. Delighted to see Indian counter for breakfast. Will love to visit again.,50
"This luxury resort property is massive & takes a lot of walking inside.I travelled with friends families in a group of 10. Check-in takes time as you really have to understand about locations inside property.  They give you free small water bottles from reception so carry them along if needed otherwise, the tap water inside your rooms are good to make tea/coffee.   Smoking room floors are really smelly with smoke so avoid if travelling with family. We were given upgraded suites that were really big in size with 2 big TV's & sit out area on 24th floor.It has Indian restaurants, lots of shopping stores, a canal for Venice like feel with a lady singing as she rows your boat. There are shows that happen inside hotel theatre.  The Casino wasn't really buzzing & had a bit of…",40
"As always it was bustling with tourists. My problem was very few check in counters, we had to be in line for almost 25 minuets to check in the hotel. The rooms have been done very well I would say it’s a good change from classical to contemporary. Unlike our last visit We had taken the breakfast package but I would say it’s best to pass. Having breakfast at the food court is the best bet. As the quality n spread of the buffet breakfast was not at all impressive. The casino n shopping areas need urgent renovation. I saw peel off paint at many parts. We had our son aged 5 travelling with us this time so visited the pool and the indoor play area called qube, we were very impressed with that. To end I would say that it’s best to avoid holiday season or be prepared for the rush",40
"If one wants to experience grandeur of highest order then this is it. Macau hotels are popular for casinos and this one has a massive stretch of tables as far as one can see on level 1 of the hotel. The hotel suites are classy with large space, excellent furniture, upholstery, fittings and ambiance. One gets a Kingly experience staying here. Level three has most shopping outlets and restaurants. A river through the mall at level 3 with gondola gives one a feeling of Venice. Food at the food court is surprisingly at reasonable cost though the hotel is at least 5 star.  On the whole a out of world experience. The swimming pools were shut for some reason, was a disappointment,",50
"The rooms are spacious and comfortable, with full facilities and good service. thanks for Venetian arranged the birthday cake to me, my family and I spend a happy birthday together at that weekend. Thank you.",40
Plush Room. Fancy Hotel. Easy access to the mall and casino. Really loved the place.  Only frustration was the Wifi. It keeps dropping out constantly which is really frustrating. They had a premium wifi connection priced at $120 per day or something like that. Not sure if that would be better. But in this day and age who pays for wifi? I mean we pay through our nose to stay at these hotels and to charge me more for something so basic is day light robbery. Don't appreciate that one bit! Rest no complaints.,40
"We booked a family suite with 2 queen and a sofa bed on 26th storey for 4 adults and a child. Room was big and comfortable with a huge bathroom. It was really comfortable and clean. The housekeeping did an excellent job even took initiatives to fold our laundry! The service of the hotel staff was prompt and good. They also allowed us to check out late at 1pm which was really nice. The hotel has a foodcourt and some restaurants. It is also of walking distance to Taipa village. However, this hotel is huge so expect crowds and tour groups and less personalised services. The directory at the mall is not very friendly and it took quite a while to find our way out of the mall because we have a kid and cant go through the casino. Overall, our stay is quite enjoyable and this is a…",40
Luxury Shopping & variety of food at food court just outside your lift room. Can walk in front of hotel and surounding the city hotel light. 4 swimming pool outdoor at third floor and really luxury suite room with 2 wide TV. ,50
"We like to gamble, so the Venetian delivers that in spades at all levels!  Food at the Steakhouse was excellent and my Chinese Wife advised me that the different varieties of Chinese food available was good too - I could also eat there. The rooms are spacious and the sleeping, seating and bathroom areas are all a good size.  This was our second visit within 7 months - the location is excellent for accessibility all round Cotai and the shopping experiences available appear limitless (my Wife tells me). Even if you don’t gamble, it is worth a 2 to 4 day visit on a travelling tour. All the Best.",50
I came here with my husband and my daughter...the mall very big..connected with Parisian. Must visit and feel the atmosphere.... You can take bus from senado square... Find bus no 26 or MT4 There are good things...food court and of course casino,50
"This is the main attraction of Macau. People who visit boom their stay here and if not that then they at least come and visit this hotel and it’s casino!!  There is no point in discussing service, ambiance and all as this place excels in every damn thing. Rooms were beautiful, comfortable and luxurious.   This hotel is internally connected to 3-4 other hotels also. There are around 600-700 shops in this hotel. 6000-7000 rooms. Huge place, where ever you go you’ll just love it.   Not to forget the casinos and it’s experience. ",50
"This hotel is one of the tourist attractions in Macau, so why not stay in it right? Gondola ride is complementary if you booked a night at this hotel. So beautiful, as you look up you can see all the awesome artworks. Highly recommend.",50
Very good hotel with all the amenities. Staff is courteous and ready to help. The only problem we faced was Check in time. On our our booking it was 2:00 Pm but we got room only at 3:00 Pm. Checkout was very smooth.,50
"Excellent Selection if you have chosen Venetian at Macau for your stay. We booked for a day only but after arriving, we regret that it should have been at least 3 Nights stay to enjoy the property. Room Ambience and Hotel Services are Value for money, Gondola ride has to be in must to do if you are planning your stay here.",50
"the hotel is really huge and giant which provides lots of facilities, activities, events & shows. The shopping arcade which also provides lots of famous brands. The gambling areas is the largest in macau which are full of gamblers, visitors & travellers everywhere",50
"It is absolutely majestic. Hugh.  The rooms are so big that they were bigger than the apparent that i was staying in HK. The resort is hugh and one is certain to get lost if u dont use the map. It has many restaurants, casinos and designer shops. We went at the time of chinese new year and there was sale going on. We did loads of shopping, infact we were not able to find same deals in HK.   The front desk staff was very courteous and offered late check out to us at 2 pm as i checkin late in the evening. He provided us Galaxy hotel facing room with beautiful views at night.  We had a nice stay and i recommend all to stay here.",50
"The hotel is Luxurious. Every detail of this place is just superb. The feel is superb and the gondola boat ride in between the hotel is also good. You feel like you are in Venice. This place is crowded but that is what it is .. Big and Luxurious. Room is excellent and intricate. There are various shows,shopping arcade and things which will keep you busy. Time flies here and no need to go out. Just enjoy this place ! They have shuttle buses if one intends to go out. Highly Recommended place !",50
"We visited Macau and stayed at the Venetian for 2 Nights.  A beautiful property with very spacious rooms, great amenities.  Largest casino.  Over 550 shops for shopaholics.  It is so huge that we felt we need atleast a week to enjoy the property.  Courteous staff, great food options.",50
"There is nothing best to describe our stay in The Venetian Macao, but MAGNIFICIENT. We got the Premio Bella Suite and the room was just absolutely the best, like staying in a mini palace. My family would definitely love to go back.",50
"Our stay at Venetian Macau in May'18 was both memorable and amazing. It's a beautiful hotel with lavish rooms and amazing shopping and casino experience. The Familingua rooms we book had bunk bed and kids area in the room itself, along with toiletries specially designed for kids. Not only kids even we were all flattered by the rooms beauty and amenities. Staying there was an ultimate experience for all. Hotel had Golden Peacock as Indian restaurant which served yummy food and food court also had a Pizza counter which served veg options. Mall itself had so much options to do and cover for all ages that we had no need to step out even for an hour during our stay. All in all a must go and stay place, I would recommend this property to all my friends and family for their future…",50
"This hotel is a luxurious dreamland.. that must be experienced. Palatial rooms, shopping mall, Casino, Restaurants, food court...name it and you have it all in there. Royal Delux Suite is fantastic if you are with kids. They give you a mobile phone during the stay with free International calls. We swapped our complimentary breakfast with lunch at Golden Peacock restaurant. Casino does not allow kids below 21 yrs. The hotel has complimentary shuttle too. And yes, there is a Mc Donald’s cafe in the North wing. Highly recommended.",50
"Entering the hotel you feel you have entered a mall, coz its so crowded with people. It takes sometime to get your check-in done. Rooms are spacious, in-room dining is excellent. Breakfast at their restaurants are chaotic and feels like eating at a diner. Because of the Casino being in the center be ready to walk around a bit. Hotel provides free rides to all major casinos, ferry terminals.",40
A very very beautiful hotel with very nice and very big rooms .....rooms were very royal .the staff was extremely courteous and house keeping was excellent. Loved their everything ....so many activities inside only ... courteous and helpful staff ....only long queurs at check in and lack of Indian food was concern  Overall a very very pleasant stay,50
The Venetian is another level of hospitality. It takes the hotel experience another level. It is huge and gigantic. Despite it's size it manages to give individual attention. The check in was smooth and the rooms were heavenly. Very comfortable. My son loved it. Morning breakfast was delicious and the spread was awesome. If you like a quiet place then you will hate this hotel. This hotel is a bus station..6 star hotel..huge mall..and the world's biggest Casino rolled into one. We loved it and would definitely will be back. I specially liked the express check out. It saved so much time.,50
Ohh my God this hotel it’s difficult to explain you don’t have to go out for anything as the entire city has been placed in the city.  Great hospitality excellent food 🥘   Highly recommend this property for vacation relaxation and to experience the royalty. ,50
"Staying at the Venetian is an experience of luxury and flamboyance.The choice of cuisines,choice of designer brands,architectural brilliance re- created plus not to mention the classy entertainment like the Parisian cabaret. Yes! Cannot forget the casinos for all who love rubbing shoulders with lady luck.",50
It was enough to want to visit again.The room reception was good and the Harrough was not enough time.My friend recommended me to stay The Venetian Hotel when I go to Macau. I think it would be more satisfactory if I had less time to check in.,50
Room was very spacious and impressive.  Kids loved it especially the bunk bed!  And price was reasonable too.  Very convenient with good foodcourt just down the suites and the hotel is walking distance to attractions.  Almost all stores you can think of are in the complex too!,50
"We booked 3 Bella Suite and the rooms were huge! 2 queen beds plus an extra pull out sofa bed. However you have to request the beddings for the sofa bed. It is quite hard to communicate with some of their front desk and housekeeping using English. Hotel is really big. Great customer service!  Pros: - size of the rooms and bathrooms - very clean - fast check in, we were ushered to the VIP Lounge and Emma was very accommodating and friendly.  - George helped and assisted us with our luggages to go to the bus to the ferry. - will provide with what you request (pillows, blanket, shampoo, etc) - got free plushies for the kids  Cons: - hard to communicate using English, improve English of front desk answering the phones and housekeeping. - no beddings for the sofa bed  - no bath foam…",40
"Check-in is fast and orderly despite so many people around. The hotel complex is enormous,we depended heavily on the map provided 2 us at the frontdesk just to find our assigned room and other amenities like the main lobby, foodcourt, pools, etc., every corner of the hotel is beautiful. When we entered our Bella Suite room, we were overwhelmed by the size, ambiance, and interior design...a real 5-star! Everything inside the room has a touch of luxury - the beds, sala, 2 LCDs, and my gosh...the CR is so grand, me & my daughter stayed there 4 a while enjoying the golden ambiance. We enjoyed a lot in this hotel, a perfect experience for first timer like us.",50
Great place to stay.. Super luxury.. Venetian to the core.. Very happening place.. great for the family too.. has something for people in all age groups..great ambiance.. lovely place.. rooms are great... food is very good..besides the casino..,50
It’s really 5 star class.. hotel is huge huge..  rooms are very big enough.. bath rooms are also very big and with all required things..   Many restaurants/ food court / huge shopping area.. there is no word to describe it.::   Casino is also very big...   Ferry terminal to hotel you will get bus very frequently   Macau is city for enjoyment... just come once and stay in Venetian...   Only problem is check inn formalities.. we stayed in queue for atleast 1 hour before we reached to check inn counter.. but staff is good.. English speaking.. very helpful and polite...   Any way overall experience is very good.. ,50
Food was amazing and service was fantastic from Amy Zhong. We will definitely come back   The sushi was really tasty and it as a great range of food available   The restaurant was really clean and the service was efficient,50
"The Venetian stay & Kotai strip experience is a must every one should experience. It's not only staying the Hotel, the Shopping, Entertainment & Macao tour a perfect adventure. Excellent location with good transport arrangements, very good & perfect room with good room service. Clean & Tastey food outlets.",50
"Absolutely no need to ever leave the building. The Venetian is a holiday on its own, from the opulent foyer to elegantly decorated rooms, with everything you could possibly need. Comfortable beds and fluffy towels etc made our stay feel like home.  The housekeeping staff were like fairies, came in when we were out and performed their magic.  Everything was on point , no need to ever have to ask for anything.   Well done Housekeeping team and the Venetian ",50
It’s the best property that one should stay in. A big big hotel with a choice of fine dine restaurants and a large food court area. Lot of international food but as good as nil options for a vegetarians. ,50
The hotel provides a good pick up bus from the immigration. The check in at the hotel had a long queue. The hotel looks palatial. One of the best luxury looks I have stayed in. It's mega big in size and is a 7 star hotel. The best part is the rooms. Huge size with great layout. The bathroom was super spacious n great. I just loved the rooms. The swimming pools are superb with many pools. The casino is huge. Superb maintanence. The check out was superb. Jus drop Ur key in a box n leave!!   Now the improvement areas:  One thing I hated is.. it has everything chargeable . Where on earth does a hotel charge for its facilities to its guests!!! The kids play area cube.. the boats.. are chargeable. This is not fair.the guests should be allowed to enjoy all facilities free of cost! ,40
"One of the bestseller Hotel in Macau and after going to this place I realized why is it so.  Me and My husband chose Venetian for our anniversary and the staff did make it special for us. We got express check in & check out option. This is usually sent in by the hotel in case if you are applicable for the express option. You need to fill the form and send it back to them. They will assist with the express check in Pass.  This was a blessing because we dint need to wait in the line for check in and saved almost 20-25 mins.  Also, since it was our anniversary the staff was really sweet and upgraded our room with bed decor for the special day. Me and my husband both really appreciated the gesture. Transportation - There are free shuttle buses to the hotel from the airport and both…",50
"Impressive hotel maintenance. Nothing has deteriorated since my last visit years ago. It continue to excite tourists in terms of the view ala Venice, the shopping boutiques, restaurants, and its food court.",40
Loved the stay here.  The hotel has a lot to explore even if you are not staying with them. However the size and quality of rooms and proximity to all the other things to do make the stay worth the price.  The pools are nice and should not be missed. ,50
It's truly a palace to stay in.. courteous staff and prompt service... The gondola ride inside the hotel is worth experience and the shopping mall is such a nice place to spend time.. the hotel is quite big and rooms are very spacious..truly worth a visit,50
The room size is big and we feel comfortable during this stay. We sleep very well. The swimming pool is cool. The staff who work in hotel pool initiative gave us cold water. The service is good. We enjoy the trip very much. We have good time here.,50
Had fun! Staff was helpful and friendly  McSorleys bar is awesome...  Not enough Hold em Tables open considering the amount of people waiting to play...  Breakfast at Cafe Deco was good...  WISH they would get the Grateful Dead to play there instead of Air Supply ,40
The Venetian is a massive property in Macau.  Great location near everything with wonderful shopping and dining to choose from.  The rooms are comfortable and quite!  We enjoyed the fact that their was no smoking in the casino and no BAR!  I love the fact that they separated the liquor from the gambling...  looking forward to visiting again...  Nice Resort Property!,40
"I knew The Venetian at Las Vegas for the first time but I didn't live there.And I missed gondola at that time.So ..this time I made my dream came true.haha The Venetian Macao is beautiful , too.However,the hand shower need to change.",40
"All of the staff is very nice, they provide excellent service with smile face. Even we have some difficult questions, all the staff try their best to help customer, or provide suggestions and alternative.",50
"If u never go to europe, so take chance to ride gondola, buy the ticket via online. Only 15-20 minutes. This place not recommended to lunch or dine in coz too expensive,  but u must buy the bakery coz almond cookies is delicious, egg tart is good, pork slices is recommended as souvenir too",40
This place is outstanding... was here for 2 nights and enjoyed every second of my stay... though i lost 20k in casino but it was worth it :) The rooms were luxurious and so as the food. walking around in Venetian was superb...  Hospitality-10/10 Food-10/10 ,50
"The hotel is superb.....I can say a city in itself.....No need to leave the hotel and go anywhere.  The rooms are excellent, the lifts are fast and spacious. They have 4 swimming pools for every kind of water temperature that you want.  Just that you have to walk too much in the hotel. The check in process also takes time as they explain each and every detail to you. Check out process is express.  I can say the best hotel and shopping and eating everything together. if you are visiting Macau then don't go anywhere else....just blindly book Venetian",50
We checked in at 29th May and to our surprise the lady upgraded us to the BELLA SUITE which was on the 33rd floor. It took as quite some time to reach to our room since the hotel is more like a luxury town. Excellent,50
"We spent three nights at the Venetian and although we had a bit of a rough start, our experience far exceeded our expectations.  I have stayed at the Las Vegas Venetian, and this Venetian dwarfs the LV one.  The shopping, canal and casino are Huge.  The rooms are the familiar two level suite with truly luxurious bath- a welcome respite from our Chinese bath.  Our initial experience was a bit rough.  We walked across the border to be confronted with a huge line in the scorching sun waiting for the Venetian bus.  We stood for more than an hour in the heat with no water or respite.  If you can, pre arrange for transit if you are arriving on the weekend.  When we arrived, we left our luggage with the bellman to be delivered once our room was ready.  We registered and then went for…",50
We went to this theatre last night. We booked tickets on-line £18.80 they were really good value for the money. What a performance so pleasantly surprised at the quality of the performers. A variety from dancers to a motor cycle performance in a cage absolutely brilliant. If you have time it’s worth it. When I picked up the tickets at the box office within the hotel I was given vouchers off food and to visit the Eiffel Tower. We went for the latter and what an experience at the base of the tower they had entertainment. You could also purchase food and drink and it goes on till midnight what a great night for so little money. It’s a must if your in the area ,40
Well facilitated and clean with spacious room. Very nice experience. Stayed for the second time. Book online to enjoy better discount and express check in/out.  Self-contained facilities and variety of eateries. Complimentary shuttle provided too. ,40
"Stayed four nights in a Non-Smoking Premio Bella Room.  Spacious, beautiful and clean room, but the lift lobby and corridors on our floor reeked strongly of cigarette smoke on all five days when we were there.  We've even encountered a guest smoking a cigarette in the lift lobby despite the non-smoking signs.  Otherwise, a most enjoyable stay.",40
"Hesitate if we should try out other latest hotel in this area but we are grateful and happy to decided to stay in Venetian. The room is spacious, comfort and we think it is great for a family vacation. We got a room with fantastic view too! TQ for the wonderful place!",40
"we enjoyed a lot over here😍,especially we enjoyed our food😋,and we had got so many facilities😍 and also we enjoyed the swimming pool over here but we request u to extend the swimming pool timings over here😫,thank you😻",40
The place is a real wonder. The accommodation might be a bit pricey but the experience will tell you it's worth. From the luxurious suites and shopping malls up until the ceilings and the gondola ride. 100% recommended!,50
"One of the best properties that i have visited so far. BIG, SPACIOUS,LUXURIOUS. Perfect to get a feel of luxury. Excellent suites.  All hotels (atleast 10 of them) and all are luxury hotels and interconnected. Big shopping malls, food courts etc.  Once to be visited atleast",50
One of the best properties i had holiday on. Perfect tucked up room and bathrooms. Luxurious suites and shopping mall. Must visit and enjoy the pools.   Staff: They know hospitality  Food: Every pallet available  Entertainment: never ending Casino: Oh yeah bouy !!   Thanks for a great stay Best luck to the team !! ,50
"Good to choose here location is excellent big room still many Chinese are smoking any place such as bath room, elevator.. restaurant for breakfast is big but customers are more so seats were not enough ",40
"I would highly appreciate the quality, cleanliness, air quality and room service of the Premium Suite, environment and cleanliness of Swimming Pool amenities and vast number of choice of dining options. Compared to tradition Macau hotels, the entire hotel resort is large in size and scale and offers good time for dining, shopping and relaxing. A nice place to spend you time in holidays!",50
"The Venetian is amazing place , a masterpiece made by man . The Hotel has best Suits , huge casino and even bigger malls all in one place . It is huge place with all top brands in the world . It has small places which represents Venice with the canals and gondolas . we reached Macau from ferry terminals by shuttle bus",40
"The nice luxury will be found in  this  hotel since complete facilities such as mall, cassino, ballroom  and restaurant. Ambiance in the theme park will remind you to Venetia,  by  small river,gondola and architecture of the  building. It will fascinate people who visit.",50
"I have the trip to the venetian Macau and we booked for the 2 room.One for the king bed and the other room is twin bed. The condition is almost good,but there was a smell from the cigarette from the previous customer.Anyway, it is the good place to come back.",40
"What can I say about this resort. Its an awesome place to be in. Just no words to describe the grandeur of this resort. A small city within itself. Hugh place. Yet very well managed.  Swift check in. Perfect room service.  The rooms are splendid and hugh. Even the bathrooms have artisan mirrors and chandeliers. Breakfast at  Cafe Deco was a hugh spread and that too fresh and delicious. Excellent swimming pools. A classic hot Jacuzzi.   The canals of Venice, replicated so well.  The Casinos are just The attraction   You have to here to experience it. Stay at least for two nights to soak into the resort.",50
"I think it was a big and clean  hotel with lots of things to see and convenirnt shopping. In addition  there are convenient shuttle bus and theme hotels nearby. It was a hotel I really liked, but It was a little uncomfortable because there was no Korean language guide. ",50
The hotel is really nice.Amazing artitecture and sea view. Service at high level.I've took a shuttle bus from the Macau ferry. I was surprised that there was Michlin restaraun Golden Peacok on the territory of the hotel. It was full. I tried lunch at the Cafe Deco. That was a good choice.Thank you!,50
"Staying two days is too short It was our first visit Macau How successful it is!! The Venetian gave us special experiences.  Brilliant, various, exciting and gorgeous. When we found out our way to somewhere in The Venetian, we felt fun~!",50
"You will never worry about getting to Venetian in the first place. You will be met with their coaches at the ferry terminal or at the airport - and yes, it is a free ride going to the hotel. So don't even bother to look for a taxi. :)  Upon entering the hotel you will be greeted by its fine architecture. I am sure you will be amazed by how detailed the design is. You would have a luxury to roam around the hotel just like you are in Venice.   Their rooms were excellent. Maintained to the fullest and groomed perfectly for their next guests. Access to the Casinos is not a problem and you can stay out for the whole night if you are into taking risks of losing or making money. :)  There is a wide range of variety of restaurants inside the hotel. You name it, they have it. Exaggerated…",50
Best of the hotel. Huge room. I got upgraded while check-in to Delux Queen. Breakfast awesome. So many items to choose from. Being Indian vegetarian had multiple Indian veg items also in the breakfast. Fantastic views from the hotel room. The price you pay upfront is cheaper compared to the size of the room and the comfort you get. A must stay for once in a lifetime.,50
"Must visit . Wow experience. Great food choices. Perfect for shopping. Once in life time experience. Consider that u need to walk a lot to experience this .  They had everything under one roof  Perfect place for fun , shopping",50
"Not sure if any words are remained to explain this place. You just get marveled by this place on every floor and every internal streets (yes ! they have named streets inside the hotel).   We arrived via ferry from HK, and Venetian has bus pick up and drop from/to ferry station. Check-in was quite OK, as it took around 45 mins, due to long que as well, but quite simple. Don't remember which suite we stayed in, but whatever it was, it was just marvelous. If you going to Macau, you must have to stay at Venetian to experience it.   Regret I had just 1 night there, but in future if anyone sponsor, will surely stay at Venetian.   P.S. Casino is not good for novice like me, lost quite a few.",50
This is a amazing place in a amazing city . Had a really good time .. they have a mall and a casino also and the mall was huge a nice shopping destination . Had some amazing Hagen dazz and also did some shopping . Amazing place to spend the night . ,50
"This is most beautiful AMAZING & PERFECT hotel i have ever visited in my life. You will just find everything is absolutely PERFECT & GREAT. From casino to nightlife, from hotel rooms to shopping, everything about this hotel is so perfect.  Bedroom is spacious, matrass is so comfortable, extra pillow is also available And even the sofa is comfort to sleep. We stated in Bella deluxe suite and we really enjoyed the stay.  The best part is the hotel staffs were so friendly and always ready for help and guidance.  The food we ordered from room (room service) was also mouth watering.  One word line i must say, whoever stays in  Venetian can never forget this beautiful place. ",50
"What an amazing hotel this is. In all aspects - be it hospitality, systems processes, room quality, views from room and food (even though I am pure veg).  I hoped it to be as superb as Las Vegas property and it in few ways actually surpassed my expectation.  Staff is extremely courteous and guys don't miss the amazing gondola ride. Just a small tip - keep hotel map handy otherwise you may lose direction in such huge property.",50
"This hotel is known for its Gandola ride,casino and imported brands,Lived in this hotel for 2 days,I loved the stay,rooms were huge with nice and clean essentials,The restrooms had a bathtub as were as a normal shower,which was so amazing,It had many restaurants and bars,We used to have a full fledged buffet in the Indian restaurant,The hotel is so huge and not easy to locate your selves back to the entry and exit gate.Even locating the swimming pool here is a big task,but unfortunately we didn't get to swim,They have proper housekeeping services and even room service for food,I enjoyed a lot here,Even the room view was great,Most memorable stay.",50
"I was here with my wife & daughter for 2 nights. But my only mistake was that I should have made at least 3-4 nights stay here in Venetian. Venetian is not a hotel. It’s a city in its own way. There’s hotel, casino, different types of restaurants, various shopping brands, gondola ride, kids play area and much more. Even the lowest room category was like I was living life king size. Huge huge rooms that I’ve never seen. Thank you Venetian for making our stay so comfortable & luxurious.",50
"The air conditioner is too cold. It's still cold. There are no extra blankets in the room, so we must ask the reception desk for help.Cleaning the room is relatively late. In the morning, I go out to clean the room until 14 p.m.No cinema",40
"We had a nice, large, clean, and comfortable room.  Well appointed. Lobby loud.  Fast check in and out. Desk person very friendly and loved the chocolates. Just what we needed after a long day of traveling.",50
"Wonderfull hotel, great and spacious rooms, friendly and helpful staff, nice choice of hotels and shops. Very interesting is also the breakfast formule: you can choose for a breakfast at the traditional breakfast times or replace it by a lunch at extended hours. The imitation of Venice is so kitschy that it becomes funny and amusing.  A great experience BUT... at a certain time, the corridors get filled with ladies offering their services (I suppose there is no need to explain what kind of services...) which is quiet shocking and  makes the whole atmosphere cheap and crap. Such a pity!",50
"The rooms were spacious and fairly nice with large bathrooms. One problem was the walking. Our room as literally the last, & took us easily 25+ mins to get to our room - however its one of things that comes along with staying in a massive hotel like this. The restaurant options were on the fairly low quality side however service, staff and everyone else associated with the hotel were courteous and helpful.",40
Not far from the tourist spots where there are nice restaurants. Hotel is popular so quite crowded. Many restaurants and shops in the vicinity if weather is not good. Can try your luck at the casino and there is plenty of entertainment.,50
"Like any other big Vegas casino, quite efficient from the ferry shuttle to the hotel drop off, lunch, shopping and thematic decor. Had a quick sit down at a slot machine while waiting for family and won enough to pay for my lunch and dessert! Good shops, entertaining street shows, endearing robots.",40
"1、To the front desk of the hotel, the waitress is very sunny and considerate, considerate and considerate. It's good to brush your cards on the elevator. 2、The environment is good and the price is reasonable. It's a good place for a short holiday. It is a pity that this kind of swimming pool will be renewed when the breakfast type is enriched. 3、The hotel design is very good, the environment is too good, because it is a rush of time, only a day, no time to enjoy the hotel, I hurried back, I intend to take a good holiday here next time.",50
"This is similar in appearance to venetian in las vegas (of course) with indoor gondolas, many shops and some restaurants all guiding you to the casino. The cieling is painted and lit to emulate the daytime sky so as per big casinos you have trouble telling time of day. The rooms are huge and beautifully fitted. The only issue i have with hotel is registering both in and out. You can wait in a queue for 15-20 mins then spend another 10-15 for staff to go through their checkin process. Cecking out can also take a long time where they generate so much paper and take so long. Other hotels can checkout in less than a minute so it is very frustrating.",40
特别感谢melody guo贴心的安排这次旅程的每个细节和关心的问候，打从我们一开始安排来澳门的时候，melody guo一直都很细心的在为我们安排舒服又时尚的房间，也顾滤我们到达与check out 回机场的接送问题，还特别安排车的接送。让我们有个愉快的旅程。melody guo... thank you very much. 你是一位超尽责的职员，you did it so well👍 hope to see you soon,50
"We stayed in Venetian for a night on 27th of April in the 19th floor, Northern Suites. The hotel shuttle picked us up. We were two adults and two children and the hotel accommodated all of us in one king size bed and one sofa cum bed. All the staff were friendly and really courteous. The hotel room was huge and had all modern facilities. We did not dine at the hotel considering the huge variety of food available at the food court at level 3 in the NORTHERN SUITES REGION.  We were upgraded to a Cotai view room and were offered extended checkout till 2:00PM. Only process that needs to be improved is the check-in process, which we felt was very slow and the most important point being, the link to express check-in sent to my mail was throwing up an error message.  Otherwise, no…",50
This hotel makes for a luxurious and comfortable stay. The rooms are spacious and the bed is very comfortable. The shower head was the best I have ever experienced. The intensity of the water pressure made for a very relaxing and thorough shower. I had never felt so clean and relaxed after a shower before. Check in was a bit chaotic as with most very large hotels but the service was good with snacks and drinks offered to those lining up. A large number of hotel staff meant the check in went quicker than you would expect. The whole hotel complex is a sight to see. Only negative for me is that the hotel is not located in the old historical part of town so if sightseeing is a major part of your trip be prepared for extended taxi trips.,50
"Huge hotel. My kids love this hotel very much. They can run for a long distance within the hotel. Haha. Got variety of food, reasonable food court and luxury restaurant too. Beds are also quite big enough for 4 people ",50
"What an amazing place, stayed 2 nights, rooms were lovely and spacious. Here is a couple of pics in our room and in the hotel. It has a shopping mall within it, plenty of food outlets/restaurants, swimming pool you never have to leave.",50
The Bella suite is great for a family. The pool area is very nice. We enjoyed walking around the many shops and the staff are very friendly. The hotel is in a great location and convenient to everything.,50
"This is an amazing hotel. It is luxury all the way. We only stayed one night and can't wait to go back.  The rooms are huge and beautifully appointed, the bathrooms are luxurious and the facilities are fantastic.  I had a win which ended up paying for my entire trip .. love that! The shopping arcade was jam packed with people and found a couple of bargains there.  Can't wait for my next trip!",50
"No review can do justice to the grand hotel that Venetian Macao is. It's like a city in itself. Busy at all times of the day and night. The hotel has a free shuttle to and from the ferry terminal(both Cotai and Turbojet ferry terminals). As you enter, finding the lobby is a bit challenging but once you check in, you are sorted. They direct you to the rooms. Finding them is a challenge as well due to the size. But the rooms are WOW. Massive with the most comfortable beds and the best bathroom ever. The room is luxury at its peak. Our room had a view of the main street. Room service is quick and efficient. There's a lot to do at the hotel right from the casino to the endless shopping and food options. Do take the gondola ride and look up the fake but real looking sky. Also the…",50
"I believe most of people are who choose hotel chain, they have in their mind the standard that a hotel chain keeps.   Speaking of this, Regis never fail.   Been staying with many Regis around the world, it’s my first time in Regis Macau. From the time we step out of taxi, everything is smooth and perfect.   Our butler Mr. Frank is very kind and attentive, I would highlight it again later.   Room is spotless, of course, with decent size, nice bathroom and heaven beds. Housekeeping is amazing, always so attentive and great turndown service.   You must try Regis bar, the ambience is so wonderful both day and night, I mean we tried afternoon tea and night drink, simply a treat!  Here I’d like to thank the butler Frank once again, this morning we were abt to have a breakfast in a…",50
"Was there for Bruno Mars show.  Staff are nice to explain everything.  I am surprise that even if the hotel was open years ago, the room and its washroom including facilities are well maintained.  High rate for price vs quality.",50
"This place is HUGE. The casino, the rooms/suites, the shopping centres. It's all a little bit overwhelming. The hotel has buses at the ferry wharf to pick up guests - there is no charge and no need to plan ahead for this. The bus delivers you to the massive check in where you will probably end up a quite a queue to check in - there are 3000 rooms in the hotel and probably many are filled at a give time so this is not unexpected. The process is pretty good considering. Walk through the gob smackingly big casino to get to your rooms. All the public areas are really well done - over the top definitely but it all looks opulent and well done. (The canal and gondola bit is maybe a bit cheap ish though)  The suites are fabulous! Very large with a separate sitting room; king bed (firm…",40
"Everything in this hotel was grandiose and excellent! We stayed at Famiglia suite which was very family/kid-friendly, with separate areas for adults and kids (with double-deck, mini-tent, own TV set, play table with coloring books). Check in and out were fast, smooth and hassle-free! ",50
This was one of the best property I have ever stayed during my visits to different countries and cities. A very well maintained hotel and everything up to the highest standard. One of the best place to stay in Macao.,50
"We stayed at the Venetian Macau for three nighs late April for the Bruno Mars concert together with our son.  Being a regular visitor of Macau, I have stayed at the Venetian only twice and this is the second time.  No bad experience really but I just find the hotel too big, too massive and there are just so many guests going around.  Anyway for my reveiw about the Venetia, the rooms are still very well kept contrary to what others may perceive, the rooms staff and the facilities are still top notch and quite efficient, praises to the general manager.  Just some hitches that could easily be fixed - we were checked in by a  newbie/trainee and I almost had a shouting match with this guy since he kept on telling me that I should just keep quiet and lsiten to him first, I told what…",40
"One of the finest hotels that I have stayed in.  The suite was huge, impeccably done, and quiet.  They even provided a cell phone for local use.  Provided a free bus from the Ferry Terminal.  Would stay here again if I ever go to Macau again",50
"We stayed here for our anniversary, just one word: amazing. We were personally greeted by a director and checked in in the room which was a fast service. They had decorated the room with balloons and swans and roses, the biggest surprise for my wife.  The room was majestic and details were everywhere reflecting to Venice. Super spacious and brand new design, great amenities as well. The resort itself is the most amazing one I’ve ever seen. Check out has never been so simple and fast as this. As said, just amazing!",50
"I have a company conference in Mar2018 in Macau, therefore I spend 3 nights here for business trip. The room is standard twin bed room with a lower level living room with sofa, working desk and an additional table for small meeting as well. Fast internet access through out the hotel area including in room, hall way and shopping mall, meeting area as well.  One of the good thing is they will include an Android smartphone in the room, local call would be free of charge and you can use it in Macao as well. Very good experience for tourist.  Great to have shopping mall right inside the hotel so food, shopping would not be a problem.  The only draw back is the hotel area is way too big and there is a casino right in the middle of the hotel, sometimes the shortcut from west to east,…",40
"The Venetian is a great hotel however the sheer size and how busy the hotel impacts service. I had a grande suite which was a fantastic room however the view was terrible. The Hotel has everything as you would expect and is very similar to Venetian in Las Vegas, The loch Buffet was very good.",50
"The property is large, with lots going on from shopping to eating.  The rooms are suites, with bedroom first and a step down to the living area (all one room).  Great size when staying for business.  While their, I misplaced my IPhone X;  the staff really tried to locate it utilizing security.  Although it was t found, I appreciate the effort.  I would stay here again, next time I’m in Macau.  This is the second time I’ve stayed at this property.  ",50
" My wonderful experience @ VENETIAN MACAU can be given 10 stars of commendation. Manager, Mr JC Cruz, personally assisted my entire stay to the last limousine of goodbye. @65 remains the best Service ever. ",50
"Dear Mr. Bede Barry - Vice President, Hotel Operations, The Venetian Macao and Sands Cotai Central. All check-in process was good and even Kenneth (FO Staff) so helpful, but he forgot to give us Cotai View based on our Reservation. Our Room view to JW Marriot that next to building construction that annoying us. But we do not have time to argue about this as Front Desk counter also quite busy. I hope in the future, read carefully guest reservation first and give based on guest order.  Thank you and regard, Riko ",40
"10.5 million square feet; in the top-10 largest buildings in the world in terms of square feet. Over 3000 rooms. A casino, mall, multiple swimming pools, multiple restaurants, a food court.    Should I go on?  This is an amazing property and a must-stay if visiting Macau.   The property is so huge, that we were giving a map during check-in to figure out how to get to our room. Wow!!  The 3rd floor has the Mall, and the well known Gondola rides. Yes! Its within the hotel on the 3rd floor.   It also has an indoor 18-hole Golf course.",50
"Real big apartment with spacious living room, bedroom and washroom. Full equipped minibar and facilities. Love the bath gel with white tea and rose aroma. The whole entertainment complex with swimming pools, casino, shopping mall is good for families.",50
"good hotel with big size rooms.very beautifully done. have lots of activities. clean n well maintained although common area toilets quite dirty, no attendants to chek n clean. have choices for vegetarians also in breakfast although everything same next day also. have indian restaurants also which serves good lunch buffet also.",40
This is a very beautiful hotel with spacious room. We fitted in a family of 4 in here. There’s a free shuttle to and from the hotel to the ferry terminals. The swimming pools are beautiful so make time if you can to use it.,50
"Very large and comfort room, clean and full bath room amenities provided.Quiet and secure hotel, with no interruption such as ring bell for laundry or other unpleasant services.  Very comfortable bed, and temperature was set to the most ultimate comfort.",50
"I come to this restaurant everytime I can. The food is excelent, the setting, is divine, the service is perfect!! The Milanesi Cuttlet is divine. Very nice italian restaurant. Do yourself a faver... just go! ",50
"This hotel is truly awe-inspiring! The experience starts with the Grand Entrance, to the hotel lobby check-in, to your room, and continues till you check out.  In fact with a hotel this size the immediate concern that hits you is if they will be able to meet individual level expectations. However, those concerns are immediately dashed. Check in is a breezy affair, even with 100s of guests checking in at the same time. The luggage was collected at the entrance and sent to our rooms even before we reached them.   To our surprise, even though we arrived a good 3 hours before the official check in time, we were allocated one room instantly. The other was supposed to be ready in 30 mins. However by the time we figured our way to the room (and it takes some figuring out) the room was…",50
We where group of friends stayed this hotel excellent service &  good food  Rooms are big that usual rooms   They have good verity of on site Resturant’s specially golden peacock’s lunch buffet was very good  ,50
"I have a pleasant stay in venetian. Huge casino, decent food, and great atmosphere. I’ve been to macau for about 5 times, but this is my first time spending a night here and Venetian didn’t disappoint.",40
The room is quite big with 2 queen sized beds.  Both the toilet and bedroom are tidy and clean.  There are 2 TVs available in the bedroom and living room.  I would say I felt very satisfied with the hotel and would recommend it to my family and friends.,40
We stayed in a standard Cotai view suite on level 27. As soon as we entered the room we noticed it smelled of smoke. We asked to change and were given an explanation about the 27th floor being strictly non-smoking so there was no way it should have smelled of smoke (it did).   Walking through the hallways you could smell smoke too. I saw a room with its front door propped open by a chair. Guess what... the guest in there was smoking! Even though there are signs in the rooms saying there are fines for smoking it doesn’t seem to deter the guests.  Front desk soon found us another room that was sadly on a lower floor (20) on the other side so we had construction site views - disappointing. At least they offered to give us a box of chocolates for the inconvenience! Good…,40
"My family enjoyed the service we experienced in this hotel. The rooms are luxurious, spacious and clean. The staff are also courteous and very accommodating. Our trip to Macau was really memorable thanks to our stay at Venetian.   ",50
"Actually, we've been planning this trip for quite sometimes. And we had already our expectation built. We took Suite Royale Deluxe for 2-nights and started from Hong Kong with jet ferry. Once arrived in Macau, we expected that shuttle bus will be ready at stone throw, since we saw many shuttle bus were waiting to pick up hotels guests from ferry. However, it was very difficult to find one from The Venetian, and we walked back and forth asking all the driver to find it. We needed to walk across the street, through some construction alley and another street crossing again until we found one with The Venetian logo onto it. Well, that was almost one hour walking with despair. We asked ourselves why the shuttle bus stop for The Venetian so far away from the harbor?  Again, once we…",50
Great place to stay. Lot of activities for al age group- stayed with a 4 yr old. Pool n jaccuzi are really good. Elaborate buffet breakfast/lunch options. You can chose either with your booking. Casino is 24 hrs and well managed.,50
"While we were staying in Hong Kong, we decided to stay for a night in Macao and chose the Venetian. It is absolutely perfect and has no difference than the one in Las Vegas. The stores are fabulous and the service is amazing ",50
"My family and I stayed at The Venetian.  We had a great time.  Room: look for something in the south wing as it allows you to have a great view of the “Macau strip” with the Parisian, Wynn Palace and other resorts in your vicinity. We were in the Bella suite which suited us 3 just fine.  Hotel: lots to offer; highly recommend the venue as it’s very central, large and has great deals along with dining options to offer. The pools are amazing whilst offering a lot of “scampering” area for the kids.  Dining options: strongly suggest Portifino and Morton’s (both are great options for date night) tho overall ambience at Portifino is better (especially if you sit outdoors).  Staff: excellent service. We were traveling with a small baby and all our requirements from a baby chair to…",50
"Every hotel-casino in Macau has their unique attraction, but this one is the best. Hotel, large casino, shoppes, everything that you want you will find here. Some branded flagship store has their shop here, such as Victoria Secret, Fossil, Guess, Kate Spade, Banana Republic, Coach, even Burberry, LV, Bottega Veneta & many more. The coolest thing is scenic view of Venetian River, 3D blue sky, & its gondola hanging around the river with beautiful voice rower. If you feels hungry, lay down at Lord Stows cafe for its delicious eggtarts or strolling around foodcourt to finds what you want. This resort can be reached by free shuttle bus from Macau Outer Harbour or Taipa Harbour.",50
"We stayed in Venetian Macao for 1 night during Easter holiday with my family and experienced the best services during our stay.  We booked the BELLA SUITE room and it is quite spacy enough for 4 people.  We experienced express check in from 11:00am.  We stayed in South Wing suite where a bitter quite than West Wing suite (most of the Chinese tours stayed in West Wing suite).  The hotel offered a free photo taking service at the Main Lobby and we can get the hard copy (with paid) for only few minutes (you may also download a soft copy for free).  At the time of checking out, I dropped down the keys into the Express Check out box where locates at West Lobby and it is quite easy and convenience.  The only compliant is the free wifi which I cannot connect at any time.  Fortunately,…",50
Hotel staff are very helpful and very efficient.  Room is cozy and spacious.  The pool is excellent.  My family enjoyed it very much.  The pool and its facilities are clean.  I requested to use the pool on our check-out day and the hotel staff promptly made the arrangement for my family. I will definitely choose this hotel again in my next trip to Macau!,50
The hotel is very huge. The room is spacious and modern even if the hotel is quite old. The bed is comfortable and the clean. I love the room interior and design. The service is fast and smooth. You can shop and dine in the hotel even without leaving. The casino is quite old including the slot machines.,50
"Room is huge, with a huge bathroom, where I have an issue with low hanging shower. Hotel/casino building is so big, that once I walked 40 mins to find right exit. You can find everything that you need in the building: food court, many many restaurants, huge shopping mall, giant casino.",50
This is a fancy place with beautiful indoors. The rooms are amazing as well as the views form the rooms. Long queues during check in. You should try the gondola ride there which is pretty interesting.,40
"The rooms were very spacious and luxorius. The room (Royal Deluxe Cotai view) with King size bed even had a railing divider between bed room and living area that had beautiful dining area.  Bath tub as well as stand up shower were spacious too, I had my own vanity mirror in the bathroom with separate desk and chair away from main bathroom mirror. Loved the room decor.  The hotel property is huge spanning shops, casinos, their canal's for Gondola rides. Except in the main lobby the paintings on the ceiling were not as great as the ones in Las Vegas.",50
"Room itself is spacious and clean. The twin bed room is good for families to travel with kids. I would like to thanks Cova and Russel from Guest Relations too. The birthday decoration and complimentary cake for my husband is very nice. There are lots of different kind of shops in the shopping area.  The heated pool is the best that I have tried ever as the temperature is just right. Most of the heated pool are too cold to play with in winter time. My kids enjoyed the pool so much. Things did not start very smooth at first as we have been waited for a long time during check-in. After mentioning this and other problems to the guest relations via email, I was happy to have a chance to talk to the Head of Front Office Ms Guo. She is very helpful and attentive. I would really like to…",40
"it was great to stay at this hotel. the room was huge. so many things to do and see. the kids had a great time as well. next time maybe we will try a different hotel, but just because there are so many good options. highly recommended",50
"This hotel already has what you need. Beside the casino, there is a huge shopping center, plenty of restaurant and you will be seeing lot of cool place to take a pictures.   You need to prepare your foot as the place is way too huge. ",40
"We stayed in The Venetian in Macau. The resort hotel is conveniently located with a shuttle taking guests directly from the Hong Kong/Macau Ferry Terminal. It offers a free shuttle from the hotel to main Macau attractions such as the Lisboa where some Michelin starred restaurants are located, other than the casinos such as The Eight, Robouchon, The Kitchen. Our room in the Venetian is gorgeous, with a king size bed, sitting area, and a beautiful bathroom with all manners of amenities. The third floor is the Canal area you can actually take a cruise in a gondola under an artificial starlit sky. Its huge food court offers an international cuisine from pizza, roast goose noodles to curry rice and Taiwanese beef noodles.",40
"The Venetian Macao I think is a over rated property. The ambience is gud but the Gondola ride is not worth the money spent. The interior and the decor is extraordinary glitzy and golden everywhere, Visiting there as a tourist spot is better than staying in it.",50
It was awesome. Worth every penny. The canal looks like the real thing and how the ceiling was painted brought the hotel more life. You can enjoy the ride for a minimal fee. The food specially in the food court were so delicious at a very affordable price,50
"This place has its own wonderful charm. Its tastefully & aesthetically designed with attention paid to every minute detail. To begin with reception area, bit lengthy Que but the staff is efficient. They are pleased to upgrade your room category. They have free shuttles running from the pier to the hotel. The property is so huge that it requires atleast 2 days time to explore it completely. There's a big shopping area inside with best of the brands. Lots of restaurants to choose from. And not to miss, the grand casino which i felt was the best highlight. You can spend hours here, as they have almost all the game tables in the world. Had a royal time.",50
"First experience at venetian was extremely good. Now 3yrs later, my stay at the hotel was fantastic.  The check in was swift and smooth, was attended by Candice, whose service was excellent. She gave us an upgrade after finding out that we were repeated customers. She also guided us on the transportation and places of interest.  We stayed at the bella suite, which was very spacious and very clean!.  The Breakfast at Cafe Deco was good but can be improved. The Food Market had lots of different types of food and there were lots of shops in venetian itself. There are free shuttle bus linking venetian to many other hotels and places of interest, Making travelling a lot easier for us.  Though its a little pricey but the service, rooms & amenities are of Top class there is no doubt…",50
"I had a nice weekend, the hotel is very beautiful, and I enjoy the shopping mall as well. There are so many brands in the mall that makes shopping very exciting! I would definately choose the hotel next time visit Macau!",40
The hotel is luxurious and splendid. The services they provide are pretty good and satisfactory. The location is very convenient that you only need to walk up one level and shop around all day long without hassle,50
"When you are planning Macau, there can absolutely be no doubt in your mind. Simply choose Venetian. You cannot go wrong. My 4th visit and happy to report, the service quality has gone up a notch since the last visit😊😊😊",50
The hotel is very clean.  The rooms are fairly spacious.  It's a giant hotel so you have to contend with a lot of people everywhere but the service is good.  There are many food choices and room service is generally good too.,40
"Hi guys,   So this was my 5th trip to Macau, but it came after a long long time. My wife & I went to Macau with the intention to return to Hongkong the very same day taking the last ferry to Kowloon. But we ended up staying at Venetian as it was my wife’s first trip, and she had a beginner’s luck working in her favor. The Venetian casino was electrifying even thought it was a Thursday and rooms were pretty huge and service was impeccable both at casino as well as in the room. Definitely going to go back there soon. ",50
you should definitely visit venetian if you are in macau. the hotel is a city in itself. the rooms are very spacious and comfortable. the staff is also very respectful and helpful. the ambience of the place is very good.,50
"Great Premium Bella Suites. Newly decorated, Clean and Spacious. Impressive ! Thanks to Yukti who checked us in and ensure that we’ll have great stay. Great show of care and hospitality. Thanks to Bell mgr John and Rex who were very approachable and ready to assist us. Venetian, recommended for family travel",50
"The Venetian is not a hotel. It's a city in itself. A perfect place for luxurious holidays for couple, honeymooners and for family also. The architecture of Venetian is awesome. It's give you a feeling of Sistine Chapel with modernisation. It's also inspire with city Venice. Rooms are luxurious and well maintained. Staff is very humble and always ready to help. Here is an Indian restaurant name Peacock. Amazing food specially dal makhani. If you are a shopaholic then it's perfect place for you. What's more I will tell you? You need at least 3-4 days only for Venetian. You never forget these holidays. It's perfect dream holidays with lifetime experience. ",50
"We stayed at the Venetian Macao for 1 night. We checked in at around 2pm and the room was already ready. The checkin queue was quite long since it was weekend but the queue moved pretty fast. The hotel seems newly renovated as we stayed here before back in 2013 and the TV in the room was still a CRT TV back then, now they have smart TV and carpet smell pretty new etc. The room is specious and comes with all amenities needed. The checkout was nice and easy as we used express checkout since we didn’t consume any minibar or room service so no bill to settle. Overall, the hotel meet up with our expectation and will be back again for sure.",50
"I stayed here around late 2016, but I only made my account here this year so this is a bit of a late review. Anyway, the lobby of the hotel was beautiful - high ceilings, elegant decor, the total works. You feel very high class here. The rooms weren't as great, but the shopping area made up for it. When I stepped out there, I really thought at first that I was  outdoors. A lot of branded little stores and a few that sold high quality masks. Very pretty and pricey. I would have bought one, but where would I wear it? :(",40
Its a very expensive hotel but the staff are kind they will help you. The hotel resembles the one in Las Vegas. But be sure to bring some cash because some of the credit cards there tend to not work on their system.,40
"Overview: I think as western tourists heading to Macau you have a vision in your mind that it's going to be exactly like Vegas. Having stayed at the Venetian in Vegas I can tell you that its a far stretch from the quality and offering you receive there. That is part of what you can expect but just a warning that there really is no expansive pool, a tiny spa, and the restaurants on site were just okay. Price: we paid C$344.38, and for the size of the room it was decent quality with four people fitting comfortably Service: overall quite happy. They provided us a free upgrade when we go in and the staff was super friendly. Rooms: the rooms were very spacious and the bathrooms come fully stocked with shavers and everything you need. Food: the breakfast buffet at Cafe Deco was…",40
 one of the very luxurious hotel .. the rooms are super spacious and clean .. the view from the room is amazing .. the hotel staff is super friendly .. really worth trying .. will definitely go back again during the holidays to macau next time ..,50
"Ha an awesome experience.Rooms are superb really comfortable,staff really helpful.For such a huge property very well managed.Casinos and shipping area is huge u can spend an entire week there and still have less time to explore the entire place and area of the hotel itself.Best hotel by a long margin and highly recommended.Do visit.",50
"The most incredibly exquisite establishment in Macau, and probably in the whole of Asia. Exceptional classical styled interiors, stunning rooms, a great place for gambling, incredible customer service. However, (there are always howevers), it has a very small range of indian menu for in room dining. The Golden peacock Indian restaurant is always full and requires prior reservation.  The swimming pool is awesome. It’s temperature controlled. The kids love it!",50
Celebrated my wedding anniversary at this resort after a 4 day stay in HongKong. We loved the property. Our room was extremely spacious and amazingly well equipped. The casino in the property didn’t require any dress code which was also amazing. We sat down at a black jack table even before checking into our room! The Indian restaurant had a long waiting que but the food was worth the wait.,50
this is the third time we stay in the Venetian Macao.  the room spaces is bigger than other hotels.  it is the best hotel to stay when travel with kids.  The only unpleasant thing is that it took us half hour to find the way out to lobby the first time.,50
"The Venetian is beautiful. From the lobby to the casinos, restaurants and finally the rooms, for the price its a steal. Depending on which time of the year you go to the Venetian you can be sure that the experience will be a good one. The people at the Venetian has made sure that all the famous foods are under its roof and are from recognized vendors. The casinos area is big enough to indulge your gambling itch and keeps it above most other casinos in the area. The rooms are very big. Families will love the space. The split section design of the rooms offers the option of separate rooms for sleeping and entertaining. My room came with a beautiful view as well If you're with kids, the kids play area and the pool are a joy. For breakfast that comes with the room, youre given an…",50
"Hotel reception: Big and many counters are open to accommodate tourists. Staffs are simply great, friendly and helpful.  Hotel rooms: We stayed at south wing floor 33. Cotai view and and loved the lay out of room, things arranged and facilities. You will have message which appears on TV for any special info from the hotel. It’s quite interesting as you can view your breakfast restaurants name, option you can choose for restaurants.  Environment: As we stayed at high floor, it was quiet. Gondola ride excellent. 20min ride.   Shopping: All classy shops found out there. You need 2 days to complete all shopping. As few hotels and merge together.  Food:  Advisable to take package when you book hotel as restaurants buffet provide more choices. The best is to book through Venetian…",50
Its an experience to just stay in this hotel. Everything will make your jaws drop. Staying here is like is like living in a dream.The food is decent and the staff is very courteous. Take a gondola ride here if you have the time.,40
"Oh boy! This is massive and impressive ! We had a rather large very very plush room for the night - the word luxurious is a bit less to describe it.   The room size was large by all means and very well appointed with facilities.   Out in the lobby and other areas is where the madness begins. It is super crowded !  Find your way through the shopping and gambling arenas - because that’s all there is to do here.  The checkin and checkout was super smooth. Wifi works well. Service is pretty good, so is the food.  You can walk out to the mall and other hotels to check out their decor (it’s a thing to do)   Definitely recommended for a short stay and book the plush big rooms. It’s worth it ! ",50
"Transport yourself to venice with Gandola rides; Play in one of the world's best casino, losse yourself to indulgenece in Spa  A close cousin of Parisian, this hotel stands amongst the best that macau has to offer",50
"Every thing in Macau is majestic. It's larger than life and this hotel is no different. It's expansive, beautiful and tranports you to Venice. The stay is ofcourse luxurious, & it offers so much, from the casino to the shopping & amazing food. A definite visit for everyone.",50
One night probably is not enough for enjoying entire place. You can get long queues at check in especially if you are visiting near new year. Rooms and facilities are great. Unlimited free rides to and fro from hotel to few places,40
"We arrive early but at 10:30 we were allowed to check in and gave us a late check out at 2pm. We don’t even have to bring our baggage to our room since they will take care of it while we tour around the place. When we went to our room at night all our things were already there waiting for us. We booked the Bella Suite Room. It was the cheapest among the room but it was already so beautiful and elegant, what more the other rooms. Even the bathroom was so beautiful and so spacious you could not ask for anything more. The room and the bathroom are clean and we stayed on the upper floor so we had a very beautiful view. We could just stay in our room and enjoyed it but we need to explore the whole hotel and we were not disappointed. In Venetian alone you can do a lot of things. You…",50
"I stayed here with my partner and friends. Its real real awesome. Soooo big hotel i never saw.  Rooms are just suites, ample space for bed and even for sitting there. Bathroom also ver very big with seperate wc well within. Fortunately we were there to witness the 10th aniversarry grand celebrations.",50
"2nd stay at the Venetian in Macau. Rooms are very large, well equipped and luxurious. Highly recommend to anyone staying in Macau. Hotel is the largest casino for pokies/slots in Macau and the free shuttle to the ferries and other casinos make it very easy to get around and enjoy all that Macau has to offer.",50
"for last fifteen years, I always stay in your hotel whenever visiting MACAU. very convenient all kind of your facilities and so kind staffs and wonderful entertainment including CASINO and food. if I have chance to visit again, I will choose your hotel.",50
"Where to start.. this hotel literally has all you possibly need under one roof. Breath-taking throughout. The shopping mall is unbelievable. Not to mention the casino it’s amazing. The hotel suite was beautiful throughout and very clean. Staff very helpful, room service fantastic. Hotel close to all shows, I would recommend to go and see one. For anyone who is a picky eater theres no shortage of food to cater for everyone which I loved. 🍔🍕🍟🍣🍤🍱 Over all my stay way amazing anyone heading to Hong Kong I would recommend taking a few days in Macau it is cheap and only a boat trip away. 🤗 ",50
Priceless experience in this hotel. From the toilet to the room. All amenities are luxurious. Our room has a good view with nice room temperature. Hotel is located inside mall so very convenient. Luxurious facades!,50
"Greatest hotel visited by me till now . A property worth visiting in a lifetime . Great rooms with awesome facilities . Grand lobby , grand restaurants , grander casino , very courteous staff , just awesome food and everything is so well done up that I have fallen in love with it ",50
"Next best to a visit to Vegas. A great luxurious way of Life. What more to do as they have covered all bases. Do beware to take enough money as you are sure to find ways to splurge. Great casino, wonderful location, great food, good pavilions to shop and entertain. What more to add, go and spend !!!",50
Huge rooms available at the Venetian with lots of different configurations available!  Massive shopping expanse downstairs and easy access to the Casino - you could easily get lost here for days without venturing outside.,40
"We come here for personal leisure,and we choose this hotel from recommending,and the hotel bus makes it easy,the hotel is extraordinarily gorgeous,and we have a great time here,hope can stay for much longer ",50
"The hotel is huge and reproduces perfectly Venice! You find the ""Gran Canale"" as the way to the shopping and as way to the ""Parisienne"", the ""Ponte dei Sospiri"", the ""Piazza San Marco"" and outside also the ""Laguna""  outside. Incredible are also the paintings on the wall and the swimming pool. In the hotel there are many casino, open 24h per day and always full of people playing. The rooms are AMAZING, perfect and clean. It is something that in life you have to see, at least one time.",50
Stayed in the Bella Deluxe and it was perfect for our family of 4. The 2 queen beds is extremely comfortable and there is a separate living area that you can lounge around comfortably. Our room faces the Cotai Strip and the kids love looking out of the window to the beautiful light display from the other hotels at night. Plenty of food options in the hotel and plenty of shopping!,50
"The Venetian is a Luxurious Hotel. It is the stunning replica of ancient architecture of Venice, Italy. Want to feel like a king? This is the place to be. Have no words to describe its beauty, service and entertainment it offers. Separate play area for the kids. Swimming Pool. Gambling area.  There is a food court at the ground floor with food from almost all parts of the world. Huge Gambling area. Complimentary Breakfast has a huge list of menu but very little to offer in terms of taste and delicacies. The area becomes overcrowded during breakfast.",50
If you are planning a Macau trip never compromise on Venetian. This is an experience in itself. thats why this hotel is also one of the itinerary for tour organisers. Whether you are interested in casino or not this hotel does make a lot of sense. ,50
"no doubt this is the best hotel in Macao. huge rooms, amazing stuff, best shopping Mall. the rooms have so much cool stuff and one of the most beautiful hotels and rooms i have ever visit.  after a month of honey moon this was the best hotel, although it wasn't the most costy one",50
"This is a great ""resort hotel"".... and the gaming tables can be fun too!!  The ambience is ""very seductive"" inasmuch as one feels like staying for a much longer time!!  The gondola ride makes one almost feel like one is in Venice... but the gondolas are a ""better quality""!!  The food services cater to all tastes--- especially the , eye popping sumptuous buffet breakfast!  The location is very central and the professionalism and helpfulness of the staff is very useful!  It is also quite economical when compared with mnay other 5 star hotels!!",40
"I stayed for 1 night at the Venetian Macau and was a great experience, rooms comfortables with all the amenities, lot of things to do including the Casino, restaurants, shops , I wish I had stayed a few more days. Is a 24 hour hotel. Time goes by very fast , highly recommended.",50
"it was a good experience to stay in venetian. i like the express check out service which is very convenient!!  however, the free wifi service is not very good in the room.  i would recommend the hotel to fix this issue asap.",40
"Perfect !!! It is said: "" You haven't been to Macao if you haven't been to The Venetian Resort Hotel !"" Strongly recommend this hotel to friends who are going to visit Macao, even if you will not stay in this hotel. I am sure my family would like to stay there for more days next time! ",50
"The view from the hotel was good and the people were kind.  I explained to you slowly because I was not good at English. The room was tidy and the next time I visited Macau, I found that it would be I'd like to make another reservation.",40
"The hotel was massive in size. Shopping area was also inside the hotel, so it was very convenient at all. Many shuttle buses to different area were available in the hotel too. My suite was spacious, especially the bathroom. The city view was magnificent. It was classic Macau hotel design which was not special anyway. We went to watch the show just right at the theater downstairs. In general, it is nice to stay here for a night.",50
"very nice and good hotel to stay for enjoy our visit. i enjoy a lot to see the atmospear and settings. i am also enjoy in dance programs, play casino, also in nightlife. it is the special attraction for this country.",50
It was my second time to stay at Venetian Macao Resort Hotel. The room was big and spacious for my kid to run in the room. The facilities were in good condition. The staff were nice and helpful. It was really a good experience to stay there. This is really suitable for family.,40
"Good customer service upon arrival at the hotel until we have checked in.  Nice place to shop and dine.  We love the food at Bambu Resto.  That was my 2nd time at Venetian at first it was a business trip, then i recommended to my family that is why I came back. ",50
"All I can say, this would be the perfect getaway for Casino players. I love also their rooms. Very neat and accommodating. They have friendly staff from bellboy to manager. Try also to walk around the amenities and nearby hotels.",50
The hotel was very clean and the designs were magnificent! I love how it was well-lit and it smelled luxurious. Everything about this hotel is just absolutely fantastic! I would like to come here again and spend more time.,50
"- huge room with nice and clean conditions - everything is available in here, if you hungry you can go to the foodcourt, if you want to shopping there's a lot of store, you can gambling in casino.. - you must queue around 15-20 minutes when you want to check in because too many people want to stay in this hotel",40
"The rooms are very spacious and clean. The furniture and décor is quite luxurious. If you like you shopping. You have great choice of brand name shops to choose from, located within the complex. The hotel complex is built along the Venice theme, with canals and venetian facades. At night all the hotels within the area are brightly lit up.",50
"First of all, I would sincerely like to thank Mr. Ethan who assisted me at the check-in counter. I had made a request with booking.com but the request didn't reach the Hotel, but Mr. Ethan was very polite and understanding and he upgraded our room as per request. Thanks to him our day was saved and our stay was so memorable. Room was quite spacious and filled with everything which made us feel like home. Cleanliness was superb. The staff was very polite. Even our minor requests were fulfilled with smiles. Big thumbs-up to the staff. The room set-up was quite impressive. A very awesome view at night from our room which was on the higher floors facing cotai thanks to the upgrade. Free Shuttle service was quite handy. Concierge department was very warm & friendly and helped us with…",40
"Nice hotel, pretty much similar to the one in Las Vegas. A good thing they provide free shuttle bus from ferry terminal to hotel. Long line for check in and took us over 25 mins to get the room key which could have been done faster. Service just average and extended check out until 2 pm as normally check out time at 11.00 am. Found food and beverage just so so as still find somewhere else much better. They offered turndown service and the best part they still have smoking room 😉",50
"Went from Hong kong to Macau and stayed here for 2 days. This place is a city within itself. One of the best stays that I have had. In spite of the hugeness, the hospitality was excellent. Neat and huge rooms, very clean sheets, neat bathrooms, towels etc. The room service was excellent. Breakfast spread was too good with hundreds of dishes to choose from. The fruit spread was also wow !!!  Had a good time staying there with time spent at the Casino !!",50
"It was my birthday 2 days before we checked in and the front desk made sure I get a gift pack from the hotel. They  sent a birthday cake to our room, extended our check out time by 5 hours and upgraded  our room with a view of cotai. Stayed in the royale deluxe suite and everything is superb but one thing I discovered though, there's  no bidet!  The personnel were mostly filipinos who are known for their hospitality so service was excellent. However, the management should put more staff in the front desk. It took me more than 30 minutes standing in line to check in.",50
the staffs doesn't know how to speak English and they do not accept card in the food court. no money changer inside too. the layout of the hotel is kinda confusing so even we have the maps its hard to follow. ,40
"we only stayed for a brief moment here, while waiting for our return flight but have enjoyed every sight and food option at this place. there were also a lot of shops that you can pick your souvenir items or could also be some exquisite food brands :)",40
"Hi Venetian Macao, I would like to extend my deepest thanks and gratitude to Sherin Pothen and Winson Bai, both Heads of your Front Office - for their utmost kindness and care during our family’s stay from 21-23 Dec 2017 at the Venetian Macao! Your personal care and dedication to the wellbeing of your guests is something all hotels should make an example of! We really want to make sure both Sherin and Winson receive our sincere thank you! Both of you went the extra mile to personally come meet us and talk to us, then called us back quite a few times to make sure we’re ok and asked if there is some other help we might need! This is exactly what makes us want to come back to a hotel again, the assurance of personal service quality that the Venetian Macao hotel should be proud of!…",50
"A huge& amazing  property with world class casinos. we stayed here for 2 nights in January 2018. very very spacious & comfortable rooms, bathroom - no match. Swimming pool area - worth enjoying. excellent facilities. very big shopping area with about 380 shops of all big brands from world. Indian Peacock restaurant is good Indian Food, Even Cafe Deco is serving good quality & tasty Breakfast and dinner which we enjoyed there. more than 100% satisfaction. If I ll get a chance, definitely I ll visit there.",50
"Stayed for two nights in mid December and had a room with a nice view of the Cotai Strip. The room was big and spacious and had the same feel as the Venetian in Las Vegas.The Wi-Fi was good and the room was fairly clean, just seemed a little outdated. Overall the experience was pretty good and would recommend.",40
"From all the hotels we stay during our Xmast Holiday last year, this hotel was the best i have ever stayed during our trip. Loveeee every corner of the hotel and its room. We booked the Bella Suite for 1 night bfr heading out to HK and it can accommodate 5 adults+ 2 kids.. we asked for the sofa bed to be prepared for us. The beds were so comfy and the view from our bedroom window was so nice. The hotel is connected to the mall and the mall itself is so huge. Easy to find a place to eat, shop and just enjoying the scenery inside the mall. After the kids went to sleep, we sneaked out to the casino and strolling around outside of hotel to see all the lights and xmast decoration from other hotels... Definitely  will come back again one day.. Highly recommended",50
"This hotel was amazing. We stayed here for 2 nights in January 2018. The rooms are enormous, of course, and the view is spectacular. Super comfortable bed. Beautiful living room. The bathroom was so nice - I could literally live in it. The hotel breakfast was a great deal and had lots of delicious choices. The check in was fast and pleasant and we did express checkout - so just spent 1 minute filling out a card and dropping it in a box and left. 100% satisfied with this stay! Definitely will be back if we're in Macao again.",50
The best Casino in Macao in Cotai Strip.  They accept just Hong Kong dollars. They have a place to change your money.  A big shopping mall with all brands from around the world. And lot of restaurants are waiting for you.  Come and have fun!,50
"We were a couple with a child staying in this hotel in August 2017. Amazing hotel, Simply flawless. Excellent facilities. This has been one of our best experience so far in any of the hotels we had ever stayed. Had some trouble in check in due to system failure, but seeing a kid with us, the staff helped us in early check in. Excellent !!",50
"Normally it is expected from any luxury hotel to provide an out of the world experience. While everyone would expect this, very few properties fulfill the expectations without any flaws whatsoever.  When the stay is booked in luxury collection even the minutest thing count. This property is all set to fulfill customer experience at its best. It is not just a hotel but an entire different world in itself. There are lots of things to do for the guest.  One can simply stroll inside the gigantic property, enjoy the gondola ride or do shopping (definitely indulge in window shopping), enjoy the various restaurants for breakfast / dinners, visit the theatre and indulge in the shows playing. Last but not the least Casino is the ultimate zone.",50
"I stayed at the Venetian for two nights with my wife. First off, the hotel is huge, similar to those in Vegas. There's a casino, an attached shopping mall, shops and restaurants. Be ready for a lot of walking. Just getting to your room from the lobby can take 10 minutes since it's a very big hotel and there are so many rooms that the hallways are so long.  We stayed at a regular suite which was huge and luxurious. The check-in took a while though due to the long line. There was a living room and even two TVs in the room (Do people actually use both?). The rooms are tastefully decorated and come with complete amenities. The hotel is a bit old but the rooms didn't look that tired so I guess their maintenance was all right.   The bathroom was also big and included double vanities,…",40
"this is lovely, clean and confortable in a great location  The suite was very big, bright and spacious with  very comfortable Queen Beds Our window had the view of the golf course Business desk table complete with printer, telephone, fax, etc",50
"it may be a luxury but a very awesome experience for people like me. i feel rich at one point (hahahaha). not all are blessed to have a chance to go around cotai. you should try hopping from one hotel to another just to experience the stay in those luxurious hotels. we stayed in a royal suite, which i think will fit a family of 5. it was just me and my husband so the room was really big for us.",50
Our family of four stayed at The Venetian and enjoyed our stay at the non smoking Bella Suite very much. It is equipped with two double beds with a living room that has a sofa bed as well. The suite and the bathroom are huge and clean. We loved the spaciousness :) Keep up the good work!,50
"The highlight was the rooms, rooms were both comfortable and huge! The lobby was very nice however check-in lines do tend to be quite long. Service was great. Loved how there was a shopping mall in the hotel with a great food court and reasonable shopping variety. In the Venetian has a few nice restaurants as well; I would recommend the Indian restaurant; good find excellent atmosphere.",50
"We stayed for a night in this hotel (bella suites room). Check in was excellent, staff were very accommodating and friendly. They also have express check out box (you just need to drop your hotel room key card to a box) which is very helpful. Overall, the experience was great",50
"Had a 1 night stay at venetian macao, it was a great experience during our stay. King size bed and large bedroom, cleaned and great bathroom. Children bunk bed are excellent, they even gave children coloring book and crayons at the room. Amenities, bathrope and slippers for children were uber cute! Express check out service is excellent. Thanks Venetian Macao, will definitely be our choice if we go to Macau again.",50
a luxurious hotel with casino with free Shuttle Bus going to different tourist spot in Macau. Lots of shopping Boutique and restaurants. Grand Canal is so romantic with singing row man... the room is so spacious ad big.,40
"When I stayed at the Venetian Macao it was very comfortable and the experience of shopping center and gondola was very good.Our room view is a little disappointing. Next time I come to Macau, I would like to stay again.",50
We stayed at the resort for 2 nights - Kenneth checked us in was extremely polite knowledgeable and friendly. We were upgraded to a better room and provided with a late check out. We attended a number of the shops some of which had excellent sales and also ate at a number of the restaurants. All the staff were extremely accomodating and would definitely recommend.,50
"Stayed for 3 nights as family of four – 2 adults and 2 kids  Chose Familiga suite as our kids were 7 and 10 and would enjoy the kids option. I haven’t stayed in the other rooms so can’t quite compare but I think these were the extras that we got in the Familiga suite: Bunk bed, little tent next to the bunk bed, colouring pencils and some small toys, rubber duckie family in the bath tub to play with and children’s toothbrush and toothpaste set. The other extra was a towel folded into a shape of an elephant. The children really loved the bunk beds and those small extras. They really enjoyed the rubber duckies went they took a bath. I think the Familiga suite also has the effect of dividing the open plan suite into two areas: bed area for adults and bunk bed area for kids. I think…",50
"We were staying in Galaxy before we checked into Venetian. When we arrived via the free shuttle at the bus terminal, it was so crowded and busy like after a rock concert. It immediately downgraded the Venetian image and reputation in our eyes. Nothing like Galaxy where you still feel decent and luxurious. Since we booked directly with Venetian, we got to checked in early and was upgraded. That was the only perk. The rooms were huge and exactly as per photos in website. The room is clean and look brand new. However the overall hotel looks classic and tired to me. I requested for room at South wing which has a direct lift to the mall which stops at level 3. Hotel room also is close to buffet breakfast in Cafe Deco. Bfast was acceptable. King size bed were smaller as compared to…",40
"We checked in the evening and had to leave the Hotel post breakfast but whatever we could enjoy was superb. The rooms were huge with 2 queen sized beds. Huge bathroom with double wash basins, tub, separate shower cubicle n a dresser.   The room had a separate lounge area with another flat screen TV. The ink bar was well appointed.   The swimming pools n jacuzzi were closed due to the typhoon.   The hotel is just Luxury personified, superb place. Would recommend higher floors for the stay. ",50
Perfect location n room. Royale suite was 10/10... so much room . Especially with separate sunken lounge . Quiet room. Casino downstairs. Foodhall n shops outside rooms. Casinos across road. Buses downstairs to take you free to other casinos. Theatre in complex .,50

"I visited Venetian almost 7 years back. Its grandeur and architecture will sweep you off the floor. Its still one of the best hotels I have been to so far. Large spacious rooms that feel luxurious and you can walk around the place the whole day. Thats what I did after attending the event that I had gone for. Not a big fan of casinos but some colleagues sure had a lot of fun. For me, its the rooms and the hotel architecture that took the cake! picked a souvenir from a shop, a beautiful mug that still reminds me of the place :)",50
"The hotel is awesomely impressive from the time we set foot at main entrance lobby, it was an amazing experience seeing casinos and shopping mall under one roof. The painted sky is so huge and it is always daytime. A small replica of Venice with the singing gondolier pulling off the gondola in the clear water canal. The staff at the Venetian Macao hotel were very helpful. Everything very well indicated",50
"The rooms are larger than what one can imagine and come with separate study, a large sit out area, 2 large TVs and a really nice bay window. We took two double bed suites for the family and loved the space that was on offer. The bathrooms were rich and lavish. Even though the concept of No Locks in the washrooms was in vogue, we managed to overcome this shortcoming.   The only flaw was that despite advanced booking, it took exceptionally long to check in at the main lobby which was flocked with seas of people as we arrived after a long and tiring overnight journey. Also the time taken to check in each person is very long.  To top it up, there is no seating space available for the guests to make use of while they wait. It did get quite difficult with senior citizens and young…",50
"This is by far one of the largest and best resorts in Macao. It has something for everyone - a large food court, a wide range of restaurants, shops, entertainment and of course gambling. This was my second visit and this time it was with the family - we all thoroughly enjoyed it and will be back!",50
Was unaware that the room I booked was a king sized bed only but the staff at the reception upgraded me to the twin bedded room.   Room was majestic with a huge bathroom!   Free shuttle service available to ports and other Sands properties.,50
Very good scent of hotel. I love the ambiance and people. People are amazing and cool. The sky is always daytime. Unbelievable! We love to go here everytime. And also to ride the boat in Gondola tomorrow! 👍👍👍,50
"The room is a suite but at normal hotel price; it is very worth it; it is spacious and luxurious; it has a section with the beds, and a spacious living room; the bathroom is huge too with a bath tub and a shower area;",50
Minimum 2 nights stay required to enjoy property. Real worth to stay. All the facilities are upto the mark which expected by a tourist. The rooms are very clean with the best view. Shopping area amazing. Many restaurants to have choice of food and snacks with attractive atmosphere. The food and snacks are delicious which could not be found in any other hotels.  ,50
Best Hotel to stay if you are in Macau. Offers lot of entertainment and shopping experience within hotel itself. The casino in the hotel adds to the hotel's wonderful experience.  Macau Tower and other locations are at reasonable distance.,40
"This was my first visit to Macau and it was an amazing experience due the Venetian Hotel. This is the main attraction when visiting Macau. The place is very beautiful and lively. Don't miss to ride a gondola when visiting the place.  They have made replicas of the streets in Venice, the grand canals and pulling it off with a gondola and the singing gondolier. it's just funny as most tourist and even us make a wishing well out of the great canal as the water is so clear, but one thing that mesmerised me is the painted sky as it so huge. Loads of fun under one roof . This hotel is located at a great location, just few minutes’ walk from the Taipa village, where the famous pork chop bun were. The hotel room is very big, much better than we expect. The bathroom is very big too where…",50
Actually this hotel is realy nice and feeling the luxury when we in.. Everyone in the venetian(staffs) are helpful..but i think when a new people under 21 years old like me (only 19) cant go in casino want to check in i believe they will confuse coz need to find the enterance to their room..,50
Granted we went during Christmas holidays! But man it was crowed. The hotel is beautiful! Great decoration. Rooms are spacious and clean. Make sure to request a non smoking rooms as we have been on a different level by accident and it smelled like cigarette in the hallway. Casino is impressive!  So many luxury boutiques and connected by the mall to the Parisian hotel which makes a cool walk. Breakfast buffet was pretty good. Nice restaurants in the mall attached to the hotel ( I recommend portofino). Plays are also available in that hotel which makes it convenient if you like Broadway. We went to see the Sound of Music and it was West End level. Enjoy!!,50

"So I am not much of a fan of casino’s, but I have to say that The Venetian in Macau is a pretty amazing place to see.  There is shopping, great food, awesome shows, and of course stacks of gambling... So plenty to do.  But I am warning you though, this place is not cheap, everything costs quiet a bit and you have to be ok with large groups of Asian tourists... they are everywhere. :)  I recommend getting there early in the day to try and get great pictures without having strangers ruining your shots. Lol It’s definitely the best casino on the strip in Macau, besting Vegas in the USA hands down.  If you are in Hong Kong, check out The Venetian. :) ",40
"The view from 18th floor, spacious and elegantly-designed bedroom and bathroom, clean hallway, food court offering wide variety of foods, courteous gym staff - this hotel may be one of the most expensive but i would definitely go back and spend even more just to stay again in this fancy hotel. TOTALLY LOVE IT!",50
"This was our first visit to Macau and since we were only staying for 1 night we decided to splurge on the hotel. We're travelling as a family of six with my elderly parents and two teenagers. We got 2 Bello suites (with 2 queen beds and a queen sofa bed in each suite so we had 3 persons in a room, each with a queen-sized bed!). We took the Cotai Water Jet from the China Ferry Terminal in Tsim Sha Tsui. I get sea sick but tried using pharmacy-bought acupressure wristbands this time and it worked! From the ferry terminal, catch the free hotel shuttle to The Venetian. Anyway we arrived at 1215pm and had to wait 15mins before the reception accepted check-ins. If you have bags you could always drop them off and go shopping 1st. But we decided to wait. Elaina at the reception was very…",50
"The room was huge and the teams were very friendly. They have several pools outside, including a heated one for the ""colder"" months. Although the hotel has a massive Casino, I still have plenty of quiet space in my room. Looking forward to another visit.",50
"This is our family trip together with small kid and total 3 x Premio Bella Suite has been booked.   It is not come to the expectation compare to the first 2 days that we accommodated in other 4 star hotel in Macao.  First, during the check in time. Our family to spend more than 1hr for the room arrangement , and I need to stand there and regular follow up the status as the front desk receptionist just silent all the time and keep mentioned all rooms was all taken by other staff for tour group. I have feedback we got the elder and young kids with us (total 3 small kids from 1 to 6 yrs and elder at 60+age ). For the first 45 mins I just stand in front of the officer and he did not really update me what it going on. And I need to voice up to request to speak to front desk manager…",40
"went there for shopping and little gambling, everything is well indicated, in case you got lost concierge both can provide you with good assistance in multiple language (English -Mandarin   -Cantonese for our helpful concierge Kiki ) . Shopping mall is huge with good choices. Casino is also looking good , it has been open for few years now and all still looks very good, the main lobby and corridor towards the gambling area looks like the first time we went there in 2007. Overall a good place to visit , multiple high quality restaurant everywhere. ",40
"World Class Resort..... yet no one is Perfect.   Pros: • Beautiful Property  • Huge Room & Bathroom • Huge Casino • Friendly Hotel Staff • A must try Golf Course • Serene Pool Area • Multiple Choice of Cuisines  • Golden Peacock: The Indian Restaurant at The Venetian is a big saviour for Indians looking for some Indian Food. There Lunch Buffet is too good. And the Staff during the Lunch Hours were so welcoming and warm. 5 stars to them. They are a doing great job.  BUT not the same when its Dinner time. Highly Arrogant.   Cons:  • Very Slow Check In Process, it took us an hour to get the rooms. Standing in QUE after a 18 hour journey was very exhausting. Seems highly inefficient process and checkin team.  • Room Service: Never ever order anything for room service, they take ages…",40
"The Venetian in Macao is amazing.  Starting with the suites in the hotel - they are elegant and spacious, with all the facilities one could wish for.  The Great Hall is gambling central - much larger than anything I have seen in Las Vegas.  Literally hundreds of tables and machines, and there must be thousands of mainlanders with money to burn.  All very clean and modern.  Then there is the shopping level - every western and eastern shops around a Venice themed circuit, complete with canals and gondolas, and restaurants from McDonalds to high end cuisine.  It’s all very hokey, but very well done and quite entertaining.",50
"This hotel is located at a great location, just few minutes’ walk from the Taipa village, where the famous pork chop bun were. The hotel room is very big, much better than we expect. The bathroom is very big too where you can enjoyed a good rest at the bathtub. There’s lots of shops within the hotel, we even bring the children to the hotel indoor playground, quite impressive. We had also tried the hotel breakfast buffet, the food varieties is much better than we expected.",50
We booked a family suite. There is 2 King beds and a big livings rooms. Nice View from the living room. Room is clean and toilet is huge. Near to food court and easy access to other hotels nearby. Check in and out is fast. ,40
"The room itself was amazing. Or rather, the suite was amazing. Paying the price I did (which would have gotten me only a tiny room in Hong Kong), I was so happy to get a whole suite. Everything was spacious and opulent. The bathroom was ridiculously huge that you could honestly put a rollaway bed inside, and I appreciated the separate bathtub and standing shower. Also loved the huge living room area with 2 separate TVs (one facing the bed and one facing the sofa). I enjoyed lounging at the sofa area watching TV eating supper.   However, Venetian would only have been amazing if you stayed in the room the whole day. There is literally nothing much to do on the Cotai Strip if you do not gamble or do not intend to shop at luxury boutiques the whole day long. The food court at the…",40
"This is a truly fantastic hotel, rooms are huge and quiet. So much to do! We don’t gamble so I cannot comment on that but everything else what fantastic. Gondola ride is well worth doing and shopping had so much variety. Food was quite good too.",50
"I have recently stayed at the Venetian on holiday in Macau. The hotel is amazing and very different to anything I have ever seen. It recreates every detail of Venice buildings. The shopping options are amazing. It has the all the best brands. The rooms are big and very comfortable. As the hotel is huge, with so many people all the time, it can feel a bit impersonal. It is very Chinese guest and casino oriented. The staff tries to help as much as they can. However, the service level is not a standard. There should be an improvement in training especially the younger staff. The food is good, but as the restaurants are within the shopping mall and not the hotel the dining experience is not as elegant as in other hotels. Room service is great and delivers the food promptly.  One…",40
"We were mesmerised from the moment we set foot inside this hotel.  Everything was perfect, from the welcome at the front desk, to the rooftop canal and gondola.  The staff made us feel part of the family and the rooms were among the best we have experienced. We will be back on our next visit to Macau.",50
"Perfect... as expected - only the check in is long process  Blocking C.C. is wrong, they should remove this or reduce the card blocking amount Overall super  sparkling, magnificent, classy hotel... above all",50
"豪華なホテル。チェックインは３０分待ちでした。 早朝、ホテルのタクシー乗り場のスタッフに声をかけて乗ったら２００ドルって言われましたけど取り締まりできないんですか？ぼったくりですよね。  I took a taxi from the venetian hotel to the airport. a taxi driver said to me, '200 HKD'. This is a rip-off! I was very uncomfortable. I don't know why I can't hotel staff warn?",40
Excellent property with luxurious and spacious rooms to unwind. Lot of shopping eating and gaming options. The gondola rides are a must. The property offers complimentary shuttle services to all the major entry points to Macao at an interval of 15 mins. ,50
At this hotel you will find the best of the brands and a Venice like feel and they also have gondola rides.You Lao have 1 day Macau city bus rides which will take you to all the good places to see in Macau.You can also book a ferry to hong hong which will take only 1 hour.Overall an amazing experience.the room was also amazing.The best part is the number and size of the pools they have.,50
Firstly I choose this hotel because it was connected with the shopping mall so it's very convenient if you like shopping.  My room is the deluxe but it was spacious with a nice interior.  They have everything that you need from bath amenities to hair dryer.   Their laundry services is good and quite fast.  My laundry is all fine.  The restaurant is perfect especially their breakfast.  Over all it's worth the money and will come back!,40
"Seems like most reviews Venetian Macau have been glowing, and mine will be no different. Stayed a night in Dec 2017.  The room was unbelievably huge, and very luxurious at that too. Beds and pillows very comfy. You will be amazed at how good most (or rather, all) things in the room are.  Service staff were very friendly too. Love how helpful they were.  Food was probably the only bummer. Had dinner at the food court situated near the North Wing of the suites. Wide range of options at the food court, but most seem overpriced. Wasn’t impressed by the taste of the food I ordered too. ",50
"Spent 3 days and 2 nights at this massively spread hotel.   Being a business trip, we had about 40 people checking-in, it was done very smoothly with speed of a bullet train.  The hotel interiors are amazing, the suite we got was superb!  You don't a suite with a good vew of the outside world, there's a lot to sink in what is already inside.  There business rooms are well equiped and they have plenty in number.   I am not a casio goer, so can't give my feed back on it.   Overall We had agreat time.",50
"So I really don't know how to initiate praising about this one heap of luxurious hotel. Right from the moment, you step out of hotel bus to check in, you could see a gigantic bubble of luxury which is going to be a part of your life for next 2-3 days.  The entrance is huge and this hotel is a part of few very grand luxurious hotels in the city. Though the check in took little longer than expected but the from staff made up for it by giving us a free lunch at their signature Golden Peacock restaurant and coupons for discount on Macau City tour.  The hotel has plethora of options to eat inside the lobby and also a 24x7 Starbucks outlet for a coffee fiend like me. Their casino is also great though we were not lucky to win anything still we enjoyed and went on from one table to…",50
"Love the place and rooms. My 2nd time since its opening. Rooms are big, the services are good and manage to have early check-in and late check-out. Got a connecting rooms too. Distant to the Macau airport is about 5 mins shuttle service. Definitely will be back again.   Cons: eat at restaurant are expensive but compare eating at food court or fast food, is sure cheaper.",40
"Wanted to see the famous interior of this hotel.  Visited TaiPa village first and read on some blog that there are shutter service from TaiPa village to casino but there are none.  From TaiPa village, if you walk straight down the main street where all the retail shops are, cross a small road, go up a short fleet of stairs, carry on uphill and follow the slope, you will find a overhead bridge that links TaiPa to Venetian Macau. Takes about 10 mins to walk if you take this short cut.  There is a large parking area and coach terminal right by this entrance. From this terminal, look for the Cotai connect coach which stops at a few other casinos.  There is 3 type of Cotai Connect which serves different loop service. so check the signage before you queue. The longest loop service…",40
"Very luxurious hotel with extraordinary detail and concept, nice services, connected with Shopping Mall and have strategic access from ferry terminal. First time came here is a enjoyable experience, very helping to easily exploring Macau.",50
"Room is spacious with a nice view from window towards the golf court and hardrock hotel Separate sitting area to sit and relax while gazing outside the window. Specially the Bathroom is too good with all facilities. A very luxurious feel overall.  The Mall area with fake sky is so amazing. We had a gondola ride and the girl (pic attached) was such a good singer. Lots of praise for her talent.  Its a huge place, make sure you are not lost.  Overall a must place to visit once in a lifetime. We cherish each moment of our visit.",50
"Whenever I go to Macau, the first hotel that comes in my mind is the Venetian Hotel Macao. It has nice facilities that fits to all people who have good eyes for luxury. It is the best hotel in Macau so far and I will keep on coming back here.",50
"Stayed with a friend in a double room, and must say it was fantastic. There was a living area along with generous space by the beds. The bathroom was great size and very clean. All in all, no real complaints, other than it is a huge hotel, so takes a lot of time to walk from one area to another.",40
"There is certainly no shortage of properties to stay in Macau and the Venetian certainly didn’t disappoint!  The room was spacious, tons of shopping on-site and plenty of gambling on the ground floor.  I had dinner at Portofino one night, the minestrone soup and lasagna were amazing!  I would highly recommend this resort.",50
"Excellent hotel, excellent ambience, excellent rooms. No need to go outside, it take entire day to explore the hotel. But ambience wise, I found Parisian much better, although it's a part of the Venetian group only. The grand canal reminds you of Venice itself, and food spread was also good, though I am a pure vegetarian. Casino was a delight , the best part was that you can play with a minimum bet of 10 Hong Kong dollars, maximum had no limits. So you can just play for fun, especially sic bo game, which is not available everywhere. Two points worth noting- Check in takes a lot of  time, so does checkout. Better do prepaid payments to avoid delays. Overall, it was a delight .",50
"I booked direct with The Venetian on a very good deal. And from the moment my partner and I stepped off the Cotai jet ferry at Taipa we experienced nothing but efficient friendly service by anyone associated with The Venetian. We were guided to the free shuttle bus to The Venetian which oozes opulence at every turn. We arrived shortly after 12.00 and left our suitcase with the concierge service free of charge, Then we were told that we could check in just before 12.30. We were served by a charming young lady called Joy who gave us each a pen in a presentation box (retailed MOP118). We were given a voucher which enabled us to have buffet lunch for 2 for only HK$10. Our check-out time was also extended to 14.00! We asked for a non-smoking room and Joy told us that guests caught…",50
"Since arrival , stayed , services till departed , everything were excellent. Only bit slower during check in. Lot of dining options; entertainments. Good surrounding environment. Lucky for us able to watch fireworks during 10th anniversary of Venetian Hotel (because we do not know our booking date was Venetian anniversary date)",50
"The hotel is very beautiful, it's a magnificent building. You will forget all the worries when you live in here. The Staff were all very friendly, and would always check you had everything you needed.",50
"Stayed for a week at this amazing hotel, there are lots of things to do and different facilities based on different budget. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who would like to get lost in a massive hotel. The casino and games are always pack as if this hotel will never sleep.",50
" I stayed here for a conference and the experience was amazing. It's around 10 minutes from the ferry terminal and is a massive property. It's built like a city in itself.  I stayed in a suite which has two queen size beds and a big living area. The rooms have all necessary amenities and are luxurious.   Just from the same building you can move to casinos, shopping areas and restaurants. Everything is under one roof.   It has 4 external pools and one of that is temperature controlled which is brilliant. For families there are play areas for kids.  Highly recommended if you are planning a holiday in Macau.",50
The room is great . We stayed here for 2 nights and 3 days for our wedding anniversary . We would just like to thank everybody specially to Guest Relation Ms. Emma Ngo for making our day special and Christine of the front desk for the help . Again thank you more power . ,50
"we stayed 3 nights at venetian macao (rialto suite). the room was really huge, its above our expectation more than 200 m2 i guess. they offered so many facilities inside the hotel( shopping malls,restaurants, kids activities, casino, and many more). free shuttle from ferry/airport to the hotel every 15 minutes. we really enjoyed staying at this hotel.",50
The room was very spacious and very comfortable..view from the window was of a golf course..a hotel with a casino ...gondola ride...shape of the hotel was quite curved which was itself a beauty ...excellent stay with kids 👍 ,50
"Well, what can I say...it is not the kind of hotel that I would normally pick for a business trip but I have to say that the service was excellent and the room was just fantastic! Great furniture in the room, the bathroom was magnificent and I had some great nights sleep! A big turn off was that I had to walk through the casino to go to my bedroom but you really get used to it after a couple of days. The staff was very helpful and very professional.",50
"The staff were really pleasant, really enjoyed our time at the venetian, the casino is huge with a great selection of gambling. The food was excellent and a great selection of shops. Would highly recommend!!",50
"I took Mum on a trip to Macao for her 80th birthday and stayed for 2 nights at the Venetian.  We enjoyed the big suite, cleanliness, luxurious deco and the convenience of shopping, eating and playing.   Hotel bed is very comfortable, the bathroom is huge with a pretty dressing table. To make our stay more memorable and celebrate mum’a birthday, the hotel sent us traditional Chinese peach like dumplings for long life. It rally made our day.   My favourite place in the hotel is the swimming pool. I had a wonderful time swimming in the rain with Italian statues and fountains around me and enjoyed the convenience in the changing room.   Our stay included breakfast at Cafe Deco which I think could be improved. More delicacy of the food is needed.   Besides, at the check in counter,…",50
"One of the best hotels Ive stayed in ever. Its giant casino, breathtaking rooms and amazing restaurants are just the thing you need from your stay. The mall is an absolute class, especially the Gondola ride, and the shops in the mall are fabulous",40
"Loved being here.  This hotel is all about luxury. Only suites, here.  To add to, the umpteen number of restaurants, the mall, the Gandola ride, the casinos. The day gets over in the blink of an eye, just exploring the hotel. It is HUGE!  From my point of view, Macau is nothing but ‘The Venetian + Macau Tower’.  Having said that, since it’s ‘only suites’ Hotel, and because when on a leisure trip, one hardly stays in room; it’s a bit unnecessary if you are just a couple. (For a family of 4, totally worth it.) Might as well look for ‘The Parisian’ or any other Sands Cotai Central Hotel, as ultimately they are all interconnected with passages and feel like one. ",50
"My husband surprised me in Oct with this trip. We had a 12 hrs flight to China, waited 4 hrs for the Hydrofoil over to Macao. Our baggage was  checked  in at Heathrow and we were reunited with it again at Macao. The Venetian Hotel is vast and is exactly the same as the Venetian in Vegas......except the gambling in Macao is  truly mega!  Our room  (a suite ) was amazing and luxurious........ab fab!. The bathrooms were big and opulent. We wanted for nothing in our room, literally everything was provided.  We had a fabulous breakfast each day........if you couldn’t make breakfast you could take lunch instead. All services were buffet style and the fayre was again amazing.  The shops in the mall are fabulous and you can take a gondola ride along the canals complete with singing…",50
"I have stayed in a number of hotels, but this was a class apart. It is huge go for  a minimum of 3 days only then it will money worth spent. Beautiful suites, even more beautiful bathrooms and excellent toiletry.  Take a visit to the old town with cobbled streets and interesting little market place. Taxis are cheap. Hotel is about 7 mins from the airport. For shopping keep the afternoon at the hotel, there is nothing you won't find their, take is gandola rode in the evening and hot the casino at night. It's a complete holiday a very relaxing 😊😊😊",50
"The riches of Macao clearly showed what its worth. One night in the ravishing Venetian was more than enough to experience the grandeur with which this tiny country operates. Ms.July took care of our check-in proceedings and we got a Deluxe Cotai View Suite on the North Suite section on the 28th floor. I recommend anyone visiting take baggage service, cuz I suffered a brain fade incidentally and refused the service which was complimentary as well. It was quite a long walk to drag our luggages through the cash crunching Casinos but nonetheless, the sole feeling of being under a massive luxury property with such aesthetic value was amazing. Every square ft of the room was basking with richness. It was just to feel the experience of living in a luxury property I spent 15k for one…",40
I stayed at the Venetian in 2009 and thought it was the best hotel I had ever stayed at particularly the rooms.  I stayed there again in November 2017 and it is still that good.  I stayed with 5 other people this time who all agreed.  The rooms are fabulous - roomy and well appointed.  The pools are lovely the golf course is fun and the food options excellent.  And it is good value for money.,50
"One of the best hotels I have ever been to! Its a huge huge property and it will take you more than two days just to explore the hotel (assuming you don't even enter any of the shops). Wifi is free all over the property.   I was upgraded to bella suite (South wing) at no extra cost at the time of check in itself. The room was massive and had everything - Two huge TVs, apple tv, miracast, etc. to name a few useful additions. They have different pools (3) for the South wing - one of the pools is hot water pool and others are cold water.   The service was also excellent. Had no issues of any kind and didn't have to bother reception or housekeeping for anything. Checking out was a breeze and all I had to do was deposit the card at express check out machine.   Highly recommended!",50
"We were two families and visited Macao The Venetian in Oct 2017. Amazing hotel and fabulous huge rooms. we were given a proper family room next to each other. It was fabulous experience with tasty food and breakfast. Just chill out in the hotel itself. Ample things to do within the Hotel amazing view and neat, tidy and clean rooms with helpful staff.  Highly Recommended.",50
"this is the excellent Hotel in Macao, easy check in and check out access , friendly and helpful hotel people, nice Lobby for pictures, nice staff when My wife and I take the Gondola, I had Lunch and Dinner at Cafedeco at the Hotel with friendly waiters. Nice shopping place. my Wife and  I really enjoy 2 nights stay here, I book the hotel + Breakfast",50
The big room is amazing. Has great view. Can go to the casino anytime and when need to shop there are more than plenty of shops. Plentiful and spacious. Believe I also had an exam the following day. Katty perry concert was worth it.   the second time here was in April? 2016 Many pools,50
I haven't stayed nor in Venetian in Las Vegas nor in Macau. I had just walk around the hotel and shops. And it's really impressive. Especially  singers on the venetian boats on the inside river :) You can easily loose here:) Look as Venetia adored me:),50
"Quite an experience of staying in this hotel. HUGE is less word. One walks walks and walks to just to take a complete tour of the hotel. Since it has a casino, the external crowd is too much throughout the day",50
very good property  lavish interiors. Exterior are little worn out.  suites are very good. well maintained. good staff. too big to get lost. .  Expensive  but worth spending stayed two nights  well satisfied,50
"Venetian has so much to do tat you won’t line to step out of the Hotel if staying for 2 days in Macau. Venetian and Parisian (newly built resort) together have so much to offer. Venetian has a beautiful architecture replicated from its Italian counterpart. You can go for a Architectural tour if not interested in shopping and gambling. The best part is everything is inside or interconnected so you don’t have to worry for logistics if with family. We covered Gondola ride, Eiffel Tower, Qube kingdom, Water park, Venetian Shoppes, Parisian Shoppes, Parisian Theatre, etc. Venetian also offers are good variety of restaurants for every taste and choice. I being Indian preferred to feast at Golden Peacock and it was just too good. Venetian also has huge casino if you want to try out…",50
"Wow, wow, wow.  What an amazing resort. From the moment we got off the bus at the hotel we were greeted and assisted by the amazing staff.  Was a bit of a queue at check-in but we were ushered into a private room and checked in by other staff. On booking I had mentioned that my husband recently had had a birthday. They had taken it upon themselves to prepare a cake for him and allocate us a room on the Cotai side. Was great. The room was spectacular.  Huge. Separate sitting room from the bedroom and you could throw a party in the bathroom. Everything was clean. The pool area was amazing and there were several pools to chose from, including adults only.  Made for a very relaxing afternoon.  Was very hard to leave!!!!  Would highly recommend to anyone",50
"This hotel looks like it has been cloned from the venitian in Las Vegas. Everything is the same, Except the attention to to detail on the finish of the property is lacking compared to the original. The staff are friendly and the service is excellent, But unfortunately no matter how much money the Chinese throw at making a Vegas in the east it falls far short of the Vegas Strip. There is and will always be only one Las Vegas.",40
"Loved the way its setup - The rooms are well-kept and good in size. The ""Venetian"" experience is quite good too. Its a place full of colours, music and happiness. A huge variety of restaurants and so even being a vegetarian, I got ample options for all my meals!",50
"This was the second time that I visited The Venetian Macau. The first one was just to see the place as a tourist. This time, I stayed at the hotel with my mother in her 80s for my birthday. Despite being my second time, I still had more ooh's and ahh's than the first one. Indeed, this hotel was more than just a 5-star hotel.  I booked directly with the hotel through their official website. That was because during that time, there were no more rooms available through the booking sites. The hotel sent me an email with a VIP pass. When we arrived at the hotel, my mother and I were immediately ushered to the VIP Reception Hall where we had, literally, VIP treatment. We passed the long queue of guests checking in at the counter because we had our own receptionist at the reception…",50
"Elegant rooms, venetian themed shopping center. The rooms are spacious and of high quality. Nice showers and bathtubs for soaking. Very clean rooms and nice views from the upper floors. Rooms are quiet unless you are unlucky to have noisy neighbors. The breakfast buffet was okay and the lunch buffet was good. The hotel becomes very crowded during the day when many tour busses drop-off loads of people for the day. Nights are more quiet and enjoyable. Many, many shops and restaurants with a Venetian theme (of course).",40
"The hotel and rooms are luxurious and spacious We chose the Royal Deluxe Suite but in retrospect there was no difference to the Royal room we were in Las Vegas, the design is different (I think even less beautiful) The hotel's restaurants are good and not necessarily expensive, the Japanese restaurant is excellent And the restaurants offered to us during breakfast were excellent There is a shuttle from the ferry dock to the hotel The pool was very pleasant  There is no coffee machine in the room The way from the room to the pool was long - 300 meters Breakfast is not available in the room - Unless you order without using a meal included in the room rate",50
"This place is a casino, but it also has the greatest shopping setup I have ever experienced.  Take a look at the pictures - I think they ""say"" it best.  Doesn't it look like one is in Venice?  It even has a canal running through it and gondolas you can take a ride in.  And the boatman will sing to you - in Italian. The place has a false ceiling that simulates the real sky.  It even follows the time of day - bright ""sunshine"" in the afternoon that slowly fades into dusk and then night.  No kidding.  And no, it doesn't rain, so you don't need to bring your umbrella. There are about 600 shops in this place.  Its really shop-till-you-drop.",50
"Staying at the Venetian is convenient and the rooms are really really big. Because it's connected to a mall, it's great for shopping and food.  The only odd thing is having to traipse through the casino to reach the North Suites where my room was. Otherwise the room and bed was comfortable with nice toiletries. ",40
"It's a very famous hotels, marvelous hospitality but I think this hotel still needs an upgrade. You may find all things you need in this hotel. Make your days are really fast and lovely while you are staying there. All services have a very good standard even though you really need an effort to go from one place to another. I really concern about the old fashioned TV in the living room - it made me back to early 2000 era lol But, I really suggest to upgrade that old fashioned TV - and if possible make a room more digital since we are in the digital era :)",40
Loved the place...artificial sky was the best part ...casinos were biggest in the world....lift was so huge....................WiFi speed was mind-blowing.....view from room was so satisfying.......I would say it was best part of my Macao trip,50
"As the saying goes, first impression always last.  Upon arrival at the hotel reception, my family was brought to hotel's VIP lounge were all formalities were completed while we are waiting for our room to be ready. Hotel staff Ms. Russel Salangsa explained to us the hotel amenities and even guided us up to our Bella Suite. The hotel was huge and with lots of corridors and for first timers, a guide will always be helpful to find your way to assigned suite.  This trip to Macao was my 25th wedding anniversary and birthday gift to my wife.  I want to extend my gratitude to Mr. Leo Liu and the guest relations team for making extra effort in buying a dozen yellow roses for my wife and all assistance extended to my family.  Lastly, special thank you Mr. Joaquin Cruz, Guest Relations…",50
"We (4 adults, 3 children) only had one night here but didn't waste a minute. The rooms were perfect, the buffet dinner was great, (oh! the desserts !)  Walking around the public areas was a treat.  The décor is superb and really takes you to Venice.  The gondola ""captain"" was entertaining and fun, also had a great voice which bellowed out around the cavernous building.  I do have a couple of little negatives.  The pools were too hot.  Even the un-heated ones were like a warm bath.  Maybe some shade over one could help because on a really hot day, the pool is supposed to cool you off.  The other point is that this is such a huge property, it takes a long time to walk anywhere.  Our room was a very long walk from the lifts even though we requested something closer. Check-in was…",50
nice attraction good food very fascinating hotel good for relaxation and leisure the casino is wide enough to enjoy with friends and family the price is good enough as affordable for the quality of service and accommodation,50
"If you are planning to visit Macau, you must stay only in THE VENETIAN MACAO RESORT HOTEL. I would say whole of the Macau is summarized in this hotel. This is a hotel cum resort cum mall. You get everything you looking for in it.",50
"It’s Thursday and the place is already rocking towards the weekend. Fabulous casino floors, beautiful architecture, superb restaurants and a place one must visit to delight and challenge all the senses. Let the visuals speak for themselves.",40
"Stayed here for a couple of days recently. Hotel has great suites - very spacious. However, the check-in is not organized and is very slow. Our rooms were not ready by the specified check-in time. The hotel itself is a shopping-dining-entertainment hub, no need to step out anywhere. However, be warned, it gets super super crowded with bus loads of tourists coming in to visit the hotel.",40
"Its superb words cannot describe just lodge in there and u can see the different Room services is the best Event hall okay nice Food not muslim or kosher friendly but edible  The view is the most outstanding  Visit the pool in evening, u dont feel like in macau. It feels like in Paris",50
"I am very impressed and satisfied with this hotel. Stayed here for 3 days with my family. We booked 3 rooms. I was able to enjoy VIP lounge, so no queueing for reservation. The rooms are clean and spacious. The staffs very friendly.  I love their toiletries , smell very nice.  ",50
"Stay in a nice hotel and visit just Hotels.....Stayed in Ventian with family. The rooms were excellent to say the least. The Hotel iteslf is amazing with Gondola rides. If you can, stay in one of the Theme Hotel like the Ventian, Parisian, Studio City etc etc, stay there and visit the hotel....Except Gym and Pools, I think all facilities are free for all visitors. There are frequent bus service from Ventian West Entrance to most of the Good Hotels, including the ones in Taipa. U can hop on a bus and hop out anywhere on the pre determined route. No Charges !!!!!. Indian Vegetarians pl carry lots of MTR pre cooked meals and carry a steel utensil large enough to fit the packet of pre cooked meal. Just use the kettle, boil water and let the meal get hot. Tried it and they were a…",50
"Let me tell you that it is not 5 stars hotels that make up 5 stars staff & services , it is rather 5 stars staff & services that make up 5 stars hotels. This is exactly the case with Venetian resort! I am really really lost for words for the exceptional and outstanding service I and my friend received at Venetian resort! Credit is given where credit is due... I first want to thank so much and highly commend The management team at Venetian resort for making our experience truly the most memorable one of all! I thank Mr. Sherin, Head front office and Mr. Willy, front desk manager and Ms. Savana, front desk manager for their exceptional and outstanding service toward our experience at Macau in general and at Venetian resort in particular! 1- Upon our check-in, we were freely…",50
"This hotel is like dream come true for everybody. This is luxury suit hotel based on venetian theme. Luxury, canal, gondola ride, entertainment, worldclass cusine, shopping etc etc everything is there & famous venetian casino is like icyng on the cake.  Room- 5/5 Food- 5/5 staff-5/5 casino-5/5 amenities-5/5 extraordinary hotel & extraordinary service. For indian food there are two restaurants 1) cafe deco 2)golden peacock ",50
"Our trip was challenging and our stay at the Venetian was meant to be our treat on our way to China, however our timing wasn't the best, turning up the day after tropical cyclone Hato. The Venetian was without air-con, most of the rooms were without water, and the island was a mess with tree's literally torn out of the ground or snapped in half over the roads, cars in the harbor and massive buoys dragged out of the harbor and left in the middle of car parks.  When we finally got to our room, i could not describe our room in any other way, than palatial. Turned out, we were the only room with running hot water, and air-con working, karma.  The hotel is breath taking, staff are friendly and very helpful, and the shopping is pretty much indescribable, you can literally lose…",50
"Massive hotel - equating with that at Las Vegas  Run by Filipino- Russian- Ukrainian  front line staff and Indian folks in restaurant  Very long ques at reception, Gia Balang at the guest relations was helpful with elderly people - thank you Gia -rooms size good ,good views from back . Buffet restaurant expensive but well worth for the variety incl. unlimited lobsters etc( buy the voucher book equivalent offer) Went for a show at the Parisian next door - excellent  Ferry booking travel agency upstairs rubbish as had only 2 staff on duty for the whole resort ! Spend 70 minutes in Que just to get ferry tickets  The gondola Filipino service was good  Would stay again !",40
"We went to celebrate my parents anniversary and my word this hotel is an absolute beauty. It does not get any better than this. Casino inside the hotel is a great attraction and entry is strictly allowed only to 18 above. The Gondolla ride inside the hotel will also take your breath away. If you plan to go to Macau, just blindly book this hotel. Enjoy",50
"It shines as bright as it's Vegas counter part. Excellent service, super clean rooms and extremely courteous staff. A special shout out to Yukti Mehra made our stay even more special. Thanks again and see you next year.",50
"Have stayed at the Venetian in Las Vegas and loved it so much that we just had to stay in the Venetian in Macao. It is just as beautiful and grand as expected. The detail in the various canals, streets and squares is unbelievable. The room itself was huge and the bed so comfortable. The room is just so relaxing with a large seating area and a huge bathroom. Highly recommend staying here.   The hotel itself is fascinating. Although it was a bit too crowded during the day with your groups, the place was so silent in the evening when all the tour buses left for the day. Perfect time for a relaxing dinner in one of the many restaurants. We ate in the buffet, a Portuguese restaurant and a Chinese restaurant. All were top class. We didn't get to do the gondola ride as they only seemed…",50
"Really big & clean room that makes you feel like a king. An integrated hotel with casinos, shops and eateries, though costly. Shuttle buses and WiFi are provided. It took us around 20 mins to get to the senado square via cab too. Would definitely come back again.",50
"A fantastic experience with my wife as we stayed at the Venetian for a night. Well i think the most attractive sight seeing spot in the entire Taipa Island would be THE VENETIAN!! Don't know where to start from! Literally a jaw dropping experience the moment you enter the hotel. The art, the decor, the roof, the floor, the walls; everything was just opulent!! It's like a small city under one roof; you can be easily cut off from the outer world amidst the rich architecture & the multiple food, shopping, entertainment & casino options! Not to miss the hotel hopping as the Venetian is connected to the Four Seasons & to the Parisian. To talk about the Woww's & Not so woww's : Woww's- Smooth check inn, very hospitable staff, room service,  THE IN ROOM DINING- Honestly, with not very…",50
"Thw hotel is immaculate and rightin the centre of the strip. Huge casino, lots and lots of shops and the service was first class. Everyone appeared happy and pleased to help you. The hotel also provide free shuttles to various parts of Macau which was very handy. Would definately stay here again should we return to Macau",50
"When in Macau, its best to stay at The Venetian.  The rooms are big and clean.  Comfort at its best.  My kids love it.  Pure luxury and comfort.  Good location and offers a wide variety of shops.   Would definitely go back and recommend this hotel.  ",50
"If such a place as Venetian was anywhere else, it would have been a pleasure. In Macau, all one could see were people in thousands; so if crowd is not your thing, then skip this. The reception staff is rude and impolite and so is all other staff.   The rooms at Venetian are spectacular and perhaps the only comfort in a place which is otherwise so cold and unwelcoming to non south-east Asian visitors.   There is lots of see around here; however, popular selling points like the Gondola ride and dance shows inside the Venetian are useless. ",40
"A brilliant colossus! If you can be patient enough during checkin, you are in for a memorable stay! The suites are absolutely superb, and we got upgraded so made it that much better! The team here is very helpful and polite. Lots to do in and around the hotel so makes for a decent 3 full day stay. Food generally is expensive in this region so can’t single out the hotel. The House of dancing water at the city of dreams must not be missed!",50
"I went to Hong Kong on 24 Sept and stayed one night on 27 September 2017 in a Rialto Suite room in Venetian Resorts Macao to celebrate our 25th Anniversay. The hotel provided one way complimentary transfer from ferry pier to the hotel using Toyota Alphard. The hotel also gave me a special vip lounge for check in instead of the regular guest check in counter. Inside the vip check in room, we didn't have to stand while waiting for the check in process to be completed by the hotel staff. We just sat on the sofa and enjoyed free drinks and cakes and fruits and we used the computer to print some documents to a laser printer which was also provide for free.  The most amazing surprise was in the middle of the night, someone knocked at the door and when the door was opened, there's a…",50
"Took an overnight trip to Macau from Hong Kong to stay at the Venetian.  The hotel provides a bus right from the ferry terminal to the hotel.  The hotel is pretty much like the one in Las Vegas with the public areas, including the Grand Canal Shops and food court, being much larger.  Room (suite) layouts are the same as Vegas.  The hotel is clean and service was excellent, as expected.  No complaints whatsoever.",50
"I can honestly say that I do not enjoy massive hotels, moreso casino hotels where are too much people moving around. I prefer a more private, quite exclusive kind of a hotel. Where customer service is focused and not mass produced. Also, I am not a fan of over-the-top interior (too Marie Antoinette for my taste).   I enjoyed their outdoor Christmas presentation with a drink of their warm muddled red wine on a cold night.",40
"Once in a life time experience, This hotel have all suite rooms, and have good view of city.  most attractive is a casion part locaetd on very ground floor on lobby side. this is all day casino and minor are not allowed.  On ground floor / lobby floor theater are located and during evening time show is going on ( have to pay for entry ticket )",50
"This is definitely worth the stay. The room was really spacious, very comfortable beds, great view, not one but two big screen tv, have an area for working desk with lan cable internet access, great wifi almost everywhere with Venetian, Swimming pools. Not forgetting casinos which is always the big draw to lots of people. ",50
I have been here for technology business but this place it look awesome place and  don't know the time outdside . It look like Venice In Italy very much.But this place more cool and more brand for shopping,50
"One of the largest rooms i have ever seen for a standard room , opulent luxury rooms. everything is best in class & the hotels works like factory , checking guest in , checking them out via express lines . One of the best hotels i have seen having an awesome Indian food restaurant called "" Indian Peacock"". Stay just for the rooms & the shopping & the gondolas & the food if you get a good deal . It is Macau & sin city so beware as well",50
The hotel is very beautiful n the room is very spacious. I stay in a family suite. It has Teo queen size bed n a sofa bed. Can stay for a family of 6. Price is about $8000 Hong Kong dollar per nite.   It is very near a popular local estate. U can walk there to get good local food. The shopping is good but expensive. Macau is full of casino n pubs.,40
"It's a Palace, to be honest with so many rooms and floors, restaurants, casinos, theatres, shopping places and what not. Brillant to be here on a special occasion with dear family. Lovely place and the food is way too great.Will visit again.",50
"I went with my Family, very good service , excellent staff service, room service was great, very caring nature of all staff . Reception was great all the amenities was assumed,  We request you to please  keep a counter of Muslim Meal ",50
"Arrived at the hotel on 7th August-2017 with my wife and three kids. Although there was a long queue for Check-in but the staff were very efficient and my wife and kids didnt mind waiting and clicking a few pics in the grand main lobby. Since I had booked two rooms i had requested for inter connecting rooms but since the hotel was full i was given two rooms opposite each other, which wasn't too bad. The suites were super luxurious and the all of the staff very polite and courteous. Joey at the check-in was really great and was kind to have called us the next day for the change of the room, but since the suites were right opposite i didnt bother to change. The breakfast layout is very convenient and the f&b staff are amazing. The best casino in Macau. Great place to stay with…",50
"Wonderful experience! The Venetian Macau entertainment resort in its wholeness is simply amazing!! Free shuttle service from the ferry terminal to the hotel and the hotel's location is the best one in the heart of Macau's casinos movida. The resort's indoor & outdoor style is amazing: simply the Italian Venice we all know. The resort has got everything to enjoy an unforgettable weekend: beautiful hotel's structure with super spacious & luxury rooms, outdoor pools where to relax, restaurants for buffet breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner, amazing food court for all tastes, a shopping mall designed with Venice's theme & architecture and a stunning big casino. The resort offers visitors very good packages in terms of hotel accommodation + ticket's events or hotel accommodation +…",50
"One of the most memorable stay thus far.    Prior to the stay, Macau had the worst typhoon and I am worried that they are unable to receive us.  However, they not only assured me that most of their service are back to normal, they even kept me updated of the situation in Macau until I check into their hotel.  Once there, the staff went all the way out to make my stay comfortable and even gave me a surprise when they knew that I am having my 15th wedding anniversary during my stay period.  All the staff in my level address me by my name which is quite rare, if you travel frequently.",50
"A very happy stay, our Bella deluxe suite was amazing. Beds very comfy. Very spacious. Our room service was second to none very quick to respond to our requests the staff were brilliant. The casino is huge and what made our stay better was walking away with some money :). The resort itself is rather large and took a whole day to explore, couldn't recommend this hotel anymore",50
"Our family booked a night's stay at this hotel. We arrived an hour or so later than the usual check-in time. However, we were told that the room was not ready as there was a late check-out or something to that effect. Understandably, we were upset after a long and exhausting travel. However, it turned out to be a blessing as we were upgraded and offered the biggest suite at no extra cost. The suite was luxurious and comfy (it was twice the size of our apartment!). The concierge and staff were also courteous and politely warm. Highly recommended.",50
"Love this hotel in Macau! While it's gigantic and you can easily get lost, the entertainment and casino makes up for it. the free shuttle from the ferry is super convenient and the rooms are very spacious. The service was good although during some peak hours, it was very busy in the lobby with groups of tourists.  I also enjoyed the location near House of Dancing Water for the evening show and the large casino with all the different games.",50
"Very nicely decorated hotel and shopping centre where linked with Four Season till Parisian, and it is also connected by a bridge at Four Season Hotel to opposite Sands Cotai Centre.. It will spend you whole day just for shopping itself, shop until you drop for branded stuff.. A grand canal in the middle of the building give shopper an extraordinary shopping experience. ",50
"Absolute must see. You cannot explain, you cannot express it on pictures, you have to see it to understand what is possible. Walking inside the hotel you can easily be mistaken that you are not outside. The sky is blue with forming clouds, but it is painted, the gondolas are floating on the channel... You can come as visitor only, but you will be among the crowds. It os better to enjoy the hotel as a guest. It is amazing it is stunning, it is unbelievable!",50
"My husband and I went to Macau for the long weekend (Sat-Mon) and stayed at The Venetian. It was just a few days after that disastrous typhoon Hato had hit Macau and Hong Kong, but fortunately, the hotel was already up and running during our visit. Not 100% yet, but the staff were very nice and friendly and made sure our stay was as perfect as possible, from check in to check out. Special thanks to Kimmy at the reception, who checked us in (and out as well) with a smile; Rose at the Concierge, who was so nice in helping us book our ferry tickets to Hong Kong; and I cannot forget to mention Eli, the staff at the West Lobby, whom when he saw me looking a bit lost, didn't just show me the directions going to Lord Stow's Cafe (opposite McSorley's), but patiently walked with me to…",50
"World class facilities, attractions and shopping elevate the experience!  Rooms are well laid out and appointed!  Staff is friendly and capable.  Lots of good dining options.  Linked with other great Sands properties.  Top destination in Macau!  Well worth a visit.",50
"I was staying in HongKong and went to Macau for a day. The Venetian blew my mind with the amazing architecture, art and SHOPPING! There were great deals and the whole experience of walking under the false sky ceiling was beautiful. We also did the Gandola right which was pitch-perfect with an Italian guy singing love songs to us. It was all out of a dream. Please do visit. The only odd thing is that I saw a little Chinese baby pee in the artificial lake. (Eww.)",40
"Casino hotels are expected to be opulent and The Venetian in Macau is no exception. No expense was spared to create grandeur to the highest level that never fails to amaze guests and visitors alike. There are also numerous restaurants that cater to varying budgets, though even McDonald's here is much pricier compared to the ones outside the hotel. Our 70-sqm (regular) room was a contiguous bedroom-living room that makes the room look much bigger. The big bathroom complements the size of the room. Over-all, it is an ideal refuge for staycation or simply lounging around after a tiring day in Macau (or in the casino). What I thought was a letdown, however, were the toiletries. I think more well-known brands would be more appropriate for this property. However, I  still very much…",50
"Got the opportunity to travel this great city of Macau on 24th Aug'17.  Stayed there in the Venetian Grand Macau Resort for 3 nights and 4 days.  Unfortunately, the time when the trip was planned, the Macau got affected with Typhoon and that too with a high intensity of 10. The Whole city was severly affected and trees got fallen on the road.  We reached on the very next day the typhoon passed.  Check in was smooth. Our Stay was near South Lobby. The Hotel is magnificent & Grand. No words can describe it easily. All the Hotel rooms are suite rooms. Very big ! Nicely Maintained ! The Canal on the Level 2 is amazing. Artificial Sky roof is also very cool. Over all a very satisfying stay.  ",50
It amazing that it's almost exactly duplicate the Venice canal inside the Hotel at second level: You can even hire a gondola and the boatman will rowing the boat and singing for you. It make you feel like you are in Venice.,50
"I have no words for this hotel... it's just an Excellent Hotel in Macau... any person visiting has to compulsorily go to Venetian Macau... because this is God Father of all the Hotels in Macau... It has a Gondola Ride like in Venice... Spas... Pools... Shopping Complex... Light and Fountain Show... and the Architecture of this building and the Interior is just OH MY GOD... just awesome experience... 3 days are also less to explore this hotel... because first of all, it takes a day of time to memorise the paths inside the hotel to each and every place... but it's a must visit when in Macau...",50
"Nice weekend stay. The hotel has everything you need, from food to entertainment. It also has a replica of the canals for the tourists to enjoy. The hotel rooms are very good and have a great view to the Cotai Strip. The casino is a lot of fun too.",40
Indian food they serve is awesome the variety you find over there is lovely or I can say you will hardly find in India Desserts are so delicious. We wish to come again with family and friends and to have all meals there only,50
"The Venetian Macau Hotel has everything one desires on a holiday. The rooms are spacious and luxurious,with every possible facility. The food is excellent,with generous and helpful services. There is a shopping arcade within the hotel with plenty to shop around and Gandola rides. The Hotel boasts of one of the largest Casino of the City. Overall ,a place to relax and enjoy.",50
"Room was the biggest room I've ever had and the price was under $200 in May. The lobby, shopping mall, pool, kid playground were the biggest among hotels I've been. It was real quality time with my family. Even makes me think of spending entire vacation only in Venetian hotel next time. It was all worth my money spent in the hotel.",50
"This hotel very beautiful, the room are large. This hotel has casiono and some store at 1st floor, food court and some store at 2nd floor. Many kinds of food you can try at food court. At this hotel has travel agent for booking city tour and tickets. The interior of this hotel decorated in Venetian style. Near hotel has pedestrian street for any kind of foods, you can walk about 10 minutes to go there from hotel. This hotel near from airport. If you go to Macau by ferry, has a shuttle bus from halbour to hotel.",50
"My family and I stayed in The Venetian a little over a year ago now, and just thought I should write something as it has left an impression that I will never forget. (I think about it everyday still) During our stay at this beautiful hotel/casino/restaurant/shopping centre, we were blown away by the exceptional suites and shops that are scattered throughout the humongous casino. The room we were given was a spacious suite that included an entertainment room just away from our beds and a bathroom that was fit for a king. Apart from the 30 minute wait at the counter to check in (I understand they are very busy with many people staying there) the stay was phenomenal, and as a result I will be visiting again in the near future. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BEAUTIFUL PALACE!!!!",40
"We went there for our 1st marriage anniversary and I inform the hotel by email that we will arrive by 12:30pm to make everything prepared, but unfortunly nothing was prepared (Angela-check in staff said), then she said the housekeeping will take around 30 min to make the rome up for us, and we decided to have a lunch after long-way trip from Guangzhou until they finish, Angela told us that she will upgrade us to better room which is also not correct because the room was the same as the one I booked (Suite with city views) and nothing was upgraded. When we went back to the room, the housekeeping finished the simple decoration and it was very nice, and they kindly send us a very nice cake for our celebrating . - In general the hotel was very good and we really enjoy everything…",40
"Venetian Macau is an absolutely awesome property and gives you an out of the world experience. Rooms and bathrooms are excellent and well equipped. Its corridors and lobbies are just superb and immensely decorated in typical Venetian style. Its canal shopping area is extremely beautiful. Cafe Deco, its main restaurant is very good and has separate counter for Indian dishes. Indians can also enjoy Indian dishes at Golden Peacock restaurant. Venetian's casino is world's biggest and worth seeing. The hotel houses many high end shops in its mall which is well connected to Perisian and Sand's mall. Overall a superb property.",50
"As are most of the Hotels in Macau, the Venetian is a huge and vast property. The rooms are enormous and great value for what you pay- you can have a party in the bathroom area, such is the size. However, like most vast hotels, there is no ambiance and warmth in the entire place. I was there for a 3 day conference and only lasted 2 days- had to get out of the place. You literally need a bus to get form one side to the other- if you wanted to get to the pool area, pack a lunch with you, because it will take you 15 minutes to walk the convoluted path going up and down lifts to certain floors, left and right etc. And be careful in that they as most hotels, take your credit card imprint on check in, but on check out will tell you that it will take 2-3 weeks for the deposit to be…",40
"The room was very nice. The picture in the description is very accurate. The room is big with an added on TV Lounge. The bathroom is spacious and very luxurious. The casinos are conveniently located within the hotel. Its a little pricey, but worth the money I paid.",50
"The rooms are spacious and very well done with all amenities in place. The hotel however is huge and often crowded. Sometimes, it seems you're staying in a shopping mall with a large casino thrown in. Actually they have 4 casinos, but all are co-located next to each other and it all seems like one big casino. The shopping arcade is huge and tries to create a faux venice feel (though it falls short, if you've been to Venice!). I didn't find any good eating options within the food court, though a couple of restaurants seemed fine. The breakfast was okay (nothing great) but be early to avoid the crowds! Check-out is a breeze (just drop the room card in a drop box and walk out though check-in can be painful (if a group arrives, and there are plenty), you might take an hour. The free…",50
Definitely book a suite. They are beautiful and very well appointed for two people to share. The staff everywhere in this hotel are lovely and helpful which is necessary as it is HUGE. The breakfast is fantastic. Make sure you eat at Portofino. Food and service divine and you can eat outside which is great as the air conditioning inside the building is frigid. Also make sure you walk out and visit the Portuguese area.,50
"The hotel is huge, lots of walking around to get to the rooms and pool, however all worth it as the rooms are amazing. Very large comfortable beds, seperate living area and huge bathroom. Had a fantastic view over the strip. Staff very friendly and helpful, got lost a couple of times around the complex but staff were so generous to point us in the right direction. Also a shoppers paradise as attached is the grand canal shoppes. ",50
"What an amazing hotel/ shopping mall/ casino/ resort! This hotel is connected to the Parisian, Four Season, the Plaza and several others. Be prepared to never need to leave the building for ANYTHING! This is an amazing tourist spot and is filled with non stop traffic. Make sure you take your camera! ",50
This hotel is out of this world - if it can be called a hotel at all as the scale of the complex is mind boggling. We opted for a partial view standard room and were not disappointed - we looked out over the Parisian next door and the room was the largest we have ever had. Very well furnished and clean throughout. The general setting of the public spaces are unbelievable - set up like the streets of Venice it feels like a Hollywood film set and staff make you feel like the celebrities. We looked around the casino but most of the tables were too high stakes for us. There were plenty of in-house eateries and bars to suit all tastes. However the day we wanted to go to Old Macao we had to use another hotel shuttle as Venetian didnt offer that service. Its quite far into the old…,50
"One of the best hotel in Macau.  It is so big. Amazing because the roof is painted with a beautiful blue sky and a dusting of clouds. There are casino, restaurant, shopping archades selling souvenirs, garments and many other. For me it is more like an indoor theme park. Love the gondola ride while entertained by the gondolier singing. ",40
"The Venetian rooms are big and spacious. The room has 2 Queen Beds with a separate sitting area. We love it. The hotel is really big with many facilities and amenities. In the hotel, there is a huge shopping arcade, plenty of restaurants, a big food court, and of course the casino. Would love to come back again.",40
"My family of our four (children 15 and 10) stayed in a Bella Suite for two nights and it was extremely comfortable with great amenities. The room was a great size with more than enough space for all of us and having booked more than 14 days in advance to receive a 25% discount, was quite affordable.  The downside to the hotel though is that outside of the room it feels like you are staying in a shopping mall! Yes there is a great pool area and a separate play area for the kids (at a cost though), but everything else is either the casino or shops. I appreciate that to an extent that this is what Macau is about but some of the usual atmosphere at a high class hotel was missing for us.",40
a mini city in itself and very overwhelming in scale. people are teeming all over the place. first look you feel as to where you have arrived? then it starts to unfold itself. amazing vision and attention to detail.every possible conceivable holiday item has been put in place.the check in process is painfully slow.will take about two hours to get a room.The restaurant serving complimentary breakfast is very average and the indian restaurant really good.but can you handle the crowd?they need to put seatings in the  labyrnty of corridors.the staff too needs English lessons.most of them have very rudimentary understanding of English.,40
"went for family vacation. The rooms are luxurious, grand spacious and cosy comfortable. More of a commercial resort with great food variety in food court, shopping arenas, Gondola rides, swimming pools, kids play zone and off course magnificent casino. We stayed for 3 days and still felt somethings were still left (for 2nd visit). Such huge property so the only disadvantage is you will not get a prompt room service. The reception staff was cordial.",50
availed complimentry bus service provided by hotel venetian after getting down from ferry at Taipa ferry terminal. Hotel is gigantic and requires minimum a day to explore each and every facility of hotel. Royal suite was quite comfortable,50
"This is one of the best hotel, infact more than the hotel that is more like an indoor theme park the rooms are super big and well equipped. Two LCD screens, a huge bathroom and great inroom dining experience. Multiple  swimming pools and activities for kids as well.",50
"Stayed for a nice to experience a vegas in macau, this place have everything you need, from choices for restaurants, shopping, casino and so on. Its big that i was a bit lost. Has a chance to watch Cirque Du Soleil Zaia during the first Visit,   this hotel is one of the best in macau. ",50
"The hotel is an excellent centrally located  property . The rooms are very comfortable and the hotels amenities and services are excellent . So many restaurants with Indian peacock Indian restaurant (michel star ) is a standout .The shopping arcades and gondolas and the shows are excellent. It is near to almost all star attractions of Macau and the hotel shuttle service is fast ,efficient  and money saver . Overall really a 5 star .",50
"The name Canton, attracted my husband and l to look for this restaurant, within the Venetian Complex, at Taipa, Macau. So we made appointment and then the search began within the Casino Maze to find it. After seeking directions from 3 security staff, we eventually located it. These are the good and bad points below.  GOOD POINTS:  1. The service was excellent, including being greeted by staff at the door.  2. The decoration, paintings and lay out of the restaurant was quite snappy with a nice aroma in the atmosphere.  3. Look for Angel, she is the lady who is very experienced, helpful and knows what to do.  4. They have private enclosed booths, that can take 6 people, for this private gatherings.  BAD POINTS:  1. Location was bad, tucked away at one corner of a massive Casino…",40
Absolutely everything is steeped in grandeur about this place and does not need me to write much. It has to be experienced in life once but can they improve their check in process. Imagine waiting for 25 minutes when you have paid 2000 plus hkd for a night ,40
"We went to Macau first and then HK. We decided to stay at the Venetian. Indeed, the hotel is a Grande one. The room is very spacious and comfortable. We really liked it. Compared to the price we have paid, this is a very bargaining.   What we were not comfortable, however, is the long queue at check in. Indeed, this one is a minus to what we should rate the hotel 'Excellent'.  Avoid weekend otherwise you will be overwhelmed with ""Red Armies"". It is very very crowded.",40
"We stayed for 1 night its a nice experience reception looks great it's a different world we stayed in royal suite which is excellent view from our room was good.Swimming pools are good.Hotel is huge we have to walk a lot it has theatres,shopping ,food plaza,pickup & drop from ferry .",50
"The Venetian is truly Luxurious. Huge Rooms and and very Huge Property, at times you feel lost. The Resort has got everything you want Mall, Casino you name it. Rooms Service is good and it is nust stay if you visit Macau.",50
"We spend two night in Venetian and thoroughly enjoyed the property. You can visit Casino @ Venetian, also enjoy Indian Food @ Golden Peacock. The best part of this hotel is that, they have express checkout facility available @ the Ground Floor. You just go there and handover the key. Thats it... (inform incase you have used the minibar).",50
"We spent a couple of hours in this hotel taking in the various sights. The shopping precinct is straight out of Venice. So adorable! The shops are  built around canals  complete with gondolas and gondoliers singing ""that's amore' "". It was a fabulous experience and the shopping kept our 3 grown up children happy!! Did I mention the roof is painted with a beautiful blue sky and a dusting of clouds. If you haven't been to Vegas it's definitely worth a look and if you have been to vegas it's still worth a look! 😊",50
"The luxury of this megastructure is really amazing. The floors, the furniture, the fabrics, the pool. Staff very kind and attentive. Amazing work of cleaners.Really its gonna blow your mind.Congratulations to this diamond hotel/resort/casino",50
"You will not beleive where you have reached if you have not been to any venetian property before. Its a complete treat for eyes and you will feel like you have reached heaven. Connectivity to Perisian and In House Mall is awesome. Casino is Huge with multiple tables of all sorts. Shops in Malls, Food Court, In house Gandola Ride, Ice and snow amusement part....Movie theatre - you name it and you will find it in house. Must be there for atleast 3 nights, I was there for 2 but couldn't complete all of it. Lastly - Hospitality by people working there cannot be undone, Highly appreciate the generosity and support for visitors.",50
"Venetian is not just a resort but also a tourist spot with casinos and shops within its complex. It is always super crowded.  Our check in experience was pathetic to say the least. Even though they have multiple counters, they were awfully slow and we were waiting for 1.5 hours in the queue. Moreover they seemed to be partial to a few local patrons (the lady manning the queue told us they were VIP's) and they were put ahead of all of us in the queue annoying all of us further.  The room was simply fabulous !! It was luxurious and had a great view. Room service was a great experience as well.  We loved the other attractions in the hotel - casinos, gondola ride and  luxury shops. ",40
"Large rooms, spacious bathrooms.... loved the room!! staff could have been friendlier..... we were 5 minutes late for breakfast and they wouldn't let us take a coffee & toast!!! Close to the sea and short distance from the touristy sights...",50
"I arrived at this hotel at 6 PM, I thought I will get in a long line for checking in, but it turns out just a few people queuing. They have 4-5 check in opened so we will not need to wait so long. The room is stunning with 70 square meters space. This hotel is connected to mall, casino, and also to Parisian. If you want to go someplace else, they provide buses for free. I love this hotel, it is perfect for us, and it is perfect for our anniversary too.",50
"The hotel is huge with shops at L-3, and biggest casino. Rooms are big too with separate living room and king size bed and big bathroom with tub. Amenities in room are great. Hotel staff is helpful. Staff at check in desk was good and explained all details about hotel. It is connected to Parisian hotel, four seasons, etc.  Eiffel Tower at Parisian is a great sight at night. Ice world at Venetian is also good for kids. There are shows also which are good. They have buses from-to ferry pier.  We loved and enjoyed our stay here. Be ready to walk ""a lot"".",50
This is the second time we stayed in this resort in 4 years. We stayed for 3 nights this time. Check in time takes ages as usual. People like to line up(wait) as a habit? The room is the same roomy and spacious with a good view(thats why we came back). Decoration showed a little bit aged. Less crowded as before but tourists seems same excited when visit. I think the food court improves a lot form before about food choice and price. The exhibition and convention area is huge  and less occupied-less show? Under strong competition with ongoing opening of new hotels/resorts in the same area. A good thing to us as consumers.,40
"First, the bads: - checking in is a real hassle, took 1 hour to check in on a Thursday afternoon at 3PM on a non-holiday period - no porter will help you manage your luggage to your room, all self service - if you're bringing a child, you will have to walk extra long to reach your hotel suite, as they barred the whole section of first floor with casino, and so you will have to go to level 3 (with all your luggage) to reach your hotel suite - breakfast sucks with limited variety - resort is huge, so expect to walk a lot, unless your only destination is the casino - crowded everywhere, anytime  And... the only good thing: The room is wow!  Huge, extravagant, it is exactly as the photos you see in the promotional materials.  They have somehow upgraded their rooms, so we didn't get…",40
"Great reception. Staff offers candy and waters during check-in queue. Luggages delivered within 20 minutes after check-in.   The hotel is so big because it is so integrated within the Venetian Mall.  The hotel itself still looks elegant after more than a decade opening although some details in the bathroom looks to be worn out.  TIP: If you would like to take pictures of the famous indoor canals, do it early in the morning prior to opening time. You will have your own ""private like"" canal view rather than congested crowded mall during business hours.  Be aware from time to time, some individual strangers will offer you currency exchange in the mall or casino area. ",50
This is just not a hotel only but also a Shopping Mall all combined into one. Its such a huge Hotel that you can get lost...Rooms comes with a sofa cum bed and a separate sitting area. Cafe Deco is great place to have your Breakfast...This hotel has the famous Gandola ride too.Hotel provides free shuttle bus to the Ferry Terminals..Its Casino is also huge and nice.Would recommend to stay there atleast once..,50
"We stayed here to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday and it certainly did not disappoint! The service was fantastic, the staff in the indian restaurant and Italian bar deserve a special mention for going out of their way to make our stay perfect. Awesome setting and value for money - would definitely come back! Only downside was the gym being out of action, however to be expected given time of year.",50
"it's huge. unbelievable. a town within a town. it's got everything bundled in it. well appointed spacious n fantastic rooms,  restaurants from all over the world, shopping, n the plaza beneath the artificial sky.......don't miss staying here...",50
"We have stayed in Belle suite from 13th to 16th June. We were awstruck by hotel standards, They have given importance to very minute details. The room and other hotel areas were very clean. You will have a Royal  impression of the hotel. On 3rd level a massive shopping mall is located. They have a 18 hole golf course on 5th level. There are plenty dining options too. The Golden Peacock Restaurant is on the lobby floor located near the west entrance of hotel. It was a memorable experience for us.",50
"Here for business trip for 3 days and 2 nigths with my colleagues. From ferry boat Cotai Jet the shuttle Bus is waiting outside and no hussle at all.  Upon arriving the hotel i was so surprised, the hotel so huge and everything are there already. Shopping, Casino, restaurants, Attraction and connected to other hotels. Service was excellent, The hotel was so clean and i will be back again here soon",50
"As hinted in other reviews and by those who've visited earlier, the hotel is massive. Over 3000 rooms along with a mall that encircles the property at two levels, events/ shows taking place in banquet rooms in one corner and a large casino floor in the centre.  It took a while for us to get our bearings but once settled it was easy. There are very few negatives to highlight as the hotel works like a well oiled machine, however increased vegetarian options would be a good idea.  Parts of the mall gets crowded at times as people from other hotels visit the Venetian en masse.   Large swimming pools are a must visit and one of them is heated. Do visit the shows/ events being promoted in and around the hotel.   A special mention goes to Yukti Mehra at the reception who helped us find…",50
"Venetian lives upto its reputation. It is a huge hotel with a grand shopping arcade within its premises. Its Casino is also very good. But the only thing missing was some extravagant free show in lobby area, like its neighbour The Galaxy. No doubt Venetian is a great hotel but I would personally recommend to stay at The Galaxy as it is comparatively a new property, thus is even more grand than Venetian. Note: If you are looking for Indian food , go for The Great Peacock restaurant inside Venetian, near its South Lobby.",40
Celebrated our 3rd year anniversary at Venetian. The Cotai View Royal Deluxe Room was superb with excellent service. The room was new and spacious.  The location of Venetian was good and transportation of venetian was very easy with the shuttle bus.  Would love staying there again!,50
I went with my family and I must say it's a worth visiting place...huge hotel and shopping area with luxury suites...will go again... Service is excellent in all the way...rooms are spacious and full of all amenities..,50
"I stayed here with my girlfriend for two nights in early December 2016. We stayed in one of the suites with a split level. You truly feel like you're indulging whilst staying here. I have been to Vegas as well, and these rooms and facilities are no different. First class all the way. With many restaurants and shops to explore, you may never leave the hotel! We did venture out into Macao, albeit too briefly, and it's old world charm was calming compared to hustle of Hong Kong. Would love to go back again to spend more time here for sure.",50
"We were fortunate enough to stay in the Rialta suite...big room...very comfortable and clean. We were able to check in and found the check in procedure not as terrible as others described. We did have to wait an hour for our room but the room was clean, as was the pool(s) and play area for the kids. We arrived on a Tuesday and the hotel was moderately busy...by the time we left on Thursday it was a zoo. Hotel transportation in/around Macau is excellent.",40
The Venetian Macao Resort Hotel is nice and the suite is spacious. Clean and good amenities. The location of the hotel is very central and shopping is very convenient. Lots of restaurants to select from. Good family hotel and indoor playground for children.,50
"The best place for shopping and restaurant in Macau.  Also, the architecture of this hotel is everything, you just can't get enough of it. and it has an indian restaurant which serve amazing food which i highly recommend",50
"Spent 2 very comfortable nights in this luxurious hotel/resort.  We have seldom experienced such space and classy ambience in similar hotels!  A good choice for families with kids, as the Festiva Food Court on Level 3 offers a wide selection and reasonably-priced dining option for everybody.  ",50
"We went here to play a little but mostly check what the rave was all about. If you want to go shopping then this is the place for you. Theres many shops here and thats all there is really to do. The food court had a good amount of selections and the food was pretty good. We enjoyed our meals. But as far as activities go, there was much to do at all. We expected more for such great reviews. We did not sleep at the hotel, so we cant say about the rooms or hotel experience.",40
"Its a vast property with the grandeur of a palace..rooms are luxurious, spacious and lovely with all the modern amenities. Its the best place to stay in Macao as it has everything from various restaurants, shopping, food court and a large casino. Its a world in itself. The only drawback is you may get lost several times if you dont have a map.",50
"I stayed In this magnificent hotel in Macao in 2014. I got a huge discount on offer in TripAdvisor and thoroughly enjoyed. It's huge. There is a Venetian canal on the third floor where you can have a nice boat ride. A golf course, a mall, big food court - biggest casino- you name it and they got it. The room was excellent. Huge windows on one side. Latest luxuries along with stylish but old world charm. The decor isn't modern but I loved this. The floor is separated into two levels. Suited me. The lower section seems like a business or working section. The upper one is more suited for sleeping. Bathroom was extremely comfortable- specially so when you come from hongkong where space is at premium. There are two main sections of the building. And it's very very possible to get…",40
"I stayed here with my family for 2 nights. This is just wow!   Checkin was smooth with refreshing drink. we landed here on weekdays so not much rush. Got a upgrade to Bella Deluxe Suite which was just huge room.   Since we booked for 2 nights, we got the Ice World Package which consists  -One-way Cotai Water Jet Cotai Class tickets -Ice World tickets  -Gondola Ride -Plush Toy   Food court has many eateries to satisfy your taste buds. and casino for gamblers.   Overall unforgettable stay, quality family time and real good time.   super like and 5 star to The Venetian Macao",50
"What I like most about this hotel is that it's all-in-one shopping and accommodation. The rooms are spacious and clean although a bit expensive if you're traveling on a budget.   We got to ride the gondola here, and the our gondolier was a nice young man, who has a good singing voice. Shopping is nice in The Venetian Macao if your budget is up for it. Otherwise, go to Senado Square for your pasalubong.   All the staff we encountered were very nice, particularly that man (a Filipino), who sold water to my niece.",40
"The hotel was the only one which could offer my family of four a room during my stay in Macau. When i saw the room, it was much bigger than as seen in the photos. My room was on the higher floors and the views are amazing. All the items in the hotel looks classy and beds are comfortable. i would say the hotel is meticulous in their choice of the furniture and fittings in the room. However one little tiny weakness of the hotel is that the first floor is the casino and if you are traveling with kids then you will have to walked quite a distance from the check in counter to the hotel lift lobby. The Venetian mall is humongous and you can get lost easily. Food are generally nice at the food street and portion is big. Kids have a big place to roam around and there is also a play area…",40
"well  Great resort , very spacy and clean room , nice pools with hot jacuzzi . Mini golf , great view from rooms , free transport around resorts and to airport and ferry , well decorated Mall attached too  Staff well trained and friendly  Def recommended and would like to come back again  ",50
"No words can express the experience you will have if you visit this property....You can rename it as a small city ..Save your steps if you want to explore venetian...Something is there for everyone..Rooms are huge ,staff very friendly and helpful room service up to the mark....You have multi cuisine food court inside with in house restaurants serving great indian food be it veg or non veg... If you are looking for luxury venetian macau is the place to be.  ",50
"The Venetian Macao is really pricey but it really is worth the money. If you go to Macau, this should be your first choice. My family and I really enjoyed the cozy place.. I will definitely come back.",50
So many interesting things within the Hotel. The Gondola ride while a little pricey is fun with the songs and humor. The skyline effect is beautiful and authentic. Many Shopping and Food options. The bus ferry services and connectivity is added benefit.,40
"Huge rooms , but they could improve on the sofa beds, the mattress is rather thin and bouncy. Food is expensive within the hotel grounds or i should say the whole cotai area. Transportation is convenient. They have lots of free shuttle buses to travel around the area and even to border gate -gateway to Zhuhai Overall good stay and kids loved it",50
Venetian hotel is a good place to visit n stay. Rooms are big and clean . Children do enjoy over there. Shopping experience was good. There are quite few activities for children and they do enjoy it. 2 indian restaurants are there so no problem of indian food. I ll definetly recommend other indians to visit venetian. ,50
"We stayed at The Venetian Macau earlier this month and we had a fantastic time all round. The staff were lovely and attentive, we even received a room upgrade on our arrival by Nick at the front desk!  We will definitely be back  Thank you! ",50
I am in trouble Britain's long. I've been travelling around a blow but this is the first hotel that is so grand that it is virtually impossible to visit the entire hotel in even four days. We took Royal Suite we are couple with the child the suite was so huge that it had two rooms and a huge washroom with three compartments. Also the bedroom had to smart televisions to keep everybody engaged but would surely it is impossible to stay in room as you come in the night just for sleeping. Even if you start working from 6 AM in the morning till 1 AM in the night it's hard to even cover up the entire Venetian property as you'll be involved in doing so many activities.  I would also recommend that shopping looks expensive here but if you compare it when Singapore or Hong Kong it is	is…,50
"Sadly we only stayed at the hotel for one night, you could easily spend a few days here just exploring the hotel. You can access the Parisian hotel which attached via a shopping mall.  You can find the shuttle bus easily from the ferry terminal (ferry 45 minutes from Hong Kong).  There was a slight queue at reception, but this is because the staff have to explain to you how to get to your room, the hotel is that big! All the rooms are suites, and the suite we had was great. Biggest I have stayed in. Only let downs were the smell of cigarette smoke in some of the communal areas, and the onsite Italian restaurant not letting us in for the all you can eat lunch (even though we were there 20 minutes before closing)",50
"A simple word to say AMAZING & PERFECT. You will just find everything is absolutely PERFECT & GREAT. Bedroom is spacious, matrass is so comfortable, extra pillow is also available And even the sofa is comfort to sleep in. The area of hotel Is huge since you can also walk around the shops and also casino to try your luck. Thanks for this wonderful service. Will definately stay here again should i come t Macau. ",50
"Before I write the main points for this resort- A word of caution. You may get lost in this huge property so make sure to make yourself familiar with layout and map. One of the biggest resort seen by me in so many years of travel and definitely one of the finest. Great rooms, excellent food, lot of shopping places and Gondola ride in case you missed in Venice (which we had missed). If you are a casino fan- no better place to be (but then why waste money on paying so much for rooms and facilities).  Recommended to stay not less than 3 nights if you want to explore it well.  Avoid unnecessary local sightseeing as it is ordinary at the best (except evening water show and bungee jumping (strictly for those with deep pockets as it costs nearly 350 USD per person).",50
"stayed here for two nights and this was amongst the best stays i ever had. check in was quick. they brief you every aspect of the hotel with patience and resolve all your queries even on call. Once you have logged in your info with them one is never required to repeat the room details or personal details. rooms are big and spacious. its luxury spot on. the property is very big and even two days were less. they also host various events. like when we ere there, dreamworks ice world was there and we thoroughly enjoyed it. with so many brands for shopping and food we never ever stepped out of hotel except visiting other connected hotels which are holiday inn, parisian and four seasons. the indian hotel's food is amazing. better than some places in India. Buffet breakfast was so so..…",50
"My husband and I had a lovely trip in Macau!  We were celebrating our Easter and definately enjoyed our time here.  The Venetian Macau Resort Hotel was clearly the biggest hotel in Macau.   I read some terrible reviews about this hotel but me and husband been planed to coming in, so here we are.  Actually, the hotel's design was amazing with great interior that are imagined to look like an open street in heaven...  It was absulotely huge hotel  Perfect casino location  There were also Gondola in both inside and outside of the hotel. The gondola ride were so romantic  I would definately like to stay again..",40
"All the rooms are modifies suites with a spacious bedroom & living room areas. The property is built world class with casinos (one of the largest in the world & largest in Macau), gondola rides, huge food court etc. The bathroom is also a small room with ample space. There is separate shower cubicle, bath tub area & WC area. The room service is good and could be better. Overall we had a memorable stay there and can very well recommend this hotel. Another important amenity here is the free ac bus service to most other hotels, ferry point, airport etc which makes it very convenient to commute & see places in Macau.",50
"We had a wonderful four-day family vacation staying at The Venetian Macao last week. We chose their Bella Suite for us four precisely because it allowed 4-person occupancy as opposed to a maximum of three in most hotels. The room was spacious and modern and they only charged a MOP 250 fee for each additional person.  In terms of service, our initial experience wasn't too pleasant. We were shocked that our non-smoking Bella Suite had smoke odor in the living room area and there were only two pairs of everything instead of four that we paid for but we were soon relieved with a few calls to the front desk and after we kept the AC on to attenuate the smell.  What we liked about our guest room was that it was spacious, clean and newly refurbished; while toiletries and towels were…",50
"If you have difficulty of walking , dont consider staying in this hotel, because you need to walk very far just to get to your room especially you are under 21 years old or with kids. The hotel room lobby is located in the middle of the shoppes.   The Swimming pool is also far from the main building.  The hotel room is huge and very nice, however the aircon is centralised even though there is an aircon switch.  I was sleeping in a very cold room.😣",50
"A great place to experience Luxury!! All the rooms in the hotel are suites and very well done and maintained.... The hotel is VERY VERY BIG and is built around a huge mall...and of course the CASINO's!! Frankly... all hotels are close to each other...so it does not matter where you stay - you can visit them all!! Note that this hotel is in the new area of Macau called Taipa Island!!! The sad part was the Breakfast!!! for a hotel boasting of such luxury, it could have been far better!!",40
The best hotel room Ive ever stayed in!  The room was so spacious with a very large bathroom. The entrance was grand and royal.  Interior was amazing.  I think the hotel has 7 Pools and a very large golf course  If you love shopping then this place is great for you! The hotel itself was so big we was given a map that had 3 floors it almost felt like a map to a themepark/shopping mall..  The food court was lovely.. they had amazing ceiling as it looked like the outside from the inside.,50
Loved the Venetian. AS soon as you step into this grand complex it feels like you have just been transported to another country. The large variety of shops and restaurants means that you can never get bored of it. Would definitely stop back in Macao again.,50
"We were staying as a family with two children under 4 so this is for the benefit of other families.  Pros - Amazing suite with an incredible bathroom  - Charming people at check-in and at the pool, allowed early check-in - Lovely cot which was brought to our room quickly upon arrival - Shuttle bus to the hotel from the ferry made the journey from HK easy  - The gaudiness of the hotel is fun and fascinating for adults and children - Super free to use playground near the swimming pools (though hard to find)  Cons  = Management, can you please add some high-chairs to your food court area. It would be such a small thing to change for a hotel of your calibre but would make a huge difference -  food is very expensive - As is the children's soft-play area (Qube) - I would've expected a…",40
"This is by far the biggest hotel room(70sqm) my husband and i have stayed-in. We had a great view, wi-fi was strong and free, & room amenities was nice and complete. We had 2 large flat TV's (living & sleeping area). It was very clean and smelled great. Interior decor was impeccable. We stayed at the North Side, and i did not go out of the hotel premises because you can find the shopping malls and food hall on the 3rdfloor. It is a huge hotel, so be ready to read you hotel map and do some walking. The only downside of this hotel was their buffet breakfast at Art Deco. It was a big dining area with limitid variety of food.",50
"what an amazing casino hotel and complex. this place does match the one in las vegas, great rooms, massive casino floor, can then explore the complex for some high end shopping with the mrs. there is also a large food court as well.",50
"Excellent short trip.  + Fast check-in and check-out. They do have check-out drop box (express check-out) + Free shuttle to hotel and free drop bag without any cost fo the guest + Most of main tourist hotel attraction is connected with the bus from this hotel + The room is super big even the most cheapest one. There is 3 main part in the room; bed, living room and toilet  - The most short cut to walk from the room  to the main reception required to walk through casino. Therefore I forgot to being my passport when I come down for lunch, then it required me to walk very far back to my room - We need to queue up for shuttle with other tourist. Other hotel do give the priority line for hotel guest ",40
We had a great time staying here. Had fun at the casino. Also great food court very large with lots of variety. I would love to stay here again. Good location. The bus services are convenient. Very comfortable ,50
"You miss this, you have missed Macau....I guess there nothing much i need to write...please experience it...A mall, Resort, Hotel, Casino, all rolled into one and a fantastic place to be in...Rooms were awesome..Make sure you get an express check in...else you may need to wait in longer queues...  Indians - there is a peacock restaurant and alternatively a pizza joint at the food court or a MCd a little further away from the Food court.  The only glitch was that after 4 hours i had to remind for my bags to be brought in..",50
"Super feeling in staying in this hotel. It is not a hotel its a city in itself.  The feel in this hotel is like you are in some palace. beautiful architecture. the huge market inside the hotel. the beautiful swimming pools, and good gymming facility add more comfort to this super luxury hotel. In one word  If u have not been in venetian you have not seen anything........",50
"I have travelled a lot and been to many places and countries, but have never come across such a complete delightful experience. Right from the Taipa terminal where we disembarked from Cotai ferry to returning back to Macau Ferry terminal, it was a perfect vacation. We had prebooked the suites and Venetian had offered us express check in facility for easier and earlier check in. Checking in from the main lobby was like a breeze and hardly took us about 10 minutes to check in to our two suites. The Bella suite was outstanding and everything seems to be tastefully done, right from the beds to the bathrooms to the sitting area. The view was amazing too. Once we stepped out of the rooms to explore the hotel and the casinos, we were not disappointed. It is such a large hotel complex…",50
"Free shuttle service to this hotel . It was a pleasure to not spending money for extra transportation ( as we know that we are tourist ! )   Check in experience : they treat me politely and gave me such a beautiful room . Their attitude is very nice . This is the first and most impostant impression by the way :)  Room ( uploaded ) : it was huge, separated with living room. I felt like a king once i saw their room because the style is classic   In room dining : thats my favourite thing once i stay at hotel . I ordered wonton noodle and it was one of my favourite in room dining ! You should try it and ask them to give you extra chilly sauce   Whats in the downstair ? Its shopping mall + casino 24 hours ! If you like gambling you should see and try it . But if you dont want to play…",50
"We stayed from May 10-13 for advance Mother's Day Celebration. Upon check-in, I was astounded that we were upgraded for free and did not ask for a deposit. The room is to luxurious with Cotai view, free wifi, 2 flat screen tv, mini ref, etc. Venetian is Huge with swimming pools, mini golf, casinos, variety of high-end restos, food court, and tons of stores that we got lost several times. Good thing all their staff from guards, front line, and even janitorial are all courteous.  I will give Venetian  Macau 10 stars.",50
"I had a fleeting visit to Macao of 24 hours. I booked the Venetian at the last minute online, about two hours before I arrived at reception.  Check-in was lengthy. I don't know why this is, but every time I have visited Macao it always seem to take so long to check in no matter what hotel (like 12 minutes at the counter).  The complex is so large they give you a small map to find your way from reception to the lifts and your room.  i booked the Royal Suite which while it may sound ostentatious, it's actually the lowest of the accommodation range available. 70 Square metre room which compared to Hong Kong is very spacious. The room is split level with upper level containing the bed and lower level the business desk and lounge area. Probably one of the most interesting features of…",50
It was one of the most mesmerizing properties I have ever seen. It was so huge that in our three day stay at Macau we couldn't even see the entire hotel. It is like a whole new world inside the hotel.,50
"The hotel is so beautiful. The room is very big. There are a lot of space. The room is divided in to many sections - Bathroom, Bedroom and Living room. The furniture are luxury. The room is very clean and the hotel provides many stuff such as toothpaste , toothbrush, soap, shampoo, bath cap, etc.  The hotel has shopping areas as well as casino. There are about 300 shops in the shopping area.",50
Stayed in this hotel again after last stay 4 years ago. Checking in seemed to be faster and now there was free WiFi in the hotel's common area. The hotel was quite well kept and looked still pretty new. Housekeeping didn't have a final check after doing the bed with hair found on the bed sheet right next to the pillow. The socket was also good with USB ports being added for easy computer & phone charging.  A couple of complaints included the hotel map which wasn't updated. I had wanted to get dessert from a shop listed in the food court but couldn't find it. Turned out that shop had closed already. Also tried to get directions from the security guards etc but very often they couldn't provide the right information.,40
"We spent 2 nights at the resort and were short of time.  Check-in was cumbersome as it took over 20 mins in Q and over 15 mins to check-in Rooms: 5/5 Large size Suit with good view (we stayed in North Suits) Room Service: 5/5 - everything given on demand in few mins and cleaning done nicely everyday Ambiance: Rightly lit rooms with two double bad and a large TV with a separate area for seating with Sofa cum bed and one more large TV there as well.  Very comfortable stay.  Free Wifi avlbl   Plenty of things to do in the complex apart from shopping.  Gandola ride is a must try.  Couple of Pools to Cool off.  Kids zone where you can put you kids for half a day or more and you can enjoy shopping or Casino.  If you are in Macau, you shouldn't be missing this Resort.  In my next visit…",50
"Everything is huge in Venetian. The rooms, lobby, casino, everything.. Was there on a family holiday, and it's very impressive. Kids had a great time. Two nights were not enough to cover the entire propert, and then you gotta find time to go out and explore the rest of Macau :)",50
"We took a 2 night package and it turned out to be a great decision. This is a magnificent, huge property, which has enough to keep the whole family engaged, without even stepping out of the hotel.  It is located in Taipa (Cotai Strip), in vicinity to all the big Macau Hotels (Sand Cotai, Galaxy, Studio city etc). It also has a twin , ""Parisian"" and both the hotels are interconnected. Hotel operates free shuttle service from Ferry Terminal / airport.  We opted for a Cotai View Bella Suite and the room was perfect for a family of 4 with 2 comfortable double beds. The room size is superb, with all amenities required for your stay. Furnishings are great. Even bath accessories are of the highest quality. Do opt for Cotai view rooms as they give you a magnificent view of all the great…",50
"As we only stay in Macau for 1 night, we decided to pamper ourselves and stayed at the famous Venetian. Check in took a very long time. Staff was friendly but seriously they should look into their check-in system. Room was huge...I mean HUGE. There were 2 queen-sized bed, plus a living area with a sofa. Toilet was luxurious..it makes you feel like some Hollywood star. Hotel itself was huge with lots of shopping and eateries (and casino of cos). There are free shuttle buses to the dock and various other casinos. This hotel is definitely worth the price that you paid for (whatever that amount is).",50
"Upon arriving at the port the bus is waiting and upon hotels arrivals it was such a surprising the hotel was so huge and this is my first time in Macau during our Business trip with my team in Macau. For 3 days and 2 night in that place is such the best experience from the huge rooms, hospitality of the staff, good service, nice view in our room which is 2819, the restaurants in the hotels, shopping, nice botiques,  All in all our experienced in that hotel was great. And I will probably going back soon and I will still staying at the Venetian hotel Macau. Keep it up!!!!",50
"The Venetian Macau is integrated with the Shoppes at Venetian which is in turn connected to Sands Cotai Central, Shoppes at Parisian and Shoppes at Four Seasons and the Plaza, so there are essentially a bunch of shopping malls, hotels and casinos all within the same gigantic complex. If you wanted to, you could spend days here in the casinos, shops, restaurants and food courts without repeating anything and without venturing outdoors.  We arrived at 4 pm from the Taipa ferry terminal on the Venetian shuttle and had to stand in line for 30 minutes just to check in, which was irritating. Sure they are busy with 3,000 plus rooms but surely such a big hotel needs to have more check in desks.  When we eventually got to the desk, Alan was extremely polite, friendly and professional…",40
In Macao the only activity is to see the hotel. As soon as you reach the hotel you will expect that someone will come and take your luggage ..since it is a 5 star property...but that does not happen....you drag your luggage and go to check in counter. The first feelin when you enter the Hotel is that you have come to a railway station platform. The check in que is very long..waiting time is 1 hour!!! And this is after we have confirmed booking. it is a good thought to carry a folding stool to sit because they do not have sofas in the check in lobby to sit. You can see tired passengers squatting on the floor. Real railway station look. Best part is that only one person per family is allowed to stabnd in the check in que!!! If you are a couple take a book to read..for an hour. I…,40
"The Venetian hotel group has nailed it again. The hardware of this property is gorgeous, the rooms are clean and huge and the amenities furnished is top of the range. As the hotel is humongous, do not expect personalised service, but expect a very structured and efficient service. I always have memorable stay here. Keep up the good work!",50
"Stayed at this hotel for 4 nights after our cruise and all I can say is Wow! The hotel itself is huge and well located on the strip. I wouldn't have wanted to stay anywhere else, and visited almost every hotel during our stay. The room itself was huge, and we just had the basic room....but you felt like a princess. Security at the hotel was great so you felt very safe. There is a big shopping mall located within the hotel complex and a great food hall too. I wouldn't stay anywhere else if staying in Macau again.",50
"For a quiet stay, just to stay in the room the WHOLE day, it is nice. The hotel itself is too huge to walk around, if you plan to go back the room to rest for few times, consider again. A single trip from any lobbies/entrances at ground floor to the lift and to your room, might take up to 15 to 20 minutes.  Service can be better, as long as you stay at Paiza Club level, it will be fine, just fine. ",40
"The hotel is huge, thus make sure you are checking in at the right desk and know where is your tower (we stayed at south tower).To reach hotel if you were coming with ferry is super easy as hotel provide shuttle to and from ferry terminal.   Receptionist was very helpful (Thank you Sami), i got late check out at 2 pm and free wifi (premium, which i didnt try as free wifi is everywhere). Room is spacious with huge bathroom, dining table, sofa, working desk and 2 televisions (you dont have to fight for remote with your partner). I had a very good sleep (the bed was sooo comfortable) and wish I had stayed longer. Breakfast was disappointing as I expect huge selection of menu from this type of hotel, but turned out it is just so-so and also taste is average. There are several…",40
"This hotel is a class apart. Its like a township by itself. It took us quite a while to find our way around the hotel. The rooms are super clean and quite spacious. We didn't take the breakfast but opted to have our meals at the food court.  We did the Gondola ride too. By the way, I still have tickets if anyone is interested.  All in all, the hotel was fantastic and I'd love to go back here again. ",50
Clean rooms and bedding Comfortable  Clean bath and shower  Plenty of towels and amenities  Well located and lots of eating options  Casino for those who love to gamble Large shopping area with so much to choose from  Surrounded by attractions on the strip All in all excellent   Con- no outdoor pool ,40
"Planned a trip to celebrate my parent's anniversary at venetian macao. The room is spacious and clean, a place they can relax in after a long day of walking and the hotel offers many dining options.  Special thanks to the hotel for arranging champagne and cake and a beautiful heart shaped arrangement on the bed. They are lovely and made my parent's stay a memorable one!",50
"This resort is a must visit once in everyone's lifetime.  Its amazing.  The property is so huge that its difficult to tour it entirely in 1 day.  The experiences are so varied that its impossible to savour it all in one day.  So, first advice is to book it for a minimum 2 days. The entrance is grand.  Staff courteous and goes out of its way to be helpul.  They advised me a late checkout (at no extra cost) because my return flight was at 10.30pm from Hk and then further the concierge put me through the Contai Ferry company which was a huge help.  All this was done within the hotel and I did not have to step out.   The shops are an experience to savour and the restaurants offer variety.  The food court is helpful as all kind of food is available.  the duty free shops are good…",50
"What more to be said? This hotel has it all. Cleanliness, luxury, in-house shopping malls, Venetian scenery, Gondola ride, and of course, it's not Macau if it doen't have a casino in it.  Room was spacious. A joy to behold. Best hotel I ever stayed, ever.",50
A nice hotel!  Staffs have accommodated all my requests.  Hotel is near to the airport.  They have a few shuttle buses where guests could travel to ferry terminal (to go over Hong Kong) or to the other part of Macau.,50
"Amazing hotel! The suits are huge and very fancy, staff is kind and helpful. there are hundreds of shops in the hotel and a huge casino. The third floor (where all the shops) design is amazing, just like Venice, with a long canal and gondolas. you can spend a day only in that floor. The breakfast is very good, mixing foods from all over the world. The pool area is huge too with 4 swimming pools.  Perhaps the only flaw of the hotel is that he is too big and crowded, got lost a couple of times trying to find my room.. He also not located in the center of macau but has free buss shuttle that goes out every few minutes.",50
"Absolutely love our stay at the Venetian. We stayed there for 3 nights and I enjoyed it very much! Room is massive, very clean and the bed is so comfy! There's about 6 Swimming pool in total including one w jacuzzi. Also, Lots of restaurants & shops in the vicinity, it's so convenient! Will definitely return soon! ",50
"Suites are a reasonable size with a lounge. Bathrooms are a descent size but as usual shower roses are pathetic spraying everywhere, cheap fittings for tapware. Bed is very comfortable. Like America you have to go through the Casino to get to your room which can be a long walk. Check in is extremely slow so don't expect to get checked in quickly.",40
Big room. Luxury hotel. Go to upstairs and you will find gondola canal with many shops. Even they have mcD on their canal shop. There is shuttle bus to and from macau ferry terminal. Casino is 24 hours. Restricted age inside.,50
"Staying at the Venetian in Macao is much more than a stay in a five star hotel. It is an experience! The hotel is 10,500,000 sq ft in floor area (7th largest building in the world by floor area) There is a duty free shopping mall called The Shoppes with an added attraction of indoor gondola rides.     Very friendly and helpful staff. I did have an upset stomach and the staff were able to assist in getting me the right medicine. The casino is not that user friendly as it has  Chinese instructions, only. The location of resort is perfect for exploring the area such as seeing the Colosseum at Fisherman's Wharf in Macau.",50
The hotel was with awesome facilities !!! If some loves casino this hotel is Mecca for him easily connected with other hotels .. not miss it's cuisine Resturant special golden peacock hotel but the only thing which pisses you off is check inn process which really slow!!,50
"We booked the Bella suite for our short stay in Macau. It was my mom's birthday and once the staff found out about it when I reached out to them to if there's a nearby cafe where I can buy a surprise cake, they offered a half-pound cheesecake for free. I was expecting a really small one but it's quite big that it took 2-adults a couple of meals to finish everything.   The check-in was fast and efficient since we were directed to the VIP lounge. We were traveling since morning and arrived at the hotel around 10 pm and I had a senior and child with me so can only imagine how this is a huge relief. The room was really big and worth every penny. Though it was quite foggy in the morning to appreciate the view, the nighttime view was amazing. The free bottled waters are also well…",50
"The rooms are humongous and all metal parts are wrap in gold, 2 huge TV, 2 huge beds for 4. Self contained hotel complex with most of what you want in a holiday - shopping, gambling, entertainment, varieties of food.  Mostly well kept despite the age, swimming pool is a long walk away, breakfast is mediocre",40
"Only 24 hours stayed in this such a great hotel, but very much enjoyed though. had good sizchuan and cantonese foods at food court close to casino and decoration of hotel were just amazing. big enough room and comfortable",50
"Excellent hotel and facilities. Clean, modern and has everything you require. Check in was a breeze and they extended a late check out without us asking. Rooms are huge, bathrooms luxurious with lots of amenities. Went to a show at the Venetian theatre which was excellent. Shopping lovers paradise. All in all would recommend this hotel in a heartbeat! ",50
"I took my husband to Macau to see a show and stay at the Venetian for one night to celebrate his birthday. The free transfer from the ferry was very easy and door to door -clean and regular shuttles running. The hotel is massive and well staffed. The reception was friendly, helpful and prompt, and the rooms are exceptionally large with bed area separated from the living room area with a small step, including all amenities you can think of including 2 large screen TVs -we had a standard room which was simply huge with oversized bathroom, bath, walk in shower, double sink, boudoir and separate toilet. The room was spotlessly clean and the bed (huge, again) supremely comfortable. The best part was the fact I had emailed only the day before to let them know we were celebrating a…",50
"Right from the time we landed at the Macau ferry terminal and got into the shuttle, the experience was amazing. And different from the one in Hong Kong. Truly king size treatment.  We already had an express check in done, so no queue. Early checkin request had also been approved and our keys were ready by 12 noon - the time we had requested (as against the standard 3 p.m check in).They also upgraded us to the Bella Suite Cotai view.  The sense of 'busy' prevailed only when we were told that our luggage would be sent to the room around 35-40 minutes later and it did. The place is so big, they give you a printed map booklet that shows you how to reach your location. We had kids with us so we had to go through the Level 3 floor rather than the Level 1 floor as that houses the…",50
"This hotel is really great. The reception was friendly and upgraded us to the twin bed room as complimentary. It was evening time and check in process was efficient, exactly what I was hope for.  Everything you need is provided in the room, it's very very big. Big bathroom, big bedroom, big working area with sofa. It has 2 TVs inside, what an extra!  I love how convenient it is, the transportation provided, the location is just perfect!  I enjoyed strolling around the hotel, casino, and the mall so much.  Even the hotel is busy, the staff maintain the smile and service really well.  Kudos to the concierge team at the lobby near to bus stop (forgot his name, but it began with B. Was it Ben or something similar. 24 April around 11:00am). He was genuinely inform about the route we…",50
"We always have a great time at the Venetian.  The rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable.  The location of the hotel is very accessible and we will definitely consider staying here again the next time we come to Macau.",50
Replica of the famous Venetian Las Vegas to Macau is wonderfully done. Minute details are taken into account to make this a spectacular site of visit. The Gondola ride is a must do. The casino is also very nicely done with enough exits and entry points in order to cover the whole Venetian by walk.,50
"This Hotel is 10/10, rooms big and beautiful, big american buffet breakfast in the restaurant attached to the Hotel. although food court a little expensive.  There are three gondola areas, don't get lost, I went to buy the pics from the gondola ride and went back to buy them, could not find it, I asked everyone in the shops, the locals did not know a thing!  finally I found out there were three, main one, marco polo and another one!  The Hotel is beautiful a must to see bring lots of money to buy things, souvenirs etc.  Very touristy, lots of groups, lots of designer shops, you can walk to the Galaxy and Pariso Hotels.  You can also walk across the road and visit their Crown, lots of Valentino brands, make sure u buy because not much here, designer stuff cheap if you know your…",50
"Even though it is one of the oldest hotels in Taipa, Venetian is still one of the best hotels in Macau due to its proximity to shopping areas and other hotels, availability of good restaurants and a huge suite as compared to the others.",40
"Quite a long queue to check in, while we were standing they serve us water. The room was stunning, huge and luxury, there are two television in the room, so good if when anyone fight over the channel. Very hard to find the way out cus everywhere surrounded with Casino😂 ",50
An aesthetically designed luxury. A visual treat for you if you love heritage architect. Nice and spacious rooms with seventh heaven view from the room window. Staff were courteous and services were all top class. Cherry on the cake is the casino. Must stay is you are in Macao. ,50
"We were recently on a trip to macau with my elderly parents (over 70). We could not thank Venetian Macao for their help. My dad had a stroke during our stay. Venetian has definitely gone way above what's expected.  When times like this, this is what makes a hotel stands out from the rest. They have a language translator, phone provided to ensure we could communicate.    We stayed in  a suite where there's 2 queen size bed and a sofa bed. Spacious. We had the city view. Beds were comfortable.   Apart from the above, the location is very convenient. Basically you don't need to leave the hotel vicinity as they have everything there.  Check in and out is simple and fuss free. The Taipan street is 10-15 mins walk from the hotel west wing, direct buses to Ruins of St Paul & Senado…",50
"At the end of the trip, it amazes you as to how does a facility of this size run so flawlessly. Good food of choice, amazing rooms, well kept facilities. The chandeliers are a striking feature everywhere, in fact the entire facility is so well kept, and to single out any particular are for appreciation would be wrong. The golf course and swimming pool are a must visit.   The setup needs to improve on service levels by improving communication abilities of staffs, by improving on their English, as getting them understand (in general communicate) is difficult.",40
The reception area was breathtaking...the entrance enthralling ....service was very good..spoilt for choice as far as restaurants were concerned...the Indian Restaurant was amazing.  Just to walk around amongst all those lovely features and paintings was a feast for the eye...the best was the Gondola ride....very reminiscent of the real thing. Had a blast there.,50
"I visited this hotel at 2010 with family, everything was just perfect, I really enjoyed every minutes I spent. The room was very big, beautifully design, nice view from the window, the pool was beautiful too and the mall... I love the mall too For breakfast the hotel gave us voucher to take a breakfast in selected cafe at the mall... It's nice breakfast and I will someday go back there again. ",50
"Stay at hotel Venetian was fabulous.The hotel is immensely beautiful ,specially the false sky appearance with canal and a boat ride in it. Vegetarian indian food is difficult to find there but restaurant cafe de laute serves very tasty Indian food. shuttles available there is also a very good facility..This property is ultra grand and would need at least 2 to 3 days to cover the entire place. Every aspect of the hotel is so well curated and maintained, its awe inspiring. The grand hall has a beautiful roof with paintings and there are multiple levels for shopping fanatics. Do NOT miss Venetian if you are in Macau!",40
"We were a little worried that the hotel would be a tired and noisy but far from it. The room was huge and looked like new. All the areas of the hotel were quiet and well maintained. The pool area was very quiet, we had one pool to ourselves.  The only downside is the huge Cafe Deco for breakfast, it would be better if there was a dining room just for hotel guests, as it's really busy. However, room service breakfast isn't much more expensive( 20hKD ) more each, so we had that instead- very nice. ",50
"We visited Las Vegas before and we loved wandering in and enjoying those beautiful hotels.  We read about Macau and decided to go their on our way back from Perth via Hong Kong.   About 4 to 5 hotels/resort opened in the past 6 months.  The Parisian, Wynns Palace....  The Venetian is a HUGE hotel.  We enjoyed every minute of it.  Beautiful, friendly and helpful staff.   WE stayed there and walked through to the Parisian. (Brand new)   We loved the Venetian Macao and all the magnificent hotels which we could visit in two days.  This was as wonderful as Las Vegas.  Surely one of my highlight trips.",50

Venetian Macau is the most beautiful hotel I've ever seen! We love the exterior and interior of this grand hotel! It has full of artistic paintings and designs. We also love the ceiling that looks like real clouds. They also have spacious and luxurious well-decorated room. The bathroom is also spacious and clean. Venetian is the best for your room accommodation if you will be visiting Macau.😄 Totally worth it! ,50
"I Stayed at the Holiday Inn . All the property are interconnected and very well made . The venetian is one of the most famous of the 4 properties. Its built in european style , Has a Huge casiono . Most of the people try their luck at the venetian casino . It has a great shopping arcade with some of the best brands available .",40
Location   The hotel is located at the strip and is an exact replica of the Las Vegas Hotel. Its is a huge hotel and is located at the center of all the hotels of the Macau Property  The hotel is super big and luxurious. The hotel is so huge that you actually require a map to navigate the hotel. It has 1000 plus rooms and is actually a mini city with a huge shopping mall and a canal with gondola ride. Rooms We got a lowest category room and it was huge room. With a suite and huge bathroom. The room is super luxurious. You can choose from two queen bed suite or a sofa suite. Even the sofa suite can be made into a queen bed. It has two TV which can be seen individually. Overall ideal for a family with two children. The entire room and bathroom has gold plated stuff. It gives a…,50
"If you want to spend time to explore the mini venetian, maybe you can stay here for 1 night. You can enjoy more at night, because the tourist are very crowded at morning to afternoon.   1. You can go to the main lobby for the venetian famous sign.  2. The gondola ride and mini village view at level 3.  3. The foodcourt at level 3 too.  4. The casino at level 1. This venetian casino's guard sometime will check you if you look like under 19. 5. The shopping center around level 3. 6. If you go outside from main lobby, you can see more object photo.  The room is very luxury. Wow, the bathroom is also amaze me so much. Stay like a 👸🏻. I adore the bathroom so much. It has iron, hairdryer. Enjoy 🤗",50
"Firstly, you need to remember that Macau is the Las Vegas of China. They want you to spend your money! The hotels are huge and the rooms are huge too. The room we stayed in was probably twice the size of any hotel room I have stayed in previously and about half the price. The family rooms have two enormous double beds and a lounge area. There were two 60"" fat screen TVs one at each end. When sitting in bed watching the TV it did not seem that big! Yes the rooms are that large! The bathroom has a bath and separate walk in shower, two basins and toilet is then behind another door. The casino is impressive but the stakes are high. Most tables started at 500 CNY (about £50 GBP) although there were a few at 300 CNY. This level of stake was enough to stop me gambling!  Like Vegas…",50
totally great stay. my second time staying in this resort hotel. everything is perfect from the amenities and facilities in the hotel.   best thing : spacious room with huge living room and huge TV and huge bathroom with reasonable price for a resort. it is connected with the casino the the Grand canal shoppe where you can feel like you're in venetian Italy but off course in here you will the Chinese flavor.   new things around : Parisian not to be missed since it is a totally huge eifel tower similar the one in Paris just beside the venetian.   this hotel is good if you're on a group with your friend or family since you got everything here. mostly it just make you don't wanna move from the hotel.   overall : great stay and consider to be one of the landmark in Macau. every…,50
Stayed with this hotel for 5 days on a conference. Their rooms are very luxurious and spacious. It is very clean and comfortable. There are also a lot of shops to go shopping and restaurants to eat. It is also very entertaining to see so many things.,50
"entire family enjoyed the stay. Large, well appointed suite rooms. Plenty to see and do and two nights was a breeze. Very lavish , tasteful decor . Shopping malls , food courts and casinos are all interconnected , so that you do not really have to step outside. Buffet lunch at BAMBU restaurant was outstanding.",50
"Where to begin - this place is enormous, eye-popping, extraordinary. It is one huge cathedral to pleasure and indulgence. Yet the staff are friendly and professional. It IS like walking through the Vatican. Rooms are all suites and at 70sqm min. more than adequate if you can stay in it that long. Apart from the gambling, there is all the food, shopping and facilities. The five outdoors pools are fabulous but under used, a real tranquil find. Everything you could want. They offered an executive check-in which allowed us into the room very early, and we were wonderfully assisted by Elaina at the customer service desk - flawless service. Only downside are the lifts are very slow and with a full hotel can take over ten minutes to reach your floor or even get in one. It IS a…",50
"The hotel is an extrodinary one, the suite room was very spacious with two queen size bed. Breakfast was superb and the the casino gambling place is ultimate. Apart from this it has other activities as well to enjoy. It is very hard to explore the property in 1 day.",50
"Huge HOTEL with 4 enteries and extra ordinarily cooperative staff to help the visitors. Attracting the tourist with fineness of the interior and offering great deals and offers. The hotel itself is a tourist spot signifies how best it is. No tourist would like to step out of the same as it held the shopping centre, different varities of restaurants apart from the food court And a boat ride. The youngsters and the casino lovers would love to sit in it and play differently as per the mood. Not only the bed but even the room is long sized with pleasing view from the window and huge bathroom where many can fit in. Loved my stay👌",50
We stayed at the Venetian for only one night but we wished it was longer. From the moment we arrived the staff where so welcoming and made us feel right at home. It was my partners birthday and they arranged a cake (actually 2) for us to celebrate which was so unexpected and kind. The kids loved staying there too especially when Crystal one of the staff who checked us in arranged for a soft toy for each of them to be delivered to the room. Such a wonderful experience and we will be back - thank you Venetian!,50
"I stayed at the hotel in November 2016, we stayed at a room facing Cotai. It was an amazing experience staying at the hotel. I felt like royalty. We had extremely high expectations from The Venetian and they not only fulfilled them but gave us more to cherish about. The staff is helpful, the place is beautiful, the rooms are comfortable and lots of delicious food options are also available. It was my first experience going to a Casino and it was just out of a movie scene. i loved every minute spent at the hotel. Will definitely be back to this place soon!",50
"An amazing view both from ouside and inside.Grand canal ,shops and the boat ride are quite wort .the rooms are quite comfortable and clean.A fast n good room service and a magnificent view of golf course.Near by to alll happening n visual feasts specially at night ..",50
"This hotel is a MUST if you plan to visit Macau. From even before I set foot into the building I already received excellent service (Special mention to Crystal, she is amazing).   I stayed for my anniversary and I wanted to make it special and they delivered without me even asking. I received excellent service throughout my stay.(Thank you Russell and Zhanna) and was incredibly satisfied.   The room itself was clean, comfortable and made me feel like a King for a day. The location was also conveniently located in the area with shuttles to take you to other places.   Please do yourself a favour and stay here, you definitely won't regret it. I will definitely come back again when I have the time.",50
"I wondered when I entered to this huge hotel.. i never seen in my life such a huge sized hotel with thousands of rooms and so many restaurants and even a big mall and a casino in this hotel. The rooms were excellent. I stayed only for one night in this hotel.. The washroom was superb with all amenities,,The view from the room was beautiful.. I am eagerly waiting to stay in this hotel in near future",50
We stayed here for 3 nights and was delighted by the hotel facilities and amenities that catered to the young and the adults.   Though casino was main highlight but we never got tired of moving around and outside the resort.   Thus making  it an entertaining place to stay. ,40
It is a huge and wonderful property to stay at. I have stayed here for 1 night but should have stayed here at least for 2 nights. The Hotel has a shopping mall and lot of eating joints in it. Preferably take room in South wing as it is close to breakfast area. You will get options whether to take breakfast or lunch. Hotel has provided additional stuffs and is near to the main attractions. I have booked under Ice world package and got free tickets for Ice World too which was a good experience. Rooms are good and well maintained. Have ordered food in Room which has a good variety and excellent quality. The cost is also reasonable as per the 5 star property. Stay was comfortable and was best part of my Hong Kong Macau Trip.,50
"We stayed at the Venetian for two nights and it was a great experience. The room was large with a good view of the strip and it is one of the cleanest hotels I have ever stayed in. The services provided were amazing and it was a good location to walk around the whole area - multiple casinos, shows and numerous bars and restaurants close by. We dined one night at Canton, one of the on site restaurants and it was beautiful cantonese cuisine. Don't miss the all you can eat lunch at Portofino either for great pasta dishes. As great as the Cotai Strip is, make sure you leave the area to visit the older part of Macau and Coloane - the Venetian is conveniently located only 5-10 minutes drive from both.",50
"Stayed at the venetian for 3 days and I must say that Zhanna from the VIP lounge/ guest services went over and beyond to ensure our stay was great. The service she provided was more than welcoming it set the tone of our trip from the moment I checked in. Can't say enough about Zhanna and her crew; Ken, crystal everyone I encountered during my stay was top notch  service. I would stay here again just to get the service they provided. Thanks again for everything we had a great time in Macau.",50
"The best experience me and my friends have ever had, no doubt! Room is simply perfect as seen from the pictures. Spacious, gorgeous, and you can find everything you want and need. But the most amazing thing is their incredibly nice service and the feeling of being respected and well served! I requested the honeymoon service and surprised my lovely partner. The hotel helped me prepared roses, swan towels and a rose cake!!!!! It was much much much more than I expected",50
"We stayed at the Venetian Macao for one night in April during a stay in Hong Kong. We booked a Royal Suite room + Cotai Water Jet package which gave us transfers to and from Kowloon or Hong Kong island included in the trip. Overall, we would highly recommend the Venetian but would have stayed for two nights if we had our time over again.  Transport: On arriving at the Kowloon Macau Ferry terminal, we couldn’t book the travel time we wanted due to it being full so we had to wait around at the terminal for a couple of hours. The Kowloon ferry is far less frequent than the Hong Kong ferry and in hindsight we should have travelled from Hong Kong instead.  On arrival at Macau, the transport as part of the package to the Venetian was very good we could check in straight away and ahead…",50
"We have been in venetian for 3 nights. Every thing was amazing. Our room was in 32 floor. It was a very nice suite with a great view(bella suite). As I know all the rooms are big and some kind of a suite. The suite was sooo luxury, clean & cosy. And the bed and pillows were so comfortable. There was a high volume hair dryer in the bathroom that is sooo helpful in the weather of macau. Casino, food court,mall, gondola & everything was great. There is a variety of mid to luxury level range of stores so every one can shop there. U actually don't need to leave the hotel, we just booked a 4 hour city tour  from the hotel and saw all the attractions. All the staffs are sooo nice but I have special thanks to Mr. Kei in check in who was so friendly and kind & gave us a great positive…",50
"It's beautiful and if you love hotels and casinos, this is definitely worth keeping in your Macau itinerary. One other great thing about this place - it's also right beside The Parisian. Like the Parisian, it'll cost you an arm and a leg to buy the beautiful things found in this hotel, but window shopping is allowed. If you have the money though, do splurge. It'll be worth it!",50
"went for friends bachelorette trip! we booked Bella suite with double queen size bed and you can experience luxury at best price! you can find shopping, food everything at one place! MUST PLACE TO STAY IN MACAU!",50
Stayed overnightas part of business trip and therefore was frustrated at the length of time it took to check in. There were only 3 in our party and the rooms were booked in advance so really couldn't see why it took so long. Putting that aside the hotel is awesome and the room we stayed in was very spacious and had fantastic views. The buffet breakfast was extensive and catered for both western and eastern tastes.,40
"I stayed at this hotel on the last night of our trip celebrating her birthday  The hotel was stunning- almost overwhelming with its grandeur and magnificent design.  We stayed in a suite looking out over the golf course on the 29th floor.  The hotel were very kind to arrange a special birthday gift. A traditional steam bun cake was sent to our room upon check in. Such a lovely gesture that she will never forget.  Whilst we were only in the hotel for 30 hours, we had a truly exceptional stay.  We could have spent days here just wandering and looking.  We are at the breakfast buffet which was vast. The imperial restaurant was fantastic too, as were the quick bites we had at a couple of the food court restaurants.  The shopping was wonderful. Decor unbelievable- purely magnificent.…",50
"While many refer to Macau as the Vegas of Asia, the names and styles of the hotels are the only similarity.   Vegas is focused on entertainment and fun, while Macau is really focused on gambling and shopping.  The Venetian in Macao is really large. The check -in staff were very friendly and efficient. We booked Royal Suites and they were fantastic. Large, modern, clean and fresh.  Used room service on 2 occasions and both times they were efficient and friendly as well.  We did not really enjoy the casino. The tables are horribly over crowded and focus mainly on Baccarat. There is no atmosphere in the casinos  as no one cheers wins etc.  ",50
"One Of the best Best hotel in macau. Don't miss the breakfast buffet. i booked a suite it was awesome with great couch area, balcony view and Big size bathing area.  Pool side area is soothing. Macau is not complete if you not visit Venetian.",50
Luxury with comfort defines this property. Despite big size and crowd staff and system helps you to smoothen check in and out( express checkout best- should be used).I booked Bella suite for family(4 people) with good view. Amenities in room good but water bottles small so ask for more in beginning only.Hotel provides shuttle for pickup and drop to ferry points. Rest of travel to city is best by metered taxi. Food court and all restaurants good for dining. Vegetarian food is at Golden Peacock retaurent(Indian) and pizza outlet in food court(hotel map gives few Indian outlets in food court but they were not there - disappointment). Maxican restaurent also have veg food choices. Casino is huge but newcomers have poor help from staff specially understanding slot machines( need…,50
"Visited Macau in April 2017, with family.  This city has plenty of resorts and Hotels, Venetian, Perisian, Galaxy, MGM being the top rated.  Venetian is particularly most liked by Indian visitors.  Venetian is internally connected through passage way to Perisian and Sand Cotai. Plenty of shows are spread out within these resorts.  The resort is too huge. Its much better than what it is seen on the Internet or what could be described by any one.  For Indian Food - Restaurant Peacock, adjacent to reception area, is managed by Indian managers and Indian chefs. Truly Indian food. Breakfast is complimentary, but the best part is that you can convert a free breakfast to free lunch at this restaurant. For Dinner and Breakfast, there are plenty of options available at food court. So…",50
"I spent 3 nights in Parisian Macao resort and they have become unforgettable days of my life. The ambiance and interior decoration of this luxury hotel is mind blowing. Every arrangement and display in the hotel called for second look and attention.  I watched 2 shows in the hotel, one on Chinese legend and other a comedy show. I visited the Ice World too. Just be cautious about food particularly if you are a pure vegetarian in their breakfast buffet.",50
"Got a lovely suite on lvl 29 - with an amazing view, overlooking the golf course and the great city skyline, bang opposite Wynn. Could catch a glimpse of their water fountain.  The only thing to fault would be that the hotel is a maze and u end up getting lost every now and then.  The casino was crowded like a fish mkt - probably due to lots of big groups visiting at the same time. Overall an amazing stay!!",50
The hotel looks a little run down now compared to the new ones which have come up in the area.  The casino is quite shabby compared to others but was always crowded.  The only attraction here remains to be the Gondola ride which is fun for all ages.,40
"A luxury hotel! The room was impressed me. That's the most spacious room I ever check-in! The bathroom is spacious and clean with bathtub and shower, as well a makeup table, which is the wonderful corner for ladies. Hotel is linked with shops and food court. Free shuttles to different attractions. The only bad is the swimming pool too far from my room. ",50
"We had an awesome night staying in Venetian. Room was so big and clean, bed was so comfortable. Anyway, be careful of taxis in Macau, they will charge you a lot (not using meter). You have ask them to start the meter before going, or just left the taxi if they refuse. I was charged HKD$200 from Venetian hotel to Senado Square. Second time, when we wanted to go to Macau Taipa Ferry terminal, taxi driver also charged us HKD$200 (it's very near, only 5-10 mins driving!!) and I asked the driver to stop in the middle way. Thankfully, we were still in Venetian area, and one of the staff of Venetian Hotel saw us stepped down from the taxi with lots of luggages, and he helped us to find free shuttle bus to Macau Taipa Ferry Terminal.  I'm so thankful for the staffs here, staffs are very…",50
"Good experiences in Venetain Macao, and the staffs are very helpful and professional, which is very good for traveling with the kids as they take care our needs sincerely.  We are also happy to take Gondola Rides, and like the songs and voices very much.",50
"First, I would like to say thanks to Venetian Macao Resort Hotel, as this time is the lucky draw prize from them, 2 nights in a Rialto suite! Such a great experience for me and my family! Finally, I pay to upgrade to Rialto Bella Suite for my family, it's so great for us to stay in The Venetian! We can enjoy the VIP services these two night, great time for my family, especially for my girl. We enjoy shopping in there, so much fun!",50
"We had a great time at the Venetian Macao. We had chosen the ice world package and enjoyed every bit of it. The rooms are great, pretty large, just a small disapointment on the view but this is rather similar to all the hotels in this area. The mall, obviously very fake, is nonetheless enjoyable. Staff at the venetian are generally nice, and most of them speak english.",50
The suites were beautiful!! Location is excellent. Food court was just around the corner & plenty of shops within walking distances. Easy to walk through to other buildings. Basically everything within walking distance! Highly recommended! ,50
"Have always stayed in the Venetian. Booking was a breeze. Excellent ambience. Service is top class. All the staff were very courteous, patient, knowledgeable and friendly. All rooms were huge. I was allocated a newly renovated room. Very clean and comfortable but I missed the previous deco and furniture which were more in line with the overall theme of the hotel. Had free wifi which was strong. Very good value for money!",50
True to its reputation... a city in itself... a beautiful hotel with great shopping n lot of activities n shows for the kids. Stayin in Venetian Macau is a experience in itself...a leisure holiday the memories of which stayon with you... the staff is extremely courteous n helpful...lots of restaurants to stasify ur palate... the canal that runs through the shopping levels surely excites the kids n the gandola ride adds to the excitement... must visit if leisure casino n shopping is ur agenda👍🏻,50
"Call it Vegas on a budget....once all the construction is completed, I am sure Macau will look incredible. We stayed in a Royal King Suite in the Venetian. Beautiful room with amazing views on the 41st floor. Room was fantastic! The hotel itself, was so large that you can easily get lost. I don't believe it is a venue for a bargain hunter shopper - mostly exclusive brand name shops that  look glamorous and beautiful, but things we can't afford.  English wasn't widely spoken so it was very hard to get answers other than yes.  Maybe on a follow up trip, a few more nights will be great.",40
"The place is HUGE, to big really.... The room we had was also massive and for the price amazing. Check in took a long time but ok. There is lots to do on the island if gambling is not your thing. Seeing young pandas at the zoo was a highlight for my wife. Tip - if you like a good breakfast order room service as there is not much choice outside.",40
"After a nights on the Cotai Strip, the Venetian was a relaxing oasis that did not disappoint. Even though the hotel are famous for its casino, it was still quiet and mellow. The hotel is very beautiful and the rooms was drop-dead gorgeous. You could easily stay in this hotel for a few days without leaving and still have an amazing experience with the restaurants, casinos and its facilities. Even the pools are pretty good.  Having said that, there are some departments which are not on par with this opulent hotel.  1.	Breakfast. Do consider having breakfast elsewhere if it not included in the price  2.	Amenities such as tea & coffee selection – nothing grand as I personally expected better quality.  Overall it's was very good, but I'm not there for gambling so my perspective could…",40
"this is one of the biggest hotel in macau.  located in cotai, right beside The Parisian hotel, in front of The City of Dream.   to get there from Ferry Terminal, you simply can use the free shuttle provided by the hotel. or, from Senado Square, you can use public bus #26A   when you visit the place, do not forget to experience the Gondola Ride at the Grand Canal.   you can also taste the famous Portuguese Egg Tarts at Lord Stow Bakery, located at the shoppes near the Grand Canal. ",40
"A well-maintained luxury hotel.    With great hotel space accompanied by in-house Gondola ride and worldwide renowned shopping brands, one cannot afford to get bored here. Great food, spaciously crafted amazing rooms, amazing interiors and you name it and it has it.   Go there to experience it yourself. Have a great stay! :)",50
"The hotel is just brilliant   Everything is well designed, similar to Las Vegas in decoration.  Take the time to grab a local tart fromLord Stowes bakery - inside on canal st walk. Best in the world!  The casino is one of the busiest in Macao. Make sure to visit the other casinos.",40
"Surely one of the best hotel in Macau. The lobby is awesome. One of the 'majesty-like' I've seen so far and still probably a highlight too. The hotel, like in Vegas, offers great range of refined restaurants as well s fast food. The boutiques are very nice too.",40
"It was a weekend getaway plan made with my wife and daughter. We stay at Shenzhen, China. From our place it's just an hours journey by the ferry. We took the ferry to the Taipa Ferry Terminal, Macau. This is the closest ferry terminal to Venetian. Indian nationals get a visa on arrival at Macau btw, which is free of any fee.   We got out from the ferry terminal and boarded the coaches that are stationed right outside the arrival gates. Reached Venetian in like 15 minutes.   The whole ambience is super luxurious. As soon as you enter these gates you are in a world of its own. It won't be wrong to say that this is a mini city in operation. So many shops and restaurants inside which serve delicious cuisines.   A handy tip for the travelers HKD is widely accepted at all merchants…",50
"My wife and I stayed one night in this incredible place.  It is seriously like a city within a single building.  The rooms are huge and comfortable and the staff are very friendly and attentive.  Once you get the hang of where you are in this huge place, the shopping is pretty good and the Venetian theme is actually really good fun.  I highly recommend this place as a special treat for a loved one - the only thing I can't quite get used to (coming from Australia) is the smoking inside the place.  Our non-smoking floor had plenty of cigarette butts in the bins by our lifts.  Putting that aside, the staff are great and the ambience was fascinating.  I would come back and will recommend to my friends as a treat.",40
"The experience starts with shuttle bus from the ferry, it took us 10 minutes to find the right counter to check-in. First hotel I have seen which gives hotel map while check-in so that u can explore every corner of hotel. Breathtaking interiors, worlds biggest casino, in-built mall, numerous restaurants, inside lake with gondola ride, this hotel is everything u have ever dreamed off. Shopping hub !! Omg what to say about those stores . All international premium brands are available. I found this property amazing to stay in entire Macau. If you're visiting Macau then do not think to stay in any other hotel. This property is like a dream to stay and explore.",50
Stayed there for a few days. The hotel has a great view. Breakfast was excellent. Staff members were very kind. Hotel rooms and the pools were awesome! One of the best hotels I've stayed in so far. Totally worth it.,50
"Stayed for 2 nights, a very big and nice room. The room split into 2 area living room and sleeping area. The hotel is very big and they have a very big shopping area with lots of facilities. But I found the security system not so good for the hotel guest as anybody can just go up to the hotel room even if they are not the guest there. ",40
"I highly recommend this place for shopping and accommodation. The interior design is amazing, service at the hotel is excellent and facilities are great. You get all you need in one place.  Visited last February with colleagues.",50
"Excellant!  Excellant!!  Excellant!!!  From  check in  to  check  out  very  fast. A  surprise  gift  to  my  wife  for  our  28th  anniversary. I  also  got  a  surprise  gift  from  the  hotel  management  side. The  bed  of  our  room  was  decorated  with  rose  flower. We  booked  two  rooms.  One  for  us,  one  for  our  children. Our  children  also  happy with  their  room.  The  room  exactly  as  shown  in  the  web  site. Rooms  were  very  clean,  very  specious.  60"" (or  may  be  more  size  TV)  one  tv  in  bed  room  and  one  in  the  sitting  area. Bed  is  real  King  size. Our  next  surprise  from  the  hotel  was  after  dinner  they  sent  us  a  beautiful  GONDOLA  fully  made  by  chocolate,  about  a  foot  long  along  with  different  chocolate and …",50
"We stayed in this hotel for 4 days 3 nights with our 2 years old daughter. We were given a room in the North wing of the hotel which had the best view overall. The room was very spacious, very clean and very well maintained.My daughter was very happy with the room as she had the space to play around in the room itself. The hotel is connected with casinos, shopping streets and food court. The north wing is very close to the food court. The advantage of staying here with children is that you can return to your room immediately if your child is sleepy or cranky or even if they need to change. I highly recommend this hotel to people who travel with children. It's a little pricey but worth the money.",50
"the room is super big size, it has definitely gone through refurbishment lately as it looks new and the colour scheme is different from the photo posted, the room we stayed were all white in colour.   There were 2 LED TV with youtube apps but no searching function , no kids channel.  This place is not very kids friendly.  After check in, you have to take a detour route to go to the hotel room if you are with kids.  I booked the city view room and i have to say i am not regretted at all.  you can see the buildings of city of dream, conrad, etc with night lighting of the buildings is magnificent.",50
"We spent 3 days in Macau and stayed at The Venetian hotel. There is free hotel shuttle bus at the airport sending us to the hotel directly. The bus provides free wifi and the speed is quite smooth. When we reached the hotel, we are warm welcomed by their friendly staffs. The standard check-in time is at 3pm but we managed to get an early check-in at 12pm. The receptionist, Ms. Lily, is very polite and friendly and we simply love her attitude. I must say that this is indeed a very very nice hotel. My parents are so amazed on the hotel's decoration. The design is so great till we thought that we are in Europe. The hotel is huge which includes casino, restaurants, food court, shops, entertainment theater, cinema, kids zone, etc. We stayed at the suite room and it is amazingly nice…",50
The hotel is iconic to the city! Every wall is beautifully curated. The rooms are classic yet modern. The staff is courteous. The hotel is mostly very busy but they efficiently handle the guests. It is a destination hotel. The shoppes have all the brands and you can shop till you drop. It is even better for shopaholics to go during sale season. The Parisian(based on the theme of Paris) next door is a new hotel but the charm of Venetian is unbeatable.   You must stay for the experience! ,50
"We only stayed for one night as we were flying on to Tokyo the next day but we had a great stay. I had emailed ahead informing them we were celebrating my wife's birthday and Echo and the wonderful lady at reception (sadly I cannot remember her name but we had a good chat as she previously worked at the Ritz in London where we are from and she was also going to Tokyo in a few days like us!) arranged a cake for her. Check in was quick and we were given a late checkout as our flight was not till midnight the following day. The room was excellent looking down onto the strip. The hotel in itself is huge and you are given a map to plot your routes. There is a lot to do whether it be shopping, eating or gambling. The staff are all very efficient and always on hand to answer any…",50
"One can't go wrong with staying in one of the most happening places in Macau.  We stayed here for 2 nights for my brother's birthday and they didn't fail to make our whole stay memorable and special.  Check in time is strictly followed. It is efficient and systematic, even if the line gets too long, though.  Their check in personnel are polite and very keen to details. They had a cake delivered to our room even without us mentioning that  it's someone's birthday.  I mean they can just go on with the check in and stuff for all they care, that's just what they're supposed to do anyway right? Make sure that everyone's checked in.  But to go the extra mile of doing something aside from what they're just supposed to do is what you call good customer service.  And that just doesn't…",50
This is one of those gigantic hotels that run all night long and never sleep. On the first night I stayed in my room and ordered room service and watched a movie. Great size rooms! They are all suites and huge ones. The room service was served perfectly and arrived early. The hotel is filled with things to do. Shopping and great restaurants. The food quality is outstanding. Macau is a great place to party with friends! ,40
"This would be the largest hotel report that I have experienced. Most rooms are quite large and well appointed. There are a number of check in counters, it is quite easy to loose your sense of direction, you will need to remember which wing your room is located. Our room key failed during our stay, it was a very long walk to one of the reception counters to have it replaced. The shopping and restaurant areas on the 3rd floor are amazing, the façades of the buildings of Venice, the false sky changes through the day from daytime to night time. Late afternoon, seated at some of the restaurants you get the feeling of being outside as the sun goes down, great atmosphere. Talk a gondola ride through the various areas of ""Venice"". Larger than the Venetian in Vegas. A fantastic stay.",50
"This was one of my best hotel satys I have had. We in the family enjoyed the grandeur and the hotel facilities. The Casino is a different experience. That apart the restaurants, even to vegitarians like us was having a good spread. The shopping area was always interseting eventhough the pricing was high. Th food court also gave a wide range food. The best part was that of the ride on the artificially created canal in dow ride with the boatman singing. Overall a great feeling and experience. Worth visiting.",50
"We stayed one night here and were blown away with the size of the rooms. The view was amazing and the hotel was massive. The only downside was location as it is a fair way away from the old Portugese part of town which we wanted to visit. Also, we tried taking the free shuttle to the Cotai strip that night and ended up back in the old part of town. After 1.5 hour round trip we settled for dinner at the hotel...",40
"The Venetian Macao is one of the largest hotels n casinos on the earth. And the quality of rooms, Michelin star restaurant food and the amenities in the development (mall, Venice like canals, arenas, convention facilities etc.) is probably second to none. The number of options to eat and shop is just in-numerable. Everything about the place is a tick, except probably the time taken to check in/out because of the sheer no.of rooms....",50
"We, four couples visited Macau in mid Feb., 2017 and stayed in this hotel for two nights. This is a very big hotel with lot of facilities (e.g. excellent shopping mall with gondola, Casino, golf etc., all of it we even could not find time to visit). We stayed in the 31st floor and the rooms were big (with city view) and extremely comfortable. Attached bathrooms (with both shower and bathtub) and toilets were superb with latest facilities. All services were excellent. Room rents were inclusive of buffet breakfast with ample choices. Staffs were very friendly and helpful. We enjoyed this hotel very much.  As this hotel is very big with several floors and rooms, check-in took a bit long. However, check-out process was quite fast.",50
"The hotel is really really impressive! We got the lowest great suite (I think it was called royal suite), at it was honestly amazing! We got a room with a Cotai view, but unfortunately the weather was rainy and foggy, so we couldn't enjoy the view to the fullest. Regardless of that, our stay was really good! All the service staff was really helpful and polite and we didn't have any problems during our stay!",50
"Just spent one night when visiting HK with family.   Check-In: It wasn't busy at all in terms of checking in/out. Got there around noon on Tuesday (maybe because we went on a weekday and during off-season). They have a baggage check-in/valet area if you get there too early and you want to go somewhere. Check-in was at 1pm. After check-in, they deliver your luggage while you are out and about so don't worry about being in your room if you want to roam around the place/city.   Room Situation: The room we had was two queen bed suite and it was plenty of room for family of four. We weren't sure about this one since previous reviews said the rooms were old or dirty. The room was clean and newer (it felt remodeled-South wing) and the AC blowing good cold air. We actually had room…",40
"I booked the Royal Suite at VMRH and I was with my wife and a 4yr old kid. One of the largest hotel room that I ever stayed. Both the check-in and check-out procedures were smooth and the speed of free wifi was decent enough to play video without buffering. Service of the In-house dining and house-keeping was beyond the expectation. Wonderful experience in warm-water swimming pool while the outside temperature was 17 deg C.  Within the vast campus are the hotel rooms, food court, gondola ride, restaurants and casinos are accessible within 5 mins of walk from the entrance of suite lobby. Astounding false sky roof within VMRH. It was very comfortable stay at VMRH. ",50
It was a large room. With extra sofa bed. We have a room that face the city view. It was great. The bathroom was very large. Even have vanity desk. We staying there for honeymoon purpose and they even gave us a complimentary cake. Thanks.,50
Pros: 1. Resort have only suit rooms and are excellent with big in size. 2. Service is excellent 3. Cotai ferry booking office in the premises with free shuttle service to terminal. 4. Free shuttle service to most of the places and other resorts in macau. 5. Only Indian restaurant in Macau 'the golden peacock' in the premises 6. Express check out  Cons: 1. Very famous among visitors so very crowdy almost every time. 2. Very big premises and have to walk very much from room to canals or to go outside. 3. Old property  Overall a good stay and best at services but there are many new properties which can be tried. ,40
"All suite resort the rooms are massive and luxurious. 24 hour world class casino which is very famous. Golf course, plenty of restaurants and food court. The place is truly amazing. I miss it so much cant wait to go back again! They also have golf course, pool and venice like canals and shopping mall. When in Macau you must stay here for the experience. ",50
"I stayed at the Venetian Macao Resort Hotel for 1 night last month with my wife and baby son.  During the check in process I expressed that I needed a non-smoking room for my baby.  The check in service representative (Yukti) offered us one of the newly renovated rooms to ensure that the room would not have any smell of smoke.  The room was perfect, with a great view.  She was able to provide us with a baby bath tub, high chair, and baby bottle warmer.  Best of all, she was able to arrange a late check out for us.  Traveling with a baby is not easy.  But the service I experienced at the Venetian has made the entire trip very manageable.",50
"A busy, crowded and convenient place to stay.  The hotel was elegant in every way with lots of service agents to assist you. It is a good place to stay if you gan=mble but comparing to Las Vegas, your odds in winning is very slim.",40
"It was the typhoon season in Macau and it rained heavily for days, didn't feel like visiting the outdoor tourist attractions, so spent the day inside the hotel, wondering around the shopping area and lots of restaurant choices. Plus some other entertainment inside the shopping area to help you spend the day.",40
"stayed here for 2 nights and 3 days. we were at the west block with view of the grand casino and resort across the street. The hotel is huge and you will need minimum one whole day to see the entire property.  the gym was under renovation, the cube is good but for older kids above 5 years of age.  the 2 large swimming pool and Jacuzzi is great. the staff is very courteous and helpful. the rooms are large and well furnished. the bathroom is of good size. the mall is awesome and time just flies there.  the food inside is quite good in the restaurants, but the food court wasn't that great except the Japanese counter.",40
Imagine being at venice with lot many shops around you while all  being indoor. You even have a sail on the canal on the gondolas with the beautiful gondoliers.At night  you can enjoy the amazing light and water show at the large fountain in front of the hotel.,40
"Best! Excellent! Amazing! Huge! Outstanding! Must Go! Well words are less to describe this lifetime magnificent experience of 'Venetian Macao'. Its just a whole city inside this Hotel. A perfect Honeymoon destination or to be with your family and friends. Best time to visit Macao is in Winter which is around December-February.   Villas: luxurious villas with exquisite amenities. Try to take as high floor as possible as the view is simply outstanding.   Food: World cuisine available Which is just delicious in so many restaurants. for Veg./Jain people 'Golden Peacock' restaurant is a must go. Well, everyone must try the best Indian food here once.   Shopping: More than 850 shops with almost all the best and the most luxurious brands of the world are here!! You will literally get…",50
Nice and comfortable for this hotel... but i think they should renovating the room a little bit... coz some stuff is too old. The location was strategic and the ambience was nice. The service is good.,40
"This is a Great Family Resort Hotel. We got a nice Cotai View Royal Suite for me, my wife and son. We travel around the city for good Restaurants near St. Paul's ruins and Tapipa food street. This Casino Hotel is the largest in Macau with so many amenities and restaurants. it is a city within a city.",50
Huge magnificent and splendid place. Rooms are spacious and aesthetic. Checkin and checkout staff are prompt. Express checkout facility available which is very convenient. Regarding food variety of international cuisine available. The one thing which we really liked was the avenues of shopping with 4 shopping malls and may be 3000 shops. So much so that it is a must visit site in the Macau city tour. In fact we did not feel the necessity of going out of the venue.,50
"i stayed there in bella suite,idea for a family with 2 kids.really a great experience.I used in house dining,express check in service ,cotai water jet (Discountable for venetian),swimming pool ( 3 Pool and 1 jaccuji) ,every thing is perfect.If you are going to macau must stay there.Although they have less options for vegetarian in food but whatever they have it's good.better book through their website ,you will get some advantage.",50
"Best Casino in Macao and luxury stay , It is very easily accessible and large number of tables available.Best part of Venetian is only casino has Indian restaurants which cater North Indian cuisine  and  famous known Casino in Asia .",40
"Quite simply the best room ever amomg all hotels I have ever stayed in. And this, when I had booked their smallest suite. It turned out to be a huge beautiful italian room, with a bath twice the size of my bedroom in Mumbai. No kidding here. Icing on the cake - the room had a view of City of Dreams' facade. The entire resort is pretty awesome too, ofcourse, but I highly recommend all Macau travelers to book a night or two at the Venetian, instead of just a quick visit.",50
"I booked the Florence suite from 10/03-12/03. Prior to the trip, email correspondence to arrange a birthday cake was very pleasant. (Although they charged MOP210 for one cake) Because of the suite, there was a complimentary airport transfer. The arrangement was to display the my friend's name as a surprise and it was clearly stated in the email but in the end my name was displayed instead.  We were chauffeured directly to the Paiza Club (extremely extravagant) we were welcomed by a friendly staff (Jess) who led us into the check in. The service provided was very personalized and we didn't even know the luggages was being taken care of while she was talking to us.   The check in process was alright and when we were led to the room, as expected, we had an army welcoming us with…",40
"Venetian Macau is an just superb. Interior is so beautiful. You must visit the shopping area at the third floor and look at the artificial sky, that is simply wonderful. Buffet Breakfast has huge spread. The hotel suites are luxuries. A must stay place for everyone visiting Macau.",50
"From been greeted by the Venetian girls at the airport to the check in in this hotel, everything is just amazing about this hotel. It's sooooo huge that people find it difficult to find their way. When u check in, you are given a map with directions towards your room. The best room i have ever stayed in. Rooms are so big that at least 8-10 people can easily sit and have a great time in a single room. The casino is again spread over such a large area that i lost my way each time i went to play. Always carry the map when you are roaming around. For Indians there are 2 Indian restaurants in the hotel itself. Overall an amazing stay and will surely visit again.",50
I have been stay there on 10th march only for a night. I have impressed with a staff called John when checking in. He is polite and keep smiling. He chat with us for a while let us feel very welcoming. He showed a 5-stars service.,50
"If you went to macao, I think the venetian resort is a must see. The interior design is really good, they have sky and cloud as the rooftoop, that make you look like at the outdoor instead of indoor. Good for taking selca. What's more you could get there with free bus that provide by the company from macao ferry terminal. ",40
"I visited the Venetian Macao with my family this month. We were celebrating my moms birthday. I informed them about the birthday ahead of time and they said they were going to make special arrangements for us. I did also mention that my mom is pire vegetarian. Upon our check in the Hotel upgraded us from a Royale Suite to a Bella Suite with view. And they sent an eggless cake to the room as well. It was such a pleasant surprise for all of us. The hotel concierge was very generous with providing us with amenities such as water, extra tea/coffee and even hand lotions. Just ask and they will bring it to you :) Fast service, friendly hotel staff and amazing Hotel!",50
"Stayed for 1 night. Great service crew! Because i told them i was there for my birthday, they gave me a surprised  of a complementary cake and upgrade to a better view room. Room is clean n bed is comfortable. They are about to answer in english when we enquiry about things. ",50
"I had 4 to a Cotai Queen size room. Had 3 towel, asked for extra while I go , came towel in a paper bag. Cool.  My dad's birthday (member), no much question asked, within 4 hrs delivery a FOC cheese cake.  Check in provided me a map to orientate myself around.  Helpdesk offer me a ""taxi use"" ""list of places"" that I can use.",40
"Stopped by here during a day trip from Hong Kong. WOW! Just like Vegas! Big, Bright, Clean and Non-Smoking throughout, even on Casino floor.  Vast amounts of Gaming, Shopping and Food choices.    The Food Court provided economical dining choices. We tried Porto Exterior for it's Macanese and Portuguese food.  The oxtail dish was unctuously delicious and the Chicken dish with Portuguese sauce was generously portioned.  Both were served with white rice to sop up all of the wonderful sauce.  Great food at a great value.  ",40
Never to miss an opportunity  to visit The Venetian in Macau. Lovely spacious and a perfect place to spend an evening . Casinos are so huge and fun to be. Enjoy gandola ride inside and exclusive multicuisine.,50
It was everything I asked for. We stayed at one of the suites on the south tower and everything was clean and modern in the room. There is a sense of luxury in every part of the hotel. There was everything you needed inside the hotel from restaurants to shops and the casino.,50
"The Venetian Macau is beautiful. The interior is gorgeous. The lobby has more or less the same concept as the ones in Las Vegas. I love the room although there was a little defect when we first got into our room. The carpet was damp. We called the manager, and got our room changed. 2nd room, however, the toilet bowl pump system was not working. The hotel maintenance got it fixed immediately. Our stay was perfect. The weather was nice and cold. Definitely recommendable! ",40
This is one of my favourite stay out of every other stay .. hotel looks like a palace and its completely mesmerising.. there is a casino inside where wecan enjoy our evening spending there.. theres a complimentary breakfast buffet and its awesome,50
"loved the stay ! ooooh the room , the food the hotel!  Just Wow  I thought the ppl at reception were kidding when they said  please carry map  you might  get lost and they were so correct it is easy to get lost! the shopping the whole stay was a dream and the Eiffel tower at the Parisian !!!!!!!!!!!!!! gr8 experience, gr8 city, gr8 casino ! just lovely!",50
"I've booked a room via their website and found a 25% off deal when booking in advance. From the ferry terminal, it was very easy to get there with the free shuttle bus, then once in the hotel we had to wait a bit at the counter. As soon as we got to the counter we had an outstanding service!! Bea took care of us with a genuine smile and a great attitude, she gave us some really good recommendations for restaurants and activities and even went the extra mile by ordering a personalized birthday cake for my partner! The room was big, clean and with an amazing view. The hotel has many things available: from casino to restaurants and shops, many things to do and not enough time! :) Check out process was easy and fast and the in-dining room is outstanding too! I strongly recommend…",50
"It is a very nice hotel with so many things available here. There is a casino, gandola ride, shopping mall, restaurant etc. what else one need in a hotel. Even if you are not staying in the hotel, you can come and enjoy all these things I mentioned. From Hong Kong, you can come by Star Ferry and from the Macau port buses are provided by Venetian free of cost not only at the time of pickup but also at the time of drop. What else you expect from a hotel.",50
"I stayed two nights in bella suite, a very big room. Except 2 queen size beds, there is a separate living room with great view, and a huge bathroom which contains separate shower and bath, and two sinks. Although it's non-smoking room, it still had cigarette smoke and I couldn't sleep well. The next day morning, I reflected this issue to the reception, they immediately offered to change to another room, but I was lazy to change, so just asked them to spray some fragrance to solve it.  The check-in lobby is beautiful, the ceiling was painted of the Renaissance-ish. All staff is very nice and polite, but waiting time to check in took too long, nearly 30 mins, while check out was just a piece of cake as every morning there is always staff on 1st floor of every elevator for quick…",50
"Getting here from HKIA was easy. We had no check in luggage, otherwise tag your luggage at checkin counter (we came from Singapore) heading to Macau. Upon arrival follow signs or ask ground staff where to buy ferry tickets. Do not exit out of immigration. Buy tickets at HK$254 to either ferry terminals and take free shuttle to hotel. From Taipa ferry terminal 10 min to hotel and the other one 20 min to hotel. Ferry duration :70 min.  This hotel is massive. Checkin was the only negative complaint having to wait 30 min .The room is huge with a grand bathroom and a sitting room as depicted in all the photos. Free water is provided. Free fast wifi .Great and comfortable stay.  The casino is also huge with smoking and non smoking areas. Then there are the shops - mazes of shops from…",50
"The good: 1. we stayed in their bella suite. It is huge. it can fit 4 people. and we got the city view which is great 2. the mall in venetian is the best and most happening in macau hands down. the famous lord stow egg tart also has a branch here which is great 3. wi fi is strong 4. offers shuttle to galaxy, ports, studio city. hotel is intervonnected and walkable to parisian, sands and four seasons  The bad: 1. Staffs / receptionist are not very fluent in English. Sometimes it is very frustating to get info from them. quite surprising 2. the shuttle may be run by third party but somehow the ones in venetian is the rudest. one lady staff there pointed finger at me while im on the bus and glared while saying ""NO EAT"" twice like i killed somebody. Firstly, there is no sign of no…",40
"Hi,  I travelled with family to the hotel, it is a beautiful hotel absolutely stunning more like an art gallery.  Room sizes are good and pretty comfortable as well. It is such a huge hotel that it almost always takes time to check in.   They have an amazing casino, Indian restaurant serves very nice food.   Have some nice shows and entertainment happening more or less all the time.   It can be good fun and some really nice leisure time to be at the hotel!   Cheers",40
"This hotel was not busy, but as was not long after Chinese New Year, perhaps this was the reason why.....hotel was very clean, room was very generous for a family of 4, and staff were very helpful and friendly. There are 4 pools, one of which is heated as February was cold! Pool was very quiet and on one of the days, we were the only one poolside! Shops on floor 3 are fantastic and great selection. Would recommend this hotel for families.",50
"we had been with a large group of lion club members ,some years back, it was a fascination to see the ambience and expanse of this superb resort,the rooms were good and clean, the staff was taxed and so  service was slow as there was a crowd for check in. good restaurants",50
A great experience staying at this hotel. Great strip view and a wonderful big room with an A++ decor. The bed was very comfortable. We later contacted the hotel to see what brand the mattress was so we could purchase one as we had the best sleep. Friendly and helpful staff. The size of this hotel and what it has to offer will blow you away. Highly recommend to stay at Venetian a delightful stay!,50
"Good experience for this hotel! Other then having to wait for almost 1 hr to check in. But while checking in, the staffs does help us rearrange our rooms together even when we did not request for it while we booked online. Thank you! The rooms is huge!!° ",50
Room size is very generous for a family of 4 persons. We had 2 queen beds on a non-smoking floor. There is a living area which is great for TV and chilling time for those who do not wish to sleep early. My parents had a great time and had raving reviews on the room. This is my third visit there and will certainly be back. P.S. Hotel can consider upgrading the TV to a flat screen one though :),50
We are so delighted to have a free upgrade to the newly renovated room located at the South Wing. The view is nice and the furnish is so new that they even have 2 BIG TVs within the suite. Everything is feeling so good and the free small birthday cake (best to email in advance) is so delicious and touching. Thank you so much and hope to stay in again soon.,50
The 2 nights spent in this hotel was extremely splendid. It is a luxurious hotel with a huge mall to buy your chic clothes and expensive existentia .Their was a enormous food court with varieties of cuisines of different countries to choose from . I would highly recommened this resort . You passionately should visit this hotel.,50
Only few hours but its memorable one. The soprano gondola singer are fabulous. Theres evisu n superdry outlet. When we arrive at the stage there a live performance. The shuttle from macao ferry terminal are free n always available. Thx,50
"It was really amazing to get the winter celebration package for The Venetian. We loved our stay and above that we got free lunch and macao tour included in our package. The property is supreme and is an amazing shoppers paradise.  Being a vegetarian, the Golden Peacock Restaurant is an amazing place. I would highly recommend this property for any traveller (couple) to Macao.",50
"A week after visiting Shenzhen, we went to Macao for the weekend and stayed at the Venetian for one night (Saturday, February 11, 2017,).  What can one say about this hotel? Its big, shiny dazzling! The rooms are vary spacious and well appointed, yet I felt that there was something missing. Room service is painfully slow, it took more than two calls to get water in the room. The mall with its hundreds and hundreds of stores gives it a nice touch and the gondola ride is very nice. The hotel is very pricey. Is it worth the money? Thats debatable! My children liked the Crown Plaza hotel better.  Would I stay here again? Maybe not, I am sure there are other hotels around with the same quality for less.",40
"Coming from a 2 night stay in HK with 2 very small rooms, we were delighted that my husband's cousin booked this hotel for our stay in Macau.  The room (standard suite) was so lovely and very spacious, more than enough to accommodate 3 adults.     Free shuttle to and from the HK Ferry terminal and/or the airport is a very big plus (though I think most hotels offer this as well).   Shopping, eating or just wandering around has never been so easy.    Warning:  Queue could be long when checkin in and you could get lost on your way back to your room so be sure to take a map with you.  Having said that, I would still recommend The Venetian to any traveller and we will definitely choose this hotel again should be go back to Macau.",50
We very much enjoyed our honeymoon stay here. Cafe Deco was a very good experience for both staff and food. The room was a bit pricey but was very nice. We did not do much for shopping but there are many shops if you are into that. ,40
"There are a lot to see in Venetian hotel. We picked the gondola ride mostly for the kids, there  are 3 canals in the Venetian hotel, they are short, just one or two turns, however, the gondoliers are very experienced, and our gondolier is a wonderful and lovely lady, who sang quite a few amazing pieces in professional style. The ticket can be bought online from Taobao agencies, and much cheaper than to buy on site.",50
Had the privilege for express check in and didn't have to queue (the check in queue was horrible). Rooms was luxurious especially the toilet but decorations was a little old already. Overall it was a great stay! ,40
"Huge and beautiful room, nicely and thoughtfully renovated. Comes with 2 huge TVs and multiple USB ports all over the room!  Even comes with a Vidal Sassoon hairdryer with retractable cord!   The hotel even offered a late checkout at 4pm.  Truly impressed!",50
"For me, first time traveling with my new born baby, experienced an amazing and fabulous journey in the venetian.  Their guest relations service is excellent. As I informed them I am accompanied with my little boy, who is two-months old, baby cot is arranged. Without any requests, they provides me a little piece if cake and hand written greeting card for my birthday celebration.   The venetian is definitely suitable for family with children. There are non smoking floor, which the guests have to signed the agreement of penalty of MOP1600 if violated.   Surprisingly, the Venetian Hotel provided free upgrade of the room, the decor and furniture maintained in a clean and neat way. My family have a full of warm and happy night there.  The staffs is polite and kind even loads of…",50
"If you're visiting Macau then do not think to stay in any other hotel. This property is like a dream to stay and explore.   Breathtaking interiors, worlds biggest casino, in-built mall, numerous restaurants, inside lake with gondola ride, this hotel is everything u have ever dreamed off.   First hotel I have seen which gives hotel map while check-in so that u can explore every corner of hotel.   Recommended is small word for this property. GO FOR IT.",50
"It is one of the best hotel i have ever been to.It was a very good experience staying there.The hotel has very good food courts with lots of option to choose from including Indian food , great shopping hub.Only the downside was the locks and health faucet were missing in the bathrooms.Otherwise the whole hotel was like a hybrid of a Mall and a Hotel.",50
"Stayed in Vegas already and was curious to compare. It was a surreal experience to be in a Venice inspired mega hotel/casino here as well. The place is huge, best is to plan your activities and get a map. Shopping is great. The casino athmosphere here was not my favorite, too many people pushing, shouting. I preferred the Wynn casino for the ambience.  Easy access to the Parisian next door, also to other hotels using the shuttle buses. ",50
"This hotel is absolutely beautiful.  The interior windows in my room looked out over the ""river"".  It is unbelievable to see how they could make it look just like I was looking outside upon a river with Gondolas.  This has to be one of the most unique experiences I have had the chance to enjoy.  You will not be disappointed.",50
"The place is huge and even after tough competition from the new and upcoming properties like the Galaxy hotel, it still has a charm of its own. It has something for everyone: Casino's, Shops, Resturants and not to forget unlimited free wifi!  There's not much to to outdoors so a value for money hotel as you'll be spending a lot of time in the hotel. Talking about the rooms: The size of their washroom would put many 5-star suites to shame (Not Kidding), Also, do try their mini-golf and one of their pools.",50
"very beautiful hotel, lovely rooms, spacious bathroom.  Too big as a hotel , no of receptions specially for bulk booking. It will take at least 2 days to know where you are going. you will have to remember marks or you get lost. regional food for group travelers can be made on prior request. gondola is fine. casino is best as casino in other hotels dosen't have so much people and looks empty. lovely pools.",50
"5 star hotel with the biggest casino in Macao. Also as a huge mall with all international brands. The mall tried to reproduce Venice city with the canals and even the gondolas . The hotel, it self, doesn't seems to be the very best in Macao, but is for sure one of the most impressive. Great location in taipa island, near by the other hotels and casinos. Inside everything is impressive, the size, quantity of people",40
What a show! Went to the penultimate 20th anniversary show at the Venetian theatre. Great effects lighting seating to see such a fantastic show. Prices of tickets were really good value and combined with return ferry from Hong Kong was a relatively cheap day out! Don't miss the egg tarts in the lobby areas ,50
What a wonderful hotel.  Haven't been to the Las Vegas Venetian but it seems it is built exactly the same way.  Casino is huge and awesome. A lot of options of shopping and restaurant.  Wonderful Artificial sky and the lake at the Venetian .,50
"So I have stopped at the Venetian in Las Vegas which is my favourite hotel, this doesn't quite get there mainly due to the lack of bars to drink at, Macau really is just about gambling and here they have the biggest casino floor I have ever seen.  Rooms are fantastic, a replica of the LV version and the staff are very helpful but at this price I expect a few bars to drink in not just the one.",40
"Stayed here one night. Have never seen a room better and bigger!What a great experience. The bathroom was huge, the bed was so comfy I just wanted to stay there forever) We enjoyed the big TV and my bf said the pool was fantastic there)Definitely worth the price!",50
"We loved our spacious room although it shows signs of aging. The living room TV is still a tube! And the bedroom LCD is definitely one of those first generation LCD's.   Bathroom is pretty luxurious, although one of the double sinks' faucet leaked.   Breakfast buffet spread at cafe deco for the 2 mornings we were there was very standard, nothing to write home about.   ",40
"Rooms: the rooms are extremely spacious and comfortable. We had a great view of the Macau skyline  Service: room service is as you would expect from a hotel like the venetian spot on! They were courteous, accommodating of requests and fast to respond  Food: lot of options are available to cater for different palates and budgets with fine dining options as well as wide variety of choices in the food court which are reasonably priced and offer food from all over the world  Casino: they have an enormous casino floor so if your in a group it is advisable to move together as you can find it difficult to find people. Bar services on the floor are very slow as they seemed under staffed and one server had to cater for too big an area to serve effectively  Other activities: lots of…",50
Quite bizarre to see a replica of Vegas on the edge of China! Hard to tell the difference from the inside. Great hotel and our room was large and spacious. Well maintained and would recommend staying here. Casino was good and most games we've never seen before.,50
Our visit to the Venetian at macau was totally worth it. Try your luck at the casino on the ground floor. A replica of Venice is made on the upper level it will take you to Venice its like one plus one free. Gondola a must do at Venetian. There would be a blue colored shuttle bus free of coat this bus would shut down at 12 midnight. Taxis would be  available to come back to the hotel. Remember try and visit venitian by 6 pm in the evening you will have enough time to soak up the ambience. ,50
Amazing place and stay . Entire property is mesmerising . They have in house casinos on entire  floor. Multiple restaurants and food court too. There is an Indian restaurant also at food court . Shopping hub !! Omg what to say about those stores . All international premium brands  are available . I found this property amazing to stay in entire Macau . ,50
"The hotel is grand and service is exceptional, as the employees were accommodating when we arrived.  A personal driver picked us up at the airport, and were greeted with refreshments in a lounge area while checking in.  The room was huge complete with a guest bathroom, lounge area, dining area, office area, and a separate bedroom with a huge bathroom and separate dressing room.  It was traditionally decorated with a regal Venetian theme that complimented the hotel's overall atmosphere.  Compared to the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas, this one might be bigger but I have to say the quality and intricacy of the design, architecture, and decor is better at the one in Las Vegas.  Nonetheless, the hotel is very nice and in several ways reminiscent to the real Venice, Italy, especially in…",40
This hotel is really beautiful with spunchy great things to see. There is a lot to do and a lot of good restaurants . During the walkabout you can see some great things including great paintings . Definitely worth a visit. ,40
Very impressive hotel in Macau. Room is big and tidy. My son love it very much cause very big space for them to play around. Besides hotel have many shop to hanging around but all is very expensive and branded.,40
The stay in Venetian is really awesome. The rooms are huge and the bath rooms are also quite big. There are so many activities to do that you don't find a need to go out of the hotel itself. The food court is also good. The place needs at least one full day to explore. The casino is also very good. Overall a great stay,50
"I had such an amazing stay with my friend. they have free shuttle from ferry. while check-in they offer you complimentary water bottles. Rooms are so beautiful, spacious and view. I love my stay like a king. this was first time luxury hotel in my life. the  big swimming pool. big range of breakfast. they aware about Indian tourist and lots of choices with Indian menu too.  for sure I will recommend everyone as well love to go back in venation.",50
"I was in Macau on November and visited the Venetian Hotel Food Court at Cotai. Had a fantastic time and had lunch on more than 1 occasion during my visit. Dined with friends and enjoyed a huge variety of reasonably priced food from different asian locales and styles of food.  Price was reasonable when you had regard to the fact that it was a food court in an expensive Casino resort. I am sure there is cheaper outlets outside the Casino environment but the experience is good, the food tasty and the environment you eat in clean tidy and easy to access.   Service was good and the food was very enjoyable.  I will eat here again next time i visit Macau. Try it and you won't be disappointed.",50
"Picked up at harbour by free shuttle bus, there was a gentleman waiting with a sign for the hotel. Check in was busy, with quite a long queue, had to wait about 20 minutes. There had been an email sent to me a few days prior for pre- registration/self check in, but as we had been traveling and no access to printer, this wasn't possible.... online would be better. Room was huge, clean, comfortable bed. Pool area was very nice, staff were friendly.  Massive shopping area. Air con was set too cold in the public areas,so we always needed to wear a warm jumper. Ate in the Indian restaurant and food was good. Food court was poor.",40
"Our experience with Venetian started as early as I booked the room and informed Venetian staff about the special occasion for I which I was coming for. The Venetian staff was very proactive in responding to my request and arranged great amenity for us to make our day special. On reaching macau ferry terminal we were able to get the free shuttle to the hotel quite easily. Upon arrival, the check in was smooth as we reached late in the evening thus avoiding rush. The room was special with a good view and great amenities.  The overall experience at the venetian, the casino and the other public areas such as the food court, shoppes, canals was really special as the enormity of it takes some time to sink in but when it has sunk it you will feel great to be here. Special mention for…",50
"the newly renovated Rialto suit rooms are worth every penny.  a flawless experience, the venetian is an 'older' property in cotai, but  its very well run and would be less sure about some of the newer places.",50
"Hotel is huge and well designed. A not very nice experience was when I got off the shuttle bus, my lugages were put on the pedestrian, then I had to take care of them by myself into my room. I came not in a peak season, so the que in the reception was not too long. The receptionist was very nice and helpfull explaining the room, the offer to upgrade, and other things I need to know. The standard room is large, 70m2, nicely laid out and decorate. It is very clean and neath. I was very impressed. In room dining was quick. Table was set up properly. The stay connected, standard free internet is provided throgh out all Sand's properties around. I got free fast internet in the room. Meals included in the room rate was a surprise to me. This was my first experience to have a choice of…",50
"Vacation Paradise , ,the room is very clean and lot of room space to move around ,more ,and mush cleaner them Vegas  ! front desk staff is excellent  , it is so easy  to get here from H.K ,by sea ,air ,land ,the place and the hotel twenty fours full of alive ,with the hustle and bustle ,the Cotar Strip  are inspired by Vegas  strip ,and have well over 30 hotels around  it is 100 % replica of Vegas !  fake or not ,it is wonderful city to vista , the sightseers  ,gambling , shopping ,entertainment , is well above Vegas ! so ,members if you wonder where to go for your next holidays , special from Vancouver  B. C ,this is the great get away , you need less over 2 weeks to enjoy it ! Happy Chinese New Year .",50
"One of the best hotels I stayed in so far. Excellent rooms, fabulous ambience totally mesmerised me. Peacock restaurant is class, serving great food. Restaurant Deco was another great place to have food. Hotel layout is so big by the time I understood It was time to check out. I missed few shows. It offers everything you a looking for in Macau. It I have spare money anytime I would lone to revisit Hotel. Best was it's special food suitable for Indian vegetarians. A great place to make HOLIDAYS. ;♡♡",50
"I visited Venetian Macau last year, just impressed with the scale oh Hotel. You need days to explore every part. Don't miss the lobby, reminds you of Italy. Rooms are bigger and bathroom is one of the biggest I have ever stayed. Shopping, entertainment, gondola rides, pool are great. Casinos - one of the best!  Highly recommended!! Would like to visit again!!",50
"I did not stay at the hotel, but the resort is very beautiful just like the one in Las Vegas, the staff are very nice to visitors and there is even a free bus service that takes you to the hotel for free.  The next time I will go back to Macao I will definitely stay here.",50
"i will mention few points about the property and its facilities 1. They provide free shuttle service every 15 mins from almost all places in Macau like ferry terminal, airport etc. 2. Water is provided free of cost everywhere in the Hotel so no need to buy water. 3. Casino is open only for person above 21 years of age. 4. you have to ask for drinks in the casino and there is no regular drinks supply in Casino. i am talking about soft drinks. 5. Its huge, includes Shopping mall, gandola ride, Casino, Restaurants, Food court etc. 6. Golden peacock is an indian restaurant in the premise and is wonderful according to indian taste buds. 7. The rooms are spacious and view is wonderful, everything is nicely planned and bath tubs are quite spacious and luxurious. 8. everything is in…",50
"We stayed 02 nights in Royale Cotai View Suite. Has nice view during the day and night time. Has shops and restaurants, and of course casinos. You basically will feel that Venetian is huge.  My god. It is so specious and I feel like a princess.  As you know Macao is full of casinos, free bus shuttles and full of yummy stalls or food.  I love how clean and shiny the room was. Even room service was great. We ordered in-suite dining pizza at 2:00AM and it tasted superb.  Venetian is within walking distance to Old Taipa Village, they have walkalators nearby, basically just get out of west lobby, turn to your right, until you see a pedestrian bridge, then you will see the walkway and walkalators leading you to the Taipa Village.  You can walk from Venetian to Hard Rock, Parisian or…",50
"We have hired the Rialto Suite and we had the best experience ever! The room was spacious and well maintained. We absolutely LOOVED IT........And when we told the very helpful concierge we were there on honeymoon, we got another free ride with the limousine from hotel to ferry terminal ! And they also delivered a surprise ice-cream cake to us to congratulate us.....they are such wonderful hosts! We love their amazing heated pools, and the concierge at the VIP lounge was always very helpful and attentive. And we love staying and using the VIP lounge, the food was amazing ! We love every minute of our stay in the Venetian Macao, and we would definitely come back and stay at their suite rooms again next time.",50
"Beautiful rooms, spacious, clean, organized. Service was good. On some occasions it was slow. Maybe we were a really big group.OverAll it was a great experience and will come back.👍👏  The checkin line was really long, lot of wait.however we told the attendant at the queue that my mum could not stand for a long time in the queue, he let us use the priority line.  I was able to book my ferry ticket from the hotel.  Cabs were readily available.   Although the breakfast queue and system was a bit weird..show breakfast coupons... they take them and then someone else returns them.  ",50
"Overwhelmed by the scale of this hotel, it's like a small city. You cannot help but be impressed by it. The rooms (suites) are very nice, the shops/casino etc are awesome. Lots of Money going around in here. If anything negative, be prepared for a frantic time once you leave the quiet of your suite. ",40
"excellent resort to spend time with your family. huge casino, great rooms and excellent service. the shuttle to ferry terminal was excellent and food was also good. in room dining includes few indian main course dishes and was nice. overall an excellent hotel with an excellent food court and shopping mall inside the hotel. an excellent experience.",40
"5 stars for everything,  the mall,  the rooms,  size,  view, supoorting staff,  ease of access to facilities.  For Indian travellers please take a charging plug converter with you coz the voltage plugs bere are different. ",50
Free return shuttle service from the ferry terminal to the hotel and what an amazing place. I have visited so many casinos but this has been the best by far.  The shopping area is huge and the food court has so many varieties of food. The Venetian building is very very impressive and I am at awe watching it.  A place to visit if I am back again in the future.,50
"The hotel was great and easy to find food and anything where all the shop is in the hotel also casino. And you will never feel alone while u in this resort. Room suite is70sqm  And free shuttle bus from ferry terminal, every 15minutes  Room is Very nice 😍😍",40
"We stayed at the Venetian Hotel resort Macau for a few days in January 2017 and had a great stay in a great hotel. The rooms are large and very well presented. There was 2 queen beds and a lounge that could also be used as a sofa bed, 2 TVs a large bathroom and overall it was very good value for money. The hotel facilities are very good with lots to see and do for the non gambler. There is easy access to other hotel casinos and the up market shopping as well as a decent sized food court inside the hotel itself. A great place to stay for someone going to Macau at a very reasonable price. ",50
Everything was good! Only except it took me too long to check in. I have a mind to stay here again if I visit macau next time.  아주 예쁜 방이었고 특히 화장실이 맘에 들었어요! 갤럭시 호텔을 마주하고 있어 밤낮으로 조망이 좋고 가격은 1박에 27만원 정도로 묵었는데 가격 대비 괜찮다고 생각합니다.   다만 체크인이 한시간 넘게 걸려서 너무 힘들었고 내부에 편의점이 없어요.,50
"The Venetian Hotel is one of the hotels we have always lived in prior to arriving in Macau for a relaxing holiday. The room suites were really big and the smallest suites own 70 Square Meters in total. We lived in the big suite which is 170 Square Meters and features an enormously large living room and a bedroom, with a marble bathroom which consist of a bathtub. The coffee and bottled water were complimentary given which was nice. The interior of the hotel was grand, formal and nicely designed overall. The cleaning was good and no rubbish was left behind after they had cleaned the room everyday. The price was rather cheap, our room was about $1800 per night when the normal price of the room (from the wardrobe) was over $10000 HKD! Overall, an excellent hotel with good…",50
We did not stay here but visited the place and the Casino. Italy beautifully created with actual gondolas etc. Lots of options for shopping too. The place is lit up at night and looks stunning from outside.Must visit place to experience Macau even if not staying here.,50
"The room at the Venetian is really spacious and well kept. I had a good view of the other resorts in Taipa from my window, as well as a view of the mini golf course that the Venetian has. The Venetian itself has very amazing decor, with fountains and murals on the ceilings and walls. I feel the atmosphere created by the decor does somewhat emulate that of Venice, especially with the gondola rides.",50
"From the Gondola rides to the vibe, The Venetian is like being in Italy but in Asia.  With over 380 shops and loads of entertainment this hotel and shopping is a must!!  The family suite is amazing with a deluxe King size bed for Parents and a separate Kiddies section with bunk beds, their own TV, DVD player and Wii, the kids will be excited and entertained for hours.  The room is spacious and comfortable with everything one needs for luxury.",50
Been here quite a while which really attracts the main land Chinese for gambling. Now the numbers are not so great. The India is another group which visit a lot. The room really attracts me with unique layout and design. One side can view the swimming pool and the other side is the golf course. The main casino is at level one with the east and west lobby at either side. Awaiting the next stay.,40
Absolutely wonderful stay in the venetian macau. The room is very spacious and the bathroom is one of the biggest bathroom that I've ever stayer. Check in time is at 1 pm and only 1 person to check in to avoid congestion in the reception area. Staffs are helpful and ready to answer your questions. The standard suite room (Bella Suite) is one of the largest in town. The bad thing is they provide free shuttle bus to outer ferry terminal starts from 9.30 am when I need to catch a ferry at 10 am so I must take a taxi to the ferry terminal. ,50
"The room we had was excellent. Clean, light, good view, spacious, with a lovely big bathroom. When the staff found out we were on honeymoon, they sent us a delicious surprise chocolate cake to our room. Good value for money.   The shuttle from the ferry port was very efficient, and free.  The resort itself is pretty tacky and basically one big mall - but it's impressive nonetheless!  The casino was better than the one we visited in the Parisian.  Tip; don't get Macau dollars. The casino only takes HKD, and you will need to exchange them at a bad rate.  ",40
"We were a goup of 5 friends, so we took the Bella suite, with 2 king size double beds and a comfy sofa in the living room area, but who needed sleep? If you imagine getting a hint of what Venice looks like, forget it! There is a 'canal' with gondolas manned by Chinese gondoliers, there is also a fake painted sky, meandering through a shopping gallery ressembling a mall. There are ample spaces, lavishly decorated and generously lit, deep rugs, well, there's too much of everything! Bewildering by sheer size,but once you get over the first impression, you realize how kitchy it all is. The general idea is that the Chinese were mesmerised, whereas the ( few) Europeans had another point of view. Well, if you're certain you'll never get to Venice, this is probably the next best…",50
Excellent hotel with well organised staff. Really enjoyed stay for a night. Easy to go Taipa area and City of Dreams and Parisien by walk. Shuttle bus is really great. Very convenient travel to airport or Ferry Terminal. Superb!,50
"Booked the Bella Suite; very spacious and can accommodate six adults plus 2 kids because in addition to the two queen beds, there is a sofa bed which can be turned out into another bed for sleeping! Very comfortable and clean. Requested to be placed on a non-smoking floor with a view --  was given the Galaxy view which was spectacular at night! The staff are very courteous and helpful as well, especially those assigned in housekeeping and front desk.",50
"This area is just casinos. Came via Cotai Jet ferry and was able to reach this hotel through the shuttle bus.   Very big, very clean and good hotel. We got the suite. It was magnificient.  We had a conference in Venetian so it was good walking distance to our conference in the same hotel.  Food here is good (except for the food court, avoid that) in all of the different restaurants. The best I've had is Tian Yi restaurant at the mall side. It was delicious!!!",50
Attentive receptionist who spotted my family of 5. Sandy from The Venetian Macau manning the Invited Guest counter suggested to deploy the sofa bed before I request for it. Children can also go to the Qube and have a great 2 hours fun. Lots of games and activities in Qube.,50
"We have very much enjoyed our stay at the Venetian. We spent 4 nights after having time in Hong Kong also. Check in is probably a big down fall. We have honestly never spent so long in a check in line anywhere in the world (30 minutes)  Our room is amazing, clean and beautiful. We are not smokers and are traveling with children and the hallway to the room has always smelt strongly of smoke & we are on a non smoking floor ( you even walk through smoke haze at times) However our room did not smell of smoke which was the main thing. Breakfast at Cafe downstairs is OK, nothing spectacular. People do not speak English well or understand English well compared to Hong Kong here.  Place is so big and lots of fun We stayed at Venetian in Las Vegas, USA last year and although it is great…",50
"Fantastic hotel with huge room, we have 4 people (2 adults and 2 teenage children), still very big room for 4 of us.  We stayed at Venetian for 2 nights and 3 days.  Very happy with the services and shuttle buses services, really convenience to go around the city.  Most staff can speak very good English, good enough Chinese.  The food course has so much to choice from, all very tasty food.    The shops seems open 24 hours, not sure.  But no super market, so you can't buy daily produce if you have baby with you.   The only issue is too many people, lots of them are not staying at Venetian, they come and visit the Casino and shops.  It is a good thing for business, it also means that you can't have peace and quiet place on the hotel ground.   The end of the day, this is happy and…",40
ok so if ur visiting HK just book a day tour to macau by ferry. cotaijet is good. its 'casino country' with 36 large casino chains from all over the world. thats more casinos than churches and temples in this small 30 sq km place. dont miss macau tower that is the highest point for bungee jumping or sky walks! the venetian resort with casino and gondola that will remind you of italian water ways and indoor blue sky is a spectacular sight. Macau is not as organized as HK but it is a good thing to do a day trip. more than that is good only if ur a gambler! ,40
"Stayed at the hotel over the Christmas holidays with the family and it was a good experience overall. There were various options like the gondola trips, shopping arena, activities for kids, decent leisure facilities which would keep the family occupied and not to forget the casino options. What could be improved - I understand that this is a huge hotel property. There has been a long waiting time for checking in although there was an option of express check out. It is a long walk from the check in area to the rooms corridor( I was allocated a room at the North wing). Positives - great staff. I have had a young lady from Portugal checking us in . The concierge staff was extremely helpful and informative, the housekeeping staff worked their best for a good experience. Another…",40
"Probably the biggest rooms in Macau, the smallest size is quite big with a living area . If you manage to get a bargain during sales, it's really worth the money. Lots of things to do and see in hotel itself, and the interior is nicely decorated. Not much complaints with this hotel, everything expected. Great for couples or family.",40
Very well located and reachable. Shuttle services are great and you can reach anywhere in the city/ country. Staff is friendly and very supportive. I would definitely stay there again and recommend it.,40
"I would say of all the hotels I have stayed so far, Venetian provides the biggest room. However, the hotel can adopt the good practice from galaxy hotel by providing free refreshment for the first time in the mini bar. The internet in my room always has intermittent disconnection. Every 5 minute, I would need to reset the router and I have informed the front desk, the technician only reset the router for us . Upon check out, I reiterate to the check out staff, hope they will take note of this issue.",40
paradise in macau..beautiful property with canals and gondolas and an awesome sky.. completely take you to the city of venice accompanied by the lovely song at the gondola ride. shopping paradise which has almost all the brands under the sun to offer. great eating places ... can spend 4 to 5 hours or more easily.,50
"we went for the Christmas week of December 23 to 26.  Check was smooth thanks to Jason Fu at the front desk who guided us properly and gave us a room in the south wing near the food court.  Only think not liked was that inspite of booking directly with the hotel, could not get the booking for breakfast with characters at Shrekfast (Suggest people to do advance booking).  Gandola ride was nice but very short.  A tad expensive.  Rooms were nice.  The food court is not very cheap.",40
Excellent hotel with well organised staff.The hotel is worth the money charged.Its a huge hotel with more than 3000 suites and i would say its an experience to stay in this hotel.The check in and check out was very quick and transfer to the Taipa terminal was without any problem...would love to stay again.,50
Love the room condition. Really enjoyed stay for a night. Everyone was really kind and nice. Easy to go Taipa area and City of Dreams and Parisien by walk. It wasn't take more than 10 mins. And I really loved shuttle bus too.,50
"The hotel is excellent. More than 3000 suites. 24hrs casino. Indian restaurant GOLDEN PEACOCK and also CAFE MOMO (coffee shop) serving Indian dinner. Excellent food at both places. Food court on level 3 serving multi cuisine food including Indian too, veg as well as non veg. The 3rd level also has a huge shopping arcade. Gondola rides available too at level 3 at a cost. Qube at level 3 is a recreational place for the kids. Swimming pool and golf course at level 5. One can also avail of the free shuttle buses from the west wing of the hotel to visit other hotels too, including the Galaxy hotel, City of dreams, etc. Indeed a hotel not to be missed when in macau.",50
In one line stay in this property  and facilities there in may be described  'If one stays here alone or with family  he/she  will never regret'  Even standard  room has basic suit out lay and facilities  and gives the comfort of a hotel  suit  Every luxury  is avilable as per  local but at  affordable  traiff  Staff very courtious food quality even for vegetarians are very good and hygienic   Sleep Quality in rooms excellent  For indians two tv chanel in Hindi are avilable What ever one needs in a hotel stay all is there . It has probably second biggest casino in the area .I am told it has 3000 rooms  Chek in and chek out are hassle free  ,50
"I was there with my parents, uncle and aunt. The property was splendid and is worth the money charged. The various restaurants serve great quality food and the room services were really good.  Shall definitely visit again",50
"The Venetian is very BIG and super busy. If you expect to e pampered as you alight and take in the sights -- forget it! The lobby is teeming with people (200-300 of them during holidays) with not a chair to rest your legs. So, you wonder if you took the right decision in booking here!! If you get an email a day or two before check-in about registering for express check-in, it is wise to do that. Will save you at least 45 minutes.  Staff are well trained and have seen large(r) crowds -- they handle things with efficiency. They provide you with a map of the hotel and believe me, it is a saviour. The hotel is super big (as with all others at Macau), you will to be walking down endless corridors and walkways with the finest brands located on either side - and, if you have kids under…",40
"The combination of picturesque structures and romantic sceneries made my quick visit to Macau lasting and memorable. It is more budget-friendly to cross Macau through water jet from Hongkong. It saves time from arranging flight tickets, etc.",40
"One of the brilliant and luxurious stay in my travel history. Pricey but worth it. Hotel is in prime location on Cotai Strip.  Spacious and cozy room. Beds were very comfortable. Bathroom felt royal.  Its a single point destination. Casino, Restaurants, Shopping, Gondola Rides are all in the building. Indian food is also available.  Huge hotel with lots to see.  Free shuttle available from & to airport and almost to all other Casinos.  Swimming pool, gym and mini golf course available.",40
"The place is buzzing with activities with visitors and hotel guests alike.  Free wifi is very strong and good almost all over the hotels and the room is very big for 4 of us.  The service staff was really good with attention to minute detail to increase the number of amenities to 4 of us even for the drinking mugs in the room. Housekeeping was efficient for such a big hotel and when one of us was sick, the direction to seek medical help was clear and helpful.",40
"The nearest ferry terminal to reach The Venetian Hotel would be from Taipa Macau Ferry Terminal. The shuttle bus is provided every 10 to 15 minutes and the journey takes around 10 minutes to reach to the hotel.  The bus will drop you at the main lobby so you may request via email for express check in 2 days before arrival from the reservation team. Upon arrival, you can avoid the long queue by picking up the key prepared at the Express Check in Counter.  Please request for rooms located in South Wing as the food court is located just beside South Wing lobby.  We stayed at Bella Suite Category since it comes with 2 Queen beds which are suitable for family of 4. The only setback about this hotel is there's long queue for everything eg. long queue to check in, check out or even for…",40
Rather looks old. No changes for the room. Alley carpet look old and bit smelly. All still the same. Only room spacy than other hotel. Maybe new hotel arround is more actractive to try. Not recomended for more than one times stay. Better try parasian paris. Also locate in same complex and connect to venetian macau hotel.,50
"I visited Venetian before, about few years ago. I found that there is some changes which is more friend to me, like the USB charger, free wifi, new TV.... I also requested some facilities for my baby, it can be provided, like baby bed, potty, tub, very useful for my baby",50
"It truly is very royal as the title says it all..... The Venetian at Macau. Located at the posh heart of the city with a view of the Cotai strip, this a huge Resort styled Luxury Hotel. The name comes from the so called Venice which has been dubbed at this Hotel with a canal like that of the ones in Venice in Italy and the rich and posh branded stores to give a finishing touch to the place. The view from the property is amazing which faces the very grand property The Galaxy. There are a few restaurants located within the property one with a Indian touch called The Golden Peacock and one called Cafe Deco both of which have a good menu on the table. However finding your way to your room might take a lot of your time.....Staying in the property for a night is just a waste of money…",50
"located in the Taipa side, it is convenient to walk to the Taipa Village approx 10 mins and have an authentic Macannese cuisine and famous Durian ice cream (Mok Yi Kei) for dessert. the famous pork chop bun, Tai Lei Loi Kei is also in the village but sadly was closed. They always close early as soon as they finished selling their goods but luckily, they opened several branches in Macau. Beautifully decorated for the Christmas season.",50
The hotel grounds are huge and the rooms spacious and luxurious.The toiletries are all paraban and other chemicals free which is a lovely touch. Loved how the rooms are built. It's spacious and chic with lots of gold colors giving you that luxurious feeling. The bed is awesome. I got a very good nights sleep daily for the entire duration of my stay. The rooms are cleaned daily. The safe has a built in power socket so you can charge your phone or any device you choose to lock in there. The windows are huge but remember to close the curtains as they clean them regularly. The hotel put a card near the window to remind guests about it. Breakfast was only available in room nd you had to pay for it. In short everything you need is in the room. Some rooms can be far away from the main…,50
The rooms and service are better than any other property in Macau. The rooms are big and have every facility you can think of. The hotel is so big that you need a map to roam around. The best part is the casino which has all kinds of games you can play. Its always full so you'll not feel alone ever. This is only hotel in Macau where you can get pure veg food. The rooms make you feel like you are staying in a palace of old times with all modern facilities. The only bad part was no windows so you can't enjoy fresh air.  The room service was quick and had many options available. There are all luxury brand outlets in the hotel itself for shopaholics.   We faced some problems due to long waiting at reservation center but the rooms made up for that.  The staff is courteous and helps…,50
"The hotel is nothing less than a royal experience! The rooms are very spacious with an excellent view with loads of amenities. Bathrooms are huge too! Overall, we loved the experience and do plan to visit again!",50
"This hotel was probably one of those that would be in my above average list. Clean carpeted room, with plenty of space and totally edges out the Parisian despite its lower rate. I had two TVs in my room, two beds and a sofa-bed that were all in really good condition. Facilities were top-notch. Special mention to the gym, where there was good air conditioning provided unlike many other hotels in China that I stayed in, Bottled water and a cold/hot water dispenser were all provided, as well as cold towels if needed. Equipment was all clean and almost brand new, if I had a gym like that at home I would go for a workout everyday! Walk down and you are already at the shops with so much variety to choose from. Brands fit for various consumers were all available, and is a really big…",40

"This hotel is an iconic landmark in Macao. It houses a huge casino and is famous for its   architecture which has been lovingly made to resemble Venice. The roof looks like the azure sky. It even has a gandola ride to make you experience Venice's famous boat ride.    And you get lots of food options. They house the Golden Peacock an Indian restaurant. Plus, the food court has options from around the world. Needless to say they have one of the best collection of international brands under one roof. The hotel cum shopping mall also have periodic laser shows.",40
"My husband and i booked the Venetian direct thru their website for our 25th wedding anniversary. We were very happy with the room and the service and all the extra amenities that were given to us to celebrate our special occasion. The room was so big and luxurious and was set up to make it special for our wedding anniversary. As soon as we got to our room, Room Service brought us a bottle of chilled champagne and a dessert. Customer Service called to check whether we needed anything else and invited us to the VIP Room where we had some snacks at their buffet. While there they arranged for our return ticket to Hongkong and even extended our check out time to 4 pm. Such a great service from the staff.",50
A very huge complex consisting of big casino and shopping . Hotel rooms are on upper storey.  Big room with all facilities.  Who want to stay in room when 24 by 7 gambling and pocker machine and shopping available a t down stairs. ,40
"After many years the Venetian hotel belongs still to the best ones, the Parisian is so much disappointing. The staff of the Venetian is skilled and friendly, the hotel rooms are great and bigger than in many other hotels. I love the shopping mall with natural sky ceiling although fully air-conditioned indoor. All in style like Venice/Italy with waterways offering gondola rides just as in Venice. Fantastic Italian restaurant Portofino serves wonderful delicious Italian food. We sat outside on the terrace under palmtrees overlooking the skyline. Great experience, always pleased to come back 💋 thank you Venetian 🇮🇹 ",40
"Its a beautiful, breathtaking hotel with a beautiful view and perfect scenarios in the hotel itself. Its perfect value for money, only its a little bit crowded, which I feel is its only drawback. You cannot leave macau without visiting venetian. ",50
Very memorable & satisfying experience. Good for family visits with kids. Golden Peacock restaurant is excellent for Indian veg and non veg food. Interior decor was excellent . One does not require to move out of the resort. Plenty of shopping and food choice. 4 swimming pools to choose from. Nice kids play zone though payable. Overall a must visit.,50
It's not just a resort but a dreamland. It's the best place to visit and stay in Macao. The staffs are very courteous and prompt with the hotel giving hassle free check in and check out experience. Altogether a dream come true,50
the overall experience of the hotel stay was very good. The rroms are spacious and are nicely done. The food in the restaurant Golden Peacock had authentic indian food with good variety which is the biggest plus point for indians travelling to macau.. The casino area is huge with variety of games to play. The food court on the 3rd floor has a lot of variety and the artificial sky is amazing.,50
"Very luxury hotel with fantastic spacy suite. The furniture is of high quality as well as the  spacy bath room including both a bath and shower.  It is a real pleasure to stay in this hotel. The hotel is huge and includes a casino and links to many shopping centers. But once in the room, we feel very private and confortable.",50
"I had a the third honeymoon. We decided to stay at Venetian Hotel macau. We heard the news that this holiday is fantastic and join altogether with the mall. We stayed 1 night at this hotel, and we are amased with the spectacular views, hugeeeeee rooms, a perfect bathroom and a great hotel. We loved it very much, we can walk the mall easily because it is inside the hotel. The only thing that we are dissaponted because the price of the hotel especially if you stay during the weekend. The second thing we have to take a long line to book in. However everthing is perfectoooooo. We will come to this hotel again.",50
"I am in love with this hotel. You have everything available here be it branded shops, Restaurants, Gondola ride, Casino, theatre etc. It's a huge hotel. You actually need map to visit hotel from inside.  Rooms are also huge. You get the Royal feeling staying in the room. Everything thing in the hotel amazes you. Staff is polite and fast in response. I would love to visit this hotel again and again. No complaints at all. ",50
"When in Macao, stay at The Venetian. The property is really huge, the rooms too good and the mall within the hotel itself is superb. It looks like a fairy tale world. Don't miss the heated swimming pool and Jacuzzi here. Its the King of the Casino with the largest casino here, a great destination for casino lovers. All in all, It's really worth a stay. ",40
The room size is quite big and the price is quite good. I found the casino in this hotel is the busiest compare with the others. The service is great.  The hotel has access to the shopping centre and a few good restaurants.,50
"What to expect when picking a Sands resort hotel such as the Venetian in Macau? High class of everything. Did they deliver? Absolutely. Just need to say it’s a huge hotel with 3.000 suits, and that never gets cosy. Have you been to the Venetian in Las Vegas, this is a similar experience.  The hotel itself and the suite we stayed in where superb. Service is quick and professional with a friendly touch. We choose to stay in the Bella suite and it is perfect for 4 persons, two good beds and a bed sofa, large bathroom with a separate toilet.  We spent one day in the old city of Macau doing all the necessary sightseeing including the ruins of St. Paul cathedral. As a European, I did not find it that picturesque, but it is still nice to see. It is however a sharp contrast to Asian…",50

"This was my second stay at the Venetian Macao, the rooms are very well laid out, but they show age.  I feel while the rooms are large and very well appointed facilities in the room, but they feel old.  In the same price point there are many new holes that could be opted for. The Casino is still the most crowded in Macau. The free shuttles can be used to travel across the city and to the ferry terminal.",40
"We stayed there last December 5-6. It was a short trip but very worth it because of the hotel. It started when we got an upgrade to suite room with Cotai view,  front desk was kind enough to let us check in immediately because we have my son in tow and came from a very long travel. Second, they help me open my luggage ( for free) who loose its lock and cannot be open given that number combination is correct. Although there is a casino I would still recommend this hotel if you are traveling with kids. Casino's are restricted to minor. The suite is very spacious that even my husband don't want to sleep in the bed with us. He loves the pull out bed from the sofa. What I love is the bathroom although some cleaning is needed as I saw some mildews starting to settle in near the…",50
"Back to Macau again at beginning of this month and stayed in Suite on 38/F.  The suite was absolutely out of my expectations.  It has a separate sitting and dinning room, master bedroom as well as the cigar room.   The cleanliness are still require a bit of attention in detail as plastic bag and condemn towel found in room. Anyway, improved compare to my previous visits and hope can further improve.",40
"I booked 2 cotai view royale suite for 2 nights stay. Upon arrival, there is a free hotel shuttle across the road after disembarked at the ferry terminal. The check in was smooth & the hotel is located conveniently within a huge shopping centre & there is a casino at level 1. The food at the restaurant is rather pricey but there is a big food court at level 3 with many varieties & price are reasonable. The hotel room is spacious with 2 big TVs & the views are good. For those who visit casinos, you will be spoilt for choices as there are many casinos within walking distance from the hotel. Apart from the shopping & casinos, the Taipa village is also about 20-25 minutes walk.  You can find local delicacies there.   There are some areas that visitors might want to take note. The…",40

I stayed there in 2013 and it was my never forget experience... The kids wanted to stay there for 3-4 days but it was out of by budget:) Its soooo big that even 2 days were not enough to see the full hotel... We had great time at the buffet lunch restaurant and would love to go there again for at least 3 nights..,50
"There are 850 duty free shops, so you can have a very good time if like to do shopping:) Enjoy! The interior of the enterprise is a copy of Venetian in Las Vegas, but still it's OK.  Besides there is a free coach to the ferry if you wish to go to Hong Kong.",40
"The Venetian is a man made beautiful creation for luxury and comfort. From outside it look like simple, but as soon once entered into the hotel, it very difficult to locate the suits without help of map of hotel which available at every counters. The check in are very warm and welcoming with very clear and desk is helpful polite. There is a nice facility of Express check out if bills to be paid by Credit Card at the entry point to suits. Suits are designed and decorated very subtly keeping in view of unique style of Venetian and filled with all modern amenities. The location beautiful in the small island Taipa,,, from any point of entry , viz. Airport, Taipa Ferry, Macau Maritimo Venetian facilitated complementary shuttle buses in intervals. Also they have paid limo service. For…",50
"We were at Venetian to celebrate our first wedding anniversary. My wife and I are very happy about the decision we made. High service standards, excellent food and immaculate service are just brief highlights about this place. We did receive a surprise from the hotel for our anniversary and we enjoyed it thoroughly. Thanks to everyone at the hotel. Looking forward to many trips to this wonderful hotel.",50
What can I say. Venetian Macao has exceeded my expectation from the time I checked in up until I checked out. This hotel is simply amazing! Their lobby looked gorgeous. The room is spacious that you would really feel like a royalty. The bathroom - oh yes the best bathroom I've seen so far. We enjoyed the pool. Not much guests in there so we pretty much have it for ourselves. A very touristy place.,50
We were celebrating our 1st happy wedding anniversary at this hotel. Thank you for the surprise from the Housekeeping department. They use the towers to fold the heart with the rose for us. Very beautiful & happy to see it in the room. So thanks for the delicious cake. The morning buffet at Cafe Deco Macao also nice. The staff was nice with lovely smile. Wonderful staying at the Venetian Macao,50

Grand hotel with complimentary airport pick-up. Stunning lobby and hall on way to the casino and to the room. Suite was huge and bathroom was gorgeous. Best hotel where we have stayed so far. The indoor Venetian canal was fascinating and eateries were plentiful. The shops were abundant and interconnecting with other Cotai hotels. Will stay here again when we go back to Macau.,50
I' ve been to Macau many times and always stay at this hotel..this time I was looking for other hotels for a change but finally end up staying once again. The lobby was stunning. Thè room was huge and comfy. The bathroom was so gorgeous. Unfortunately this time the room we had have bad smell that we have to move to other room. ,40
"Last time i stayed here was around 2011.  The room i stayed in now felt relatively old.  But that's my only average remark.  Overall, I just absolutely love the vibe of this place.  Everything you need is here.  Still highly recommended.",40
First time at the Venetian property as we did not manage to stay in Las Vegas last summer! It was incredible from the point when we checked-in. Special thanks to Yukti for arranging a wonderful room with view for us.,50
"The room is huge and spacious. The hotel is too huge and especially for travellers with kids it is difficult to navigate since you cannot use the casino area to pass through.   The Shoppes on the 3rd level are beautiful with an artificial sky.  Be sure to take your free photo (u get a coupon on check in).  Overall super crowded at all times and check in generally not given early (even though i was travelling with 2 senior citizens and a small child and had requested for early check in at 2 pm, i was not given the same)  Also had asked for adjoining/inter connecting rooms during booking 2 months back but even that was not given, and in fact got 2 rooms on different floors not even same floor! On asking for same floor was said u will have to wait for 1. hours :(  We called for…",40
"The place itself was heaven. we didn't book a room but took a quick stroll around the hotel, i must say it is the top 1 on my list on the most prettiest and biggest hotels i've been to. We stayed longer at their mall where we took pictures on the manmade venetian inspired gondola (not sure if that's what they call it) i loved the smell of the whole place, it was just heaven. i'll definitely save up and go back there and stay for one night when i'm older. :D",40
"Amazing Resort and Entertaiment in one connecting bulding in Macao. Staffs are also helpful. I enjoy my shopping journey in Venetian and Parisian. Last but not least, gambling in casino is one of the best experience that you should never miss it. I would like to come back to stay in Venetian. ",50
"This is my first time to Macau with friends, we really had a good time here and impress by the interior design of the hotel. We stay at verona suite and it is very large room with 2 queen beds. But i think with big room and luxurious, why dont they put bathtub inside the bathroom and also the shower is too old. They must change with the new one. Its not worth it.  Breakfast was good taste. I will try parisian hotel next time to macau to compare with venetian.  ",40
"I never write reviews, and actually created a Trip Advisor account just to give The Venetian the praise they deserve. I have been to Macau a few times but this was the first time with my kid. The Venetian took such good care of us - they gave my husband a cake for his birthday, gave our toddler a small toy, catered to our requests and preferences every step of the way with courtesy, professionalism, attentiveness. I was thoroughly impressed and my kid had the best time. We look forward to coming back again soon.",50
"The best bed i've ever slept in. Despite beeing a mass-hotel, service was excellent, friendly staff, competent concierge. The building is just a dream. Casino is overpriced, lowstake-just for fun- gambling starts mainly at HK$ 1000. Which is approx. 125 Euros. Per bet... Not that many western tourist as expected.",50
"Two good friends getting together to have a wonderful trip to Macau .. and to top it off with a stay at the fabulous Venetian Macao Resort. This was the second time that we have stayed there and we can't ask for more. The location is fantastic; the room condition is first class; the staff are friendly, and finally the food served at the restaurants is of high standard. I strongly recommend my friends to come and try it out.",50
"This is a typical over the top casino hotel with Venice theme and canals in the shops, piazzas and good sized rooms  It's not cheap but after 2 weeks in other 4 star hotels you notice the little things that you don't get in a 3000 room palace  There were fewer toiletries, no shaving kit and everything was extra, and if that's breakfast it's pretty expensive   I had a newly renovated room which was very spacious and nicely kitted out. Shower was pretty average  Check in took ages   It's completely geared up to extract cash from the Chinese so didn't have much in the way of choice for eating and was really limited for any form of nightlife  If you want any atmosphere you need to go over to the Hard Rock down the road  It's ok for tourists but it's not the Mandarin or any of the…",40
"This is the Queen of the Cotai Strip. With its 3000+ suits it is huge and you can really get lost inside the complex.   Staying here is like entering another world. You have absolutely everything you need from venetian canals, huge mall and casino and several bars and restaurants...   The pool area is also very nice with both hot and cold pools and also an adult area with no kids allowed  The suites are comfortable, very good beds and the service and attention from the staff is second to none...  I will recommend this hotel to everyone thinking of going to Macau.",50
"Venetian Macau is one of the most famous landmark of Macau. Many locals and tourists would visit for its food, restaurants and for the stay there. It is at a very good location as it is also surrounded by many other hotels, such as Sands Cotai, Parisian, City of Dreams, etc. People can travel by bus, taxi, car, walk, or shuttle buses provided by the hotels. The hotel includes a shopping mall that has many shops that range from high end shops to mid range shops, very suitable for family or friends visit. Locals would go there for dining purpose, as well as shopping on the weekends. I personally like to travel there a lot, because it has a very nice atmosphere, have shops that is appropriate for my age and delicious range of foods that i could choose from the food court. If…",40
"In Venetian, there is a theater for concern, it is called COTAI ARENA. I went to the “show Lo” concern last month. Show lo is a famous singer and dancer in Taiwan. Actually, I am not really like Show Lo, I just accompany my friend. But during the concern, it changes my mind because of his dancing skill, no wonder why he can be the dancing king of Asia. Moreover, one part in the concern was that Show Lo become a DJ, he made the atmosphere very exciting. Audiences shook their body following the beat. I like this feeling, it is so relaxing. The lighting effect and the sound are good, they make the show prefect.",50
"The Venetian Grand Canal shopping centre, there are many shops, buy clothes, food, boutique, cosmetics, and everything. This is one of the best shopping centre. If you are not come in the holiday period, do not have so much people to be able to shopping easily. Here is the famous artificial sky, and modeled on the Venetian local buildings and canals. Visitors can buy tickets, sit on the boat swim in the canal, there are people singing for you. On the 5th floor of the Venetian Hotel there is a small playground called Q Cubic for children to play. Cosmetics are duty free, is simply a woman's paradise. Once, I bought something forgot to take, the next day to find, go to the store to take, even still, they did not eat those things or as garbage lost. However, the Venetian car came…",40

The rooms are very luxuriously decorated. People live in here will feel very comfortable. The unique European architectural style makes you feel good. I can not get in the casino because I am not 21 years old. This is very disappointing. But I still love here because here have the shopping centers. In the shopping centers, there are hundreds of stores. You can buy what ever you want here. I have buy many clothing which I like.

There is a famous blue sky inside the hotel. I remember that one question is which places is sunny day forever in Macau? The answer is Venetian hotel. It is because there is a blue sky. So, I think the blue sky is the mark inside here. Also, there are many different shops such as sports, electronic products, and cosmetics. It attracts many tourists to come here. There is many shuttle bus outside the Venetian hotel, it is very convenient for going another place. People can also pass Venetian hotel to the Parisian Macau and Cotai Hotel so that people can shopping in these three places. Therefore, if relative visit Macau, I will…",40

For tourists who are traveling to Macau, one of their aim is usually to try casino since they are in area where casino is legal. Although, i have never stayed in Venetian hotel or in casino since i am not allowed yet because of my age, i always go to Venetian for shopping. I really like the environment and decoration there. However, it is kind of crowded too. When i came Venetian for the first time i was wondered whether that sky is real sky or not, but actually it was drawing on the ceiling. It really looks like the real sky that makes you feel so good. Besides beautiful drawing of sky, there is river with many many bridges. And you can also take boat in the river.

When I was a child, my parents used to be go to casino every Chinese New Year. Before opening of Venetian Macau, I could only stay outside of the casino. It is because people whose age are less than eighteen are forbidden to go in. However, Venetian Macao is the first casino which young children can come in together with their parents. So after its opening,I do not need to stay outside, I can come into there and have some food or drink a cup, even come to the playground to play to wait for my parents. It is a very good way for children. It is because children will not bored in Venetian. The most important…",50
"On my point of view, the Venetian is no different from other hotel design, but the Venetian take advantage for being both international brands and popular stores, such as H & M, UNIQLO, Adidas ,that is the hot spots of Macau's locals. Unlike Parisian Macao are located all of International brands in order to attract mainland tourists consumption, such as LOUIS VUITTON, gucci some high-consumption brand-name stores. In addition, the Venetian has a food court, providing guests meals, and the price is reasonable, so the Venetian is a good choices for having meal.

The thing that I like the most for this place is its shopping place because there are lots of shops where I can reach them all at one time and it is comfortable to walk in that area, sometimes, there will be performances on the road. However, the visiting ship is very expensive and I think it is not worth of riding, because they only traveled for a short distance and both the river and the environment there cannot create an atmosphere like Venice.

Because I do not often get lost, so at that time the mood is a bit unwilling, but also led me to have a psychological shadow of The Venetian Macao.

My daughter loved it very much as she can run around and play at the room freely, there are 2 TV, so you can have different channel at one time.   Room was clean enough, bathroom was also clean. Bed is also very comfy, even the sofa was comfy as I fell asleep on it :)  Overall this is a good value of Hotel, and will definitely come back.",50
"Simply the best amongst the hotels I have stayed so far. Was there for 2 nights and totally enjoyed being a part of ultimate luxury experience. It has everything, shopping mall, gigantic casino, wonderful suites along with superb food. 3rd floor of the hotel is the mall as big and huge as a stadium. All brands from across the globe are on display. superb food court. need to eat with chop sticks so was a bit difficult but managed. Had a smooth check in. Room was on 33rd floor with superb cotai view. Over all we had a wonderful stay and definitely The Venetian stands true to the reputation it has gained over the years. Cheers Team Venetian!!!",50
"Last stop on our 4 city tour and we chose to stay here because we wanted to stay in a suite room.  The room is very spacious, classy and clean.  However, evidence of its age is showing. The TV is old, the furnishings are obviously old.  Bed was large and comfortable.  Toilet is large, however, would wish it had a bidet.  We got a non smoking room, and though the room does not have any smell, the hallway stinks of cigarette smoke.  Breakfast is good and would recommend including it with your room.  Gym is great, pool is ok.  Did not gamble so no reviews regarding the casino.  Impressive hallway.  Hotel itself is very large and you'll be provided with a map to get around the place.  Staff is very friendly and helpful.  Just a side note,  since the Parisian just opened at the same…",40
"Great place and the resort is top notch. Visited during my wedding anniversary and was very happy with the hotel, Great options to Casinos and great Indian restaurants Golden Peacock and Indian Spice Express/",50
The rooms are large and very spacious. The view in each room is perfect and the staff (Filipino) is very helpful. The pool area has lots of sections so you can choose where to swim if you do not like to shy away from the crowded ones. The gym is also cute but I didn't bother using the facilities because I am trying to rest and not get tired. The food menu in in-room dining has a reasonable price so if you are tired to head down you have good options. Definitely a good place to stay.,50
"The Venetian, is the best luxury hotel / casino to stay in Macau. Traveled from Bangalore to Hong Kong in a flight and took a ferry from Hong Kong to Macau, and they have The Venetian buses waiting outside the Macau ferry terminal to pick everyone for free and you just need to find the right bus and they take you directly to the hotel. Check-in is easy as well as check-out. The shopping experience there is awesome and the rooms are the best by all means. The casino there is one of the best and you will love everything about this place. The place is very safe and customer friendly. They have a lavish breakfast buffet and they have all the cuisines and the food is amazing. If you are a fan of pork, you get awesome pork ribs just outside the hotel near the entrance in the bus…",50
"In Venetian, everything is huge, grand, mesmerizing... All rooms are suite rooms. Big rooms with all the possible amenities you can ask for.  The casino is very happening place here. If you don't like gambling, still you should visit it once. It's worth a visit.  There are as many as 4 pools!! One of them is warm water pool, one is adult only and one warm jacuzzi.  With gandola ride, more than 3000 shops (including connected hotels and shopping areas), performance theatres and many food options, there is never a dull moment here.  I recommond for a two night stay here.",50
"Checking in/out during midweek off season, we encountered no lines and attentive employees. Overall, I was impressed by the general standard of the hotel considering it was almost 3000 rooms.   Food:  golden peacock was good and deserves its 1 Michelin star. The spices in the curry were perfectly balanced. They could up their game on dessert a little.   Dragon noodles was good. Probably expensive for what it was but it's in the middle of the casino.   Breakfast buffet: decent but way too crowded around 9am. We ended up skipping it and going to Starbucks to avoid all the people.   Standards: I found the security in the yellow jackets a little too strict with the hotel standards. We saw them refusing to let a little kid wearing a robe go to breakfast because he had to be properly…",40
"The Venetian is a hotel that integrates entertainment, shopping and entertainment. When my family and I walked into the hotel, we were surprised by the interior decoration of the hotel, because you can see many world famous paintings in the hotel shopping center ceiling, which was really very beautiful. And what's special is that inside of the hotel it has a ""river"", which also allow people to take a boat above the river, but it is a little expensive to take the boat. When we walked around the shopping center, it just give us a feeling like we are walking on the street, because it has a man-made sky, (actually, I think this should be just a huge piece of cloth) and all the shops are also European-style architectural style. everything was really fine, it really give you a feeling…",40
"We only stayed one night and really enjoyed your stay.  Although the hotel is very big, everything ran smoothly -- from check in (dropping our bag and having it delivered to the room later) to express check-out (a drop box right by the elevator exit). The room was beautifully appointed with enough amenities to get us through our stay and with a great view of the strip. It was also an important birthday and the hotel was nice enough to surprise us with a cake in room, complete with a candle and matches so we could have a small celebration.  Thank you very much for the great holiday -- we would recommend to family/friends and stay there again definitely.",50
"We didn't stay here but visited on a day trip to Macau. We took advantage of the hotel's shuttle bus from the ferry. Lots of photo opportunities in this very opulent building. A large food market area where almost every taste is catered for.  Gondola rides through the shopping mall, with some singing opera as they go. Great experience.",50
"I booked a night over here to experience what a five star casino resort would look like, and it did give me the luxurious feelings. It has everything in the resort itself like casino, luxury brands shopping, restaurants and even a foodcourt (the foods were delicious). Since the resort was really huge with many visitors, I feel its too crowded for me. The room was super spacious with separated living rooms, a mini dining table I think, two TVs, desk, and luxurious bed decoration. I even got a little tired to walk around the room :P The room decoration was like western style and the amenities look a little old. I would recommend to visit the casino and resort but staying in other brand new five star resorts as the room prices are pretty much the same, and also you get modern or…",40
"We arrived in macau on Oct 24,2016 and the room bell suite is spacious that can accomodate 50 persons. If you are planning to have a hote party this I recommend. No bidet so make sure you have tissue.",50
"We spent a week at the Venetian and it was simply spectacular. We have suites which were beautifully decorated, huge and spotless clean. The hotel has incredible shopping, fantastic restaurants and links easily with other gorgeous properties such as The Parisian and The Four Seasons. The small outdoor pool (1 of 3) was over 18's which suited us perfectly.   ",50
Pro: Huge resotel with many things to do.  The room was spacious and separated sitting area.   Con: kind of little bit dusty in room because of decorating curtains.   Each places far away from each other's because this resotel way too big. ,40
"Lovely room ,comfortable beds  great quilts .....etc....lovely large room with sitting area....great size bathrooms...great views.....quite...big hotel ...lot of tourists on weekend very busy best to go mid week....less crowds.....great shuttle buses from ferry to hotel and back ...good ferry service to Hong Kong...great pool area ....great hotel lots to see, eat and do at this hotel and Macau,..",50
"Venetian Hotel room is really spacious. 2 queen beds & 2 TV. one large sofa. 70 sq m. Can accommodate 4 to 5 persons. Excellent location. Galaxy, City of Dream, Sands Cotai, Parisian & Wynn Palace are within walking distance. In fact there is a direct link to all Sands properties like Sands Cotai, Four Season Hotel & Parisian.",40
"Venetian lives upto expectation and beyond. It is a great place with the family, with all amenities and is well furnished suites and choice of food at the many speciality restaurants in it and the connected Hotels you can walk across. Only the breakfast is a disappointing. We do not gamble and so we lost no money there.",50
"Its all gloss and glimmer at the venetian macau, more so during december end time, when a huge decorated christmas tree adorned the lobby , adding to the visual delights in this property.  desppite the vastness of the property, one manages to find ones way around with the help of maps on LCD screens at every corner in every floor.  The food court is huge, and has all kinds of cuisine including indian vegetarian  The suites are large , bathrooms too are very spacious.",40
"Like seriously! I Had been to this place in mid October 2016 with my family and I was just amazed. You may require an entire day for going through the hotel. We stayed in the Bella suite and it was the best room I have ever slept in! Exceptional service. Do not miss the Gondola ride and pick a nice ferry man. We had the Italian one who would greet us saying ""Namaste"" in his Not so weird accent and then start tap dancing and singing. He actually sung Bollywood Mohabbat song ! DO not miss the food court there below the fancy sky. Mostly non veg. But there's a great pizza shop there for both vegetarians and non vegetarians. There's an Indian restaurant too. Huge swimming pool area. Jacuzzi is different, two large pools with numerous other pools along with a kids section. A…",50
"Don't get me wrong, the Venetian is a great place to attend a convention and to squeeze in great shopping in between speakers.  It will also spoil you for food choices,  you can practically eat your way around the world without even stepping foot outside on the street.  My one let down was that the complex was so big and crowded you get the feeling you are in some gigantic train terminal or an over the top  themed airport (if ever there was one) in the middle of peak season travel.",40
"Venetian Macao Resort Hotel is a perfect place to celebrate the Birthdays of your love one's , friends and families as it has a lot of things to offer with regards to their amenities & facilities. They provide us an excellent service & place to stay. They've even upgraded our suite, late check-out,  and  have given us a cake for my sister's birthday. Mr Max,from guest relations team,  is very keen and hands on to our needs. He even call us to ensure if that everything is fine during our stay. All the staff are courteous and attentive whenever we ask for something and even guide us for directions. The Hotel has an amazing view and architectural design. We will definitely comes back here  for a vacation. Love this place & the staff  and I won't forget the one of kind experience…",50
We stayed in Venetian for 1 night and wished we could have extended our stay. It was a great experience. Venetian Hotel is very big & luxury. We can see the plane taking off and landing from our room. Appreciate that Venetian invited us for express check-in program. We can priority express check-in at the hotel main and south lobby reception desks and check in hotel at 12pm. For booking thru Venetian official website can free upgrade to premium Wi-Fi & late check up service at 2pm.,50
"we liked the place, not just a hotel, the way they tried to create a theme around it, its a good one. The hotel is huge, with so much to do, casino is large, overall a nice place. One disadvantage is the size though, at times its too impersonal, like the check in takes a lot of time, the baggage services - standard time of 30 minutes at times would make you impatient. However a nice theme hotel i would say",40
Huge Property and a very helpful staff. Very Spacious rooms with Classical interiors (May need uplifting in near future). The shopping mall with sky is an experience for first timers. Good transfer Shuttles from different ferry terminals and within City.,50
"If you are travelling with a family,  The Venetian must a wonderful choice for you.  In Hotel you can find a lots of activity and restaurants.  Due to so many groups to stay there, it seem so busy in the main entrance as well as in the lobby.    However, when we get into our Suite, all the busy pictures were gone as we can have a big Suite, two big beds, big bathroom with shower & bathtub, separate toilet, separate bedroom & living room, big & comfort sofa where my mum can lie down to enjoy the big tv in living room, dinning table...  Before we arrived, i had arranged something to celebrate my mum's birthday.  I forgot to tell their guest relations team that is not the exactly birthday month of my mum.  However, Ms Angela still arranged for us upon checked-in and my mum love…",40
"Enjoyed visiting and sightseeing a lot of places. Prices are pretty expensive but beautiful tours. I will come back there sometime in the future. 👍🏻💯😊. Those tourists are interested in casino, museum, restaurants, etc. I recommend this great tour. ",50
"I cannot stop thinking about this place after our 2 night stay. It is incredible.   Stayed in deluxe suite.  Huge room, with lounge, and enormous bathroom.    Bed was a little hard for my liking, bathroom was all luxury including a shower that was more of a vigorous massage than a shower - delightful!  And not a drop on the floor after all that water!  The resort itself is sensational, glitz, and glamour personified. Something we all should experience once in a lifetime!  Staff were responsive, good language skills, and nothing was too much trouble.   Courtesy buses were great too and from the ferry.  Would have been great to have one go into Macau also, but I guess they want you to stop with them!  We had a wonderful 2 days.  Loved it. Pure luxury in every way, and great staff.",50
"Room was clean and comfortable. Amenities and bathroom were sufficient. The reception, bellboy and housekeeping staff were helpful. The beds and pillows were too soft though. The public area was clean and huge, you could get lost! The map given by the receptionist was very useful.",50
"location is right in the center of cotai !  and  on foot , able to sightsee of old town village  also, by hotel shuttle bus easy to go to the airport really close to it!  also inside of the hotel time killing fun activities we can do a lot : shopping, casino etc   lovely hotel as well to stay^^ ",50
For all those who love some mullah this is it... Luxury n gambling is what you get too the core.  View of the canal n cotai strip is must when you book a room.   Around it you have house of dancing water  and other shows on timely basis,40
"The hotel experience was great, from the staff to the rooms and every smenity was perfect. The only negative thing was the check queue. It took us 1:30 hours just to check in . And in a hotel like this it was just not expected. ",40
"If you are in Macau, this is a must visit place for you. Don't miss this place for anything, else your trip is a waste. From dining to shopping to beautiful scenery, a pond flowing on the second floor, beautiful scenery and awesome food court. This place is a complete package. A must visit.",50
"One of the best property you will find in Macau, Rooms are too good and huge in size. Property itself in huge. Swimming pools are awesome our kid really enjoyed a lot. Lots of shopping options inside the hotel. They also have an Indian Restaurant Golden Peacock which is a Michelin star restaurant. The only down side is the check-in procedure it will at-least  1 -2 hours, they dont even have any sitting arrangements at the lobby so you are forced to sit on floors!!!   They should make some sitting arrangements for the senior citizens and kids at-least. But once you check-in you are in an another world.",50
"Having been to the Original at Las Vegas a couple of times, We had an idea of what to expect. if you are coming through the Ferry, I would recommend taking a cab and coming in thru the Main Lobby. As the Ferry shuttle brings you in through the West entrance which is like a fish market with all the other tour buses coming in and the lobby reception is not staffed per the ratio of customers coming in to check out - took us like 1 hour and 15 minutes - FRUSTRATING. Otherwise, its a huge rest, the rooms were huge and perfectly appointed with good restrooms and amenities. The property I felt was a little run down - but otherwise try to get on a higher floor with Cotai facing!",40
One of the best hotel resorts i have ever come across.A place worth to be visited by anyone.Awesome ambience awesome food.Very friendly staff with great hospitality.Given to me a chance i would love to come back to this marvelous property again.,50
"Huge, overwhelming hotel, complete with miniature St Mark's Square, canals and gondolas. Good food court in there though, well worth a look.  Rooms were very large and to a good standard, house keeping was good and the rooms were very clean. Room service also very reasonable and to a good standard.   There's a huge number of shops, and under-tunnel walks to other nearby hotels, which is a useful way to get around in hot, humid months.  The only major downside was it took us almost 30 minutes to be seen at check-in - other people there at the hotel for the same business conference we attended complained of even longer waits. Not what you'd expect from a highly rated hotel.  Also, although I had a non-smoking room, there was clearly a smoking room nearby which left a bad smell…",40
Good nice hotel but seems that its getting a bit old with the bad smell in the room. Was a bit intolerable. Apart from that and the room is far from the lift etc all ok. The room is big and spacious and views is ok too. ,40
"Hubby and I stayed here last night at the end of our business trip to a surrounding city, first I skeptical about choosing Venetian because it is getting old ( built in 2007). However as we only stay for one short night, and Venetian is one of the biggest landmarks in Macau, having the mist number of shops, restaurants on the property, we thought to give it a try. We were not disappointed!   Venetian, despite built in 2007, has been well maintained and looks just like new. The service and ambience are both great. Everything was superb. The room is spacious at 70+ square meter, 2 tv's in the unit, large bathroom, and a divided living area.  Shuttle to and from the China birders or airport are very convenient and runs every 15-30min.   There are tunnelwalks to other Sands resort,…",50
"It was in January 2012 when I went there, but I did not know that it was on tripadvisor. So, this is my late opinion:The shopping mall fees like being outdoor on the street looking at the blue sky without knowing that it is already dark outside. A little Italy even with gondola. It is a very impressive place. Similar to Venus Fort (Japan).",50
This was a very Nice and beautiful hotel. 3 nights were enough.. The are a lot of People in The shopping area... The only problem was that you can online pay With credicard in The big and expensive butiques. Paying food or drinks With credicard was not posible anywere.,40
"It was an amazing stay at Royal Suite, The Venetian Macau. The hotel has everything inside. The shops are endless with the most premium brands and variety of restaurant options. We also visited THE EIFFEL TOWER ( The Parisian ). Brilliantly Crafted. Its just PARIS in MACAU.",50
"Been to Macau 3 times, and 3 times too im stay at Venetian Resort Hotel, and still impress me everytime i go there, the first time i stay at venetian is 2010 ""WOW"", the 2nd time stay still ""WOW"", and 3rd time is for my honeymoon its just AMAZING!, very nice staff, very nice treatment for us (not just because its our honeymoon),very easy to go nearly everywhere in macau, the room is big , clean, and the one thing i noted for the improvement is now we got the free wifi in the room hahaha,which is big improvement for us lol, at last just like the terminator said I'll be back  thanks for the great memories",50
"Absolutely fantastic experience. The hotel has everything right. Staff, food, facilities, ease and luxury of stay, shopping and eating avenues, connectivity and offers..just everything in the right place. Must stay when visiting Macau.",50
"The guest rooms are all suites with separate bedroom and living areas that make your stay comfortable and enjoyable.  There are so many things to see and do that it will be time to check out before you have covered everything.  The shops are endless, with multiple restaurants and in-room dining available, and of course you could spend as much as you want in the casino with games of all kinds and slot machines to keep you busy for hours. The entire resort is based on the best of Venice, but newer and brighter and of course with the gondolas and small canals in and around the resort.  A relaxing and enjoyable mini-vacation for my wife and I.  Recommend it to everyone.",50
"We spend 2 days in the Venetian hotel in September 2016. We got a room with a nice view. The room was very big with 2 TV. The service was very good. The casino is very big with a lot of options to choose.I was in the Venetian in LV, but the Venetian in Macau is even better. I will be back to this hotel in my next trip to Macau.",50
I do not like gambling  and Macau but the resort was very nice.   The signage is difficult.  The casino and shopping areas have no windows or doors so it is easy to get lost in the building.  There were no convenience stores.,50
We did our own day tour from Hong Kong to Macau using the Turbo Jet - just catch the free shuttle bus from the Macau Wharf to the Venetian - you can easily spend hours here. Well controlled gambling areas with no children permitted. Visit the Venice Canal area - really beautiful with lots of shops too. Go for a boat ride in the Canal. So many places to eat and so many things to do. Wish we had planned to stay overnight.   ,50
Top rated place in Macau. Had a good time here. The mall had the most premium brands. Pretty huge casino. I left my passport in the room but they wanted to see it to allow entry into the casino area. Showed them a copy and they let me in. Didn't try my hand on any item but had a good time watching people bet and win,40
We stayed in this hotel for a night and wow what an experience. The decor takes you back to Victorian era and is really beautiful. The rooms are so big and beautifully done. Loved the whole decor. Casino is BIG and you have plenty of options to choose from Baccarat to Roulette. The Gandola ride is good fun. Different type of cuisine along with Indian options available within the hotel. Wish we had stayed for one more night.,50
We stayed here for 2 nights and really had a great time.   What's good  1. Grand structure and very beautifully made  2. Shopping mall and food court within the hotel  3. Very large rooms with all facilities  4. Superb breakfast and attentive staff at the restaurant and a special mention to Jade who was taking personal care of the guests at the table  5. Four pools including the heated pool 6. Amazing play area called QUbe for the kids  7. Entertaining casino   What's Not so good   1. In room services are very slow and Delayed  2. Check in queues are too long ,40
Stayed 3 nights in Royal Suite which comes with a sitting room that is below the bed. Way too big for solo travellers. There is a nice dressing table and big wardrobe that will wow over ladies without fail. Had a high floor room which has a nice view of Galaxy Hotel and the high way bridge. Bed is comfortable and are completed with all necessities. Shower head is a tad of a problem as the flow of water is small and doesnt eject water smoothly. Hotel security is very poor. The security guards (u're lucky if u see one) do not bother to check on identity of people who walk into lift lobby. Apparent solicitation even in the lift! Environment is not suitable for travellers with kids. ,40
"Great location if you are after the casinos. Asked for non smoking room, but was given a room with strong cigarette smell. Staff was offering to clean it but the smell stayed even after they cleaned it. Staff were friendly and helpful. Would not mind to come back. ",40
"Came for a long weekend and was stunned by this hotel. Pure luxury in every way. We arrived early and asked if we could use the pool while waiting for our room, but as we chose a quiet time to arrive by chance our rooms were ready. Room itself was very spacious, had a view of City of Dreams and the mini golf. Childishly we loved the fact that the room was big enough to have steps in it! There were 4 swimming pools, one of which was adults only (perfect for kid-free sunbathing).",50
It's an amazing place... it will give you a fee as if you are in a kings mansion with big lobbies .... decorated walls ... big fountains.. wow ... big casino huge shopping malll.. we stayed at Bella suite.. food was awesome ...,50
Great hotel but check in process can be bit time consuming if you are coming during Chinese National Holidays. We went to Venetian during Chinese national holiday and place was very crowded. But food and entertainment options available at this place are great.,40
"It was my second visit to this hotel and this time with my parents. The hotel is very good and of high quality both in Decor and in service, they made us feel special on my and mum's birthday by giving a complimentary cake in the room. The staff was very helpful and kind, bags arrived before our arrival in the room. The concierge was helpful, we got a complimentary pic with family making our stay memorable. The staff helped us with taxi.  Overall, good and best experience.",50
"At the beginning... We came from ferry to the west lobby. Nobody met us and helped with the luggage. OK.  Next. Usually first you see the reception - not here. You should walk quite far. With the couple of big bags it's difficulty. Finally we approached it - and it was long queue for checkin. Staying... Room on 34th floor was good - large, fresh and light. I had all I need. Staff and service was professionally good. Facilities... Pool - quite far from the north suites - 300m; there are two of them (warm and cold); water was too much chlored; Gym is well equipped. Dinning... breakfast in Bambu was fine, in DECO - very crowded. In Bambu breakfast (cuisine) was much better for me. Lunch and dinner you can choose from the number of different restaurants including shopping food hall.…",40
"Likely the nicest hotel I’ve ever stayed in. Previously I stayed at the Venetian in Las Vegas and was impressed by the luxury and grandness. The Venetian Macao has outdone its Las Vegas counterpart in every way. This is luxury as good as it will ever get for 99.9% of the world’s population. The guest rooms are beautiful, luxurious and very spacious. All the buildings and furnishing are very impressive. There are lots of world class higher end shops and great restaurants.   Better than the feel of being in Venice.",50
Room was a little tired but amenities overall were great. Given warm greetings/congratulations and a birthday cake for my wife on arrival. Considering all rooms are suites it's difficult to complain given the price vs size. If you like Indian food the Golden Peacock is a must. The staff are fantastic- smiling and attentive 24/7.,40
"I booked a special package through the telephone for a nights stay and tickets to see Stomp which was really good value.  The room was really spacious and the view of the Cotai strip was really nice to see.  Everything was spotlessly clean and had all the facilities one would expect to find.  The checkin was a little slow due to the confusion about the package but the members of staff couldn't be more friendly and even called the room to ensure we picked the tickets up which was a nice touch.  We also had breakfast at Cafe Deco included in the package which was delicious.  There was a good selection of food to choose from.  The only negative was that we were on the side of the pool and golf course and there was music playing until 1:30am, if I sleeping, it might have disturbed…",50
Liked the separate bedroom and sitting area in the rooms.  My seven year son enjoyed the pool and playing in the mini 18 hole golf course. The street performers were just great.  The food court served sumptuous food. Overall a wonderful and memorable experience.,50
It is really like visiting heaven on earth. It is the best ever property I have visited.in life on should visit this property at least once minimum. It have repeat value.  Hotel needs to have more checkin counter.  It is time taking and long procedure.  There is always a b8g queue,50
"Rooms are very spacious, we were a family of 4 and we all had a comfortable stay. we had a Royale Suite and all had no complains/ regrets. You place the request and they are ready to arrange if its possible.",50
Good One  Very spaces hotel  room All Country food available  Very Good Swimming Pool Lots of entertainment near by In Hotel service is good  Need Attention   Language Problem (No one knows English) Chinese Staffs are rude. No trolley service from ferry to bus you need to carry luggages in hand Bus drivers and Conductor are rude not speaking  Very less information in English ,40
"We had one night stay at The Venetian and enjoyed every bit of our stay. Great rooms, shopping experience and the Casino that buzzes through out the day. It was mini Venice recreated in Macau. I played Black Jack for the first time, with minimum bets of course, and the staff was quite accommodative and helpful. Even the other players around the table were warm and friendly.  Tips:   - This is quite a large hotel and ensure you know the correct wing of your room.   - Use the easy checkout method to avoid the queues. ",50
"Room was great, amazing stay, did not like the shower head, the shower head was on the wall, that's fine, but you cannot avoid getting soaked in cold water, getting cold and wet before the temperature gets warm and cozy to shower in.",50
"I saw there is an ""early bird"" promotion on their offical website and booked a room for my anniversary thus my kid's birthday. The guest relation team is just to amazing. They has upgraded us to a better room. And when we get to our room, it is decorated with ballon and a heart sharpe with rose in our bed. And later on, a birthday cake with my daughter's name on it is delivered to our room.   Not just the guest relation team impressed me. When I check-in, the lady called Yuki is really nice and have very good service. She saw that it is my daughter birthday when checking-in, and she gets a present for her too. It is a Venetian doll, a dog, which will say hello, dance and say good bye. She is so happy to have such a lovely gift which is unexpected.   We have tried the kid's…",50
"Spacious room with a great view! The room can even accommodate for a family of 5 even though this is intended for just me and my girlfriend.  The staff are very attentive and even gave me a birthday cake to celebrate my birthday. In addition, they still gave me a free room upgrade without me requesting for it. Superb value and hotel staff service!",50
"My friends decided to have a out of the country trip and we choose Macau and decided to stay at The Venetician Macao Resort Hotel and I'm very happy and glad that we made a right decision to stay at Venetian. Upon entering the hotel, you can really love it already since they have a beautiful lobby to welcome you. We had a Verona Suite which give you a fantastic and classy feel in the room, it is so big and beautiful. We decided to try out thier pool and it's amazing because they have two big pool and I love it because it has trees around the pool. I love the hotel staff since they are friendly and nice. If you're into casino they have it om the ground floor it is so big. And they also have the grand canal for sight seeing then around grand canal it has lot of establishment and…",50
"This hotel is too good. The rooms and bathrooms both are huge. The food court is so well made that though it is covered, it seems as if you are under an open sky. At first go I was not able to recognize that it was not sky but covered in such a way that it looks sky.  Casino: I went to other hotels as well to check out the casino, but I found that Venetian has the best casino. So huge - amazing. It was the only casino where there were two tables of roulette starting with HK$25. Rest all had Roulette starting with HK$50. I loved the casino. They have their bus services to go to other hotels. ",50
The experience was amazing but also tiring! The number of crowd was overwhelming! The casino was super busy. It's nice to go around if you have much time. The prices are bit costly but was still affordable.,40
"It's Impressive how it looks exactly the same as some places in Venice.. it's a nice place to kill some time shopping, taking pictures and wondering around As for the Hotel and casino, it looked so crowded on Saturday...I guess it's quieter on week days...",40
"Amazing, mind blowing, excellent, elegant....... Words aren't enough to express how I felt to visit this marvelous hotel, was a life time experience for me and my family. This was the best hotel I have visited. And would recommend this hotel to everyone who wish to travel to MACAO. Huge casino & restaurants. 4 swimming pools. Breakfast was lavish with special Indian dishes which kept changing every day. Would love to visit this Hotel again.",50
"Macau generally is a funny place, its all Chinese fake. The Venetian hotel is HUGE! It took us around 20 minutes to walk from the hotel lobby to our room, later we discovered that there are separate lifts , to bring the guests to the rooms faster. But then we changed the room and got lost again.  The rooms are spacious. The quality of amenities and all the furniture although is not that good. You can hear very well what is happening in the bathroom.  I would definitely recommend this place because it gives you experience.  Just slightly disappointed that they do not dress up that much for dinners and casinos . We were well dressed, tall, Northern Europeans so everyone stared at us. Not complaining, it was fun anyway. ",50
"The property is nearly identical to the it's sister in Las Vegas.  From the decor, gondolas, and Grand Canal Shoppes.  The rooms are spectacular.  There's not really anything to see in Macau, so there isn't really any ""view.""  The casino floor is large, really large, and has all the baccarat you could want.  The other table games are available, but are not as prevalent.  The property doesn't have the focus on other diversions (e.g., shows, restaurants) that Vegas does and as a result, there really isn't anything to do other than gamble.",50
"For my birthday I rented the Rialto Suite for a night. The room was spotless and enormous, ultimate luxury. Also the service was of high quality. I am very satisfied with my stay, it was even better than what I imagined!! Furthermore, I did not go sightseeing in Macao since the hotel offered entertainment for days!",50
This place is huge with a casino and mall. The gondolas inside the mall area is a great way to ride and enjoy the rest of the interior. Look for the famous Lord Stow's egg tarts! They are famous and taste great!,40
"Have visited two times in this property, they provide free drop and pickup from ferry terminal, spacious and well maintained rooms, ultimate variety of food courts inside the premises and lot of shopping options and world class casino. Always recommendable to friends and family.",50
Excellent hotel to stay very nice rooms all rooms are suiet AN some of the rooms are very big suiet AN at Gud price and hotel is very big So you have to walk a lot to go out an u can get casino everywhere!!if ur are casino fan than you should go there!!,50
" Venetian is a  city in itself. Huge rooms with separate sitting n luxurious bathroom.Decore very tastefully done. Good view from every room. An entire city of Venice has been incorporated in the third floor, with shopping centres n condola rides, and eating joints. Golf lovers can play golf n kids can enjoy d kids zone. Delicious buffet crazy casino's. what more can u ask for. one doesnt need to step out of the hotel . staff very friendly n helpful. love the place...best stay ever",50
I booked royale suite.it was great.very spacious.bathroom size was very good.tea/coffee making supplies were in plenty.check in and check out was very fast.the hotel is so huge that it takes a day to understand but it's worth roaming around.you won't get bored.casino was good too.had a great time.would love to visit again.,50
"It is a fantastic hotel. All suites are very large. Beautifully decorated. Bathrooms are very beautiful and modern. Breakfast is excellent. There are Indian items in breakfast every day. Though big hotel, takes personal care. Shibu in restaurant is great guy and no words are enough to praise MelRose, she is a Woman of very high dedication and committed to customer service. We will come here again.",50
"I stay with my lovely sister and my friends. We booked 2 rooms bella suite. The room is very big for 2 persons, and very beautiful. My room has a city view, and has two bed queen size. The bathroom is nice, has a bath tub and a small room for closet. They provide some drinks and snacks (mini bar). Room size is about 70m2.  This hotel is very amazing and very very big!! Me and my friends always lost there. This hotel has a casino and shopping mall. ",50
"First time experience staying in for 3days 2 night at Bella Suite. Couldn't agree better that it's one of the best hotel in Cotai, Macau! Great service, Hygiene, Comfortable, Great malls, Food & Beverage & Entertainment as well!   For late check out, you could just pop by the porters to drop your luggage & inform them the room number you've stayed in. its free for a baggage per room.",50
"We, as a couple with our family members, booked two connecting rooms (or they called it suite) for two nights during the Chinese New Year in 2016.  Venetian is simply at the heart of the Cotai Strip.  It physically connects to the Four Season and the Parisian (Sands’ newest premises), the Cotai Sands and the City of Dreams are just across the street, while the Galaxy Resort is at its back.  We decided to stay in the hotel during the Chinese New Year as our family members liked to try their luck in the casino while my wife and I enjoyed shopping.  Last but not least, we could find food easily in these mega resorts (most restaurants closed during the New Year).    The biggest credit is the size of the rooms, very spacious.  This gives extra marks to Venetian and explains why the…",40
"We have stayed at The Venetian a couple of years ago and to this day have fondest memories . Recently we have stayed at the ""property sister"" (same owners) The Parisian and regretfully the high expectations have not been met. Naturally we went to visit ""our Venetian"" and it turned out we were spending more time there then in our booked hotel... Lovely shopping, awesome food hall, exciting gondola rides. To the managers: how is it possible to get it so right with the Venetian and so unremarkable with The Parisian. We know, where will be staying next time though!!!!",50
Hotel just gorgeous and massive! Lovely restaurants and the Canals and the shopping Devine. You quickly forgot what the weather was like outside and really got absorbed into the experience. Just adored Macau ,40
"This has to be the best hotel in Macau , it has everything from golf club to shopping malls, gondola rides , night sun , magnificent architect. Everyone must experience this hotel atleast one time in their life . ",50
"Spacious, luxury room with excellent service. Friendly staff and high speed WIFI. All the restaurants in the property are great. Especially the Golden Peacock were they serve Indian cuisine. Enjoyed a holiday at this great place.",50
I think it's beautiful hotel and well planned with so many amenities. Wonderful casino huge area various games is just exciting.  The shopping centre inside the hotel is amazing. Almost all world brand are present inside.  Room size is just amazing. Ambience is good and India food is available with nice quality and available 24 hours.  ,50
"We stayed 2 nights at this amazing resort. Our only 2 complaints would be that it took an hour in the check in queue (Thursday afternoon) and that the room (although advertised as non-smoking) smelt of tabacco. Otherwise, OMG the suite we had was amazing, way too big for our family but we did embrace it and felt very spoilt! The staff were helpful and friendly and were quick to ""grab"" an English speaking colleague if needed. The resort itself is huge and I am sure you could stay there for a longer time and still discover new shops etc! The process of getting the complimentary shuttle to and from the relevant Ferry terminals was convenient. This resort hotel certainly did not disappoint!",50
"The room we stayed was fabulous! One of the nicest and most spacious room we ever stayed. We dined at one of the restaurants located on the first floor and the food was yummy and good value for money. Our only regret was the stay was short and this was our first trip to Macao. But.... We are returning in November for a longer stay this time and with a larger group of friends for merry making.The hotel is very luxurious, bathroom is very exquisite and the room itself is very cozy. Though the bed is too soft for my taste. And there's a hint smell of tobacco in the hallway even though our room is a non smoking one. Overall it was a very pleasant stay, prompt and hospitable service.",50
"Thumb up for Venetian Hotel's overall service. Our family enjoyed the 3 nights' stay in Bella Suite. Very clean, spacious and clean. Love the 4 pools and friendly staff. Easily accessible to other shopping places. We shall return!",50
"You can get lost in this hotel, take note of which wing you are in. If your key becomes corrupted and does not open door, it is a very long walk to one of the reception counters. Larger that the Venetian in LA, but does not have the same feel. The food courts are quite good with excellent variety of cuisines. The staff are friendly and the rooms are very clean, as expected.",50
"Grand and huge hotel. had Bella suite on higher floor - north wing  PROS -  - I really liked the idea of e-Checkin. I used it, was very convenient. Checkout was as simple as dropping the key in a box. I am giving 5 star just for this reason - Good central location - Huge room size. Huge size bathroom. Nice view of Galaxy light show from the room - Food court is major plus. There is even Starbucks on ground floor. In general, service was good - very fast wifi (Venetian premium) for those booking on hotel website  Improveements needed -  - Expensive food options - Very poor layout for moving around. specially if you have kids. layout is confusing - Room lighting was too dark for my liking. - The room is in need of upgrade, considering other newer hotel popping around. Room…",50
"We were lucky that one of the two  Royal Suites that were  booked under the Summer Package, was upgraded.   I stayed in the upgraded suite and was very satisfied with  the beautiful suite.  The bathroom is so huge which both  the bath and the shower cabinet are available. The stunning  view at night from the room is superb with lights from the neighbouring hotel-casino.  Plenty of shops with food  court.  We had free tickets for a gondola ride.  The gondolier will serenade to you on the return trip back to the pier.  We  did not take the photo souvenir as it is too expensive which  you can ask before boarding.  The hotel staff kindly advised  us to take a free shuttle bus to the Sands Hotel to get a taxi  there for a downtown Macau shopping.After shopping you  can take a taxi…",50
Venetian is one of my top favorite location in Macau. Because Venetian is so wonderful place. Very luxury and very uniques place. I am really recommend to all who are traveller in macau to visits or stay this wonderful hotel casino I'm sure you will be enjoy and very memorable of this place. The casino are so nice and very crowded casino so many China's and different people like to play casino. And most of them they are also have different restaurant. But I just to recommend to eat in buffet restaurant because you can eat what you like as long as you like to eat. Everything. Are very special so awesome. ,50
"This is the second time we've stayed here and we love this place. Rooms are spacious, very clean and the decor is beautiful. Staff are always friendly and helpful and  there is plenty of variety for food and shopping too.  Good location.",50
"The venetian is huge, I got lost lots of times! but don't worry the place is beautiful and there's lots of interesting things to see so you won't get bored just roaming around. The rooms are alright, a little bit outdated but it's very spacious. The biggest downside on staying in the venetian is the food, it's expensive - almost twice the price compared to food courts in the macau peninsula.  If you are on a budget I suggest staying in the macau peninsula than hotels in Taipa, and then just take a half day visit in the venetian.   pro tip: If you're staying in the Venetian, don't forget which wing your room is and take note of what stores are near the entrance (Eg. West wing - front of Häagen Dazs) so you won't get lost!",50
"I previously stayed in the Vegas Venetian and both hotels are equally beautiful and decadent. The room was large, the pools were lovely and the restaurants and bars that we visited were high quality. The staff were welcoming on the front desk and there was a free shuttle to the ferry station which was easy to locate. However, the casino itself and the overall vibe was completely worlds apart from Vegas. Everywhere was heavily ID-ed, there was no free alcohol and everything seemed quite heavily regulated. It stucked all the fun out of it and there was absolutely no buzz or atmosphere like you get in Vegas - this was the same in all the casinos. If you want a wild Asian Vegas experience, you won't get it here. It was more expensive than Vegas too.",40
Awesome a must go place. Luxury at it best Top casinos U win or loose that doesn't matter  Super cool interiors  Awesome gonda  ride  Cool staff  5 star rooms and services Great ambience If possible will visit again  ,50
"A brilliant paradise to stay with all amenities shopping mall casino food court fine dining gym a golf course. Less to say more to do. A one time experience a minimal must!!!! Very spacious rooms, good view from the room as well please check at the reception if you wish for a good view from your room smoking and non smoking rooms available. ",50
We stayed in royal suite. The room was huge. It had all the necessities. Though the general decore of venetian would remind you of some dubai mall. You need a map everytime you move out of your room as the place is so vast that one tends to get lost. ,50
"It's an excellent hotel where all rooms only suites having a separate area for sitting, dining etc, and a separate spacious area for a king size bed. Each suite has two big size tvs and a big window for an excellent city view. The bathroom is very spacious and luxurious. There is a separate floor with all branded shops and duty free shops and restaurants etc. There is also a separate huge area for casino. It's definitely one of the very best hotels in Macao and highly recommended for people to visit with family, friends or solo.",50
"Just spent a lovely weekend at the Venetian Macau to celebrate my wife's birthday. Faultless from the start, hotel staff super helpful and friendly, nice and spacious interconnecting rooms as we requested, kids loved the theme. Staff at cafe deco friendly, food good for the family. Saw the House of the Dancing Water, great for family. Spent the rest of the weekend wandering around the resorts, gondola ride, Eiffel Tower at the new Parisian Hotel, very fun trip , very family friendly and would definitely return. ",50
"I had a good time at Venetian Macau. Here is my review,  Pros Really huge luxurious rooms Huge property, so many options for shopping and entertainment. Friendly staff Good breakfast Well connected to all the properties in Cotai strip Easy Checkout  Cons  Huge queue for checkin. Spent almost an hour in the queue.  Relatively older property, age has started impacting the rooms.",40
What a hotel. It is so big and efficient. Need not go out.Specially liked the Peacock restaurant. Me and my wife stayed for two days in May 2016 and thoroughly enjoyed our stay there.Shuttle buses leave every five minutes from Ferry terminal and also from Hotel.Looking for a return trip.,50
express check-in service is absolutely great! i'd recevied mineral water when check in and free premium wifi access in room..  check-out was so easy and i drop my baggage for free..  so great experience to be here.,50
"The entire establishment is amazing. The room is elegant and huge. The view from our room is remarkable. The bathroom is likewise huge and stylish. In fact, I can just stay inside the room all day long and enjoy the room and the view. The pool is great and the kids enjoyed the playground near the pool. The staff were friendly and accommodating. It is just near the airport. They also provide free transportation (bus ride) from the port/pier area. We will definitely stay there again with my family!",50
I have stayed in one of the better hotels around the world but this hotel stands apart. In Macao I actually didn't stay at the Venetian but took a tour.. I first impression is its huge and sprawling. It has numerous casinos ...heard it had the largest one... Though a novice in casinos but tried my hand at some slot machine and didn't win as expected..inside the hotel as it is designed after the famous Italian city of venice so the name has Gondola rides for hire and the best part and if you are lucky you will get a beautiful gondola female driver in traditional attire and they would sing to you.,50
"This is one of the most famous landmark hotel from the beginning of the Taipa area and been kept well through the years. The staffs are very nice & helpful, and the hotel, shopping arcade is very attractive. However, the Food Course is too pricey compare what we can get from the city.  The front desk should arrange more staffs to take care of the large volume of the room guests checking in. Or, the guest will turn to other new hotel and not coming back.",40
"Although there was a delay on checking in due to very long lines, once we reached the counter we were met with a smile. We were celebrating my husbands birthday and were offered a free cake on check in and complimentary drink vouchers. We stayed on the 32nd floor in the south wing.... AMAZING. The room was big,bed was comfy and the bathroom had all that was required,the only gripe is the hairdryer only blew cold air and took a long time to do my hair. The bar at Cafe Deco had happy hour which was 2 for 1 on beers,spirits and cocktails. We ate at Portofino which was great although a little pricey.  The dim Sim House was great,affordable and tasty food.  Highly recommend staying here",50
"We only spent a night in Macau and the Venetian looked like a nice option having spent time in the Venetian in Vegas. Getting from Hong Kong to Macau via the water jet was fine, quick and efficient and getting through customs in Macau was really quick, we then got on a free curtesy bus to the Venetian which was all very efficient, so that part was all good.      When we got to the hotel however we got stuck in a check in queue that must have taken the best part of an hour, I think we made the mistake of arriving just after the standard check-in time and that place gets very busy, the staff try to be nice offering water and sweets whilst you wait, but I'd rather they got behind the counter and reduced the check-in queue, but that's logic for you.     The room itself was very nice…",40
A Very good service that I ever had.  Most of the staff very polite they are helpful  We lost our wallet. Then the security found that and send back to us. Even we told them it might be left in the taxi. Within 30 minutes they help us to contact the taxi driver. They watch through their Cctv they provide us a very very good service. This is the best hotel services I ever had.  ,50
"We stayed one night at the Venetian with our three small children and had a great time.  It wouldn't seem like a child friendly hotel but it actually was perfect.  We booked the Family suite which had bunk beds for the kids, bean bags, a child's table and a free other little fun amenities for kids.  The kids loved the bunk beds! The Venetian also has an indoor playroom which was great although you have to pay extra for it which was the only minus.  We did the Gondola boat rides and swam in the pools.  We also did the outdoor mini golf with the kids which was fun until it rained.  All in all we had a great stay and had plenty to do with kids at the Venetian ;)",50
"The design and the environment are beautiful and artistic with the implementation of Spanish element. The hotel room is spacious and elegant, suitable for couples and family member. I love the environment while this is my first timw visit.",50
"Large, luxurious rooms in the huge Venetian complex.  Great shops, restaurants and casino under the one roof. Gondola ride in the Venetian canals does not match the real thing, but is a bit of fun.  Easy to get to on the free shuttle from the Macau Ferry Terminal.",50
"Luxury and convenience at its best! Would love to stay at the Venetian again, and i would reccomend this hotel to families and friends. Very nice suites, helfpul staff. Overall a wonderful stay. Thank you for a remarkable experience. 😊",50
"We had a delightful two night stay and regret we had not organised more time there. The room was luxurious and great view from upper floor.  The staff were outstanding,  especially at reservations, very helpful and courteous. The dining  options were numerous and great quality. Enjoyed gondola ride and all shopping opportunities.",50
"What a place !!  Seriously, awesome and worth every cent to stay here.  My husband and I spent a weekend here and felt like royalty.  The room was fit for a king.  LARGE everything.  King bed with a lovely view of Macau out out window.  A wide range of food places, and shopping stores galore.  High end stores.  The casino is great, though we burnt a hole in our pocket while there!!  ha!  They also have a fantastic club - i forget the name.  Great music - R&B style.  Loved the place and will def stay there again.",50
"Macau was a day trip for me, hotel advice from me about rooms or service won't help you.  Jet boated from Hoog Kong and arrived caught a free shuttle to the Venetian.  Really a good discision because the first floor is so much for the adults and children.  Bars and fine resturants to take out and the Irish Pub.  One of the best Swiss and mushrom Hamburger with perfectly fried french fries.  protions were huge.  Plenty of beer and whiskey served by our American waitress from Flordia, People everywhere.  Involved a little effort to just move.  Taxi's cheep so take a ride around the city and find the Old Catherdal wall still standing.",50
"The only reason that I'm giving this place a 4 is purely due to its convenience. This place has possibly everything you could want. I feel like it's one of those places that seems great to visit but not actually stay at. As a hotel guest, it's too crowded to really be able to ""relax"". The room was spacious but felt old and run down.",40
"The Venetian Macau is not only a hotel and resort. Almost anything that relaxes a person is in here. There are regular shows from well known artists and performers. Just check the calendar of events. If you think gambling relaxes you, the casino is there to either make you richer or poorer :). I did not gamble but I used the casino to get free drinks!  The third floor of the building offers food and stores of signature products.  You can go around the shopping stores until you get exhausted both in energy and money. The food court is also in this level where you can choose various types of foods.  Be careful though if your palate is choosy.  The servings are too big for Asians and if you do not like the taste then you will be wasting the food.  It is always wise to ask about the…",50
"Your reception staff Johnson is wonderful. He's very friendly, patient & helpful. He took the time to explain some of the locations I was enquiring on, and upon knowing its my hubby's birthday, he arranged a birthday cake for me & even upgraded us to Bella Cotai. Little gestures like this sweeten our whole experience.   Someone else even called us the day b4 we checked out to ask us if everything is ok, if we need baggage assistance upon checkout & even if we need a late check out. Superb. Keep it up! ",50
"Thank u venetian for upgrading my room to deluxe other wise it will difficult for me with 2 kids. Its small Village People & people there mostly chines. its feel like u r in very busy street in China. but when u enter in you room it will different experience altogether.  mostly people confuse where to go, such big hotel u can't imagine,. people go for lonely place don't advice to go there, no privacy, in the morning you have to look for you breakfast( go to CAFE DECO L1) but staff are so polite and helpful. Gondola ride is expensive 120HKD per person, but no body taking ride. food court was there but food is little expensive, they provide free shuttle service for airport ferry service and pic up from airport ferry. every 15 min there is a bus service, casino is 24x7 open.",50
"We had great time staying here 3 days 2 night. Our room got upgraded since we booked through their portal. Wifi is a bit slowly and not stable sometimes. Express check out is so convenient, avoid any delay or waiting time. We highly appreciate for this idea.  Overly populated, food is overpriced. Most Casino dealers and employees doesn't know how to speak english, Cashier lines way too long for exchanging money.  Overall, we had a great time here. We surely will come back next time and recommend to other friends. Thanks !",40
"Went with family in June, and the room is huge. I faced the golf course. I suggest having slippers, as the wooden steps in the room are sticky. Generally service was good, but the queues took forever. Also, the hotel is ridiculously large, which made trying to find the check in counter hard. The gondola ride was fun, and the shopping pretty good.",40
"We had great time staying here 3 days 2 night . The front desk staff Ken was so nice to provide us the late check out until 2 pm of the last day and prepared a surprised birthday day for us when he knew it is our family member 's  birthday . Bella suite room is extremely fancy . The view from South wing is nice , opposite to Galaxy hotel . Our room is 26-031 which is quite of far away from the swimming pool . We need to walk around 200m to reach it .  Wifi is a bit slowly and not stable sometimes. Express check out is so convenient, avoid any delay or waiting time . We highly appreciate for this idea . Overall, we had a great time here. We surely will come back next time and recommend to other friends . Thanks ! ",50
"This hotel was massive, along with all the major hotels in Macau. It had its own shopping mall in the hotel which had pretty much every single international store you could ask for. Took me days to properly shop. Food court was quite big and had a good range of food. Rooms were just like Venetian in Vegas. Hotel was a little dated but clean. Didn't gamble over there so not sure about casino, but it's definitely a shoppers paradise.",40
"Free shuttle from/to Airport or Ferry Terminal  Good but overly populated, food is overpriced and lack bench/ seats for resting.  Most Casino dealers and employees doesn't know how to speak english, Cashier lines way too long for exchanging money.",40
"This place is massssiiiveeee!!! Hats off to these guys to be managing something this huge.. I am sure it takes a lot of planning, management and sheer guts to do it. Check in is slow, takes about 30 min per person and after 5-10 min the line looks like you are at the security check at a busy airport. Everyone has different packages and it gets difficult for the check in staff to choose and print all the vouchers. There should be a simpler process for atleast their staff's sake..The housekeeping is very prompt and hats off to these guys for this. Rooms are exceptional. The basic Royal Suite (smallest room) is bigger than suites in most of the hotels. So from the and hotel perspective its awesome. Buffet breakfast at Café Deco and Lunch at Bambu are basic and have had better in…",40
"Arrived at The Venetian expecting great things and wasn't disappointed! Beautiful rooms, stunning views, helpful and friendly staff (albeit lacking in English speaking skills), huge casino with big variety of games and plenty of shops. Really nice atmosphere everywhere and very reasonably priced (we upgraded our room for what I consider a reasonable extra £35 a night). I'd definitely stay here again and would 100% recommend for anyone visiting Macau who wants a bit of a luxury experience.  Easy to access from Taipa ferry terminal or Gongbei border gate via shuttle buses and plenty of easy access to other casinos and shopping areas. ",50
"This hotel has everything - the most gorgeous suites ever, more than 30 bespoke restaurants, food-court, shopping arcades, lakes and gondola rides, 4 swimming pools, and the most expansive CASINO!!   This hotel is an experience to be cherished.",50
"From rooms to their mall to the room's Cotai view. Everything was exactly how I wanted my vacation to be.  If you love to go shopping, this place will be perfect for you. I bet you can't even walk around the entire hotel mall in one day. The place is located near EVERYTHING, and maybe if you visit now they'll have the Eiffel Tower up already.    All staff were nice and very helpful, everything was very convenient as if they just want you to enjoy your day already.    Great location!  Elegant rooms! Great service!",50
"I had booked a suite at the Venetian to celebrate my 8th wedding anniversary.The ppl at the Venetian were very courteous and friendly.I had intimated them via mail,the purpose of my visit and the arrangements the staff made before and during the visit was very memorable for me & my family .Thanks guys 🍾,it was awesome.The receptionist was very friendly and availed me a late checkout, when I had requested the same.The suite is off great standards.Didnt find the ppl at the condola ride amusing because when  I visited their souvenir shop the response of the girl at the shop was not friendly when I had requested whether I could take a picture of the shop..the food at the golden peacock was ok ...on the overall the place is wonderful and would look forward to  an oppurtunity to stay…",50
"This is the first time I am staying in Venetian and had enjoyed it. Service of the hotel is good, from front desk all the way to house keeping. They had been professional, efficient and customer oriented.  I had booked a Royale Suite. The room is extremely spacious. When I requested for the sofa bed to be converted into a bed, I was amazed at how big and comfortable the sofa bed is.   Everything about the hotel shouts luxury and opulence. The building by itself and the interior, with its intricate carvings is already an interest to a lot of tourists. Of course, it also has it's shopping arcade which is huge. You can spend a few hours shopping. There is a also a very big Foodcourt in the hotel serving all kinds of cuisines.   Checking in can take a bit of time as the hotel is…",50
I have visited macau 4 years back with family and stayed at venetian for 1 night.it was great experiance over there in macau. Hotel has big casino. You have to stay atleast for 2 nights to see everything in venetian hotel. Suite was great and spacious. Bathroom is so big with bathtub. Experiance like heaven. ,50
take the free shutter bus from the airport to venetian city or any famous hotel around th mocao . its like 30 min for one bus to waiting . bus stop is 200 meter from the airport . u can travel all around macao just by taking the shutter bus . good accomondation,50
Lovely experience. Comfortable accommodation. Package was excellent value. Time taken to checkin was excessive. More staff need to be available as this is the first impression of the hotel. More seating could be available generally throughout the hotel as it is so large. Amenities such as water should be freely available n the general hotel areas.,40
"I stay first time at Venetian Hotel. It's really luxury. Appearance of Hotel, Interior are so nice. And we can enjoy Casino, Shopping in Hotel.  Appearance = Very Good Interior = Very Good Service = Good Atmosphere = Very Good Clean = Very Good Price = Acceptable              (This time around 2500HK$)",50
"It's a famous Resort in Macau and it's houses Venetian Casinos, Venetian Shopping Arcade, the Signature Gondola Rides and a Swimming Pool for relaxation here one can enjoy Asian Meals and Western Delicacies too. One must visit this place for the Gondola Rides it's really awesome.",50
"We stayed at the venetian for 1 night, and booked the Bellla Suite. I have to say that the staff is exceptional - unlike i have ever encountered! Always ready to go the extra mile to help! The hotel also sent a birthday cake and a few cookies to the room as it was my daughter's birthday! She was thrilled! Truly one the best hotels i have stayed in.",50
"After having seen the original Venetian at Las Vegas, were anxious to experience the little sibling in Macao. Though bit beyond our travel budget, made it a must go to. travelling in July, the accompanying couple who had not traveled abroad ever was thunderstruck on entry to the Hotel by the sheer number of people in the grand lobby somewhat akin to a busy airport or railroad station. The check in alone took no less than 40 minutes. Somewhat apprehensive whether the huge cost incurred will be worth its value and being sore at being allotted rooms not nearer eachother, entered the rooms. The Royal Suite though at the bottom of the rung, the rooms were a picture of perfection in luxury leaving nothing to imagination. In fact everything from interior decor, the attractions and the…",50
"This Hotel is absolutely beautiful,,styled the same as Las Vegas of the same name ,service is excellent and prices are very reasonable Excellent places to eat and the design is amazing ,,Gondolas move along the canal (man made) and you can ride in them ,,great for the whole family",50
Resort is identical to the Venetian in Los Vegas. It's like a city with lots of high-end shops and lots of eating places. Rooms big with a separate lounge area. Beautiful bathroom. Hotel is always very busy so not the place for a quiet holiday. A short walk to other large hotels and casinos.,50
"The sheer size of this hotel will overwhelm even the most stout-hearted person. To say that I got lost [not once or twice, but three times] is not embarrassing at all. And the quintessential Venetian experience would undoubtedly be the 'canal cruise' :) The rooms are huge with a lovely view from almost all of them. Everything about this hotel is luxury. Had a wonderful family vacation here. Flip side: Never ended-up leaving the hotel, coz there is so much to see & do inside the hotel itself ;)",50
"THE GRNDEUR OF VENICE, VENETIAN MACAU  The hotel is no less than a “Mini city”, with striking structure that stands out. The Venetian Macau is the must do experience if you are heading to Macau! Not only because it has world‘s biggest casino but it boasts a resort and is the ultimate luxury experience — with the theme — Venice which gives you a feel as if you have been transported to Venice. It is not only a hotel which offers luxury suits, but also complete shopping, entertainment and dining.  ￼  THE ROYAL ,VENETIAN MACAU  ￼  GRAND LOBBY AT VENETIAN  Three years back I had visited Venetian Macau, to experience a leisure stay. I was amazed to enter this massive edifice, the entrance and the lobby was grand indeed with the majestic art work in ivory carving, contemporary…",50
"Compare with Hongkong, Macau' hotels are more convenient. We stay at Venetian. Hotel is part of the mall. We can enjoy hotel's facilities, easily find food at the mall and go shopping. Venetian also provide bus at the pier. You can easily hop into the bus and go to the hotel for free.   All rooms are suite room. Consider we have 2 children, we book Bella Suite with 2 queen beds. The rate is slightly higher than other suites with king bed, but it worth. Room is spacious with living room. We really enjoy our stay in Venetian.",50
"Entering the hotel gives a feeling of entering a busy highend mall! The crowd is exceptional at the reception area, long queue for check-in as rush was there, but front desk staff is very good and the check-in and check-out was smooth n very fast. Due to some reason we got an upgrade in the room... we got bella suite - 2 queen beds room as we were 3 of us and on the 34th floor. The view from the room was amazing! The room and bathroom were very spacious, comfortable and luxurious...   The hotel has many rooms and you have to walk really a lot to just explore the hotel. The shopping area is more than 2 floors and well spread ...every section having a different look. The ceiling is real alike and the gondola ride is not to be missed... The casino is one of largest one in Macau...…",50
"this is one of the best hotels i have stayed in.as you enter the hotel you come to know how grand it is,it dosent end at all and you keep admiring this hotel.there is a big casino and a very big mall in this hotel which keeps you amazed.staff is very polite and helpfull.plz visit this hotel once in a life time.",50
"In the Venetian Shopping Mall, you can find merchandises from almost every popular brands of shoes, clothes, watches, jewelry and etc.   You can't miss the egg tart from Lord Stow's bakery. There is a waiting line but it moves on quickly.   Gondola riding is also available with the long waiting line in the weekend.",40
"- The best hotel in the area! - Rooms/Suites are awesome and as seen on photos on Booking or TripAdvisor. - Royale Suite (we stayed in COTAI VIew Royale Suite) include a sofa bed. it shows as a two seated sofa in the photos, but reality is that it is a sofa bed that can accommodate two young kids, so no need to add in extra bed. - Rooms are very elegant, well maintained, and spacious and luxurious!  - The Staff at Venetian exceeded out expectation and flipped over our bad experience to a positive one. My son got a throat infection and fever on our last day, amazingly Natalie Chen the duty manager responded immediately and have not only extended our checkout time to 4pm, but had a “security team member” to escort us all the time until we were done with the checkups. We were about…",50
"Absolutely as good (or as bad),  depending on your point of view,  as anything Las Vegas can offer.  Simply astonishing.  The capital expenditure to build the place must have been astonishing.  Gambling is a serious business in Macau.  This an opulent palace in which to carry to it out.",40
"Had an unplanned tour in Macao, and this is the last place we went. the place is quite big that you can be lost if you wander too much. there are so many shops inside and if you have the guts and the money, you can try the Casino.  the artificial blue day sky is beautiful, they also have a night sky in the food court. you can ride a gondola and have your picture taken.  there are many people inside - either shopping, strolling, actually staying in the hotel or playing in the casino - but most of them are nice and accommodating.   would like to remind everyone who wants to go to Macao, that they accept Hong kong dollars - the bills not the coins - so don't be angry at them if they won't accept your coins.",40
We stayed for just a weekend with two children. Shuttle bus service is nice. The check in desk staff were very friendly and accommodating. The rooms are spacious and nice albeit dated and old looking. Only thing was the hotel itself is huge and full of people...and we were a bit overwhelmed by that. Long walk to pools or kidszone and to make the trek through all the people and around the casino part of the hotel was a bit tiring.,40
"You won't believe your eyes that a Hotel can be as incredible as this one is. It's huge, too much of walk inside to reach you room. But you would be glad that you are walking.Entire pathway is gorgeous. The Lobby level has lovely Casino, everytime you cross it to reach your room or some place, you would want to stop by and play a bit. The level up has a huge shopping arcade, and you have blue artificial sky to look at. The Hotel level one has artifical canal, you can get a Gondola ride. Lovely choice of restaurant. You have the best Indian restaurant in the hotel. Great shows... easily you can spend 2 nights at this hotel.",50
We took the King bed suite and as soon as they knew we are honeymooners they sent us a cake to our room which we liked a lot .. the resort is so spacious and the shopping floor is amazing .. its like you are in Venice in Italy,50
"For such a large establishment, myself and the family were treated like royalty even before our arrival.   Max Verzijlbergen, the head of Guest Relations, ensured that myself and the family were fully taken care of during the whole time. We were provided with personal touches (hand written birthday cards, personalised cakes, upgrades and welcoming emails) all from Max and the team which made us feel valued which is unheard of when visiting a hotel of this size.   I cannot recommend the Venetian high enough as the rooms were incredible and the staff were the most attentive I have ever experienced. For example, one night I was locked out of my room at 4am after a late night trip to the casino, and the staff were able to copy a new key and have someone deliver it to me in the lobby…",50
This hotel located on top of shopping center and casino. It is a perfect spot. At first we though it might be a noisy hotel. But after 2 nights stayed it was not a problem at all.Front office is very helpful during check-in process.In the room they have everything you need.Nice and clean.We had a perfect stayed in this hotel.,50
Very nice hotel  The shopping on the canal was amazing has a lit of activities.   The check in was smooth as we got to the rooms we were greeted with personal letters.   The rooms were lovely with split level and gave a very large look it's more like a suite.   We had lovely food and enjoyed all the error days stay.   This is one place a must stay if you want luxury. ,50
"I really love to stay at this hotel, because of their Facilities. their Shuttle Bus are great.   Even though there some problem happen, but overall it's fine. but the check-in Time took Extremely Long, and my room not ready yet.  wish to come back with a Great Value.",40
"I went to Macau to do a bit of Casino hopping. I really like the vibe of Venetian. Although there have been a lot of pictures taken there, it was something new. I like how there was a shuttle directly from the airport of Macau straight to the Venetian. It was very convenient for me.",40
"We stayed for the second time at Venetian for our anniversary and we loved the experience so much. Staff is helpful and polite. When they knew it was our anniversary we got complementary breakfast at Cafe Deco and a mousse cake. Our room was located on 32/F North suite, we had an amazing view looking through Galaxy hotels, and Macau side. The suite was clean, well equipped, I loved the bathroom, so spacious, with two sinks, one bathtub, one shower, separated toilet, a dedicated space for make up! The only thing I can say is that it was way too cold in the room, we turned off the A/C but somehow it was still very cold!  Apart from that everything was great! What we love as well was the pool facilities, it is exclusively for guests only and do check this twice. They have 4 pools…",40
"Staff is really good. Took less than 15 minutes to check in. Hotel is really big. More than 600 shops inside the hotel. You will not be bored. Food court is over priced. Even a water bottle cost 9 US$. It is far from city centre, you have to take a taxi to go there. No where to go or see at mid night. All shops at the food court close by mid night. If you are not going to shop that much, better to stay at city centre & you can pay a visit to venetian anytime.",40
"great food, shopping inside the resort, one never has to leave the hotel. Rooms are extra large! but real gem of the hotel are the staff, always helpful and accommodating. although it might be overcrowded with tourist, i will still stay here on my next macau visit, and maybe i would be lucky in the casino.",40
"Amazing place. Built like a palace and feels like you are in some other world. Huge casino , gandola ride and a variety food court inside . Need a full day to see all the attractions . The place is so huge that u might get lost inside but u will not realize coz u will be busy enjoying paradise.",50
Stayed here for 3 days..hotel is amazing.the room had a full length window..amazing view. .saw a fantastic ice sculpting display...it was held in 1 of the rooms in the hotel...saw the gondoliers on the waterway thats threads through the shops inside the hotel..the shopping centre has a fake sky...we must of spent half our time exploring the hotel..there are three pools..one for adults only which was nice..a mc donalds across the road..only thing that bothered us was the humidity as soon as you left the air conditioned hotel it hit you..but we still managed a few trips out,50
"Stayed with our family group of 40 people. We entered from bus parking area. Entry was OK and was under impression of entering busy market area. On reaching check in, rush was much more, but hats off to check in staff...check was smooth n very fast. All were given rooms in B wing. We walked..walked..walked to reach rooms..on entering we were amazed with room, washroom n bed size. Amazing Golf area view from room. Wifi coverage was excellent.   Swimming pool n jacuzzi was the best. Casino, night club all within reach. Best part was big market in premises itself with every section has different look...not to forget Gondola ride...  Food was awesome with lots of variety in Veg n non veg during breakfast, lunch n dinner.   Venetian is in middle of all clubs, shows n theatre in area.…",50
"Checking in process is a little too slow, a long queue at the counter. But everything else is perfect! Amenities are good too. There were only 2 of us, but the room can fit like 4 people. Free shuttle bus to the hotel. Love this place.",50
its really very BIG. two night stay wasn't enough to see the entire hotel. On first night we stayed in a room which was big with all 5 star amenities. but it had a very bad view.. it look like a huge electricity generator plant within hotel premises. it was horrible view.. very dark in the city of lights. But next day we were shifted to another same size room with comparatively better view but still short of expectation. they said rooms with good view were more expensive. everything from food to basic need items is expensive here. McD in the shopping floor is a great saver if you are on a budget. overall a great memorable experience.. a must visit beautiful place.,40
"Even if the hotel is not too new, it still looks grand and magnificent with its  grand painting on its ceiling. The staffs were  mostly Filipnos and they were genuinely friendly. The receptation staff even upgraded us to a room with a view. I love that drinking water can just be requested any time. Wifi speed is not too bad. The concierge made a mistake though in giving us instructions on hiw to go to Fernando restaurant. He should have told us to cross the street first before taking bus 26. Otherwise we would have ended in the border going to China.  The ambiance though was not as nice becuase there were a number of mainland chinese tourists and as usual, they were very noisy. This is not the fault of the hotel though.     I love our room becaue it was very very huge…",40
"Wow.  This place is amazing.  Like other reviewers, cannot fault the rooms which are huge (we stayed in a Royal Suite which is actually their base grade room), had in room dining for breakfast (again wow), waiter came in, set the table as if in a 5 star restaurant and the meal was excellent).   For those who like an alcoholic beverage whilst placing a few bets, go to Vegas.  No alcohol in the Casinos, at the tables or poker (slot) machines.  All of the casino's we went to were the same. We stayed for five nights and still didn't see everything in this facility.  Top brands of everything.  I've never seen so many Tiffany's, Versace's etc.  Every casino and hotel seemed to have one. Service was faultless and can get good deals online.  Room said the Rack Rate per day was $7500 HKD…",40
"WOW. What a experience my family enjoys at VANETIAN.  We cannot imagine Macau without exp. of VENETIAN. Superb.  The quality of rooms , amenities and Services Levels are of  Very high standards . Its a ONCE in a LIFETIME experience. Venetian is WORL in itself. The CASINO in Venetian is its Heart.  Its a Wow factor. Experience the Joy. They treat you like KING.",50
"We stayed in the Royale suite at the Venetian Macua for three nights and four days. Our room was extremely comfortable and luxurious, the sense of space was amazing for our restless toddler. Room service was par excellence and they set the table to give you a fine dining experience. The food was tasty and sufficient and general service was prompt. There is ample choice of shopping, a play area for kids, the pools, and the gondola boat ride. Get there early to avoid the long queues. All in all an enjoyable stay.",50
"An amazing hotel that is huge.....maybe too big....the rooms are spectacular....adult only pool as well as kids pool, huge shopping centre, food court, bars...huge casino, live shows....but seriously loads walking to get around",40
"visit this place on 22 july 2016, this place is very big and have a beautiful ceilings, but the main problem is :  this place was very very crowded. there're so many people that sit on the floor in this resort casino... and they're acting like they're the owner of this casino... LOL",50
"This is one of the biggest & busy Hotel I have seen. From the Ferry terminal there are free shuttle service to the Venetian Macao resort Hotel.As soon as I entered it was like an Paradise.The rooms are spacious and excellence for leisure and business.There are shopping mall, gondola ride, casino and restaurants on the third floor.I will go back and stay there again with my family .It's worth the stay.",50
"A huge hotel , get spoiled in the lap of luxury. Each and every minute thing you see in the hotel is just so marvelous.  The gondola ride is a must to be taken. The shops are very good and the best part is the casino, best in the world.",50
"This is the one of the best hotel i ever stayed , amazing luxury rooms with lots of space , and the washrooms are better than rooms :-)   I suggest 2 night stay to experience the hotel , the shopping arcade is a treat by itself with lots of options for a shopaholic.  unfortunately i couldn't explore the restaurants , though the breakfast at the coffee shop was quite impressive .  The casino was the best part of my stay , which i enjoyed a lot. look forward to visit back soon .  keep up the good work !!",50
We chose to stay overnight at Macau on a friend's recommendation and it was so right. We were lucky to get a suite upgrade. It was like an apartment :) Property is huge and one need couple of days just to see the property :) Well yes it comes at a cost but its worth it.,50
"This hotel is perfect and very luxury ! The decoration is so nice its look like old church and castels in italy .By our arrival they took us for the vip check in ! The suit was very luxury and very big for one person (living room ,room, bathroom) .in this hotel you can find a big mall for all brands expensive and not  expensive (dior ,versace,fendi,armani,adidas,h&m,pull and bear,lacoste,converse,nike,channel,prada,louis vuiton ......and much more.in this hotel is located the biggest casino in china .you can find a spa ,pool ,cinema,supermarket ,souvenir shop (special items)and a food court with so much restaurants international and Chinese .he had a tour in the gandole its was so much fun the capten was singing and dancing .they tooked pictures of us ,and give them us back…",40
"Beneficial if you book directly from the hotel website as you get the express check in (miss the large crowds waiting in line for hours) .We were upgraded to the topmost floor .. the suite was fit for the royals..spacious ,attention to details for comfort and glamour with  excellent views of the city.There are so many levels of  options for both dinning and shopping in the hotel itself  ...some are overpriced but there are many local ones with good discounts so do look around  .The hotel gives many discount booklets and coupons so do collect that .",50
"I went here with my family, we book for Bella Suites Room via Agoda. We really enjoy with the hotel service, facilities, location and also the room. The room is really big, clean and we got 2 double beds (queen size). The staffs are helpful and friendly. The foods in the restaurant and food court are a bit expensive but we like the taste.",40
"The Venetian Macau China has everything you could want, hotel, casino, restaurants, huge food court, all suites. And as a addes bonus in a city of outstanding history. Leave time for checking out Macau, you wont be sorry.",50
"venetion is the best hotel in Macau,biggeest, beautifull, for full Masti .Nice food best location fully comfertable.hotel has four wings south- north- west -east. these are very big. we stay there 3 days but we can not see all the palace. all over is good hotel with big suits. we are  fully satisfied in all field. Thanks VENETION MACAU",50
"The room is spacious, luxurious and clean. Reception staffs are polite and efficient.  However entrance to rooms had to be via casino and my wife is also always stop by security checks anyways I take that as a compliment to my wife youth.😀  Overall, we love our stay, everything was good and we definitely choose Venetian again in future time.  ",50
"As soon as we arrived in Macao, a shuttle was ready to take us to The Venetian. The hotel was very crowded, however had a feel of grandeur that could not be matched by anyone else. As we had booked directly through their website we got an option for express check-in and also got the room with the best view of Macao as it was on 34th floor. The rooms were spacious and the staff were always ready to meet our requests. Also as thee was a shopping mall, gondola ride, casino and restaurants all on the ground floor we did not need to go out at all. However, due to its sheer size it is sometimes difficult to find way to our rooms.",50
"I truly fall in love with this hotel. This hotel offer you a very huge room and luxury life.   I fallin love with the interior from the lobby  Especially the lobby. Beautiful. The interior feels like in Europe on 5th century.   Breakfast give lots of variety of food from asian, american, etc.   And well, since this place is sooooo big....no wonder if you will get lost inside the mall.   It also easy to access another casino by walking. Very cool isn't it?!   I love Venetian.  ",50
excellent for leisure and business. lots of stuff to do and see. could not see the entire hotel during my 2 days of stay. very good staff and excellent activities. very indulging shopping area and an excellent casino.,50
"Extremely good service, very friendly and helpful staff, beautiful, cosy and grand suite room, highly useful shuttle bus, huge shopping area, contains everything you want in one place. Definitely will go back again. This hotel is one of the main reasons I will want to go to Macau. Ask for high floor.",50
"The Venetian Hotel is really huge and not that easy to navigate. We had slight problems locating the main hotel reception (lost in the maze of shopping corridors at ground level). The hotel is linked to the very big Venetian Casino and Shopping Centre. Following check-in after waiting in line (picture a long immigration queue) for a long while, we had to navigate our way to the correct lift lobby. The hotel is so big and long that there are 2 very separate lift lobbies (North and South). We were assigned room 97 at the North lobby but for some inexplicable reason, the reception sent us to the South lobby, resulting in a fantastically long walk, lugging our luggage. Not so user friendly 5 star hotel after all? The saving grace is the size and grandeur of the guest room (or…",50
"We stayed 2 nights with 3 rooms in this Hotel The Lobby was amazing and big. Check in was quick and the staff was very nice. for the room...... its awesome. very big, spacious and the design was very Italian. The bath room was awesome too. The amenities was completed.  The pool was amazing with many different pool The Kids club was big and complete although its not free.  For food at breakfast was good with many variety of food.  The location was perfect, cause in the 3rd floor it was a big mall with Venetian Design its the best mall with the Venetian boat too.  There is a fine dining restaurant, branded shop, theater, Star Buck and big Casino in the 1st floor.  I definitely will stay in this hotel again if i go to Macau",50
"Just excellent. Its a shame i was only here for the night, but there is plenty to do in the hotel, a brilliant casino, swimming pools. I had a lovely suite on the top floor, however i would say the views weren't so amazing as the Island isn't so big! Definitely a mini Las Vegas without the price tag. We went for a stroll outside and walked through the amazing streets of Macau, which get crazy busy at night. It's a portugese colonised island so it has some pretty portugese architecture and restaurants. Brilliant street food, and most of all the nightlife is brilliant!",50
Want a venetian experience but no budget yet? Then Macau shall do just fine. You'll love the grand canal inside the mall.  The luxurious casinos and of course dont skip the shopping! It was my first time coming here and although i think the other malls would have been better this one is still one of my favorites among the many places we've visit during our Hk/Macau Tour!,50
"I did not stay in this hotel overnight, I just visited to go to the casino and shop. Huge casino and plenty of places to shop.   Was very impressed with the paintings on the walls/ceilings, it definatly felt you were walking outside in Venice...very beautiful!",50
"Certainly one of d best hotels.  Recommended to stay if you tend to spend time in d room,  and if you hv extra budget.  Cleanest n plush hotels.  Huge area to cover as a tourist,  in a day.  Casino,  gondola are some attraction which will take ur breath away.  The reception area looks like a crowded market place and chk in time is for longer hours.  Their r 2 entry points to d hotel,  however the entrance of 1 end from where the buses usually drops the tourist is horrible in terms of crowd, suddenly one feel that it's a railway stn. The other entry is peaceful.  Both the entrance to the hotel are at the extreme end of each other.  But once you clear all this and once you start walking towards d lobby it's an different experience.   Recommended not to stay in the hotel instead…",50
"Just returned only yesterday from Macau.  I am still in the awe of Venetian Macao Resort Hotel.  Stayed for two nights, as a matter of fact limited to one and half days as had to check out early in the morning to catch Ferry to HKIA, wish we were there for one more day.  Great architecture, big place  (one requires a full day to explore the hotel and surroundings), host of fun & entertainment options (besides Huge Casino - I am not a big fan though).  Spacious and well maintained suites, neat and clean corridors.  Luxurious Brands. Value for money stores and food court (besides the hotel restaurants).  Impressive Gondola ride (wish the Canal has been lenthier than the one and ride to be longer).  Overall a great relaxing experience.  Wish hotel care to include break-fast and…",50
"Had a great time in the hotel,rooms r very nice and big.. Lots of activities in the hotel..casino is good..good Indian restaurant..u can stay in the hotel all day and cannot get bored..very lively atmosphere..good live music they play..throughly enjoyed our stay.. Thumbs up",50
"Hotel is located right in the Venetian shopping mall with a variety of shops and restaurants for adults and kids. Taking an indoor Gondola ride is also wonderful under an artificial  atrium. A 70-square-meter Bella suit with 2 parts is large enough for a family of parents and two children. Decoration is splendid. There are plenty of shuttle buses different locations, which provide a free and convenient way to explore the city. Shrek, the Broadway show is on at the moment in the theatre. ",50
"Magnum Opus. Yes it really is an masterpiece although in the form of a giant ,3000 rooms resort with 400 shops. One require 2 days to explore and enjoy the Venetian only. Gondola ride, arena, swimming pool, Qube are just awesome. Perfect for the entire family. Best place to stay in Taipa Macau till another property by the same group becomes operational. Yes they are coming up with another Masterpiece - 2700 rooms Parisian... Definitely full brownie points to Venetian. Venetian is Macau and Macau is Venetian.",50
"it was so nice to stay in Venetian Macau, but the swimming pool is not to big, that is the only bad image. Me and my wife can sleep very well and can even go down to Casino for relax.   Venetian is quite old history compare to its vicnity hotels, and can manage very well, cheers.",50
"There are a number of hotels in Macao with shoppes, great rooms and casinos. What sets The Venetian apart is the fact that it is Venetian. Classy architecture with some brilliant artwork adorn the lobbies and corridors. The shopping area is a constructed to look like the Grand Canal and does an amazing job with bridges, gondolas, Italian piazzas and amazing architecture all around. Rooms are again large and comfortable with very helpful service staff. Dining options are excellent with a wide variety of cuisines in the many restaurants, however the food court is a little restricted in terms of choice. Try the Cafe Deco buffets. The hotel may feel a little crowded, however, this is the place to stay when in Macao.",50
"I am Italian, totally trustworthy. The hotel is a nice one, a Vegas-style reproduction of Venice. It s a good fake, clean for the moltitude that is in, noisy in the lobby but very quiet in the room. Employees are just ok, not super friendly and surprisingly only a few of them speaking english. It s not a romantic hotel, and differently from Vegas, there is not a strip out there. So go if u want to have fun with gambling in a low level noisy but funny place, standard food and shopping since the dozens of shops are the same you can find everywhere, come here: next time I ll try another hotel, but still I ll spend some money in gambling here: but mainly don t come here for romance with your fiancee.",40
"My Family very enjoy stayed in this Hotel, The Room was big, We have a very nice bella suite. the Hotel Staff very helpul, Everything we need just call ""0"" and then staff Hotel will help so quickly. We also can change the coin money to MOP to take a public transport/bus. also can buy a ticket Cotai Jet in concierge.  We can Also find Halal Food in food court.  Everytime we need a water, a staff Hotel will give to our Room. The Shuttle Bus every 5-10 minute. We want stay here again next Holiday.",50
"The hotel is quite luxury as known, it is very convenient for everything like gambling, eating, shopping and other entertainment. The quality of restaurants are great but very expansive (expected). The only thing that I don't like is the hotel is too busy and crowded due to too many tourists, most of them are not the guests who are staying at this hotel. But overall is good, good for vacation, people here can enjoy a great time, even don't need to leaving hotel. ",40
"I just have one word for this property & it is INCREDIBLE. This was the best property We have ever visited in our lifetime. Casino was so great. We played and won too. Gandola ride was so romantic, room was spacious. And the city view from our room was so amazing. A must go property. ",50
I have stayed in this hotel with my family and enjoyed every moment of it. My kids doesnt want to leave the hotel even after check out...such a great resort room service was superb. Ultimate dining at golden peocock and cafe deco. Huge casino to play around. Big swimming pool infact they have 3 different pools. Suites are really great bathroom big...superb will definitely visit again.,50
"During our 4days vacation to HK and Macau, we spent 2days1night at this amazing resort. Good connection and very frequent free shuttle bus from/to ferry terminals. We received a very warm welcome, great help from VIP checkin and concierge for my 75years old mother-in-law. Expensive deposit but very comfortable and nice red wheel chair for her to explore the big Venetian resort.  The summer room package comes with ferry tickets to HK airport. Voucher/slips to redeem the ferry tickets will be given after checkin. The redemption is fast to be done at another specified counter. There are limited ferry schedule available to HK airport, so redemption to confirm tickets (not seats no.) should be done immediately after check in.   We have a very nice Bella suite at south hall for 3…",50
"This is just the place you should visit.. we came here in winters and previously this hotel was not in our radar being a bit costly.. but then one of my friend told me that if you are going to Macau then do stay in this hotel.. we paid only 3000 rupees extra but it was worth it.. My daughter really loved Qcube... the children play area.. and this is so big that you need a map to go to your rooms or to travel inside the hotel. my daughter still tells the stories about this hotel.. in our 10 days of stay in tour in hongkong, malaysia and macau.. this was the best one..  Rooms are reaaaallly big.. the best place till now...  Definitely should stay here.. add some extra amount just for this.. its worth it..",50
"It was an awesome experience staying in this hotel. Price was totally worth it for the hospitality. Came during Christmas, will definitely come back and stay at this hotel with the family. All in all, everything was great.",50
"The room was spacious, the bed was comfortable, and amenities sufficiently stocked - but that's what you would expect from a 5-star hotel.  What came as a pleasant surprise were the birthday cakes and greeting cards, even though we were just a small party of 4 on a special price package.  Very impressed with their service - we are already planning another stay t the end of the year.",50
"Visited again this month with family.  The room really need some detail  touch up.  We were being disturbed by the Room Attendant to request for room make up since 8:30am and the same lady asked me again when I was out at 10am.  Very honest, I don't like to be disturbed especially on Sunday morning!  The Pool Attendant was good, the lady offered a glass of water for my son and me when we sat down before swim, this is totally unexpected!  But pool water is not very clean.  All in all, everything better than my first visit back to years ago.",40
"Calling Venetian Macao as a hotel or resort is a misnomer, its a small town in it self. Stayed here for 3 days and felt should have booked for at least a couple of more. It has no rooms, only suites. And I simply could not find any fault with the rooms apart from the small water bottles - but they replenish it on request. As a part of the Sands Group, Venetian is interconnected to the other Sands Cotai properties in the vicinity so there is lot to see just walking around the hotel.  A number of high-end stores can satiate your desire for shopping (its great for the window shoppers too) and there is activities galore.   The food court is just amazing with a lot of variety (including vegetarian food); you also get stone oven pizzas which are sinfully awesome. Indian food in…",50
"I was totally out of words when I saw this place, I was just like, Wow. It's so freaking amazing! I cannot wait to get back there! The ceiling mimicked that of the real sky, as how you would imagine it on a perfect day. The canal looked like it was straight up lifted from Venice itself. It's beautiful. There's a variety of boutiques and stores you can shop and dine at. Definitely a must-see in Macao! :)",50
All rooms in the Venetian Macao are suites which are spacious and well-equipped.  We dined at two of the restaurants on the resort (both excellent) and used the large pool area extensively.  Abundant shopping options for every budget.  Staff are excellent especially comparing to nearby Hong Kong! We made numerous special requests which were ALL met (with a smile!).  Then of course there is the large casino floor providing games to match your risk appetite.  In summary there is everything you need for a resort escape without leaving the property.,50
"I have stayed for one night at Venetian Macao on a holiday trip to Hong Kong and Macao. Even though the resort is costly, it is worth to stay in this resort. There is lot of attraction inside the resort itself for shopping, Gondola ride, restaurants and bar.",50
"I am not a regular hotel reviewer, but the services rendered by the Guest Relations  Team in The Venetian Macao makes me be one of those to appreciate what they have done to assist me in the wedding proposal during the stay.  I booked the hotel 4 weeks in advance enjoying the program discount of 25% off, what a great bargain for the room and service! I sent the service request to the hotel asking for the in-room arrangement of delivering the surprise and setting up some video stuff when we dine out. The reply was positive and prompt and the team was very professional and cooperative during the whole process of communication.  What's more is that they have arranged us to check-in in the VIP lounge and a celebration cake was presented. Warmest so far in every hotel experience!! …",50
"The hotel is well maintained, I stayed at south wing floor 14, in the interconnecting rooms which I've specifically requested to the reception staff. The staff was very welcoming and helpful. The rooms were nice, clean and the bed's comfortable. There are 2 televisions in the room, 1 in front of the bed and the other is in the living room area with sofa. From the hotel, you can go to their shopping mall area where you can shop, eat and there's kids area. There's a food court in the mall, and of course there's lord stow's egg tart in the mall and also in the hotel.  From the ferry terminal, you can take free shuttle bus to this hotel. Definitely will recommend this hotel. ",50
"Its a luxury and casino hotel in Macau but it offers a lot aside from casino gambling . A must see and experience  is the macau venetian gondola ride.The gondola might have originated in Venice, but you don’t have to wait for a trip to Europe to ride the traditional, flat-bottomed row boat. The Venetian Macau offers Italian gondolas with serenading gondoliers gliding through the San Loco, Marco Polo, or Grand Canals.  While the whole thing may seem like a romantic adventure, it can be a fun family activity or a friendly one. Just forget about the smooch under the bridge. -",50
"Once you walk through the double doors into the hotel you would find you are in seventh Heaven .  The wonderful Roman Feel , Similar to the Vegas counterpart , gives you a feel for luxury . Add that to unparalleled customer service , and you have a winner .   The Rooms are big with all the basic amenities you could ask for . As a couple we were thrilled . Since we were there for the races , we hardly had any time . But we did manage to find an entire day for shopping ( mind it you would need an entire day ) . followed by the Casino and then the Spa . We were soaked into luxury and had a feeling of a resort .   Even though its very very very busy , you need to just find the right link . Check in and check out takes a little time . Room Service is quick . Shopping mall has tons of…",40
It was a really nice experience staying at Venetian. We had booked Royal Suite and we got accommodated at 18th Floor. The bathroom has elegant marble floor with both bath and shower.  The view was amazing from our window. There is a very beautiful multiple swimming pools arrangements on I think 3rd or 5th floor. It was lovely. The property offers free Venetian shuttle bus to The Venetian Macao from Macau Ferry Terminal as we Landed in Hong Kong and went to resort by Ferry. The Ferry service starts at 11:00 AM. Please check with the property on the shuttle bus schedule in advance.  The Venetian Macao Resort Hotel is like a  5 to 7 minutes walk from The Shoppes at Four Seasons and an about 10 to 15 minutes drive from Taipa Ferry Terminal. It has Asia's largest casino in it and is…,50
"I stayed at The Venetian with my husband and children aged 5 and 7. We initially booked the Bella suite for 4 nights but upon entering the room we had some issues and were promptly upgraded to a Family suite. It was large and had an area for the parents as well as the children. The family suite was perfectly geared towards families with younger children and consisted of bunk beds, kids desk and chairs and their own tv and video games. Furthermore the suite included a stepping stool and amenities for children. They also had a plush toy each sent to the suite for them.  The service at the hotel was exceptionally good! Check in was smooth particularly because we had emailed prior to our stay and requested the check in forms which were filled out prior.  The pool area was great and…",40
A very nice hotel with lots of amenities. Excellent staff service especially at the swimming pool staff so pleasant and helpful. Unfortunately the spa was closed for renovation until August not so good at this time of the year. Fantastic suites!! Very good restaurants however quite overpriced as we spent eight days at the hotel. ,40
Be spell bound with the large spaces inside the hotel. The malls and the shopping places inside are really good. Take a ride in the boat in the canal inside the Venetian.The food court inside the hotel has many cuisines to offer including the Indian.,40
"Only an overnight stay,but would come back All facilities were excellent Beds great Only complaint was about all Chinese hotels in general. They claim to offer non-smoking rooms which is true,but the rooms always stink of stale smoke",40
"Great Hotel AND WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE.Everything Is EXCELLENT , Rooms are spacious . CANAL STREET with shopping under the clouds is splendid.Sunrise view from room was superb.Holidaying with friends and families. though not first time excitement was like first visit/",50
"Good property clean wide rooms nice place to explore.  Casino  &  shopping lovers have great fun . Have 2 Indian restaurant , golden peacock rocks 😃😃😃😃, Indian Spice second option , best way to  explore macau. Also go glaxy for fun in casino and there diamond lobby.",50
"If you are in Macau and you don't visit The Venetian, trust me, you have missed a great deal of truly extravagant side of Macau hotel luxury and casino culture! Holding the title of being the biggest Casino in the world with highest number of roulette tables this is a place to awe upon. The 3rd level has a unique tourist grabbing attraction - Venice built inside the Hotel ! With a false sky and a Gondola ride with all Venice attractions/sights built in to emulate the original European city, the souvenir photograph with the Gondola ride is a keepsake ! Must visit for sure!",50
"Our first time visit to Venetian Macau. We stayed there 2 nights. We experienced good service manner, excellent guest room environment on 23/F with clear outdoor view. We enjoyed delicious food at BamBu Restaurant and CafeDeCo Restaurant & Food Court. One of splendid shopping mall in Macau. Travelling by shuttle bus was convenient. We also could walk around other shopping mall linking with Venetian. Overall rating was 8.8.",50
Made a trip with my elderly parents earlier this week. The staff were all very friendly and handled our check in very well. The room was large and greatly surprised my parents. We were at 33 floor with a bird's eye via on Cotai area. A fantastic stay overall.,50
"Five-star hotel with spacious rooms and a beautiful interior. Venetian Hotel is very wide so to get to the room had to be through the journey through the spacious lobby. For a superior room was already very spacious office that consists of a bathroom, bedroom and there is a relaxing space along the couch to watch television, especially when using a suite type rooms would be very much more widely. Venetian Hotel is integrated with four other luxury hotels that can be accessed with one another and equipped with a casino.",50
"Great luxurious hotel with very comfortable suites and good service. The place is huge!! (3000 plus suites) and its very easy to get lost in it. Lining up at the reception desk or info desk can be a bit of a pain.  But a great experience, thoroughly enjoyed it and would go again in a heartbeat.",40
"Venetian is not just a hotel, it is an experience in itself. And a royal one at that. With vintage furniture, artistic interiors, classy crowd and some of the best brands from around the globe, it feels right out of a dream. The place is so grand that two days and nights were not enough to experience all of it. But each moment is totally worth it. Indian vegetarians must visit the Golden Peacock restaurant in here for a culinary festival. If you ask me, one should go to Macau to only experience this place, at least once in their life.       We booked this place for two nights on a friend's advice.",50
"This is a must go and stay resort hotel in macau. Spacious room, artistic furniture, and built in to the venetian shopping mall. It was my accident stay here because i used the hotel shuttle bus that standby at the ferry station and bring you to venetian hotel. The receptionis was no friendly. Maybe because due to the long que and crowd of the guess. One thing that below my expectation is the pool.. very small in term of resort hotel. Futhermore, the pool area is half under constuction when i stayed there in year 2014. ",50
We booked royal suite with king size bed. The reception was very kind to change the reservation to twin bed room with the same class. The room was very spacious with living room and big beds. Overall the saty ws excellent for the quality of the room. Only one downside that the hotel does not provide shuttle to tourist destination other than to the ferry terminals.,50
"This is my first time to visit Macau with my family. I booked this hotel on their official website. I enjoyed everything in this hotel very much and I think I will stay in this hotel again as I am in Macau. The food was good, the room I stayed was quite good, very nice swimming poor, furthermore, I liked the shopping mall in the hotel very much.",50
"The venetian Macau is no doubt the grandest of all in Macau. Thousands of travellers check in and check out ijn this hotel daily!   What I liked: The property obviously is a treat. You need not go outside the hotel,since the hotel itself has a lot to offer. From the fantastic casino to the ultimate shopping destination. I stayed there for three days and felt that a day more would have been brilliant. The small activities like the gondola rides etc are a must do. You should also definitely try your luck at the casino. For Indian Travellers and other nationals who are fond of Indian Food, THE GOLDEN PEACOCK is a  must try (The bad part about it below). Enjoy a beer at the swimming pool and try the mini golf.  What I did not like:  a) After a long flight one expects to check in as…",40
"Stayed at The Venetian for 4 nights and it was an awesome experience, we got a complimentary upgrade to The Rialto suite - what a feeling! The room was absolutely fabulous and amenities were well appointed - we even had a Nespresso machine in our room... The resort is a city within itself, and way too big, man I got tired of walking. We bought the buffet pass as there was a promotion at the time, and boy it was a great idea - all the places we tried had great spread of food and didn't disappoint at all - Feast, Golden Peacock, Grand Orbit. Definitely recommend this resort. Casino wasn't very impressive as the minimum bets are too high and not for recreational gamblers.",50
"We 4 families stayed there for 2 nights and 3 days. Huge hotel with large casino area. Room service is little bit slow but reasonable with such a large hotel. All rooms are suite, ours was Royal suite.Good room planning and perfect ambience make this place a Must visit hotel. We enjoyed casino a lot there till late in nights also. Staff was very cooperative and food court at 3rd floor and Gandola ride was awesome. Try to get rooms on golf course view ,other side is also good but inner side is best.",50
"We stayed one night at the Venetian Macau and got the royal suites package. Large rooms, got a complimentary gondola ride, breakfast and discount booklet. Awesome selection of restaurants and stores in the resorts. We also used the the shuttle service to the ferry terminal which was convenient and comfortable. One issue/complaint was that this hotel is fairly large so the check in/check out process took quite a bit of time.",40
"My partner and I were most excited about going to Macau and staying at the Venetian. Even having read a number of reviews, the vastness of the hotel and the complex was totally surprising - it was very easy to get lost!  It was great to wander around the food court and shopping areas and with a little imagination believe you were strolling around the canals of Venice while being indoors.   We had a Royal Suite on level 26 which looked out over the Galaxy (provided a beautiful backdrop of an evening) and the harbour. The room was extremely spacious with a separate large bathroom; the king size bed was on a mezzanine level and the lounge area had a couch; desk; table and lounge chairs upon which to relax.  The only element which was disappointing was the furnishings and the room…",40
"It is one of the best resort in Macau and value for money, the rooms are so big and cosy that after visiting from Hongkong, each room in Venetian looks like a bungalow. We stayed in a Bella View Suite which is quite big one with 2 queen sized beds and pretty big living room + a view of Hotel Galaxy which, illuminates in the night to give a majestic view.   Amenities in the room are plenty and drinking water and extra towels are easily available on call. One should call the front desk in 30 mins normally things reached to room. It is pretty big property so it better to get a map and get familiar with major points of interest.   Staff is highly courteous and much polite and better then Hongkong service industry  There are plenty of choices to eat and for vegetarian people there…",50
"It's massive means really. U will get lost easily. Solution simple - every where there are touch location  maps fixed . It tells us where we are. After that code language n invent places-restaurants shops etc.  Be careful about casino.  When u start winning , take a break. If ur luck is good - take jackpot machine.  If not check ur luck with other machines.  Indian spice restaurant is really good. Artificial sky there is wonderful. ",40
This is my second time in Venetian Macau. And of course my favorite section is the shopping area. You can almost have everything that you need there. From high end brands to Local Brands. If you're going to purchase an Apple product I suggest you buy at Fortress. It's cheaper compared to other reseller stores.,50
"All under one roof! Loved every aspect of the resort. The architecture is one of a kind. Can't have enough of it, it's like you've been transported somewhere else. Great selection of restaurants & stores in the resort. They do have street performances too in the Grand Canal area. ",50
"The Venetian Macao is an impressive hotel, with a huge casino (divided into four zones, probably to help you not to get lost), shopping mall (with canals), and thousands of rooms.  The casino floor is very nice, clean, and updated.  Our room was nice and clean, but strangely dated for a hotel that's only about ten years old.  The decor looked like something more than twenty years old, and some features seemed out of place in a modern hotel (like the old fashioned CRT television).  The room was surprisingly large and very functional; it just could use a design refresh.  ",40
"We stayed at Venetian to celebrate our daughter's birthday. We had wonderful time there though the weather is not as good because of rain storm. However we can stay in the hotel and enjoyed ourselves, spacious, clean, cozy room. Besides, the hotel gave us birthday cake which is very delicious too. We will come again next time we go to Macau.",50
Venitian Macau is like a palace and the experience to stay and dine was splendid. it is a good shopping place and you can get whatever you want at Venetian. Not to miss The rooms are quiet big and vey spacious to relax.,50
"The hotel is very big and lots tourist in out.  The room are very spaced with nice designs and clean toilet. They have great service too. The counter girls are very polite and always smile. They explain in great details. The hotel provides shuttle bus to different places, except the famous tourist spot. Disappointed on it. ",40
"Have experienced luxury before, think twice before you land in Venetian Macau. Situated on Cotai Island of Macau, provides unimaginable experience of Venice. Stayed there for 1 night with family, was a true experience to remember.  The rooms are have a minimum of two separated places for bed and relaxing/study. There is also a full dining area for in room dining. The amenities are all classy in nature, with each furniture looked hand crafted. We ordered for in room dining and it was also a majestic experience with the service it offered. The quality and taste of the food could not be better. There is also a food court inside the shopping mall. We had breakfast included in the package, and could not even remember the number of  items covered in the buffet menu. Amazing collection…",50
"The hotel is just huge!!! Biggest hotel casino in the world. The decoration is amazing and all the staff speak English which it was really nice. The room were nice just q bit old.. Don't have any sound system, Bluetooth, usb charge. The swimmingpool was very nice but they don't have music and to get a drink it took us to wait too much .   ",50
"Big Hotel with free shuttle bus from ferry terminal is a good point.Check in was only allowed after 02.00 PM,so long queee when i want to check in (about 40 minutes from queiing and check in) even i was travelling in tuesday.Reservation team made a good note from my requests.They also concerned and ensure that sofa bed will be prepared since i am travelling with my young kid.<Extra mineral water and bath kit also prepared for my kid).Thanks Jane for your great hospitality.I got a room from north side and the entrance was near the food court.",50
"Stayed here, unfortunately, only for 1 night. Should had stayed here for more nights. The reception is great, very friendly and caters to what I need very well. The room....gosh....our royale suite was perfect. Speechless when we entered our room. View was breathtaking. Room service is perfect and the gondola ride is great. Will I stay here again? You bet I will. ",40
"The hotel and rooms are nice. For this type of hotel, it's fairly pricey but the staff were all super friendly and helpful. Try the 7th floor of the south tower for a nice view with a mini golf course.",40
Macau is famous for casinos and malls. Venetian provides the best casino facilities. The grand canal inside the venetian is one of the most beautiful man made structures i have ever seen. very romantic. The hotel staff is very helpful. We were on our honeymoon. And none other hotel would have been better. The concierge lady helped me with making phone calls and helped me book shows even outside the hotel.  By and large the best hotel in macau,50
Superb location with excellent in house facilities...!!  Beautiful view of Cotai strip & mini golf course from our room was simply amazing.  Our suite was upgraded to a Cotai view suite. You can add some more vegetarian restaurants.  Also make casinos more English friendly with English signages. Overall a really luxurious & comfortable stay...!!,50

"I spent 3 nights here as a part of my Macau trip. I have been staying at the Venetian since the first time i visited Macau 9 years ago in 2008. The room, the facilities in the resort and the service is great as always. The staff is helpful and friendly. The architecture of the building is one of a kind, it was a great place to take photos. Its also provide family friendly atmosphere at the resort and i had such an amazing time with my family. ",50
"Its a complete world in itself. You just think and you will have it. The rooms were amazing and so very spacious  , we stayed at BELLA SUITE on the 15th Floor. Queen sized beds ( can easily accommodate 2, if more people are travelling and staying in one room ). Everything was just perfect from Interiors to Bathroom to in room amenities. We also relished the Indian Buffet at THE GOLDEN DRAGON RESTAURANT. Needed minimum 2 days to have a complete view of the Venetian, its a huge property . You will find Casino's , shops , good Food court with one Indian Restaurant.",50
"Macau although not thought of as a normal honeymoon destination by many couples, should actually be on everyone's list. It is the perfect holiday destination when you want a vacation where you chill in a hotel room with tons of shops, a food court, pools, etc.. All within the same complex. My husband and I spent three nights here-  What we loved- 1. Great service by the staff, they were friendly and polite.  2. Thoughtful touches- as it was our Honeymoon, they sent up a delicious chocolate mousse cake to our room as a surprise and as requested, they accommodated us with a room on the 32nd floor. 3. A STUNNING view of the city from the 32nd floor. 4. Free late check out on the day we were supposed to leave. 5. Fast free wifi. 6. Clean and spacious rooms.    What could be…",50
"I have stayed several times at The Venetian Macau, as in every time, the service was splendid, staff very attentive and polite and have always gone an extra mile to make sure I am a happy guest.  This time I got a free night from Sands Reward club, and I thought, ok, maybe this time, since I am not paying for the night, the service might be different. Room might be smaller or less attractive.  Turned out I was wrong, no change in the service whatsoever, it was as good as before, if not even better. The room was specious, the welcoming was very warm. I admit, I love this place and will be certainly coming back again!!!  A big thank you to all the staff whom made my stay so wonderful!!!",50
"Superb hotel. The world is inside. Copy of Venice which is better than the real Venice. Must visit once. Rooms are so spacious. All branded shops are inside. The gondola ride experience is awesome. You will not know what time in the world it is going on, once you are inside.",50
"The hotel location is fantastic, close few minuts walking  (very hot weather) or with texi from all the best places in Macau, including the other big hotels and the airport terminal, ferry terminal and shopping centers. It has the best rooms (only suits) and the biggest casino in the world. the staff are very friendly and help, even takes you where ever you want to go at the hotel just ask them. the hotel dezine like vevetian is amazing and people come only to see it, and also to see the shops at the side of the canal that crosses the hotel.",50
"Big big big, major big establishment. Bigger than marina baysands I persumed. Hotel, casino, mall, food court, pool, foodcourt joined together in 1 location. Expensive but worth every penny. The room is amazing, large, coated in gold paint, looks fancy and expensive. In here, u have to spend a lot of money, because in Macau everything is expensive from food to drinking water. Should try the gondola!!! Expensive !!! But worth to try once. The staff are from many different countries like spain and phillipines, and they all have amazing voices.",50
"If You are going to Gamble to Macao then ............. 1. Stay at the Cotai Strip - Any hotel is fine, ideally choose one with Breakfast included and/or meals 2. The strip is not a big area and all hotels and casinos are connected through free shuttles also can be covered by walking 3. There are no convenient stores or 7/11 or others and hence please carry your alchohol with you 4. No Mc Donalds except for one in Cotai Shoppes in Sands and hence you are forced to eat in the hotels which could be somewhat expensive  The Venetian offers more than just Gambling, but more for family than for the lone/group of friends who are there to Gamble  WIFI - please be careful in choosing the Free Wifi - there is a paid option that you could choose by mistake",40
"The size of the room is very spacious but the stairs are sticky, have to wear slippers.   Taxi stand is far away from the check in/out counters, unfortunately if you are under 21, you are not allowed to get thru the casino and have to take another 10 mins walk to the check out place.   Staffs are generally nice but not very concise - takes few mins to understand each other.   If you are in a holiday mood, above is not a problem at all.",40
"Booked a hotel suite.  Hotel has four wings.  You have to walk 20mins to pool and gym is at the south wing.  Hotel, casino and shopping place are huge.  Free shuttle buses are available to bring you to ferry terminals or airport or hotels.",40
Venetian is a great place to stay in Macau. This is nothing less than a city with everything inside. The Royal suites are just too good to stay. Resort service is nice. Awesome Indian food was served by Peacock. Golf course and Gondola Ride are special complementary. Good place to buy brands as a huge shopping place (with daytime all the time) is part of the Resort. Multiple casinos are within the Venetian to spend nights.,50
"I loved my visit to the Venetian in Macau.  It wasn't as packed in Las Vegas, but there is so much to do.  The Gondolas are great. If you have kids and need to put them somewhere there is a 3 hour day care available with slides and games and activities.  The canal shops have a lot of restaurants and retail stuff to do.  Lobby is great and large.    Pros - Lots to do, casino, rooms are clean, restaurants, prices reasonable Cons - Casino Buffet was below average.  I would eat at the canal shop restaurants",50
"This place is HUGE. Leaving aside the eye-gasm from all the ceiling art and the fake sky above gondolas in the shopping mall, our stay at the Venetian was brilliant. The rooms are huge, we had an insanely good view of Macau in the evening. Staff at reception could be a little quicker, but the check in and out process is simple. There is a taxi stand outside but a lot of places are easy to walk to nearby. On price-point, I will just say a stay here is not cheap.  One star docked because of:  1) All the rooms still smell like smoking rooms. What is that about? Having been to Macau a few times now I've noticed this in all the casino hotels - this clearly needs to be addressed, the smell is foul.  2) Unfortunately, given the Venetian has been around a while the rooms are a little…",40
"From hongkong you can visit macau for almost 1 and half an hour.first, go to HK-Macau terminal port. Dont forget to bring your passport. Then second, buy your ticket for only $180 (one way), some ferry boat offered $150-160. Their last trip is until 10:30pm but you need to come before 10 or else you need to find a hotel and apartel to stay for night and it so expensive.When we arrived in macau,we ride a shuttle for free- yes! Its free even our tour was free.I feel I was in venice Italy when I  there, you will enjoy staying in the resort and take a picture w/ your company or if you are alone. If you feel hungry they have different type of cuisine but its a bit of expensive. They accept HKD! When returning to macau-HK terminal port I saw the beauty of the city because of the…",40
"The Venetian is one of the most jaw-dropping luxurious hotel we've ever been to. It's interior design and the Venetian-inspired architecture is truly impressive. Their staff in costumes give guests the extra-feel of strolling under Venice sky. Am not a big fan of the casino but I heard it's pretty crowded. I guess this explains why there weren't a lot of people in the outdoor swimming pools. (Which was great coz then I was able to have some privy time in their Murano pool and Jacuzzi. )There's a lot of shopping going on and although they have very friendly and accommodating staff,  I still suggest one grabs a map to avoid literally getting lost.  We stayed in one of their spacious Royale suite which was a split-level type that made us feel like royalty.  I love that the hotel is…",50
"We stayed in this hotel for 2 days. Trust me this hotel is GRAND. It has casinos, shopping mall, food court and many more things. We booked this hotel through expedia.com. Hotel offers frequent pick and drop shuttle service (free) to airport and ferry ports.   As soon as we reached at 12:00 pm, within 10 mins, they offered us a room whereas their official checkin timings are 3:00 pm. There staff is very hospitable and ensure to offer you all sort of help.  We booked belle suite room type which is good for 2 adults and 2 kids (twin double beds). Room is very spacious. You can enjoy variety of activities such as swimming,casino and kids activity  room.  They have huge shopping complex with nice food court which offer many cuisines.  You must try Gandola ride. It is a terrific…",50
"After doing a bit of research decided on the Venetian for our recent trip to Macau.  Although it is a huge hotel, we didn't have any trouble finding our room as others have experience. When arriving to our room we were blown away by the size with huge bathroom and seperate living area, it was like our own little apartment.  The rooms could do with a bit of an update as they are showing their wear, but overall it was great and would definitely visit again",40
"Pleasant stay. Comfortable spacious room. Sofa becomes a bed which was useful as my little one (1,5 year) slept comfortably on it by himself. High speed internet, very stable in the room (Wi-fi). When we entered the room the temperature was set to 17 celsius, which was way too low as outside it was 40 degrees. Not a big deal, you can adjust it. However, inside the whole resort, it is really very cold. I suggest bringing some long sleeve clothes or pants, especially for your little ones. You can find everything inside the resort, so no need to get out.",50
"A must visit when you are in Cotai area or in Macau . Of all the entertainment venues and Casinos available , one of the most comprehensive and complete experience giver must be from the Venetian at Macau . They have a full range of shopping , dining and gaming experience catering for a wider range of guests and visitors ..",50
At first my sister book us at this hotel thru Booking.com because they offer a big discount. The Royal Suite was 13k for 3 persons. So we decided to book this offer. The offer includes free breakfast. I emailed the Venetian if we can get another 1 person in our room since my mom's friend decided to go with us to macau. The staff of the hotel replied to me in about 3-4hrs. They told me the decision is between booking.com and me since I book thru agent and not directly to the hotel. So I decided to cancel my reservation in booking.com and book directly to their site. I saw one of their promotions (Scrumptious Macao Getaway) and decided to book this. I calculated the normal rate of room and the perks of this promotion which is I think is a best offer compared to the other promos…,40
"It was pleasant stay with sands group the hotel itself is like a city we don't have to go anywhere after approaching this beautiful hotel with all the amenities in the hotel premises but have only one indian resto that too is very good and bit expensive too , rooms are average .",50

"I cannot praise The Venetian enough! From the very beginning they offer a free air conditioned well appointed shuttle bus from both ferry terminals of the airport. The check in was easy. We were celebrating a special wedding anniversary and we were surprised to find a welcome  card and decorations in our room, followed by a bottle of bubbles and a cake. It was a very touching gift from the hotel. All the staff were so kind and helpful to us in every way. The suite was very comfortable and well appointed in all ways.  Special mention to Jojo and Russel and Min and Max who made us feel like we were at home and they became our friends. We will keep in touch and we look forward to our next visit to the Venetian Macau. For gamblers I should say that I went to numerous other casinos…",50
"One of the largest if not the largest casino floor in all of asia.  All other casino floors in other hotels in Macau do not attempt to compare. So the hotel is made in such a way that if a member of the family gambles there is a myriad of activity for the non-gambling members of the family.  Within the property there is golf, a hundred plus stores plus a hundred more as the property is connected (for foot traffic) to its sister hotels located beside the Venetian.  Even for the upcoming ""Parisian"" hotel beside the Venetian.  There are original ""shows"", concerts, exhibitions, authentic gondola rides, movie theaters, even a panda reserve in Macau. So well if you don't gamble, Macau and the Venetian Hotel will of course still welcome you with open arms. It is almost a crime to visit…",50
This was one of the best experiences that we had in recent times and difficult to forget for a long long time. We were booked for the royal suite which gave a us a very royal feeling indeed.The hotel by itself can keep you busy at least for a couple of days with the vast array of shops and the casino. There are shuttles to and fro from airport and ferry terminals. Be sure to check out the gondola rides provided in the hotel as there are two routes and they have different times for the last trip. It a good experience to indulge in. Advice on checking in and checking out : be sure to keep at least half an hour to spare if not more as there can be long queues and more so if peak tourist season. Also keep in mind that the hotel being a huge premise it can take up to half an hour for…,50
"They meant well -  It was an express checkin and in  a minute gave me the room keys..but I had to go back  with my luggages across the grand hall because these were not working. I accepted the offer for a 6pm extended checkout time..but they forgot to inform all departments and people kept calling and knocking at the door informing me that it was past 2pm checkout time. The little things somehow took away some of the feel good feeling.  On the bright side, room was perfect, housekeeping did a good jod keeping the room clean and tidy and the shopping experience was great. Very grand and dwarfs all other hotels in the strip.",40
"We (Party of 4) were staying at Venetian for one night. I use the advantage of express check in where I did not need to queue for the check in. Initially we have difficulty to open our room using the card given. But the staff approached us and help us, and even offer us for more toiletries. The room is huge and comfy. The shopping mall and the eateries are fantastic. We didn't manage to go to the casino. The Room's rate is quiet fair for the suite since we all can fit in comfortably, like a family room. We will surely go back for more.",50
"Amazing hotel! You would need atleast 3 days just to explore the hotel itself, it is that BIG!!! The rooms are well appointed and has all the amenities. The hotel has biggest casino in Macau too. The hotel itself is the main landmark of Macau",50
Provided with a spacious room with nice view of some hotels and also could see Macau Int'l Airport.  Venetian provide lots of shopping and food outlet to choose.  It is easily connect to other hotel via its shuttle bus service.,40
If u r in macau its a must stay. One time experience. The hotel is huge u can spend 4 days only walking to each corner. It has 5-6 swimming pools. Stay at least for 3 nights. All major hotels are interconnected to Vanition.,50
Plus points: Location excellent. Grandeur par excellence. Facilities are good. Truly 5 star experience. Room very spacious. Convenient transfer from Ferry terminal to hotel and vice versa. One suggestion however for the hotel. It will be good to have some help at the ferry terminal to offload luggage. It is daunting for elderly couples to load/ offload their own bags specially if they are pushed inside.   Negatives: Breakfast was substandard..spread was poor and repetitive. Cafe deco staff were not courteous except a few. Specially the ladies at the main entrance are rude and impatient. Now coming to booking. I had made a booking for 2 adults and 1 child 6 years old. Upon check-in we were given only 2 breakfast coupons and the staff didn't mention anything about the child.…,40
"Great holiday destination...fun for kids, shopping for the latest fashion and luxury brands... Making money through Gambling...scenic pools.  Plan your holiday at the right time summers are super hot and is not the time for city tour. Rest is a holiday well spent.  ",50
"One feels lucky immediately on entering the gigantic edifice that is the Venetian Macao Resort Hotel. I was told that it has the largest casino in the world and seeing the sheer number of people about i can believe it's true! Rooms are ultra luxurious, the staff pamper you, great food and shopping options make it a city unto itself and you may never want to leave. There is just so much to explore and experience in this Hotel. Highly recommended except for people who dislike crowds!",50
The place is fantastic to visit. The rooms were good clean and spacious. Should stay for two days to enjoy. One day becomes a short visit if you wanna go outside. The hotel also provide shuttle service to ferry. Only one Indian restaurant in the mall.,50
Convenient transfer from the airport via the free hotel shuttle bus. Room was very spacious as shown in their website. Very clean. Buffet breakfast had a lot of choices. Place tend to be very crowded as it is a go to place in Macau. Shopping was fun from Egg tarts to Bossini -  Midscale to hi-end shops (Shoppes at Four Seasons) Hermes and Prada among others connected to the Venetian Mall. There are a lot of restaurants in the mall area (even fast food)  as well as in the hotel. Coming back again in July 2016!!,50
Spent one night here. Check-in was a bit slow due to the long queue and finding the way to the elevators was tricky wich is not surprising for a casino hotel. The casino was packed and a lot of athmosphere. The room was very large with view on the strip. Airco worked fine and bathroom was very spacious. Buy a breakfast coupon at check-in and they bring it up to the room for free in the morning. Ensures a calm and stressless start of your day. Service is very friendly and welcoming. Would stay here again for sure.,50
"Did not plan to come here except for the egg tart but it was raining heavily when I reached Macau so ended up exploring the place. It was really well decorated in the architecture of Venice (I think as I never been to Venice before) both inside as well as outside. The interior design really made it worth the time spent here, with three man made lake where you could board the gondolas for a short ride. We also chanced upon a clown livening up the atmosphere and two musicians filling up the space with their violin music.   It was a great experience and will definitely come back here for another visit if in Macau. ",40
"Huge place, you could get lost. Architecturally brilliant. Plenty of dinning options within and around the resort. The canal is a great place to be in. Even the most basic rooms are big and luxurious. Casino is decent if you're into gambling. Nice staff. Infinite number of shuttles to ferry thousands. The only thing which I found not to my liking (not a general rule) was that it lacks the personal touch, the warmth. It's like you are in the middle of a giant fair. Huge groups are checking in and out. People are walking everywhere. But once you are in your room then it's great.",40
"It's more than a hotel, it's look like a castle with 100 of artworks, this property is one of the kind in the world. Amazing room service and great food. Hotel and room designed are super luxury. Easy access to entertainment area through the lobby and high security at the same time.",50
"Our boys jumped for joy then rolled on the carpeted floor when they saw the bella suite at the venetian. They really love hotels and this is one of the nicest we've stayed in so far. Check in was a bit tedious though as there were many people checking in at this enormous hotel. Service was great all throughout and the amenities unbeatable. We loved the pools, the mall, the venetian canals. Everything opulent and classy. Stay here if its your first time in macau. You wont regret it. ",40
"I was there for only one night, but it was fantastic experience with three friends. We made reservation of suite, but they have upgraded us into fabulous, great, very big suite, I don't even know the name :). I wish we would have more time, but so it was, sure we see us next time. Staff was so professional, like I never meet before, but I do travel a lot. Great, congrats!",50
"We spent one night at Venetian Macau and the moment we entered the Hotel, realised the mistake committed. Every facet of the Hotel is worth praising. The reception desk executive Kelly was superlative in her initial introduction of the Hotel and true to her description each area was well described. The Bella Suite where we stayed was just perfect in every sense. The onlooking Golf Course was a pleasure to watch from our 24th Floor. The Concierge desk Executive Joanne was so good in helping us with our return transfers on the ferry back to Hongkong. Overall left the Hotel with a vow to return back very soon. ",50
"For non-Macau frequents, Venetian is a must stay experience like Caesar @ Vegas; stay-in service is up to 5-star standard and hence its price. Check-in was horribly slow, so may be a good idea to opt for express check-in before arrival. After such bad check-in, I opted for express check-out without hesitation, in case i missed my boat back to HK. Didn't do express check-in as I didn't know whether my shuttle arrives at Main or West Wing counter, apparently all shuttles arrived at West Wing. No flexible free upgrade at counter as Caesar does in US, everything is to the T the way you booked, I even have to mention I'm entitled to free upgrade booking direct with them. For Macau frequents, there are many new hotels near by at a much cheaper price and newer rooms. Venetian's &…",40
"Ok, so a great hotel. I know it can appear cheesy to replicate European hotels in Asia but Venetian pulls it off. The standard rooms easily accommodates 2 adults and 2 kids. Two double beds and the sofa folds out. Good sound proofing. Bathroom spacious.  The only downside, and not a major issue, is that the tv' seemed dates and poor choice of channels.  We didn't have time to swim in the pools but they seemed clean and well maintained.  Overall, a great place for a stop off.",50
"Once you arrive in Macau, you are welcome to take a complimentary Venetian shuttle bus to the Cotai Strip. The bus will drop-off at the Main Hotel Entrance and pick-up at the West Entrance.The Venetian Macau-Resort-Hotel has become one of the biggest landmarks for gamblers throughout Asia. Controlled by Sheldon Adelson’s Las Vegas Sands (LVS), the Venetian was the first giant casino to open on Macao’s Cotai Strip, an area of reclaimed land offshore from downtown Macau.The This Venetian Macau resembles the Venice Grand Canals. Nowhere else in Asia will you find the finest in luxury suites, world-class shopping, sensational entertainment and irresistible dining- all under one roof. It has become a certified attraction drawer in Macau from that it became open to the public-inside…",50
"Macau is the mini Las Vegas of the east and i totally agree to it. We stayed in the Venetian macau Cotai View Royal suite, This is by far the best suite with the best view and its absolutely worth the extra money they ask for it.  Room : the rooms are spacious and luxurious to all extends, By far the best in Macau i feel.  Staff: The hotel huge and inspite of that the courtesy they extend is something amazing.  Pool: there are 3 outdoor pools and each one of them is unique and you must use them for sure.  Dining: There is a food court and apart from that you get vouchers for any 2 meals in particular restaurants which we took. We choose Indian Golden Peacock which is rated as the number 3 restaurant in the whole of macau and is  must try. There are other Italian restaurants…",50
"The hotel is so huge with large lobby, I took almost 15 minutes walk to reach my room. The room was too big, clean and comfortable, the staff is friendly and always tried their best to help, the majority of service are above average starting from room service, concierge... etc. ",50
" The Venetian Macao is the largest casino in the world, and the largest single structure hotel building in Asia. The casino is divided into 4 themed gaming areas namely Golden Fish, Imperial House, Red Dragon and Phoenix. The casino consists of over 3400 slot machines and 800 gambling tables.The hotel tower offers 2,905 suites.The CotaiArena (formerly known as the Venetian Arena) is an indoor arena. Hotel having huge food court and many restaurants. And lots more for shopping inside the hotel only.  ",50
amazing place.loved the gondola ride there .it took 2 days to visit the full hotel . it was strange as the hotel doesn't offer spa and massage .it was good indian restaurants to eat .great food .the checkin was very smooth and got everything at random the front desk people were very cooperative explained everything .great brands and shops to shop on .the room size was very good . the concerige was also helpful .very well planned .amazing nightlife in hotel n casino .great place and will visit again for sure .i loved it and this place will always be a experience,50
"The Venetian Macau !! I think the name is enough for the review. If you want to experience the Casino, Shopping and luxurious stay then must visit this place. Services they offer are wonderful. Free Bus service all over the Macau and one of the live place ever seen. If you are a brand lover then this is the place for you !!",50
This is one property that's not to be missed whenever you're in Macau. Rooms are big with excellent view from every room. Great service by the staff and an overall super experience is what this property offers. Would definitely recommend it,50
"I had stayed their from 7th June to 9th June, 2016 and i had most wondeful experience of my life. Guest relation manager JOJO FOO had surprising arrangement which made our anniversary most memorable so far... Eventhough hotel was totally full, Mr nickel was kind enough to have special fast arrangement for our check in. Rooms were pefectly located and our room was upgraded from royal suite to bella suite....its not a hotel but a city inside the hotel with everything there..... Awesome place, awesome management....",50
"The resort will make you say WOW. Wonderful experience. Lots of entertainment inside the resort. A must visit place if you are staying in a different hotel or on a single day trip to Macao. One of the greatest Casino's in Asia is in this Resort. It has been build in a township model for entertainment including Multi Cuisine restaurants, Rooms, Casino etc ",50
"We took the Cotai ferry from HK (Sheung Wan) to Macau.  It is an hour ride, and maybe another 20 mins to go through the customs.  Got to Macau about 1pm, and the Venetian check in counter was packed.  I checked in my bags as it was not check in time yet (1:30pm).  We took the bus to Macau, and see the Senado square, and Ruins of St Paul.  We had dinner than head back to the hotel on the south side.  Check in was quick.   The room was super large.  Very nice suite.  Bell boy bring in a bag with bath robe and slippers.  AC worked well.  Was able to fill the tub with very warm water for a good hot soak bath for the long days walk.  The pagoda ride was very nice.  You can reach almost all parts of Macau attractions with the Casino bus.  Good to plan ahead.  You can do the Macau side…",50
The venetian is a wonderful hotel to stay in... everything under the sun in one roof... the food choice could be better but the rooms is large and is well appointed. the pools are ok as well.the kids had fun only draw back was the size it was too big... connect to four season and in front of city of city of dreams.,40
"I went to this hotel for a conference, and slept at one of the royal suite. It was an overall good experience. The room was spacious. The room follows mock-renaissance design, so prepare for thick flowy curtain that hangs above the bed.   The main floor has a casino, which I only passed as I do not gamble.   The third floor is a shopping strip, with renown brands lining up the sides. There is also a pretend ""Venetian canal"" that stretches across the floor. You can ride a gondola complete with a singing guide. The ceiling is painted as if it is a sky.   I honestly thought it was going to be tacky. But it was not. Somehow.   The only down side is it is a bit far to the Macau city center, a cab ride takes around $50 - $80 depends on the traffic. But... of course instead of visiting…",40
"we stayed with my spouse during the weekday, as a first time traveller to macau I thought that during weekdays there wont be too many tourist but I was wrong there were a lot but then with the extreme size of the hotel there were ample space to roam around. we stayed for 3 days and it was memorable. We checked in last sunday, june 5. and there was quite a long line, good thing I checked in online as I was given a priority and in just 10 minutes I already had my keys. We stayed in the north side and we loved the suite, clean fresh and spotless. well the tv are kinda outdated and the programs were chinese, with 3 english channels and no NBA, anyway its a vacation and watching tv should be the least to do. They provide water but its only 250cc but you can ask for more and they…",50
"My friends and I were on a budget trip but luckily for us we booked a very good deal with The Venetian.  This is worth every dime as the place is very luxurious, the rooms are well maintained and the services are awesome! We also tried the slot machines in the casino. Those were the only games we could play inside because we were on a tight budget but it was worth it. **Look for the 50cents machine so you could stay longer. :D  What I love about Macau are the free shuttle buses around so you dont have to spend a lot of money in transportation. Ride a shuttle bus and look for the nearest spots on that hotel. Every hotel has their own trademarks and it's all FREE!  All in all, I would still love to go back to Macau for the 3rd or 4th or nth times!",50
"We had a wonderful stay at The Venetian, Macau during our Hongkong-Macau Holidays. The Bella Suit, which was allotted to us for 2 nights was very nice & amazing with full of luxurious amenities. The inventory of the hotel was extraordinarily superb. The lobby area was like a small town. The casino was one of the biggest in MACAU. The shoppe area was also wonderful. The gondola ride we enjoyed a lot.",50
"We stayed here on our last night at Macau. I'm super impressed with the hotel design structures. It's a big building with a shopping mall and many entrance to casino at the middle of the hotel. casino was so big that made u spoil of choices. The room was big..it have two queen size bed room, a sofa bed..two TV and plenty of space. The staff were friendly but most of them are Philiphinos. The price was equally challenging but worth the stay. WiFi was quite fast but once a while u lost connection. Bathroom was amazing big and clean and the set back is it came without lock from inside so u have to warned others that ur using the bathroom.   The shopping shop were plenty from high end products to economically prized. Plenty of eatery but for us it's always quite pricey. food…",50
"The hotel is very good, we went for a meet and stayed at the hotel. The rooms are spacious and clean, the rooms and the bathroom are well-maintained. The staff is very patient and helpful. The swimming pool is big and very good. The breakfast buffet had a wide spread and the food is good but price is high compare to other 5 star rated hotels in Singapore.",50
The service provided by this hotel is incredible particularly given how large it is. The attention to detail for each resident is an experience in itself. My friends and I loved our recent stay at the Venetian Macau and will return.,50
"To stay at the Venetian was the top agenda for our vacation trip to Macau. Sadly this was the only good thing about the trip to Macau. The hotel is amazing, huge and well maintained. The gondola ride was really good and the operator was really friendly. The staff at the Venetian is highly considerate. The casino floor is the biggest in Macau. There are quite a few stores within the hotel that allow you to shop round the clock. Apart from the Venetian there are a very few attractions in Macau. Some of the most popular are right across the Venetian (Sands and Hard Rock are at a strolling distance a fifteen minute walks takes you to the old Portuguese Town 'Taipa') and hence to stay at the Venetian makes absolute sense. FYI if you have been to Las Vegas, you could avoid Macau…",40
The property is huge ...... even though they have above 3000 suites the service is exemplary. We had a comfortable stay .... Breakfast was a bit of a show stopper ..... food was not at all tasty ....(Cafe Deco) .... the only saving grace was the eggs .... nothing can go wrong with eggs i guess.... close to 500 shops ..... the gandola and the decor of the hotel was just awesome ..... added to that is the huge casino ..... what a time in macao .....the checkout called for just dropping your key into a express check out box ..... that was something new.... A must visit,50
"Went for a visit to the Venetian Macao Resort hotel. While we didn't stay the night, there was ample time to roam around the resort and ""sight see"". The hotel is extremely lavish as compared to the hotels in HK - space is evidently not a constraint here in Macau. The ceiling of the main hall of the Venetian is very nicely painted although you shouldn't compare this to the painted ceilings of King Louis' castle in Versailles, Paris.   Food at the Venetian food hall was pretty crap though. Tried a few dishes and they were pretty much either tasteless or downright bad. Perhaps we should have chosen a nice restaurant based on Tripadvisor reviews instead.   Overall, we had a lovely day out to the Venetian. The mini version of the gondola ride made the trip a memorable one. The…",40
"This hotel is Luxurious. This hotel is huge. This hotel can be overwhelming. Beautifully decorated rooms that just add that extra luxurious feel. Fantastic staff and fantastic ammenities. Macau has a number of great hotels to choose from and The Venetian is an Iconic location to stay. While it will not impress everybody, It definitely impressed me.",40
"This is my favourite Resort to stay at in Macau. I've stayed at this resort 6 times over the past few years and it's worth noting I'm not a gambler.  The first thing that you will notice about this place is the sheer size and scale, it is a lot to take in and can lead to a bit of sensory overload.  Check-in is fast and efficient with a very friendly staff. I suggest asking for directions to your room. As previously mentioned this place is massive and you can get easily turned around on the casino floor (obviously designed to keep you in).  Like all things at the Venetian the rooms are ridiculously large, it is a great experience viewing them for the first time.  I have two food suggestions at the Venetian, one low end and one high end.   First, one of the best Oxtail curry i've…",40
"Huge rooms would be an understatement. The bathrooms are bigger than rooms in many HK, Paris and NY hotels ! Great room service. The hotel is a mini opulent city with everything for everyone - gondola rides, gambling, Jurassic park, shopping... Wifi is dodgy and they could improve it considerably ! Our room had an amazing view of the cotai strip. Check in and check outs are surprisingly considerably efficient, considering the huge crowds. ",50
"Venetian , Macau has to be one of the best properties I have ever stayed during my travels. Staff were excellent, amenities superb and the ambience was spellbinding.   It has everything that one can ask for, from the hotel itself, best of the retail outlets, some great gambling experience and great dining facilities.  Would definitely come back again for a longer stay. ",50
"My wife and I visited The Venetian Macao in April 2016 and unfortunately, were only able to stay one night. We booked our stay through the Venetian website and were treated like VIP guests upon arriving to the hotel and checking-in. Our ferry ride was very smooth coming directly from Hong Kong International Airport and they shuttle from the ferry terminal to the hotel was very easy to find.  My wife and I didn't spend enough time there to gamble, but we were able to eat at one of the restaurants inside the hotel. It was Bambu and I would definitely recommend this hotel to others. We ate during brunch time and their was a nice selection of buffet items ranging from fresh seafood to other Asian style dishes.  Don't worry about renting a car, because taxi service is very common in…",50
"Amazing experience from the time we walked in the door. We only stayed one night but we had a great time. The hotel was enormous and the decor was incredible. Great value for money, the room was massive.",50
spent one day in Macau with family. the rooms were large easily fit our family of four.the dinner in the lobby restaurant was good.The Venetian canal is over rated. the best thing we did was crossover by foot to the hotel apposite for a light show. behind the hotel had rock cafe where live band was rocking.all in all decant stay.,40
"The Venetian is luxurious with its magnificent design,it is very vast with top branded stores.the venetian canals with artificial day-light sky are a treat for the eyes. It is a complex maze to get to know the way to the hotel suites, the lobby, the kids zone, the restaurants and the swimming pools and especially with kids with so many detours to avoid the Casinos. The Hotel Suites are a class of its own with comfortable beds large rooms with royal bathrooms. Free wifi and shuttle bus service are available. The carpet area under the cots is not well kept with a lot of accumulated dirt. There is a lot and lot of walking to do.They did not allow to take hot milk for the infant during complimentary breakfast, thought that was not a nice gesture for a hotel of this category to…",40
One of the best hotel in Macao. You don't need to go out of the hotel... They have locals food in the food court. And they have one of the best Portuguese egg tart shop in the shopping arcade... So its easy to go around without having to go far away from the hotel.  ,50
"Such a lavish property , once you enter Venetian you are in your own world. Very nice rooms , views, lot of options for foodies. The hotel is very big and you can get lost and have to found out way. The casino is also very big with lot of gaming options. Will truly recommend this for someone who is visiting Macau",50
This hotel is more than worth every penny. It is not as expensive as the other hotels in its class but the amenities and the service you'll get are beyond expectations. Their suite rooms are really big and classy. I specially love the bathroom. It is everything you would like your bathroom to be. I seldom swim in hotels' pool but I was not able to resist their pool with warm water. It was great! I'll definitely be staying here again in the future.,50
"Hotel is magnificent and super big! Tend to get lost within the hotel.   Pros: Very nice hotel, big and clean rooms  Cons: Less directional signs, shuttle bus intervals a bit slow  Suggestions: Have a shuttle bus to Macau's main attraction - San Ma Lo.",50
"I had made a day visit to this hotel way back in 2009 and now, 7 years later, visited again, this time with my family to experience the wow factor by actually staying here. Just like the last time, this hotel did not fail to leave me awestruck this time too.   But, as a resident guest, I got more time to  experience the Venetian more deeply. What I discovered this time though was the fact that this hotel is more mechanical than personal. I would grade it a 4 on a scale of 10 when it came to finding smiling or hospitable staff. Everyone conveyed they are doing a job and wouldn't be bothered otherwise. Another major flaw here is the lack of English speaking staff. For a hotel which operates on a global front, it should have been a priority to have properly trained English speaking…",40
"Service at the front desk was fantastic.Massive Suite area, Good Value for money.This is a huge casino and hotel. Lots of high end shops and eateries. Similar to Vegas there are the gondolas and opera singers. There is even a pub on the lower floor. It has a convention Centre attached and it is easy to lose your way unless you are paying attention to all the signs.        Lots of Chinese tourists and it gets very busy on the escalators to the shopping areas . The casino is in the middle so you can avoid going in if you are not into gambling. Lots of walking involved so wear comfortable shoes.        The free shuttle buses get you to and from very efficiently the ferries.",50
"Have to be honest, used the bus ride to the Venetian shops using their free bus ride service.   The place was very regal, with smoking rooms, and HK$1 minimum bets on the slot machines.   Place was cold and maintained very well, not that crowded and very close to the canals unlike the other hotels. Would go here again to gamble (yes, slot machines).",50
A commercial hotel with great options for high end shopper  The rooms are placed in two different areas the north wing and the south wing You really need to walk a lot if you are checking in from the main lobby towards your room on the south wing especially if you've children as they don't allow toto unto walk via the casino route   The rooms are pretty good with standard amenities but i would say that the rooms require a modern upgrade compared to the new hotels coming up in Macau   The hotel is connected to couple of other hotels with a bridge from where you can see the upcoming Eiffel Tower replica called the Parison   During our stay Venetian did not have a go to Pub other than the lounge in the casino which is not a match towards classy pubs and lounge bars in Macau  Also…,40
"One may be quick to be intimidated by the sheer size of this hotel, after digging up its history, turns out the entire Cotai Strip was developed by the Sands group to put up several hotels and casinos. Venetian being the biggest one. There is an indoor gondola ride with a faux sky, it is fantastic to have such a huge structure indoor. If you come to Macau by jet boat, this would be one of the first stops in your itinerary. They have a free bus ride from the port going to the hotel. ",50
"When you are at the Venetian, you hardly have to go outside to shop. Everything is there. You just want to make the effort to go outside to see the other attractions like the Macau Tower for skywalking and bungee. I enjoyed doing it again this time when I'm not crippled with gout. The room itself is beautiful and spacious. I love the cleanliness of Macau, the elevators and escalators at the street crossings.",50
I was here only for 2-3 days but I loved the hotel a lot!! The rooms were just the best. The hotel was so big that u have chances to get lost. I was also lost n after walking for 2 hrs I finally found my room!! The hotel can't be described it was just like Venice n was a dream come true.,50
"If you have been to The Venetian in Las Vegas, you will be prepared for how huge this place is and the massive scale at which it operates. The reception, for instance, resembles a row of airline check-in counters during peak passenger traffic. I did a quick mental calculation and estimated that there were at least 200 people being checked in at the same time.  The experience begins at the ferry terminal where arriving passengers are greeted by long-legged women in small dresses who guide you to the hotel bus. Once you are checked in, you can make your way to your room on your own. Make sure to pick up a map; without guidance, you will be lost.  The rooms are huge. Ours had two levels, with a fence between sleeping and living areas, two TVs, and the bathroom had two sinks. The…",40
"Venetian Macau is the best place to relax and a must to experience the service,  more so if you are with family and kids below 15 year. So much to do within the hotel itself.  Rooms are well furnished, absolutely no compromise on every bit of it. Checkin time will take ~20 mnts due to long line, despite many counters to checkin.  We have enjoyed our stay, food and the shopping within the hotel. Good Indian food and a separate breakfast spread with Indian verities. Worth the money spent on everything. Stay at Venetian is an experience by itself. ",50
"I was only here for two nights on business so might not have seen everything. The Hotel itself is I think the same format as the one in Las Vegas, very American in its over the top look. The hotel itself is very good, very clean and very very large. As always in this type of hotel I tend to get lost, the time always seems to be the same as the ceilings are painted with constant blue skies and a few fluffy white clouds. The rooms are very large and comfy, there is nothing to complain about here. A few photos I have added I was told off for, apparently they are not allowed in the Casino! I should have known that from Las Vegas when I wa told to remove my camera from the table!",40

I can say this is one of the famous hotel in Macao . I've been there 5 times with friends and relatives . There's a casino  there if you are fond of gambling. But for me I love shopping more.  And inside this place you can find branded products. this place let you imagine  you're in Venice ,40
"The rooms are a very big size, and the decoration of the whole hotel is very over the top, which it is supposed to be.  The entire thing is build around the giant casino which is operating 24 hours a day with loads of people even in the small hours.  It took a while to get an idea of the scale of the complex but in the end I enjoyed it and would recommend visitors to Macau to at least have a look.  I was told business levels are decreasing in Macau but it looked very busy to me!",50
Rooms will make you feel like your are staying in a palace.They are spacious with a separate sit-out area in a suite.The grand canal shopping brings a variety of brands a cross the world for extraordinary retail shopping experience!Gondola ride is a must!Try your luck and get rich in worlds's biggest casino!Truly a unforgettable experience in Macau.,50
"A very massive and huge hotel, worth a stay. The rooms were massive and best in class. the view from the room was beautiful. The hotel is a city in itself and requires a lot of time to explore. Must stay.",50
"So we did a 2 night trip to the property..honestly you need atleast 3 nights to understand the place. The entertainment in this place is non stop. the theme breakfast with cartoon characters is worth a try, walking in the mall under the artificial sky or take the gondola ride. The lounge bar has some good bands playing every night.   The staff here is very courteous and helpful.  We had a exceptionally warm front office personal by name yukti mehera who went all out to make us comfortable. .:)",40
"Even their basic suite is very well appointed and comfortable. Public casino on the first floor is very busy most of the time. We had a package with breakfast included, they serve it at Cafe Deco in the South Wing from 6:30 till 11 am. Note that it gets very crowded with a very long line from 9am. So only take packages with breakfast if you know you're ok with long lines or that you're going to be up early enough. Otherwise Imperial Dim Sum place, at the same sector could be a good alternative if Asian food for breakfast good for you, Note breakfast vouchers only good at Cafe Deco though. Shopping is endless but on the 2nd floor.  Swimming pool is not impressive however.",50
Venetian is SUITE Specialist in Macau Food are also very tasty Transportation are very convenience and fast staff are very polite and helpful Casino is very spacious  Great shopping in Venetian Must come and stay to experience,50
"We were amazed by d opulence n vastness of d hotel. One of d best suites we ever experienced in d whole world. Venetian is so huge dat we got lost very often in d hotel, d venetian shopping arcade n d casino. Only con is dat d main lobby remains crowded always which is a hindrance to d privacy of d venetian residents because of unrestricted entry of hundreds of outside visitors.",50
"Wonderful Elevation .. first impression on entrance created loads of excitement for the next available journey..  Never Ending attractions, especially the third floor with sky view and Gondola.. just beautiful A Must-go-again-and-again place.. good for friends and even for family",40
"屬於區內較大間的酒店房，CHECK IN時間較長，因為人較多，交通安排多元化，步行10-20分鐘可於區內享用地道美食。酒台內的購物商場與設計也國際化。賭場是必然參觀的地方！  推介此酒店！  Very big room!  CHECK IN time is longer, because people are more. Transport arrangements can reach a lot of area. 10-20 minute walk can enjoy authentic cuisine in the region. Shopping malls and design is good and international. Cant miss the Asia Casino, worth to visit!  Recommend this hotel!",40
"Stayed for two nights in May 2016. Was initially a bit unsure if we will get good service given huge size, reviews about long checkin queues( which were there).   Fortunately we were offered express checkin and that helped crossed first point.  Staff had noted that we were there to celebrate our sons bday and sent a very nice cake on their own.   Also, really liked the food variety in food court esp given we are vegetarian.  Most impressive part was their proactive call to check if we need their help for the checkout and when is our flight and the best way to about planning our return journey and even what time we should ask for baggage pickup. Max at front desk further impressed by even checking out veg options at a restaurant for us and calling back with a proper reply.  …",50
"The hotel rooms have excellent view! The hotel is huge so can be like a maze and chances of being lost on the 3rd floor where the mall is can be quiet a walk. If you have kids accompanying you, access to Casino to cross over is also not there, so ""walking shoes"" a must :). Having said that, the architecture, design leaves one spell bound. The option of swimming pool is amazing, the elevators are high speed ones. The choice of option for in-room dinning is great. The folks know how to take in-room dining experience to a different level itself!",50
"I spent the night with my partner to celebrate our anniversary. We had excellent customer service. The hotel reception sent us a beautiful cake to celebrate our anniversary! The hotel also provides a variety of entertainment. Our personal favourite was the Bellini Lounge which had good music, fun atmosphere, delicious cocktails and great live music. Unfortunately we missed the Gondola rides which looked like a lot of fun.   Our purpose of stay was to see the House of Dancing Water, which I would highly recommend. It is an incredible show and is only a short 10-15min walk from the hotel. The hotel provides free shuttles to and from the hotel, as well as to The Sands so you can do a bit of exploring.  Very happy with our experience and customer service. Thank you to all the staff…",50
"The Venetian Hotel is fabulous in many ways: the décor outside and inside is amazing with interesting buildings similar to some in the real Venice; the casino is massive with a wide range of tables and slots; shopping and dining facilities are extensive; suites are well-furnished, spacious and comfortable. We received a warm welcome on arrival and, although there were many people checking in at the same time as us, there were plenty of staff on duty to assist and even handed out bottles of water to those in queues. Our room was a clean spacious suite with quality toiletries, double sinks, separate shower and bath. There was also a hospitality tray with kettle, tea, coffee and bottles of water. There were 2 large screen TVs: one in the bedroom area and one in the lounge area.…",50
"This place has been on my bucket list for quite some time.  We went shopping here and as well as tour the area from the casino, shopping mall, hotel area, etc.., it was HUGE! it was so pretty! It was so awesome! I want to go back here again. The hotel offers free shuttle ride to/from the airport/ferry.  My boyfriend surprised me with a Gondola ride, the lady in the gondola ride serenaded us and it was so sweet. Definitely check on my bucket list.",50
"Venetian is one of the grandest hotels in Macau and there are tons of deals flowing around all the time on their website from discounted rates to food packages and more. They provided a quick shuttle to the hotel from Macau ferry terminal and the checkin process was quite smooth. Venetian even upgraded my room for free. The room is extremely amazing, one of the best I have been at. It's pretty spacious, well set with really nice fixtures. The food court is also good and has dishes from all over",50
"Venetian is big hotel casino but Macau is good for a weekend trip. My teenage kids likes to visit the Macau Tower. Also enough the ride of the New ""8"" rollercoaster. All in all a lot of walking. We try to use the hotel shuttle the best we can, no need to rent a car. Taxi is not so easy to catch if you are not in the hotel area. And watch out for scam... some driver will raise the price. Although is not legal but most visitors do not know the rate. We had a lot of fun having tea at the MGM and Dinner at Wynn... watching the light show on top of the Italian restaurant . Two days is more than enough if you do not gamble.",40
"Macau nowadays known as a ""Las Vegas Asia"", once i step my foot in mainland Macau all i can say way i definitely agree with that slogan that people gives to Macau. one of hotel and casino i visited was The Venetian and it was blown my mind. The casino was so huge and the decoration on this hotel was amazing.",40
"few things you can't miss it in life and one of it ir Venetian Macao resort hotel, it is a must see along with your family, and its beyond words to praise! so just go, stay and enjoy it (it is said that hotel is 5 star, which is wrong, its 8,9 or even 10 star)",50
We reached at hotel too late as Indian resaurant closed down but Mr.karanmay had initiated and extended his best service to us and food was equally as good as their service.  I wish Mr. Karanmay have a blessed carrier ahead.   Subrata,50
"The Venetian is a huge casino and hotel on the Cotai strip.  Many people, mainly Chinese and Indians, stay here.  The rooms are magnificent, with high quality fittings and furniture.  The WiFi is fast. The aircon is perfect. The bathrooms are well appointed, and there is never-ending hot water.  It's really a pleasure to stay at this casino.  Probably the only downside is the long walk to your room, if you happen to get a room that is a long way from the lift lobby.  Ana from Portugal was lovely at check-in and check-out.  All the staff are friendly and do a great job.  Just one complaint... the left-over room service food stayed on the table in my room for 2 days, and that was a bit disappointing.  Nobody likes to have half a Club Sandwich hanging around.  Overall though, The…",50
"We stayed several days in The Venetian Resort Hotel and every day was a new adventure just within the confines of this gigantic operation. We stayed in the north tower but the other towers are just as palatial.I was struck with the enormity of the hotel with it's Venetian features including streets of fashion, jewelry, and cafe's shopping all under a Venetian sky. The gondala ride down the middle accompanied by a singing gondalier was nothing short of a fun spectacular. Even if you never gamble it's truly a sight to behold, exceptional accommodation in an exceptional location.",50
"What a good time it was in Venetian. Amazing hotel with so many shopping outlets, food court, restaurants, casino and so on. The architecture is beautiful. It's out of the world experience. There are other new properties there, but Venetian was better than all. Our hotel had a transfer facility to the main site seeing places in Macau. Our room and bathroom was clean and huge and had a view of pool and garden area. Multi cuisine food is there in the hotel, although variety in vegetarian was very less. Gondola ride was the best one especially the song singing. Romantic gateway... Worldwide brands are there in the shopping arcade. One can spent as many days as possible and won't get tired of it.",50
"My favorite hotel to stay in Macau. Been staying here couple times.   I stayed alone in Bella Suite. Awesome big room!! I was in North Suite room 21-115. Bad view from room. Please try the opposite room with Golf and pool view.  And please Come early for breakfast in Cafe Deco. Otherwise loooooong queue to get a table. So many food to eat there. Awesome. Vegetarian meals also available.  They have everything in the hotel, shopping in grand canal shops was great. The food court was great. Casino is awesome.  1 pack Capri Cigarette in casino is MOP/HKD 90.  They have Shrek Musical.  Great experience!",50
A huge property ... one is bound to get lost ... keep asking for directions to navigate within and around the Venetian. A visit to Vegas years ago ... leftme with a yearning to stay at the Venetian ! and tht came true at Macau. A place where kids and adults alike can enjoy. We were there for 2 days and dint step out for any sightsee activities at all (House of dancing waters was closed for the 2 days we were there..twas their weekly off. The macau tower was too far).  The 4 pools including the heated one are huge and the kids loved spending time in it. Food court is decent with SOME choices available for veggies. Try the thin crust pizzas at Pizza Pizza and the Med stuff at Pita Pan. There is also a Thai and Vietnamese place serving veg food. Haagen dazs whipped up yumm ice…,40
"Awesome experience with family, we will all remember it for several years for sure. Although it does not have anything great ""pass-time"" for teenagers it had everything that you would look forward to.",50
"The Venetian Hotel is one of the leading Hotel in Macao.  We didn't stay here, but we visited during our tour to Macau.  The interior at entrance lobby is excellent and nicely decorated.  Huge Casino at level one.  Godola ride at level three.  Overall superb one.",40
"The inside was amazing with so many shops, food courts and things to do. So much effort was put into this hotel as they even have a river and gondola rides inside! The building didn't look very grand from outside but inside was totally opposite. ",50
"This place was so so amazing. I loved exploring inside and also tried few games. There are shopping malls, restaurants, hotels and you will find every kind of shop inside this casino. There are also shows in the evening and its completely free. What i liked the most is that they provide free bus services to come and go :)",50
This was our first visit to macau and all that v could say about out stay at venetian was WOWWWW. amazing hotel mesmerising facilities and superb shopping experience. The global cuisine is worth its mention and the breakfast spread at Cafe deco was lovely.amazing casino and equally classy swimming pool. The staff is friendly and always happy to guide.... v will come back soon,50
"With so many new establishment in Macao, Venetian is still one the classic that survives. It is a large complex with hotel, resort, casino, and shopping complex. Rooms are in general bigger than any hotels. Beds are comfortable and hotel are well connected with the shops and casinos. Finding things to do in this complex are so easy that in fact you don't really need to go out to spend your days.",40
"We stayed only one night, but loved our check in and check out experience, but was it due to the wonderful staff member we encountered? We think so and she should be recognised for such wonderful service. Room service was also very good. Not cheap by any standards, but delivered service as ordered. The after check out experience is let down by the absence of a lounge for guests waiting to transit to the airport or back to Hong Kong. There is nowhere to sit and wait and you are just thrown in with all the other foot traffic to and from the casino. Big letdown.",40
"I went to this hotel with my family , the hotel is just awesome and huge . The check-in procedure is repetitively easy and you don't get english speaking problem. We reached the rooms it was very good and even the 1st category of sweet room is large enough to accommodate 4 people easily . Hostel has shopping centre , food court where you can get 2 Indian restaurants and then a great Indian restaurant called Peacock in basement. Money changer and china bank is also there. You a MCd also in the food court and restaurants which give good option for veg food  It has one of the largest casinos in this cotai strip .  The only problem i faced in the hotel was the size , we were given room in north suites which were far from food court, reception and kids area and pool. The pool was…",40
"Wow, I have been to Vegas, and Macau just blew my mind... This place especially, it was only about $250 AUD per night in April 2016, which is what we paid per night for our hotel in Hong Kong the week prior.. this room was at least 3-4 times larger and the finishings / service was 5 star, the bathroom was as large as any hotel I have ever stayed, king size bed, seperate split level living room, 2 TV's, etc etc... and this is their basic suite, so if you upgrade it only gets better apparently.  I did a little research, the usable floor space in this hotel (shops, pools, casino, hotel, etc makes it top 10 largest of any building in the world. That explains how I kept getting lost in the shopping area, and got lost going back to the room a few times... this place is huge...  The…",50
Stayed at this Beautiful Hotel in Feb 2016. Everything about this place was just perfect . They have a free pick up and drop facility from/to the Macau Ferry Terminal.The hotel is just Magnificent . The Rooms are huge .All of them are as good as a large Suite.The service is brilliant. The Casino is packed at any time of the day. The hotel has resturants and shopping stores .The Gandola Boat ride is a cute attraction within the hotel ( one persons gandola ride was free of cost per room booking) . They also have tour buses to take u round Macau .However its advisible to check the tour buses timing at the time of check in as there are only two slots available during the day. ,50
"Was at Venetian Resort almost 10 years ago when it has just opened. Rooms are well-maintained, large space with good steps divide bedroom & living areas, with TV set fo each.  The Shopped has vast variety of brands, stretching from Venetian resort to the opposite Sand Cotai Central, where hotels like Sheraton, Holiday Inn and St. Regis are connected to. North is main lobby; south near meeting facilities; west lobby's concierge sells SIM card -same price at outside phone shop and will install it for you- and outside lies free shuttle bus lines to main places like airport & ferry. Walk pass taxi stand (on right), turn right at the street, there is an escalator and walk way to Taipa old town where lots of good restaurants like Seng Choeng (Chinese) and O Santos (Portugese) are. …",40
"I stayed at the Venetian for 5 days - Conference with R & R, in May 2016 and I thoroughly enjoyed my 5 day stay. The entire process of check in and facilitation is excellent. The Venetian is a copy of the same hotel in Vegas and the Grand Canal is spectacular. I would have loved it more if there were seats to sit on and sip champagne or a glass of wine. However,  like in every casino,  they don't provide sitting arrangements and your feel are sore and blistered from walking and walking. - All rooms are suites and well laid out. They are comfortable and romantic !!!!!  - The conference facilities over the days we were there, was unbelievable. The ballroom is almost the size of a rugby field and there are staff and security all over. They can feed thousands of delegates in 60…",50

i would rate this one of the best kindly book through their hotel websites as if you are lucky enough you would be upgraded as we were also upgraded even the quoted rate was same as that of travel web sites so its better to book through hotel web site directly,50
"Stayed here for a night and felt like a princess.  room is spacious, it has a grandiose feel to it. The hotel complex has a lot of food and shopping area so we didn't mind just staying in its vicinity because we did score some good finds just by walking around Venetian.",50
"If you are planning to be visit Macau strongly recommend staying at the Venetian. Very luxurious property and hospitable staff. The rooms are large and designed for great comfort. Suggest optimg in for Cotai View rooms. The children playbarea Qube is great for kids also the entire ambience of Venice provides a very good experience. Golden Peacock restaurant here is a wonderful place for Indian food . Great conceirge , super shuttle service and overall its THE PLACE to stay at during the Macau trip.  ",50
"I was there attending a conference in Macau and have stayed there for 3 nights. it was an awesome/unforgettable experience with huge rooms more than comfortable beds and delicious food. it was a complete city in itself with the shopping arcade one of the best casinos. to add to all this there was a gondola ride as well, would surely like to visit again but this around for more days.",50
"great hotel, the design is very good and yeah as you know, the have casino inside this hotel, and this hotel has mall inside the building, so big the building and our group when travelling here satisfied with this hotel",50
"Stayed for 2 nights attending a conference. We had a suite on the 18th floor of the South Wing.  No view but the spaciousness of the room more than made up for it. It had 2 levels, the bedroom and bathroom was on one level and you walk down some steps and you have a comfortable sitting lounge and a working desk. Whilst the room was spacious, it was dated. The 2 television sets were the old box type and the bathroom decor was dated with old tiles and old tap ware. I did appreciate the spaciousness of the bathroom with double sinks a separate sit down make up vanity a separate bath tub, shower and a separate toilet. The bathroom amenities were basic likewise for the in room coffee and tea provided. Unfortunately, all motel quality. Complimentary bottled water was provided which…",40
"The Venetian is enormous - I can't imagine just how many rooms it must have! The rooms are huge, and very well appointed, with large, luxurious bathrooms as well. The pool is nice, as are some of the restaurants. There is a massive amount of shopping too - you almost don't need to leave the premises once you arrive! The spa is also very nice",40
"One of the best hotel in Macao. The hotel was same as reviewed by others. The room, food & specially it's inside shopping arcade & casino was just amazing. The main thing i loved was it's Venetian Gondola (a replica of Italy). Stayed there for 3 days & those 3 days were just amazing. Will recommend for honeymoon or for a family holiday.  It's a must visit place if you are going to Macao.  Will see you next time Venetian.... 😊❤️",50
I was there with my family last year for family tour and got a chance to stay there for a 3 days and it was a memorable experience for sure. We sated in south block of the hotel building. They have the biggest casino I have ever seen its unbelievable to imagine also how can they operate such a huge property with smooth operations.We got an excellent room suite completely like a presidential suite how we have it in India the food was top notch the services awesome especially the boat riding on the second floor like how the city of Venice has it just remarkable it was.Now I look up to The Venetian Macau as a what 5 star can be. Thanks to our travel company to make our dream come true and The Venetian Macau .,50
"Come to Hong Kong - Macao for holiday, we never been here before. Our friends suggest this hotel to stay. We booked the hotel with a very worthed value of money (5 Stars Hotel) and got the Royale Suite room. Arrived from Ferry Port, there is free shuttle bus that can bring us directly to the hotel. Inside this hotel, there are casino, foodcourt, swimming pools, international shops, and you can take a new experience to take a ride on an authentic Venetian Gondola (such a romantic journey and feels like in Italy 😍). The room was so big, clean, and you can enjoy the bath tub (FYI : the bath room was so big too). Very recomended to you to go for honeymoon or holiday with family member, so comfortable just stay in the hotel. Love it. Thanks for beautiful and sweet memories.",50

"I booked the Royale Suite (70 sqm) via the hotel's website for three adults, one child and one baby. When we arrived for check-in, Nick, our receptionist, told us that we were eligible for a free room upgrade because of my use of their website! I was very surprised! During the smooth check-in process, he gave us even more freebies: bottled water, additional card keys, and even two extra rollaway beds! I felt very overwhelmed by these perks. The only offer we did not take was baggage delivery, because then we'd have to wait for 30 minutes before it can be delivered to our room.  We saw that the door to our room was unique from the others-- we had double-doors. Curiously, we entered and were-- again-- greatly surprised! Our ""free room upgrade"" turned out to be the Rialto Suite!…",50

Starts from free shuttle services from Macau airport / ferry terminals, bulk room check-ins, shops, gondola ride, exhibition centres, innovative show performances, massive room sizes, restaurants and not to forget 24hrs open Casino.",40
"We enjoyed our half day trip to the Venetian Casino and shopping plaza.   Our group was picked up at our hotel, Hotel Royal located in the old town, by the free Venetian shuttle bus and 20 minutes later we were in the Venetian Shopping Plaza.  The ladies loved the shops and everything else on display. I enjoyed the magnificent artificial skyline which looked very real. The canals bore a likeness to Venice!  We had a snack at Lord Stowes Bakery and then made our way into the Casino. A massive casino, the largest I have visited, and some of the betting limits were very high.  We abstained from trusting our luck.  All in all a very enjoyable half day outing and upon departing the casino a shuttle bus was available within 5 minutes to return us to our hotel.",40
Awesome and Spacious Rooms and It is so big that often you will get lost in it and too many shopping places also. Lighting at night looks like Original Venetian Hotel . Services provided are also superb .,50
"Best experience ever.  Gorgeous rooms, great service, beautiful hotels. View was AMAZING. We didn't want to ever leave the room. Room service was very reasonably priced. The hotel has a canal on which you can get a boat ride and has great shopping. Food ranges from food court (which don't accept credit cards!!!) to michelin starred restaurants. Love love love this place.  BEWARE the con artist taxi people at the airport. Just take the free shuttle. We were charged 300 HKD for a taxi from the airport. The hotel receptionist said it should not have cost more than 150 HKD at the MAX, and in fact should have been closer to 120 HKD. This is a ""broken meters"" kind of a place, so negotiate the rate prior to getting into the taxi.",50
"An experience one must have. Casino, good food, shows, luxury living is why people visit Macao. Once you check in there is no need to move out of the hotel. A complete city with good shopping plaza but quite expensive so avoid shopping. Food is very good and there are plenty of options.  Hotel staff is couteous and you get lot of coupons to indulge in various activities in the hotel.",50

Stayed there for 3 nights in March....would definitely go there again...",50
"First, I wouldn't recommend this hotel, only because there're many great hotels around it, and they are newer and cheaper.  This is a true 5 star resort hotel, room was huge, more like a suite. 2 big flatscreen TV in room, big bathroom, comfy bed. Good service too.  Also, there're many different kinds of restaurants here, and a big food court.  Casino area is guarded by securities, underage are not allowed.",40
We stayed here while at an Asian conference with a group.  This resort is HUGE!  It is almost double the size of the Venetian in Las Vegas!  We will return here for sure as this resort is amazing.  The rooms are beautiful and the staff wonderful.  Take caution when gambling as you are not using US dollars.,50
The most luxurious place I've seen. It's huge. The staff we so helpful in providing me with enough instructions to get back to Hong Kong. Sadly I only spent a few hours here. I would've loved to have gotten lost at all the opulence and luxury.,50
Stayed in this hotel in April and had a wonderful experience with my family. The suites are all nice with spacious area for living room and bedroom area  are all welcoming. King size hotel and amenities. The best hotel to stay in Macau. It has a lot of shops and food areas in this location and a picturesque hotel wherever you explore. For those who want to go for casino this is the place to go. We were able to use the pools and it has both heated pools for cold season and a regular pool to enjoy for summer. Definitely worth recommending to friends and worth to try. Two thumbs up for the overall experience.,50
The property is huge and a great place to hang out. the suites are very spacious and comfy. u can find all u want to entertain urself within the hotel. u can find lots of shops but its best for window shopping.,50
"Booked their suite room. It was really a huge room with a king size bed with a sofa bed. Enjoyed the stay in this hotel. Hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. Housekeeping is also very hardworking, came and make up the room twice a day. Location is also convenient as they had their own shopping mall and casino within walking distance. Free shuttle to other Casinos as well as the jetty too. Will come back again. ",50
"The suite is huge with a lower level living room. We were three, but there was no need for a third bed, since the two beds available  were sufficiently large. Express check in was available, but staff in front didn't seem to know this, since he blocked me from entering the check in session. The offer to help with my luggage came too late due to this. After check in, we requested for in-room dining. This was efficiently set up and also collected in time. Touring the Venetian was exciting with the make - believe skyline and canals. Shops were nice, but we settled for the lovely cafe with egg tarts: Lord Stowe 's.  Touring Macau was easy to arrange in a shop, and the concierge  was a big help in finding the shop a few minutes  before closing time. Shuttle  available for ferry as…",50
"The hotel as you know is one mega king size hotel. the rooms were beautiful and large with lovely bathrooms and furnishings....However I must comment about how a lot of time goes just to find out about the check in....due to poor signage's of the hotel....the staff experience before the checkin counter was not the best as expected, can be improved....please make sure you do not waste time there. overall the hotel is lovely specially the rooms, swimming pool, foodcourts and the shopping arcade.......",50
"Visit to Hongkong & Macao is incomplete if you don't go to The Venetian. A city in its own right. Shops , Casino, Gondola ride  & everything else. Just royal. The rooms were awesome. Food was great. You go there and get spilt for choices. Casino was great!! You have to be there to feel it all!!",50
"We were very happy with the free shuttle rides in Macau it was easier for us to go around. Right after arriving in Macau from Hong Kong we rode the Venetian shuttle. The facade in itself is so luxurious. Everything was amazing. I don't know which way to look because the place was very nice (that is an understatement though). We had a great view from our room. We also swam in the pool (they had 3 pools) the next morning and the bathroom was very well-equipped with blow driers, lockers and additional towels. We were also happy seeing kababayans working there so we had a few chit chat with them. The gondolas and the sky painting was wonderful. Shops and restaurants are everywhere though food is cheaper outside. It's a little difficult for directions though because the staff speak…",50
"I had a free upgrade to royal suite! The entire area is majestic. I probably love everything here.. There is a clear distinct choices from affordable meals, shops and luxury at its best. The staffs are very professional. I enjoyed the casino's as the slot machines are endless, they have my favorite monopoly world travel. Each royal suite is huge and the comfort rooms are superb. It is worth every penny. It's just not recommended for solo travelers like me. The scenic view from my room is so peaceful. For you will be entertained all around and will have less time going to your royalty like suite. Bellini Lounge is cool and modern, Im glad I saw Filipino Staff here. The Edo Japanese restaurant offers the best shashimi, it is like I have been to Japan with all the authenticity. The…",50
"I didn't stay at the Venetian since the rooms were not within my budget.  However I'm writing this review to mention about the amazing free shuttle that this casino provides.  From Airport to Cotai Strip to Old Macau, take the Venetian shuttle buses.  Morever these awesome buses comes with free wifi.  Totally amazing!",50
"Of course, it's Venetian macao , what do expect. grand building. complete picturesque . loved the suite. wifi in d room only. view is magnificent. gondola ride was cute. sang bollywood song for us. food was awesome , indian buffet was done separately. it was easy to find vegetarian food among all meat country.",50
"Of the Casinos in Macau, it is the Venetian that has the most to do beside gambling. There is a huge shopping mall with numerous choices in the food court. The shops are all luxury goods (therefore very expensive). But there is also free musical entertainment and an indoor gondola. Its a nice place to take the family for a few hours and a good meal.",40
"Everything about this place was wow. the moment we landed in the property our journey to an amazing experience started, starting from the bell boy at the entrance gate till the time we left the property every moment was memorable. We were upgraded to a bigger suite, the suite were large, clean and spacious. The front desk staff was very courteous, took time to explain things. guided us properly. very large and wel maintained property, excellent service the staff was very polite and courteous. overall a very nice experience.",50
awesome big room! very pleasant! i feel like i am a big time celebrity. i would definitely go back here. i love everything about this place. the smell is so nice. the food is great. the ambiance the atmosphere i can stay here forever. my kids enjoyed every minute of our stay.,50
A huge hotel......... totally majestic.. lived life of venice . The gadolla looked soo romantic. Huge market with almost display of every brand in the world. Smooth chek in and chek out. They provided a map with chek in which was rightfully done because without map a man can get lost in the hotel. Great Stay. Thanks Venetian,50
"I have stayed here for three separate times so far and I will continue to do so every time I'm in Macau. The suites are amazing and it's so convenient to shopping, concert or other entertainments. Service is outstanding and the staff are always quick with response and really make a honest effort to make your stay there unforgettable. Staying in the Venetian will definitely enhance your whole experience in Macau. Very convenient with the shuttle buses to the other island.",50
"The hotel is a great hotel, ample areas, huge casino, many upscale stores and beautiful suites. However, Macau, and the Venetian Macau, can in NO way be compared to the Las Vegas Venetian, probably because the hotel is mainly geared towards the Chinese clients. What the hotel lacks is entertainment in the former of shows and bars. If you don't gamble you may have a hard time finding entertainment.",50
"I haven't been to Venice, but the Venetian Macao experience was a trip beyond forgetting. Going to Venetian Macao is already enough for a Macao tour. Everything is in their. Specially the Gondola, so Romantic...",50
"I was living in Hong Kong so had to take the ferry to Macau and experience it and boy was it different to Hong Kong, dare I say even  more crazy , people everywhere and extremely busy .we didnt try the casinos as its not my thing but quite amazing place to visit",50
"My husband and I stayed in The Venetian Rialto Suite and we were not disappointed at all. Amazing hotel. It was really a jawdroppin experience. The room was huge and I recommend for family to stay. All facilities are venetian style. Just the way we like it. I also believe that the staff are the main strength of the hotel, with most of them going out of the way to take care of our every comfort. Special commendation to the front desk officer Mr. John or JC who took care of all our needs. He gave us best recommendation for eating, shopping and transportation. So happy that he recommend the buffet restaurant named Bamboo. It is now my fav buffet resto.  Given that this was our first time there. JC exceeded our expection in helping and guiding us. Thanks so much for making our stay…",50
We Stayed in for 2 nights but i feel that wasn't enough as we were not able to explore the place completely. But undoubtedly its the best hotel in town with lavish structure.We actually had to use a map each time to reach our room. On arrival our room was upgraded as we were a honeymoon couple. We were given a suite which was really big with a full equipped bathroom. The view from the room was breathtaking.  It has a huge mall setup on the top level but mind you things are pretty expensive as compared to the same brand stores in Hongkong. Also the options for vegetarian food is very less...so its advisable to carry your own food.,50
What a lovely hotel ! The staff are amazingly helpful ! The rooms were superb and very very comfortable !  The decor was so tasteful and beautiful and the bathrooms one of the most amazing that i've seen !   The Hotel and Casino are huge ! it obviously has its own shopping arcade- you must visit the Venetion Canal Shoppes - just amazing ! apparently the top brands are available cheaper than in Hong Kong and Singapore so people shop like crazy .. but even if you dont plan to shop there is just so much see. You just been the stamina and patience to walk around ...  You must visit the Lord Stows bakery for the famous Macau Egg tarts - they are simply scrumptious ! Also Koi Kei bakery to pick up their lovely bakery items and meat jerky as gifts or to take home ..   The food court…,50
"Awesome is the best word to describe The Venetian Macau. The hotel is big and wonderful. The size of the room is huge. But I can say that their services is 7 star services. I lovesssssss their customer service.  In the booking I've told the hotel that we go to Macau to celebrate my daughter's birthday and when we arrived, the hotel upgraded our room and my daughter got her suprised birthday cake and birthday card from the hotel. She lovessss it so much. Thank you so much for your services.   The foods in the room services also nice and yummy. They have spicy taiwanese beef noodle soup. When you eat it you feel like you go to heaven. The soup is soooo perfect and the beef is so tender.   In December we will go to Macau again and for sure we will stay in The Venetian Macau again…",50
"The Venetian Macao Resort Hotel is the first hotel which I have lived in Macau.  When I came to Macau with my parents to went to University of Macau, we choose it because it looks very good.  The room we choose is Verona and it’s so big.  It has a big living room and a small dining room for customer to eat take-out food.  And the appliance inside the room is very delicate and looks very luxurious.  About bathroom, it’s also very big compare with other hotel, even though 2 people use it, and the sanitary product all belongs to Cologne.  The Venetian Macao Resort Hotel is not just a hotel, it also has too much restaurants, shops and a big casino.  Under the hotel, is a very big shopping mall.  Most of famous brand can be find in here, so I think here is women’s heaven.  At the…",40
"2D1N trip with family and parent. It was for birthday celebration for mother. Areas deserving special mention: Suite was BIG and clean and tidy. Bed and pillow was good (given that mother is really sensitive to different bed / pillow and was able to catch some sleep) Really appreciate the connecting rooms arrangement. Rooms for improvement: Breakfast - selection was less than expected (compare to another restaurant over at the Sands Cotai Resort which was also available for selection on the list of restaurant for breakfast) Would appreciate something ""special"" for mother, given it was for her birthday. Was locked out of the room as we were 10 minutes late for check-out. Not a good impression, given the occasion.",40
"The Venetian is a Macau's famous attraction, it comprises hotel, gaming, convention, shopping, sports, arts and leisure facilities that make it develops into an integrated place. Most of the tourists must visit The Venetian when they come to Macao. For me, I would love to go shopping in here because it is very comfortable. In summer, we can go shopping in there with air-conditioner. In winter, we do not need to endure the cold weather. Especially when you are tired, you can find a place to have a break competently. Moreover, the grand decoration make you have an illusory appearance that is in a palace. There are abundant displays, such as painting golden armillary sphere, a giant chandelier and Renaissance. All of these appear in front of you amazingly. Nevertheless, it is…",40
"We stayed in Venetian for 2 nights. Royale Suite is fairly large and extravagant. The check in staff were very helpful and insisted twice or thrice that we use bell desk to carry our large bags when they came to know of our plan to carry the bags on our own to the room. Some staff at Golden Peacock restaurant need additional training. They are very strict in closing down the buffet and dont entertain late comers. When we ordered for Vegetable Biryani, staff member coldly responded that it is sold out without offering a pleasant alternative. Having staff at Casino who can speak good English and proficient in explaining games will be helpful!!",40
"Great Services , Great Facilities and really great rooms. I never forgot the nights I spend in this hotel. This hotel have the biggest casino in the world I think and there are lots of good services in every corner of hotel.",50
"In March 20, I went to The Venetian of Macao Resort with my friends. So why do we went to there? The answer is shopping! Inside The Venetian of Macao Resort, there is a large shopping center in the first floor, a lots of famous brand have official store inside here, such as NIKI, REEBOK, VANS, H&M and so on, so we went to there for a crazy shopping. Beside this, there are lots of entertainment facilities in here, if you wanted to have an excellent gambling in Macau, I strongly recommend you can choose The Venetian of Macao Resort as one of your choice, since it is the largest and most famous casino in Macau, a lot of well-known stars always have their own concert in here, since the facilities inside here are considered the best in here. Furthermore, the top hotel are also…",40
"Stayed at the Venetian hotel in South Tower. Room was very big and extremely comfortable.   Be prepared to walk a lot in the Venetian everything is far apart. Check in is middle of casino floor then far walk to tower then far walk to room from the elevator.   If I am correct there are 3000 rooms.   Once you ready to venture out go to the mall downstairs it has pretty much everything you could want and is. Nice to see the Gondolas in the water.   The casino is very big and has loads of people gambling, I am not interested in the casino so I'm unable to give any reviews or tips in regards to casino.  This was my second stay in the Venetian and both times have been good.   It is also very close to the airport.   ",40
"Venetian-based hotel interior. When you enter the smell will entice you. It is one of the most popular techniques to lure a customer but why not the smell is truly opulent. One of the most extravagant hotel/casinos that are known wherever you may go. The people behind the interior worked hard on this one. Lush gold almost everywhere. Their staff are very helpful and very welcoming. The bathrooms are just WOW. Very charming. Materials in a Venetian based interior are very important because they have to incorporate the ""water"" element in the setting. Though not much of wood and or brick was used(in the real Venice this is the alternative because marble and stone is heavy) I still think they did a fantastic job. Try visiting. It's a go to place when you're in Macau. ",50
"I came to The Venetian Macao Resort Hotel is very happy,when the car go to theThe Venetian Macao Resort Hotel outside, you can see the Continental Building,My favorite building is the constellation clock, I do not like is that too many people.",50
"The Venetian is the emerging leisure and entertainment place in Macau. Different from the Macau Tower, the Venetian is a casino with hotel. Although, the Venetian is a casino, there are lots of shop in the Venetian, wherever famous brand or other young brand. In recent years, the Venetian become the shopping haven of the Macau people and the tourists. In addition shopping, there are lots of recreational facilities for teenager. Gondola rides, you could take the boat ride through the Grand Canals of shoppes at the Venetian. QUBE CLUB is he world of Venetian Kids, There have climbing structures with slides and nets. QUBE CLUB such as a small playground. Usually i go to the Venetian three time a month. I will go shopping there or have a dinner there. It’s because my favourite…",40
"One of the best stay in the world. Casinos, shops and dinings located just below my room. Dining option was fantastic, the lobby was grand, and my room was spacious and filled with luxury items. Had a great time here strolling around the lobby and shop. Plus, we rode a gondola with a opera-like singer/driver.",50
"The Venetian Macao lives up to its name -- it does give you the feeling as though you've been transported to Venice with its enormously spacious suites, luxuriously designed to feel like a little piece of a palace in the middle of small, bustling city. Even The Venetian's smallest and cheapest suite is already in itself larger than most of the family rooms of other Asian luxury hotels. I love that the suite comes with two TV Sets - one in the living area; and, another right in front of the bed, so that guests wouldn't have to choose to stay in just one area to get a TV fix. And the bed -- it's totally designed to make guests feel like a Queen, with its fine tapestries, thick sheets and classy pillow choices. Truly a royal experience that your body would enjoy even when it's…",50
"Venetian Hotel is one of the most popular Hotel in Macau and recently years it also become one of the landmark of Macau. Everyday there are a large amount of bus through every port of Macau to transfer visitors in to Venetian. Through the land is very expensive here, Venetian still built a lake at it front door to show the impression to the visitor all over the world. When you get in the Venetian Hotel you will be attracted by the huge gambling yard which can involved by thousands of people. On the second floor of the Venetian, they built a  similar Venice as amounts of bridges and a beautiful blue river. As a visitor, you can buy a ticket to take a ship travel around this hotel. The blue river and the man-made blue sky leave deep impression to each visitors who comes there.…",50
"Have stayed here many times and it consistently delivers. Standard rooms are huge in grand style with everything you need and spotlessly clean . Just remember which wing you are in as easy to get it wrong , especially after a few drinks in the Bellini bar..... The casino is enormous and for those not wanting to gamble the night away you can get some serious tensile therapy...... all the brands are here so come prepared.  I've stayed in other hotels in Macau, Lisbon, Emperor , Akura but to name a few and this is the best.   I've no hesitation in recommending. ",50
"The hotel itself is a breathtaking structure.. And the interiors are exquisite. It has a shopping mall with an an artificial canal complete with a gondola giving a Venetian feel to the place,  a casino, golf course, pool etc and everything is grandly decked up!. The suites are spacious, comfortable, and has no shortcomings. The staff r well trained, courteous and seem to know exactly what we need. There are daily frequent shuttle buses to the ferry terminal, sands casino and hotel etc. The breakfast buffet has an Indian section which is limited but the hotel has an Indian restaurant so no problems there! Definitely the place to stay at Macau.",50
"The place to choose if you are visiting Macau  Well i believe the Venetian in Macau is bigger than the original Venetian in Las Vegas.  The resort is huge with lots of restaurant of different cuisines , casino's etc...   Most of the good shows unfortunately is outside of Venetian like House of Dancing Waters show is across Venetian Resort  4D show of Batman & House of Magic Show is in different hotel .  I expected that we have more good shows inside Venetian but nevertheless it is still an experience in Venetian  Food is relatively cheaper than Hongkong so make the best use of the same Breakfast in Cafe De Macau is desirable as you will not see a better spread laid down anywhere in Asia , they would probably have all the cuisines laid down every morning  I had taken a private…",50
"I stayed in the Royal Suite for 1 night in early April.  PROS 1. Lavish, opulent experience that you should try at least once. The furniture exudes class and decadence. Room was more than spacious. 2. Great casino with many options and blinds. I had a fun time there trying out different games.  3. Nice mall in the Venetian (The Shoppes?) that had a good mix of eateries and shops.  CONS 1. The hotel was massive and perhaps too vast for my liking. It was not easy to navigate around the place and even finding the check-in counter was a problem. 2. Just an overall feeling that the hotel felt a bit detached from guests due to its sheer size.",40
"Venetian is vocational village, there are casino, shopping areas, eating areas, entertainment and hotels. In there, you can solve any problems of travel. I always go to there for shopping and eating. My friend had some concern tickets, and she found me for accompanying, so in March of 2016, I watched a concern of Korean top signers.  Actually, my favorite signers is not these 3 groups, but one artiste of the groups was my friend favorite. In the concern, although I did not like their music before, but I was attracted by them after the concern. The music was so wonderful and shocked. I really enjoyed it. The concern was about 2 hours and half. There were so many people in there for listening music, some fans were so high and happy, they shouted very loud, and I were infected too.…",40
"Amazing hotel overall. Do not expect personalised attention of a resort in India, Bali or Thailand but experience facilities. Huge, comfortable rooms. Great in room dining. Multiple swimming pools. An unending array of activities for adults and kids alike.",50
Almost service was good except some restaurants in Venetian which were not kind and bad taste. But restaurants in city of dreams were good!!  I recommend them instead of venetian restaurants. Other service of Venetian was really satisfied.,40
"One word describes this hotel Massive. !!!!! The rooms/suites are awesome ! Certain things about the hotel are frustrating though ! The check-in process takes too long because of the long ques , the check out also the same. You just seem to get lost in the hotel as its too massive ! Taking your luggage to and from the room is a task, they need some golf carts. The casino is really big and the dream works show as over hyped, nothing much really ! The property is excellent though and the gondola ride awesome! I think more than anything we were overwhelmed by the place.",50
"It's truly Grand & Magnificent experience staying in this place. At times feels like living in a shopping mall, at reception it felt like living in a Airport. But a great experience. Remember it's so big that at times people get lost in this.  Big casino, shopping area, Gandola ride are big attractions of this place. ",50
"It is a good deluxe place to spend time when in Macau. Their standard room is like the presidential suit in the Philippines and the cost ranges to 700- 1000 plus MOP depends on the season. We took the standard double bed at the Bella, North part. It is near the Grand Canal and Casino. But it needs a little upgrading.",40
"Good Hotel.Lots of attractions.Almost diffcult to navigate out of it to go out :) No issues as such,they had food court as well.Connectivity is good with Sands as well.These guys should add more attractions like the vegas strip,more water shows for public viewing.",40
"If you are in Macau, this is the place have to stay. Nothing beats the unique, grandeur and luxury feel. One cannot take away the view, services, and a complete over experience of staying there. Absolutely worth the experience...",50
"Second time here and still loved it, but this time round I found the property just way too big ! Walking from the room to grab a taxi was 10 minutes, which is a log walk in heels. Staff at front desk were great but the staff around the hotel who have difficulty understanding English can come across as rude, otherwise a pleasant stay ",40
"My wife and I spend a couple of days at the Venetian hotel whilst staying in Hong Kong. The Cotai Water Jet trip over was excellent and just under an hour. There was a free shuttle service from the ferry terminal to the hotel and check in was smooth and efficient. The suite was first class and had everything that a luxury hotel could offer.  We dined at the Italian restaurant in St Marks Squre and just walking around the shops and canals was a surreal experience and was hard to remember we were still indoors!!! A tour of Macau organised by Cotai Travel at the Venetian was superb and a change from the resort facilities. Dining in the Cafe Deco at the Venetian was again superb and even though I am not a gambler, the activities in the Casino were well worth watching. Checkout and…",50
"My first stay the Venetian and i can say its not going to be the last. Right from the great outer architecture to the amazing rooms interiors to the shopping arcade to the venice feel with the boats, this place has it all. Another great benefit is that they offer bus shuttle which is free pick up and drop to and from the airport. These buses can also be used to travel to the city for free. The frequency of these buses is around 15-20 mins. The casino is world class with min. bets at different tables that cater to all pockets. They also have a duty free shop within the hotel. The concierge is extremely helpful. Overall highly recommended.",50
The room is big and the Customer Relationship staff are helpful.  The room is non-smoking room but the room smell smokey.  The swimming pool is nice and the staff are nice too.  The free wifi is smooth and easy to access.,50
"We enjoyed a two-night stay at the Venetian in March 2015 while attending a corporate event also held in the same venue. Everything about this place is on a massive scale - from check-in to the range of shopping to the room size.  Our room - the cheapest class on offer - was huge, with an entrance hallway leading to the massive bedroom area, then down to a lounge/dining/office area with views out over the golf course and Cotai Strip. The room was immaculately presented and beautifully furnished, in an opulent Italian style. The bathroom was on a similar oversized scale as well, with quality amenities.  The Venetian complex is enormous and it's almost beyond human scale, so expect to get lost navigating the endless shops, but also enjoy the madness of it all with the canals and…",50
"An absolute treat to stay at such an awesome property..to add to it we got a free upgrade to bella suite. The rooms were huge with 2 queen beds , a palatial bathroom , food court with good choices, a grand casino inthe hotel , free shuttle to some hotels and ferry terminal. My 5 yr old thoroughly enjoyed the stay.. The check in - out was pretty smooth . We did wish there was some place near the west lobby for the waiting guests ..since we were waiting for out tour pick up..too many people at the entrance..am sure casino was a crowd puller..also we werent aware of the free shuttle to the other hotels/locations which we could have used well ,if known earlier. This we managed to use only on the last day.  All in all, the stay was a memorable one ..",50
"The Venetian Macao Hotel is very huge that you will get lost. Good thing, we stayed at the hotel. At night, we took photo shoots everywhere. Hehehe. By the way, their staffs are very accommodating and approachable. Bedroom is totally luxury and spacious which good for family. I recommend this hotel for family! Another thing, please use the free shuttle but kindly note that passengers must be 21 years old and above. ",50
"This was my 2nd visit to The Venetian Macau. It was just as i remembered it but it is less  exclusive now. When it first opens ; it had a wow factor but not anymore.   What i like about this hotel: 1-It's suites! wow; it was and still is massive; perfect when you are travelling with kids.My 9 year old loved staying there. He stayed at The Venetian too when he was 2 , of course, he couldn't remember it and he was too young to make a comment then 2- Clean 3-Its bathroom was massive too; it has a large walk in shower and a separate bath; excellent! Its toilet has its own door too, which was very private; fab! 4- Its bathroom was so massive that it could accommodate a large dressing table and chair. It also had 2 separate sinks; love it 5-We treat ourselves with its room service:-).…",50
"Visited in March 2016 with wife and two kids. Took Bella Suite. Room was nice but smaller than expected. The hype about this hotel is so much that the expectation is too high. The hotel does everything nicely. The lobby and the casino is huge. The shopping mall and the food court is lovely. The shows that happen are also high standard.  Overall very very nice, but probably would explore other options as well on the next visit.",40
"Well - the title says it all...  the casino, the shopping arcade, the theatre, the food court & finally the rooms...  I have never seen a property as huge as this ever ! Infact - sometimes it was frustrating to get to the right exit, because you just cant find it easily.   Though the rooms & some facilities are getting a bit dated - but thats absolutely no reason for anyone not to try Venetian. You get the shuttle from the ferry terminal (very easy) & then reach hotel within 15 min. The hotel also has shuttles to their other properties... & we hopped on those just to get a nice city tour. (it was free after all) :)  The City of Dreams is just across the road & you definitely have better shows & night entertainment over there. We visited on the christmas eve & the place was…",40
"Luxurious suites with either a king sized bed (big enough to sleep three adults) or two queen beds (comfortably sleep 4 adults) and a living room with sofa and a little dining table.   Bathroom is HUGE, with bathtub and shower and a twin wash basins for him and her. Hotel is connected to a huge shopping mall and a food court with good variety of food stalls (Western, Chinese, Cantonese, Singaporean, Taiwanese etc).   Free shuttles ply between Taipa ferry terminal and hotel, which takes only about 10 minutes.   Seems to be a popular hotel - lobby always crowded and long check in queues.  However, service is good & efficient.  It's the only hotel I will choose to stay whenever I visit Macau.",50
"It was a marvelous experience having been able to stay at the Venetian Macau. I wanted to stay longer however my holidays were a bit tight.  The room size met our expectations. However we found scattered peanuts near the window which they have not thoroughly checked. Our room was facing the Grado Mini Golf which was astonishing.   I had a great use of their gym in the early morning and not much people that time.  We had the chance to seek help from the Concierge. I was unable to catch his name however he was a bit Japanese looking. His service was great and was giving a very warm smile. Please do keep it up! If you could pass on these words of encouragement, I would greatly appreciate it. I've been working in the Hospitality Industry for quite a while and I know how frustrating…",50
biggest and best and with huge casino . Food court serves every need ... its a city in itself in macau ...... must visit if in macau Taipa . Casino is great and caters to everyone need though conversion from Indian Rupee makes it costly in Food and water,50
"It is the most awesome resort I have ever seen in my life. Its huge, it's beautiful, it's rustic and awesome. Rooms are royal. U feel very special there.  The shopping street is just wonderful. You have all the brands you can think to shop from. Luxury at its best. ",50
"Today is Sunday,I have done all my homework, so I think about going outside to relief pressure. The Venetian is a perfect choice for shopping and eating. because there have plenty of  brands. The cheaper, a little expensive and luxury all you can find in Venetian. Recently, it is time to shopping cause every store discount heavily now. The servers warmly welcome clients and treat me with a patient. During the trying a clothes, they give me suggestions about collocation that I really don't know. The Venetian has a special and fresh fragrance's smell. I bury myself and very enjoy it. The last I need to mention is that there are a mere casino teenagers can see from the escalator in Macau,because the law doesn't allow people who under 22 years old in Casinos!",50
this is agood property if you are looking for something expensive.. the rooms are faboulous..the swimming pool on the terrace is wonderful with a hot and cold pool...the food is ok..overall good experience but an expensive one to be honest....,40
This place is just superb. Let me first tell you the highlights:  * Huge gambling area * Vast shopping options * Amazing Food options in the cafeteria and the restaurants * Nightlife and Club option are also available inside the hotel itself * Wi-Fi connectivity is seemless from the time you step in to the resort till the time you leave. * Shuttle service to almost everywhere in the city * I have not seen such big rooms in a hotel before. The rooms are awesome and very well maintained.  Some points which were negatives are  * Check In is a very tedious and a long process as the reception is always crowded. * The pool area is quite secluded and should be reworked on.  My stay here was amazing and would love to visit again.,50
"The property was booked by the travel company. The hotel pleasantly surprised. 1. Suite is  big n you get suite at a rate at which you get a room at other comparable hotels. The attached bathroom surprises, its big, well lit and feels good. The rooms on the higher floor offers spectacular views. 2. You get a free shuttle to most places in Macau ferry terminal, hotel galaxy. 3. Room service is decent. However complementary water is too small in quantity. 4. There are four swimming pools n one of them is a heated jaccuzi.  5. Mall on the third floor is very good for shopping or dining or strolling. The gondola ride though expensive is recommended. The third floor ambiance is amazing, The sky looks spectacular. 6. The breakfast is a fantastic spread .The quality of food is great.…",40
Taking my mother to Macau for the first time so I decided to give her a great hotel which is Venetian macau.  The hotel itself has its unique indoor river or canal which has its gondola.  My mother love the swimming pool area even we didnt swim there but just sitting down in the area and enjoyed the green environment already had its soothing feeling for us.  We had a fun walk by walking and pushing her jn her wheel chair in casino and enjoyed seeing exciting people who won the gamble.,40
"Macau is a paradise by itself. Gardens and greenery all over the place. The local shopping near venetian hotel was amazing. The hotel by itself is so huge with branded shops. However the foodcourt food is expensive but you dont have a choice but to have it there. The casino is where the action happens but that said i never visited the casino but enjoyed the place for it natural greenery. Take a stroll along AMA temple. Do not forget to have portugese egg tarts which are very tasty and famous in macau. Its a mix a portugese and chinese settlement.  The room at venetian is by far the biggest room i have ever stayed till now. Two huge beds , a separate space for sofa and study table, a huge washroom. WOW.....  If you are with kids the there is a kids play zone on the 5 th level on…",50
hahahahaha so then... wht do I say about the venetian.... it is a must go hotel... and yes it is worth all the hype.... if can't afford.. must stay here for at least one night .... I stayed here for 3......  don't miss the shrekfest  if travelling with kids....   only place where they require an improvement is breakfast buffet. ...... not upto standards of venetian... and the price which we are paying... definately need an improvement here....   casino... well wht do I say..... stunning and amazing..... biggest casino in the world. ..... do I need say more?  ,40

Incidentally it was raining during our visit, so we could use the heated jacuzzi. 5. Mall on the third floor is very good for shopping or dining or strolling. There's even a Venice replica gondola ride, which we took n was great. 6. We took a shrekfast at adjoining hotel at a walking distance from within the Venetian and kids really loved it. I am definitely coming back to Venetian whenever I visit Macau again.",50
"The Hotel Complex have one stop excitement. Hotel, Casino, Shopping Mall, Restaurants, Theatre. Located only minutes away by hotel shuttle bus from Airport and Ferry Pear. A high end Shopping mall with luxurious brands, Great eating experence for mid to high budget. Casino with many kind of games. A must visit when you are in town. Have Fun...",40
Stayed for 2 nights in Bella Suite .... The room was spacious and toilet was too good.... The hotel is just amazing and requires two days to explore all the area... Food court has all the options including Indian. The shopping mall is also the place not to be missed and the best of the lot is the Gandola ride...  Will definitely want to return and stay in this hotel...,50
"We stayed at the Venetian for one night and really enjoyed it. The location is perfect to visit the Show of “House of Dancing Water” and it is great to reach Coloane as well, to go to Macau Island is also easily possible. Venetian itself is an experience and we were very warmly welcomed at the check-in (without queuing due to Express Check-in), what immediately made as fell happy about choosing Venetian. The rooms are spacious and the staff really cared. We enjoyed a very nice surprise to celebrate our 1st Anniversary, a spacious room&bathroom, great food and loved the variety of shops you cannot go to in China. We would love to come back one day.",50
"Wow!!!A shopping mall,A casino,A golf course,a city with rides. This & much more bundled up in one hotel. The rooms are cosy but the experience is extravagant. Please plan at least 4 days as you will take 1-2 days to explore this huge hotel. They have created a replica of the streets of Venice & you can even ride a gondola within the premise.  Let me sign off as you need to go & experience Venetian & yes adjoining to the hotel they are working on creating Paris. phew...",50
"Wonderful experience, probably the best outside of Italy. Room was absolutely wonderful. Luxury is too simple a word to describe the room, two tvs, wonderful king bed with pillows galore, couch, coffee table, mini table, bathtub, amenities, shower, separate restroom.  Free WiFi in the hotel; free shuttle service to and from hotel; ferry tickets available from concierge.  Several pools; including an adults only, and warm water pool.  You cannot top the Venetian.",50
"This is a great hotel in the wonderful Macau! The hotel is just huge, 3000 rooms if I am not mistaken but the rooms are just BEAUTIFUL and HUGE!!!!!! My breath was taken away with the beautiful design and size of the room, you don't want to leave!  The Hotels free breakfast has just about anything for anyone, well recommended.  The shopping arcade is as beautiful as the real Venice, Italy. Waterways, real gondolas with serenades just fantastic…unbelievable, you really feel as if you are in Venice. There are great restaurants around 300 stores and also a food court for a quick bit!  The Casino is one of the largest I have ever seen!  You have everything you need at the Venetian Macao no need to go anywhere else but if you want to visit other hotels the Venetian has walkways…",50
"We are a couple who visit Macau and the Venetian for celebrating our 3rd wedding anniversary! The reception agent Icy was soooooo kind to upgrade us to a room with beautiful view outside the window on higher floor( room no. 34098) for free, and she also make the phone call to arrange the special honeymoon style bed decorations ( with heart-shape towels and fresh roses) according to my request when booked the room online. Although thus make us wait for 1 hour to check in the room, but it is so worthful when we walked into the room. Besides, we won a little money in the casino during this time. Lucky us! In addition, the hotel also present us a special gift to welcome our marriage and stay, it is a 6 inch strawberry mousse cake, very delicious! Thank you sooooo much to the…",50
"I've stayed in this hotel property in mid March because a conference is held in this hotel's expo facilities.   [1]  There are frequent free shuttle buses from this hotel to the two ferry terminals in Macau (one in Taipa and another the outer habour ferry terminal), Macau international airport, and a few places including the immigration border to mainland.    [2]  Check-in and check-out are smooth.  If you do not need a copy of invoice, you can actually drop your keys into the check-out boxes.  It is actually recommended because the hotel is very big and it really takes you time to work to the reception for check-out.  [3]  In terms of sports facilities, there is a gym at 8/F that opens from 6am to 11pm.  Amazingly, though the hotel is huge, the gym is relatively not even though…",40
Venetian macao resort is a place worth living. It offers gandola ride within close proximity. Rooms are neat and spacious. All major brands of clothing and eating joints are opened within the mall. One can spend a day or too looking at each and every place,50
"If you are looking for shopping and dining, this hotel is the one. There're huge range of shops and nice restaurants without having to grab a taxi. However, the hotel is so big, we checked in at the main lobby and have to walk around 10 minutes to our room (with a map). The other thing is if you are looking for more privacy, Venetian might not suits you as it's too crowded with visitors for shopping, dining and casino. Room is clean and ok. ",40
"Stayed at this hotel for a night while we ate on our holiday to Hong Kong. I must say the structure is really good and you will never fee you are in Macau at all.   If you visit do not go out for food you can find food shops around the hotel.   Take loads of photos, its really worth while.",40
This was our fourth stay at the Venetian and as usual we were very happy.   We upgraded to a family suite this time around and the room size made it well worth the extra cost. With separate living room and bedrooms the suites offer parents a sense of privacy. Other advantages to the suite are the VIP private car pick up from the Ferry as private lounge check in.  All in all another nice weekend getaway.,40
"I must say that this is a hotel with above expectations ratings in all aspects.   Room: We were given Bella Suites which had two queen size beds, dining hall, sofa and all other amenities. They provide free water bottles as and when you call the room service.  Bathroom: Big bathroom with all amenities and dressing area as well. Service: Excellent! We reached after long flight and requested a little early checkin as we were with kid and very tired. In spite of policy to check in at 1 pm, they let us in at 12.  Excellent room service whenever required. They also provide free pick-up and drop to some of the places including from airport. Location: it has the best location in Macau as people from other hotels come to visit Venetian Macau. It has a big shopping mall, restaurants with…",50
"I had always heard about venetian but yes once you are there you can see the marvels of the place from its hotel to shopping centres and eating joints, All in one package with teh free buses from all over to connect to.",50
"The location, rooms, pool, restaurants and staff were all great. The Bella suite was a good size for two adults and 2 young kids and having so many restaurants around kept everyone happy. The heated pool was also a hit with the kids. The only issue as a westerner were the cultural differences which ( despite living in Asia for 18years) became a problem. The Spitting, pushing in, shouting became tiresome and we were glad to leave. ",40
"We stayed during part of the New Year celebrations, the decorations around the hotel were beautiful and added to a fantastic experience. We had a royal suite on the 34th floor which had a view of the Cotai strip. The room was very spacious and immaculately clean, any items used were replaced and we felt like we were experiencing luxury. We had breakfast in the Cafe Deco- it was delicious - so many choices! The staff we dealt with were friendly and very helpful. The shopping mall is beautiful and huge. We enjoyed watching people in the casino - even if we didn't understand the games! We found places to eat and shop a short walk away in Taipa village and caught shuttle buses to other hotels and areas of Macau and went to see the pandas in the panda pavilion . An overall amazing…",50
The Venetian Macao Resort Hotel is awesome hotel to stay. I would recommend a room with Cotai view which has spectacular views during night. This hotel is huge and it would take days to explore. You have lot many shops and a replica of Venice. A must go with a Gandola ride to feel as if you are in Venice. Huge Casino is right in the centre of lobby which is crowded 24X7. ,50
"We checked in on 7th March -9th March, we were provided south suite 21049 room no. Awesome room which gives you feeling of living like a King. The hotel property is too good, casino, shopping mall, food court etc. You feel like it's a heaven. 100% satisfied. Lovely breakfast provided at cafe deco.  Shuttle bus service provided by the hotel for pick up and drop to ferry terminal or local market. Decent caring staff. Full marks to this hotel. I enjoyed staying here with my family.",50
"The Venetian Macao Resort Hotel offers the almost perfect hotel experience, whether you are in for gambling, shopping, or for a conference (as was my case). The rooms are large and spacious, nicely decorated, will all necessary amenities. There are many food options for all tastes and almost at all prices, including a very large and diverse food court up to high scale restaurants. Very good wi-fi in all spaces and in the room. Shopping however tends to be very expensive. Another minor minus - no hand-shower - an odd omission.",50
"The room and bathroom is big. The room furniture and fixtures are very elegant. The room offers very nice bathroom amenities. Housekeeping service personnel are very efficient and very service-oriented. The main lobby of the hotel is breathtaking. Overall, Venetian Hotel Macau is an excellent hotel with excellent service despite the fact that the hotel maintains 3000 rooms and services thousands of guests on a daily basis.",50
"I absolutely loved this hotel, the rooms are huge and the bathrooms are pretty big! This hotel has a mall in which there are various restaurants and cafes. The hotel is sooo beautiful, I just adored it. Best hotel in macau!",50
"We recently spent 2 nights in Macau at the Venetian. It was a somewhat surreal experience we shared with the many thousand of other people bussed in every day from the Chinese border, ferry terminal and airport.  It is certainly a shopping and gambling mecca. You can easily stay within this huge complex for the duration of your stay. The dining options within the complex are huge ranging in price and style.  All provided big meal serves.  Macau and particularly the area around the Venetian and the other mega gambling complexes around Taipa is not the kind of place you can run down to the local corner store or supermarket. Although we did walk into the nearby village on a couple occasions which is quite close and assessable with a range of shopping and dining options.    The…",50
"This hotel is massive and there is a bit of a walk, even from just the reception to the lifts that bring you to the room. It can be a little overwhelming when you first step into the hotel but staff are ready to point you in the right direction. Have to walk through casino to get to the hotel suites from the Main Lobby.  The rooms are huge. Two queen sized beds which were very very comfortable. I found the pillows a bit too soft and fluffy and gets flat through the night. Overall, I love the room.  Reception staff was great. Was in Macau for a business trip and extended for an additional night. Allan, the service staff at reception was kind enough to allow an upgrade so that I didn't have to check out and check in again for the extended night. Check out is also later, at 2pm, if…",40
We visited the Venetian Macau as a part of a holiday.  The hotel's casino is absolutely spectacular.  The shopping is amazing.  There is something for everyone at this hotel.  Shuttle buses to other casinos are available just outside the hotel.  The hotel façade is tastefully done.  Staff are very hospitable.  The only thing I wish is if we were allowed to take a camera into the casino!  All in all a wonderful experience.,50
"Stayed for one night (9-10th March) and all I can say is wow. The hotel is giant, the staff are lovely, breakfast was enjoyable.   We were upgraded to a room on 34th floor with a beautiful view of Macau and it's casinos and because it is my birthday in March they sent up a gorgeous birthday cake and gave us free checkout until 2pm which was appreciated. Definitely need more time in Macau so will be back and staying at the Venetian.   ",50
"Because I study in Macao, I go to The Venetian many times.  The first time is during my check in time of the college with my parents.  We have stayed there for two days.  In my hometown, there isn’t such a luxurious hotel with heavy Cologne.  I am very cautious about it and I can’t wait to see how the room is.  When I got into the room in a high floor, wow, that’s too sumptuous to imagine.  The light, the table, the bed even the wash room.  All in all, it’s comfortable and enjoyable to stay in the Venetian.   	Later, I go there with my friends.  In my opinion, it’s more than a hotel, it’s like a small city.  We can buy clothes, have supper, buy food and watch movies there.  Also, when festival comes, it’ll have some interesting activities, such as opera and parade.  It’s very…",50
"When I visited there I had no idea, but when entered it was amazing. Room given was awesome, beautiful with all the comforts one can think of...food, shopping, leisure all came under one roof. Facility for kids, shows, gondola.... And the list is onnnnnn!!!!",50
"The hotel is decorated with elegant and classy atmosphere. Both the room and the lobby are fascinating. The customer relationship team is kind enough to decorate our room for our honeymoon trip although it's not at the first day when we step into our room. Besides that, a sweet mystery gift for us and it's lovely.  While on things to improve, the check-in process should be simplified although we understand that the hotel is always overwhelmed with guests. however, personally I don't agreed with the set check in time as 1pm or even later due to room availability. The guest should have given the chance to check in first and have a courtesy call right after the room ready but not to ask us to wait until the check-in counter open and queue again. Though, we have a great memory with…",40
"It is an absolutely huge hotel, with shops restaurants it is like a small village in itself.  I had a junior suite, the room was huge. A fantastic sized bedroom. A nice seating area to enjoy.  The bathroom was luxurious and just what I needed and wanted. The only shame was I was not there long enough to enjoy it fully.  There are many extras the hotel staff will do to make your stay more comfortable.",50
"As is well known about the majestic Venetian Hotel - Its simply Grandeur Personified...beautiful Lobbies, Great Height...The Grand Canal Shoppes, So many eateries and yes the rooms...they are all suite rooms !! Amazing experience when I was here in End of Feb 2016.",50
"Was an amazing luxurious holiday  wowsome huuuuge beautiful hotel , everything  was perfect and the entire staff was helpful n courteous .will go back to Venetian anytime.our Royal suite was fabulous in room dining was a treat service was impeccable.",50
Love this place! Best place on the strip! Amazing rooms with great style. Friendly staff. Rooms are large beds are amazing! Only downfall is you pay for Internet. Free valet parking! Amazing restaurants! Casino is great! Lots to choose from. Table games on holidays get a lil expensive but worth it. ,40
We chose The Venetian to celebrate my friend's birthday. The room is spacious and fabulous. The bed is super comfy. The hotel has everything you need. Love the complimentary cake!  ห้องกว้างมากกกกกก เตียงนุ่ม หมอนนอนสบาย wifi ฟรี ทางโรงแรมเตรียมเค้กวันเกิดให้ด้วยค่ะ หลังจากเช็คเอ้าท์ก็มีบริการฝากกระเป๋าได้ฟรี มีพนักงานคอยดูแลตลอด,50
"I took mom and cousin there as a birthday treat for my mom's 70th birthday and she was impressed by the massive rooms. The check in counter was also very considerate. The nice lady (Kelly, I think) delayed our check out time from 11 am to 1 pm, seeing that I was with my mom. It was a very memorable trip for her and I appreciate the gesture from the staff. ",50
"Added some extra U's to actually show the size of the hotel. Being divided into North/South etc wings, it's just showcases it's sheer size. I am still amazed by how this place is managed and run. The hotel is situated on Cotai strip (new area/territory) which is joined by a sea link with remaining Macau.  There is not much around except for posh hotels and Casinos.Hotel staff is unexpectedly prompt. Considering it's size i expected delay's but it was otherwise. Checking took us around 30 mins due to huge lines.  Coming to the hote, It's is one of best in Macau and rooms are all suites. Once enter the lobby, you realize the luxury.  Rooms are very spacious with separate living and sleeping areas. Washrooms have a walkin concept and are very spacious.  We stayed in south wing…",50
"Undertook a 2 day trip to Macau with friends in Feb. The weather was great with a light chill and a bit of rain. The Venetian is a very large hotel and if one doesn't want to step out, it provides all possible facilities inside the hotel including a well appointed mall for shopping and a food court. The checkin experience was not so great as had to wait for an hour to get a room.For the size of the hotel that the Venetian is, one would think that they could make the initial checkin process a lot faster. The complimentary bus pick up from the airport is very efficient and the service at the hotel in terms of Housekeeping and Room Service is amazingly good. The rooms are one of the largest I have seen and are good for hosting a small impromptu get together.",40
"WOW! thats the normal standard reaction from the time you enter the hotel till the time you leave... and you never want to leave:) We were in a large super luxurious suite with a stunning view from the 23rd floor which overlooked the Macau tower not far away.  The check in process took awhile and there is no seating anywhere in the lobby so its a bit tiresome but one can wander into the casino or any of the restos around to get oriented with the sprawling layout.  Yukti and Bea who attended to us were patient and detailed. Its very difficult not to have a good time with the free coupons and range of restos, food court, venice look-alike shopping mall, and the casino!  you dont need to step out doors as you roam around the hotel complexes via the interconnected passages which are…",50
"The hotel itself has plenty of interesting features and activities to offer; from the expansive casino, endless shops and restaurants, to huge art replicas, gondola ride, and even a variety of city tours. We, however didnt like the rooms that much. We booked two, and even if they were huge, they smelled stuffy with some hint of cigarette smoke in the air. The rooms also were a bit too dark, and somber-looking in spite of the gilding, and the table and couch were begging to be cleaned. We didnt need much from customer service so thats still good customer service Id surmise for having already anticipated the needs of their guests.",40
"Impressive hotel. Thousands of shops within the hotel you don't even have to leave. We stayed in a suite very big including lounge area. Very large bathroom. You would think for the amount of money you are paying they would have flat screen tvs. The room had those large tv units that was disappointing. Great food court on level 3 of the hotel lots of choices from Chinese, Vietnamese, Indian, Italian cuisine at reasonable prices. Overall very beautiful hotel. ",50
When talking of Venetian oh..it is Grand. Almost everything you will find it here. Very large Casino more then 500 tables. It is quite expensive as compared to some other ones in Macau. Atmosphere is electric. Definitely a place to go even not staying must go as a tourist to see the beauty. ,50
"For one night in Macao, the Venetian was where we wanted to be. For better or worse, in those (many) walls we stayed too since the only things around it are other hotel/casino resorts. No matter, we walked miles around the shopping area in faux Venetian style. Played at sic bo and luxuriously strolled around our massive suite while wearing our Venetian robes. Although we didn't win enough to afford anything in the expensive shopping areas, we had a great time feeling like we *could* have... maybe... if only we'd bet differently. Nice getaway from Hong Kong.",40
This property by far has been the hugest I have ever been and stayed in. During my 3 days stay in Macau I just happened to venture out just once to the macau tower for bungee jumping. This place practially has everything. A really crazy big and mean shopping mall that doesn't let you realise what time it is due to the awesome blue sky coloured roof that make u feel its day any time. Casinos are expensive as compared to others but huge. large and infinite eating options.  The only problem is the check in and check out time. Also they don't carry your luggage to and from your room. And shuttles are hard to catch due to sheer amount of crowd,40
"Ahh this hotel is simply grand. Very huge with one of he biggest casino, suite rooms,shopping mall,eating joints. You name it & this place has it all. The rooms are fabulous,spacious,decor is superb, the washroom is big. for sure it is worth the splurge.The interiors are like venice & you will always feel there is day inside.Check in will require time coz of the big hotel & lot of rush.",50
Amazingly beautiful. We were upgraded to a Bella Suite facing Cotai Strip which was marvelous. I was able to take a wonderful picture of the strip. The room is as grand as the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas. Hotel staff from reception to room service were wonderful; they all greet you with a smile. I was charmed by the room and didn't want to leave it.,50
"If you're not traveling with a tight budget, then go for The Venetian in Macao. Everything here is huge, and very luxurious - from the lobby, to the rooms, to the casino. You will love the mall, the restaurants, and of course the gondola ride.",50
"We stayed for  2 nights in Macau and preferred to stay 1 night in Venetaian as it help you to explore this property in best way. It has very big casino, Gondola ride, big brands shop, 30 stylish restaurant, free wifi, big size room & bathroom  although which require renovation.  It is actually a very big property so it is suggestable to wear comfortable foot wear.  Food court is very large and you can get good options in reasonable price.  I personally love the artificially cloud view in food court.  If you are planning to stay for more than one day I would suggest you to stay in other part of city where you explore Senada square, Macau Tower, other nice hotels I.e MGM, Lisboa, Wynn etc.",40
"perfect place for holiday there are many other activities apart from hotel and casino ,and in the evening there are shows below the hotel. Its the largest and best  hotel in macau.And it has the largest casino in the world",50
This place is awesome! I am thrilled how this place looks like Venice. They have a Gondola and a river in the middle of the mall. The artificial sky looks real. Lots of shops and food. Free shuttle from the ferry terminal and back. I will have to take my family here soon.,50
"Not sure though, but the staffs said this is the largest casino in the world. They have a lot of shops and huge space allotted for the Casino. As I don't gamble, the Casino was noting special.  They have a indoor boat ride (Gondola ride), that gives the feel of Venice. There are four canals, you can take a ride from any one of them. The boatman would sing for you when you take the ride that takes you through the pseudo Venice with the blue sky.  Here again, use the Klook app and save money. And avoid weekends and holidays.",50
Amazing hotel with lifetime experience. Offers all kind of facilities within the hotel premises. Staff was very courteous . Have large number of shops of best brands in this world. The casino was huge with all kind of games available. Win there is a big plus.,50
"I have been to Macau several times but haven't stayed at The Venetian so when I planned my trip to Macau last January, I decided to finally try this hotel.  We stayed at the Bella Suite with 2 Queen beds.  The room is huge with a nice living area where you can lounge, have a snack and watch TV comfortably.  However, eventhough we booked a non-smoking room, we can still smell cigarette smoke and had to ask the staff to spray some air freshener.  You can also see some signs of wear and tear like thinning carpet, scratched table and light stains on wall.  The hotel is humongous and you have numerous dining choices but I thoroughly enjoy the food court which has a good variety of food offerings. Shopping is also great as there are great number of shops (my favorites are Sasa,…",40
"We visit Macau and Hong Kong together.  This resort is amazing and the room had a superb view.  It's  huge property so one needs time to explore this place.  We stayed for one night only but fell in love with this place.  Our room was base category room but our room was specious nice and clean.  Even the bathroom was very good.     Resort tip - Put on your walking shoes and go explore this place,  very beautiful.  Nice shops and casino within the resort......basically it's all-in-one! ",50
"Still extremely good value, considering price, room size, shops, facilities. Sure you could upgrade to a lot swisher, newer hotels, that would cost twice to three times as much, but if you're prepared to overlook the need for a lick of paint, tired carpet, old tv's (nothing to watch anyway!), the money you save is better spent on eating out and shopping. All the best hotels and casinos are a 30 min walk of each other. Food and drink is not cheap here, so a 30 min walk away, you can find a local supermarket, stock up on cheap beer, snacks etc, and restock your mini bar. That can save you big dollars too. You really only need 2 full days here to soak it all in. More possibly in warmer months, if you want to lounge around the pool and play golf?",40
"We been here to celebrate my partner's birthday. We are impressed the hotel send us compliment of a birthday cake with name written and a greeting birthday card.   Room is spacious, nice and clean . We got a view facing the river and airport.  Compound itself is huge, with casinos, shops and restaurant.  We enjoyed our stay.",50
Visited this place with my husband last month .Beautiful and spacious rooms and bath. The best shopping experience in macao i would rate it better than hongkong also. In terms of pricing. Loads of walking so make sure youre in comfy shoes. The buffet was a good spread to try out locsl specialities . Staff friendly and helpful.. Overall a worth its stay . Think if u do 3nights the deals better with a return trip to hongkong and some shopping discount. We didnt have the time so stayed for 2 nights. ,40
"We stayed with our family in hotel to celebrate my husband’s birthday. We really appreciated for the birthday complimentary.   We stayed in a large suite with an outside garden, Verona Suite, 2 double beds, 2 washrooms, a dining table with 5 chairs and a large living room. Our kids were happy that they can run around here.   The staff was exceptional to solve all of our problems, really appreciate it. We had a memorable holiday here. Definitely a recommend hotel to stay in Macau with the family.",50
"We stayed with our family in this hotel from 7th Jan and checked out on 10th Jan 2016. For 2 rooms and 3 nights we paid 1100 USD inclusive of Fee BF. I was told this is cheap as per going Macao rates as the Venetian subsides the rates from their Casino earnings. Well Reading other comments about this Resort I am not too sure about it. Nice place, located inside a Mall. The name Venetian has been justified by making a Canal with shops on both sides. They have even put a Gondola in the canal to make it look realistic. BF is as good as a nice Brunch. We enjoyed our stay here. No complaints.",40
"You will find your hotel room in a large and very busy combination of casino, shopping mall, food court and more ... as long as you have your floor plan at hand. The rooms itself are great and as well the pool area is. The rest is not very personal and quite kitchy (including an indoor ""canale grande"" with singing gondoliers - but at least all with great voices!).  If you are primarily here for gambling you probably won't have to leave the premises at all. What makes sense, because there (in Cotai) is nothing around (except a chinese style Venetian stage setting and other hotels or casinos). It takes a 15 minute taxi ride to get to the historical Macao downtown.  Definitely a recommendable hotel, but depending on your interest there might be more appropriate places to stay in…",40
"Nice hotel with all of the facilities inside. Great view from my room, thanks for the honeymoon complimentary at that time, really appreciate it. =)  Plenty of choices for the food in the foodcourt, overall I enjoyed my last visit. I've came here 2 times and all very memorable for me. Just one thing need to be improve, the hospitality of security staff, need more smiling than the others. But for the FO, HK, Bellboy, Doorman, it was perfect !",50
"We stayed at The Venetian in Macao back in Nov 2015 whilst there for a friends Wedding.  I must say, it wasn't terrible but it wasn't amazing either.  Its a bit of a ""rabbit warren"" so be prepared to do lots of walking and getting lost!  I thought the hotel was a little outdated in decor... The first room we were given absolutely stank and had a terrible view!!!! It must have been a former smoking room.  After advising the check in counter of this, they offered to move us to another room.  The inspected approx 5 rooms to only which 1 was ok (not smelly).  This room was much better and had a great view!  The Hotel is very focused on gambling rather than hotel guest.  You cant escape the Casino (which we thought didn't offer as many choices compared to machines etc in Australia)…",40
"Venetian is probably the best hotel in Macau. Lived upto its reputation. We had a memorable holiday. Myself and wife stayed in a Deluxe Suite on 14th floor. Luxurious rooms, very spacious, excellent furniture and furnishings. Excellent beds and pillows. Great dressing room, bath, etc. Very neat and clean. Free Wi-Fi. Breathtaking view of Galaxy hotel outside the window at night. Kettle in room with tea & coffee facility. Excellent service. Casino. Replica of Venice outside and inside hotel. One can even enjoy Gandola ride in canal above casino. Lot of shopping facilities for a wide range of customers.",50
It was a pleasant stay. The staff was very cordial. Baghya sree at reception was extremely helpful in getting my room confirmation for the second day despite the challenges of having a marriage party staying  Bhagya sree at reception was exceptional. She helped me secure the room for second days stay and also was very courteous. She personally went to cake shop when we ordered for the cake. Did help us out for selecting the cake and got the booking done for u,40
"the  venetians is the landmark in Macau city its a must go place .the best party is the ultra luxury rooms and casino.Everything is huge in this hotel. The building, the casino and the Venetian shopping centre .food quality was excellent with too much of variety there were like 200 people dinning at the same time without any difficulties.",50
"It is the true definition of Luxury. Excellent rooms, best service, everything is impeccable and it is value of money.  It is Kings type Royal experience with the luxury in every bit of it. Room sizes are great... Furnishing is Royal.",50
"Everything is huge in this hotel. The building, the casino and the Venetian shopping centre. We went there to see the shopping centre, it's like Venice, but then inside. Same buildings, bleu sky with some clouds, canals with gondola's for a ride. And shops, shops, shops, ... I never saw so many shops on the same floor with so many people shopping. Mainly Chinese (95%, because Macau is tax free and cheaper then China) and some rich Indians...",40
"This huge hotel runs smoothly from arrival at the ferry terminal till departure.  The rooms are a split level with king size bed and separate lounge.  Nice view of some of the other hotels on the Cotai strip.  The casino looks nice and often busy but very high stakes,higher then Vegas!  Lots of shops and restaurants throughout the resort and sister hotels.  All quite expensive but of good quality.  ",50
Accessible by free bus from ferry terminals. Tourists who do not want to play in casinos and just want to look around are very much welcome. Expensive shops and restaurants. Must visit the gondola rides.,50
"The Venetian Macau Resort is one of the most interesting entertainment venues in Macau. In addition to being a popular place for hotel stays and having one of the largest casino floors in the world, there is quite a bit to do/see here for visitors.   A favourite is the indoor Venetian style Canal which are located on the second floor. Visitors can take gondola rides along the canal or simply walk along the Venetian themed walkways, enjoying the Shoppes at Venetian Canal, eateries, small bridge crossings and Disney like scenes of Venice. Sure, it is quite touristy but who cares, it is still a fun place to see.  A favourite stop of mine on the Canal is the Lord Stow's bakery. Here you can try a local food favourite, the Portuguese style egg tarts that are quite famous here in…",40
"Very very nice from receptionist to room assistants.  Much appreciated that they fulfilled to all my requests and also let us have extra happiness even on toilet stuff.  Also, there is an express check-out very convenient !!",50
"Stay at Venetian (1 night of 7th Feb.2016) is really an awesome experience. Except internet access issue in casino area, it was most memorable experience of my life. I wish to visit Macau again and will stay in Venetian.   I have been provided suite at North Wing but lower floor (9th) due to unavailability of suites, but still it was nice experience. There are 2 televisions provided in suite with most of the necessary channels including cartoon network with which my kid was happy. Suite was quite big enough when compared to other hotels/resorts in HongKong. There was 2 separate areas in suite itself for Bed and living.   Minibar is also having a lot of variety which can be used with charges.  Main point is that, at the time of check-in, they offered us both options to take one…",40
"The hotel is huge and luxury. It is the first time we have to check the hotel map sometimes at the first 2 days of the past few years travelling experiences. The room was nice, polished and the staffs were helpful, friendly and trained. Do not miss out the shopping area and Gondola rides of 3rd floor, The buildings and the sky were impressive. There is a shuttle bus station can take you to different attractions in Macau for free just across the main road. Only thing I complain is there are no any mini supermarket or 7-11 in this hotel or outside around the hotel. It felt like a movie call ""The Truman Show"". Everything is good but controlled. It is not convenient that you cant buy any snack or beer at the midnight. It made us have to choose to pay for the mini bar in the room or…",40
"My husband and our friends stay in Venitian for two nights,Jan5,2016.Room is huge,very beautiful,we're like king and queen.Every holiday we always visit Las vegas and I can tell that Venetian Macau is bigger than Las Vegas.",50
Best in macau. Awosome. Specially casino. Resort. Markets. Games. Pool location.  Staff performance. Room services food quality all services are very good i think venetian number 1 ranking in macau. Macau venetian best for holidays,50
"We stayed in the Bella suite with a 2 queen size beds and a living area, both area had big TVs. With fast WiFi a gorgeous Bathroom, nice pool and touring around make somewhat feels like youre in Venice, with the gondolas and people in costumes often on the sidewalks.",50
"My wife and I traveled to Macau for our silver wedding anniversary and chose The Venetian Macau for our stay. The total experience was grand! The rate we got was preferential (very affordable), plus the suite given to us was excellent for a honeymooning couple. Conveniently situated among the ""Macau strip"" of other 5-star hotels and casinos, we simply leisurely walked to all the nearby dining places. Probably, the only downside was that many people were always booked there. I guess that's how popular the hotel is.",50
"Bigger and more interesting than the Venetian in Vegas, the food court features western as well as Asia selections, located on the Cotai strip with a dozen other new Casinos within a short walk, gambling rules are different here so it takes a little getting used to.",40
The stay at Venetian Macau was very good The breakfast and dinner at Cafe Deco was nice The breakfast had many vegetarian items which was a pleasant surprise The room we stayed was very comfortable and a great view of the lighted Galaxy hotel The staff is very helpful and courteous,40
"The hotel is truly classy.  It has something for everyone - casinos, shopping, theater, food - you name it, they have it.  The staff very helpful and eager to help and make you feel comfortable.  We attended the House of Dancing Water - which is a one of a kind show - it is a must see if you are in Macau.  The set was amazing and the show was enchanting, entertaining, kept us on edge.",40
"We stayed at the Venetian for 3 nights in a suite. The room was spacious with a good view especially at night. We loved the pool and the kids playground. However, the hotel is very big so we have to walk a long way to get to our room from the lobby and all other amenities.",40
"Amazing hotel, amazing view especially at night. If you are not checked in, you can leave your bags in the baggage counter for only HKD10 per bag. They also have free bus services going to the airport. They also have an affordable food court on the 3rd level of the hotel casino. You cannot smoke in the casino, they have a designated smoking area. On the 3rd level, you can ride the gondola.",50
"Yes! The rooms and staff are perfect!  When we initially booked for a Smoker room and found out that the cigarette smoke can still be smelled from the room (we thought that it was just worse in the hallway) , we requested for a room changed and they immediately accommodated and provided a new room (in no time)! The rooms are classy (actually classy from the moment you entered the hotel). We were in awe.   Nice place and experience.",50
"Wonderful ambience.Very cooperative staff and well maintained hotel.Wide range of shopping options,free transport within city sight seeing points.Good casino options for Gamblers.Bell Boy faciliy very nice.",50
I love The Venetian Macao. You can have a lot of shopping and dining choices. They have entertainment too. Your family will surely enjoy this place. I really enjoyed my stay and I'll definitely come back.,50
Venetian is simply huge. It was difficult to cover the premises in couple of days. Rooms are stylish and large. Breakfast was excellent. Lovely place to stay and shop. More then 300 shops. The casino is lively and full of people even on week days,50
"Amazingly well designed hotel. Lots of entertainment, casinos, shopping centers and your very own venetian style gondola ride. Do take the ride! The hotel rooms are beautiful and you need atleast 2 nights here to enjoy the hotel itself. The breakfast buffet was also sumptuous.",50
"The venetian is really a place where everything is larger than life... You will have a grand time taking pictures, going shopping and even try your hand in playing at the casino. If you like these activities then you will have a good time there but for somebody who loves outdoors then probably just like me this will not be your cup of tea :-).",40
"I really like it here. Been staying here two times.   The room is really spacious, luxurious, clean. and super comfortable. The toilet is not being neglected too. It is really bright and very big.  It has one bathtub and one standing showering space. there is two sinks. Besides, there is a separate make up table and chair. Beautiful.  The Venetian is massive, not easy from one place to another, especially you have kids with you as unable to cross casino, which the shortest route.  Great transportation access to everywhere, other casino or even the city central.  Besides, in Venetian, you could get the best Portuguese tart. Lord stow. Yum!!  Besides, they is lot of facilities. Just go to explore.  The BEST hotel i ever stay in. LOVE it.",40
"Stayed for 3 nights and still i could not cover the full hotel..  24x7 the place is lively. We got an upgraded room, although the size was same but the view was much better after the upgrade.  Rooms beyond 24 floors offer better view. The lifts operate at a high speed.   Will definately stay again at this property.",50
This is our second stay at this great hotel and was just as good as the first time.  We went with friends and family and it was good to see their enjoyment of the hotel.  You certainly still need a map to get around the vast hotel but there is so much to see in this huge area.  There is so many places to eat and shop - the food court has so much variety and the prices are good.  Our room was lovely - last time we stayed we were upgraded to a suite - still was not disappointed as I don't think there is a bad room in the whole place.  I recommend that you check your booking before arrival even if you booked through a travel agent - we had problems with check in but they sorted that out within 4 hours.  Enjoy!,50
"Had been there with a casual visit to the casino, the exterior & interiors are par excellence. Inside its 24X7 casino gambling area. Its a stylish place to spend time & money.Be careful of the gate where you enter & exit, also do not leave children unattended",50
"This hotel is huge. You could stay for a week and never go outside. Being in Macau, it has casinos. But even if you didn't play, there are shopping centre, restaurants, shows, amenities, facilities, and stuff to do inside the hotel. The room is spacious and felt very luxurious. I only stayed for a day since it was a business trip. But on leisure trip some other time, it better be longer.",50
Visited as part of a tour and we were dumb struck by the grandure of this place. It is truly an awesome building with the need of a map to negotiate the place. St Marks square is an interesting but very busy place to visit.,40
Rich architechture. Super big casino n shopping place. But only visit if u gamble or do shopping otherwise there is nothing for you. A great gandola experience Little venice. Lovely roof  I saw very less foreigners there i dont know why.  ,40
"great hotel, with amazing view. plus you can walk around the hotel and see or even play casino. they also have many stores and restaurants inside the grand shoppe. Also, you can feel a little aura of venice with the gondola.",50
"everything in here is large, the casino, the hotel, buildings.. you kinda need 3-4 hours to experience the mall and the casino. first of all, don't miss the venetian style mall on 3rd floor. a bunch of stores with artificial river and boat. try the boat, cost around MOP 130, and it'll take you circling the mall while singing.. and try your luck by playing the casino a while.. who knows you will double your money.. :D",50
"The Venetian is classy and impressive from the moment you see the grand building structure from the main road, it sits there prouder than all the other buildings. This resembles the Venice water-city in Italy, nowhere else in Asia will you find the finest in luxury suites, world-class shopping, sensational entertainment and irresistible dining- all under one roof. It has become a certified attraction drawer in Macau from that it became open to the public-inside the hotel you will mostly find Rich Chinese Mainlander’s and some Asian’s. Besides, It has become one of the biggest landmarks for gamblers throughout Asia. The Venetian includes gambling, retail, exhibition, conference, sports and theatrical facilities, that creates an integrated resort experience for visitors. The main…",40
"This is my second time in Macau, and again we booked a bella suite. This time, we were given a room with a better view and closer to the elevator. The breakfast is still the same, I wish they could've changed it a bit from last year.   I requested for a late check out at 1pm, but surprisingly our key card didn't worked after 11am, which is so disappointing. We had to call a housekeeping to assist us but they keep on existing to try the key card again. We wasted about 20-30 minutes of the time figuring out what to do.",40
"I stayed at Bella Suites for 1 night, The room is big,beautiful and clean .It has 2 Queen bed which  very comfortable, and the Bath room is very spacious . For 1 day I don't have enough time to explore the Venetian. What I love about this hotel are express check in and check out service ,free shuttle bus to many locations",40
"I went here near the beginning of 2015. In terms of design, innovation and creativity goes, it is what amazed me. Very different and has that 'special' factor to it that stands out from what I've experienced before at other hotels. It has everything you need during your stay and surely left me as a satisfied guest. ",50
"This was my first International Trip & First International hotel stay .... So lucky that i stayed at Venetian ... Lovely Hotel ... Beautiful rooms, i must say what a bathroom ;) .. Cafe deko food ... all floors so decorative ... canal cruise.... lots n lots o things to write . A person must visit Venetian if going Macau , its like a sightseeing pont.",50
"Right from the entrance you will be short of words to describe the beauty of this hotel. we got express check-in done and hence didn't have to stand in ques for checking-In. The rooms are beautiful, we stayed at Bella Suite and it was worth the price spent on it. The size of the rooms was more than one could ask for. though the property is huge but the in room services were quick and upto mark.  the hotel provides free shuttle to go around incase if you dont want to spend on taxi.  the hotel has amazing food court and also the restaurants were good. we tried the Italian & Indian restaurant were good but expensive.      the only issue is from tourist attraction point it is a bit far, as in one will have to travel a bit to see around the city.  Dont forget to carry on umbrella.",50
"We went to Venetian just for a night and booked a royal suite. (You can book the Bella suite if traveling with kids, it has 2 queen beds) It has a sitting area and bedroom area just divided by a railing (with a TV in both). Because of which it only felt like a big room. For those who don't know this hotel only has suites. The interiors are perfect you can see no regular wear and tear. The room has all the basic amenities- iron and board, coffee maker, hair dryer Etc. And has amazing stuff in the mini bar. Oh and a wonderfully planned bathroom. Huge!! With 2 basins(that's a plus for me) a separate area for shower, tub, toilet and a dressing table. And it is stocked with all the things you could need. I really liked the sewing kit. The king size bed was a huge California king size…",40
"Staying in Venetian will keep you happily entertained and engaged for 2 days and 2 nights atleast. With exciting shows and events, interesting activities like the gondola ride, shopping and ofcourse the mighty Casino! Play to your hearts desire in the casino while getting pampered by champagne,shop till you drop, eat brilliant assortments and variety of cuisines and watch amazing shows. It can be a little heavy on your pocket specially in the Casino where Chinese ladies will give you a hard run for your moneyyss. ",50
Stayed in this beautiful hotel in April 2015 with office colleagues. Very beautiful rooms n view from room. Casino at ground floor is so large that one can lost in this place. All types of breakfast available with all options. We had a group check in but it was very quick n fast thanks to hotel staff. Food at their restaurant was very delicious. Gondola rides available inside hotel only. There is shopping mall also in this hotel. Over all cool place n nice stay.  ,50
I have never seen such a massive hotel in my life. The room was perfect. Facilities were amazing but it looks more like a very crowded city in its interior. There were very large streets full of shops and restaurants everywhere. The Casino was pretty impressive. Too many people.,40
"We always stay at the Venetian Macau during our visits to Macau.  All rooms are suite rooms and if you wait for their promo rates, you can get a huge room for only hkd 1200. The only downside is that the rooms are a bit old by now and may soon need a renovation. The beds and linens are very comfortable and guarantees a good night's sleep.   6 elevators are in operation so waiting time is short.  The mall has a wide variety of stores for every age group and budget. There is a wide selection of signature to mid range stores. There are bridgeways connecting the Venetian mall to the 4 seasons mall and the Cotai Strip malls so you do not need to walk outdoors to access these other malls.  The food court offers budget meals from Chinese (congee, noodles, dim sum) to International…",40
The hotel is huge n like a city in itself. The staff is excellent namely sherin who took our checkin n Zhanna who was in constant touch with me to make the hotel arrangements . Thanks a lot . Must also visit the casino n the gandola ride. The rooms r nice n spacious n so are the housekeeping staff. There were free drinks at the casino tables however were very disappointed with the servers and their rude behavior. Overall an amazing place to stay ,50
It was our first time to visit Macao and staying at the Venetian was an excellent choice. Staff was very polite while doing the check-in despite a guest who was behind me asking how long does he still have to wait plus other questions considering I was still talking to the staff.  Some guest just have no manners but the well trained staff was in my opinion quite composed and maintained a smiling face!  We were offered free fast speed internet for the room though we didn't make use of it since the general free wifi is pretty good. This hotel resort is a huge complex that offers a one stop shop.  It simply has everything...huge choices of shopping and dining experience. We visited other hotels in Macau and believe Venetian offers a complete package which others would find…,50
The room was perfect and its worth the price. I had a 30% discount since I did my reservation 14 days before the actual date of stay. Our stay is worth it.. The staffs are friendly and can speak in english so we don't have problem with the communication. I will surely go back to Macau and stay at Venetian hotel :),50
"The reception staff is friendly and detailed. Although there is a queue at the check-in, the staff will serve mineral water and some mints. As we are celebrating our anniversary, the management surprised us with the room decorated with rose petals. In the evening, they even brought us a delicious strawberry cake.  Rooms are well maintained... Kudos to the house keeping staff. Location of the hotel is definitely a plus point as all major brand shops are located within the vicinity. Free shuttle bus is available for guests to visit other hotels.",50
"didnt stay there(only daytrip)..nice, beautiful..i love it..nice place to shop and dine..the food court is not bad either..love the interior of this resort..its a huge place with casino..overall it is worth a visit.",40
"One piece of advise, to begin with. Travel light because you will be doing a lot of walking here! This place is huge and yet looks dwarfed by the hue crowds that throng every square inch. To get to the point, expect large rooms with larger bathrooms, retail outlets ranging from top notch to the mid levels, a food court, tons of restaurants - Imperial Dim Sum being my fave, some bars - in fact an irish pub and a loungy Bellini. Venetian really has it all. Did I mention Gondola rides? And to top it, juts when I thought I would miss my ferry ride back thanks to long check out queues, come along a gentleman called Sherin, who checked us out seamlessly in quick time.",50
"lobby was magical and mesmerising . we were in awe seeing it . Huge suite rooms , beautiful decor .shops so many and also had gondola rides besides it. Casino was so HUGE , we kept walking and walking .",50
what a pace!! everything under the roof.. luxury at its best.. Had a wonderful stay.. the casinos were worth the visit.. everything is lavish.. the suite was extravagant and service was superb.. worth every penny!!,50
A completely out of the world experience. Simply amazing. Perfect stay. We stayed in a royal suite at the 33rd floor. What a beautiful view outside. Hotel is huge with casinos and a big shopping paradise inside. Also one can experience the Gandola ride which is worth enjoying. Big rooms. Courteous staff. Very nice n tasty food with many varieties being vegetarian or non vegetarian.,50
"Having a visit their is like living a dream the foods are free.. Friendly staff.. Staying at their hotel is expensive but very reasonable. Inside, there is a canal where u can go boating around the casino.. It is a wonderful experience staying there.",50
"Remember this hotel is crazy busy! Lots of ttourist coming in to view the Grand Canal and tthe shopping area. I must say itt was magnificent. We stayed at the hotel in the Rialto Suite. whilst the room was enormous, it was not of quality and design was not well thought through. Good service from all that worked there, however, the space of the room could have been utilised and designed to be more guest friendly. Otherwise good hotel and well priced for the location. Great service from the Bell boys again and housekeeping is good standard.",40
"We were a group of 10 friends and had booked 3 suites. The only forgetful experience was the journey from ferry terminus to Venetian in their bus - where the driver and bus staff were pretty rude, and during the check-in where we had to literally wait for 2 hrs (it was between Christmas and New Year). But after that, it was smooth sailing. Suites were expansive, hotel was grand, casino - intriguing. Food was exceptionally good (we tried Indian, and it was surprisingly delicikus). In food court, be ready with cash as sometimes they don't accept cards. The speciality restaurants serve some super dishes, do try Tao for sure. Also Golden Peacock (book in advance). The hotel has an express checkout that was really helpful.",40
"The venetian has amazing building, decoration, rooms are romantic, has character, the venice riserside so romantic and unforgetable. The staffs are very professional and welcome. I love has been there... Thanks venetian Oh yeah, all of my photos are great because of venetian design so wonderfull and artistics",50
It was my uncle's birthday and the Receptionist was kind enough to offer complimentary upgrade and a birthday cake as a surprise. Room was very spacious and everything was wonderful! My uncle and and aunt were both very happy with this trip.,50
"Queue of about 70 to 80 people at check in counter but extra staff was called in to quickly clear the queue. Front desk staff Elaine Kwan deserved mentioning as she remember in details all my requirements. Housekeeping very efficient. Room is spacious with two queen size bed and also if needed a couch can be turned into a sofa bed. It could accommodate up to five adults (Asia size) comfortably. Booked online for free Wifi. Free shuttle bus terminal located within the hotel, plenty of shuttle services to go to other casino and ferry terminal. Unfortunately no shuttle service to Senado Square.",40
"We flight to HK and stay in HK for two nights then wen to Macao. It's convenience to take the ferry from HK to Macau and there is a free shuttle bus waiting outside the ferry terminal when we arrived. It's a nice place that we arrived at the hotel, I think it's main lobby, the white guy who checked in us from receptionist was quite nice and friendly, his name is Max or Mac. We asked the information desk and the manager explain to us very detail about what we asked, his name is Ray Chen or Ray Chan. Once we arrived our room, it's amazing big but the TV is very old and there is dust on the desk and also on the TV control, I don't know how many days it haven't been clean. overview, it's good but need to change the old facilities.",40
"This is the Grandest hotel I have ever seen and same was the reaction of the group i was travelling with. This Hotel is Big, Beautiful and very well maintained. Every thing about this hotel is GRAND, the Lobby is huge you get tired walking around, Casino so so big and vast , so many chandeliers and all of them beautiful and large, escalators are tall, Rooms are big almost like a apartment, large shopping mall, and imagine a canal inside a hotel.   It has very artistically created a small replica of Vanice. Entire shopping mall has artificial sky and it is so very well done that in day one would not realize that it is artificial. There is a small canal in hotel which offers Golconda ride over it(Boat ride), the lady riding the boat was dressed in Italian sailors attire and she…",50
"The room is spacious, free wifi, very clean and well presented. The location is good and easy access to not just the Venetian shopping mail, but also the others such Four Seasons and City of Dreams.  Free transfer also from / to TurboJet Terminal and checkout process is quick and easy. The only improvement opportunity is the check-in, i.e. a bit slow.",40
"i really like room design here like Venice style , Big size with suite , comfortable , great stay for family , well maintenance , Stay here with everything in Venetian many shops good for shopping traveler , Variety of dining here you can find everything , Free wifi all area ,",50
"I made this trip because my mother wanted to see the new Macau since the last time she visited was almost 40 years ago. Also my relatives told me about their wonderful experience at the Venetian, so I booked us there. We were not disappointed. The room was large and luxurious as advertised and room service was the best I ever experienced in any hotel, local or international. Best of all was access to the food court for our meals and the rest of the mall for our shopping and entertainment.",50
"It was an absolutely amazing hotel and stay,  it will make you feel like you are in venice/europe! Beautiful interiors and a lot of activities restaurants and shops to keep you busy! The casino there is the heart of the hotel which is busy 24 7! When in macao it is a must go! ",50
an excellent location with really five star attractions. Lots of entertainment for entire families to enjoy. My three days with my wife were fully occupied. Macau has some interesting history.access to other hotels and adjoining casinos. cinemas for chilling out and daytrips that can be organised through the concierge.,50
"We stayed in The Royal Suite for 2 nights in the month of December.   The Venetian Macau is a gorgeous looking hotel. It's got an awesome shopping mall within it. Beautifully constructed and definitely not be missed if you're in Macau.   The Casino is large and is a fun place to hang out.   I insisted for a room on a higher floor- 34th Floor. And boy I sure wasn't disappointed. A brilliant view of the city indeed!   The room was large and spacious. The bed was mighty comfortable. The Royal suite is divided into two sections- a bedroom and an extended portion consisting of the drawing room. The suite sure felt amply spacious.   The bath area was pretty nice too. Loved the shower area!   There is complimentary Internet available. Though it could have been faster, I wouldn't…",40
"The hotel very grand and luxury. The room was broad and very clean. The bed was cozy, bland, and warm. Toilet very clean, nice and, tidy. You can shopping at the hotel and eat famous egg tart ""Lord Stow"" at here. Famous place of this hotel is a reproduce of Venice. ",50
"We stayed here for one night in the beginning of January. The place is enormous. It has hundreds of shops, a casino and of course it's own man-made canals, complete with gondolas and singing drivers. It's so big, it has it's own map, which you will definitely need (I got lost a few times). The staff were very helpful and they have an express checkout option. We stayed in a royal coati view suite which was spacious and really nicely furnished. It has a separate living area, large window and a giant bathroom. The bed was really comfortable and the water pressure in the shower was good.",50
"I always wanted to stay in this hotel when I visited Macau. We stayed here for 3 nights. The hotel was very beautiful with the lovely artworks on ceilings (nice for taking photos). The room seemed a little bit dated from what I expected.  The reception and housekeepers were very pleasant - the housekeepers were very dedicated when cleaning bathrooms and beds. Hotel was accessible to many shops for shopping - spent a whole day shopping. Stayed in the North Suites, which was a bit difficult when going to the gym. They didn't have shuttle buses to the Peninsula which was a bit disappointing.  Overall, a nice experience. I recommend this hotel for first-time visitors to Macau. However, for my next visit, I would probably stay in a more quiet hotel.",40
"The Venetian offered a variety of indoor entertainment, you wouldn't need to go out for days. You can get a taste of Venice in this hotel, it even had an indoor canal and artificial sky! Conceptually, this was one of the best hotel I've been. ",50
A very popular hotel in Macau. So you have to wait for a long time while checking in. But this is not a big problem. Candy and drinks are provided in the queue. The hotel looks just like the one in Las Vegas. And I have to say its room really has huge space. I will choose Venetian again for my next stay in Macau.,50
Stayed for 4 nights. All i can say that once i entered the room i dont feel going out from there. The room is so nice. Very clean and very big.   Place in Macau is more to site seeing. I went in Feb. so its kind of cold. Room service food is nice. Friendly staff.   All item is complete in the room. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻,50
"We stayed here for three days to celebrate New years eve. The Hotel is beautiful and picturesque. It was a family vacation so had booked two suites, unfortunately we could not have side by side rooms so instead we were given second suite on floor above. Thankfully the location of both suite was near to stairs, this made our movements easier. but both suits were really far from lift. The suit was beautiful and spacious. Beds were comfortable.  Service wise, it was really slow. Be it room service or any restaurant with in Hotel. Service was so slow in Indian restaurant i.e Golden Peacock that we never got our ordered food and something that we got took good half hour. I would say AVOID Golden Peacock. Breakfast again I was not very impressed with the service and food quality. It…",40
"This is such a great hotel - experience wise was really superb! If you are planning to go to Macau, The Venetian Macau is highly recommended.  They have exceeded our expectations. Staff service is really fast and efficient.. The hotel is so fragrant anywhere in the hotel you will smell its good aroma.",50

"Staying in the Venetian is a grand experience and there can be no doubt that this is one of the greatest hotels in the world. The scale of the hotel, the architecture and artwork are simply magnificent. That being said, there are some downsides to staying here:   1. It is terribly easy to get lost and casino security don't seem trained in helping guests with directions to their rooms.   2. Because the place is so huge, it feels almost like an airport when you are trying to check in or even eat breakfast. The staff however are great and even gave us an upgrade on checkin.   3. On the same note about size, you really don't feel special because you are just one of thousands of other guests.  In conclusion, staying at the Venetian was a unique and exciting experience, although not…",40
"Initially found it a lil expensive but the moment we entered the place, every penny was worth spending!!!! Jaw dropping ambiance n casino.  All suite hotel... even lowest category was one of the best rooms i've stayed in so far. Big beds! Big space! Big bathrooms! Amazing views!! Shopping vouchers n freebies! Free shuttles!!! Can't ask for more... Indian veg/non veg restaurant Peacock near the check in counter and Indian Spice in food court were truly a bliss. Mall was rather a city within the hotel whr u get anything n everything. Gandola ride is a trademark attraction of venetian hotels and is a must try!  Icing on cake are the live shows and concerts and parades that keep happenning in and around the hotel. I say if you r in Macau, you have to be in Venetian😊",50
"We stayed in the Venetian over the New Year for 3 nights and can say that we got good value for our money. While we expected more from the suites (rooms need updating - which is why I can't give full marks) we can say that we got good value for the price that we paid. We booked our stay through the hotel's website and chose the grand macao shopping experience where we got free daily breakfasts or lunch, a 1,500 MOP shopping/dining voucher, and free cotai water jet ferry tickets from Macao to HK Airport. All in all a very good deal. The choice of having breakfast or lunch is very convenient as we don't have to rush in the morning to have breakfast and the dining/shopping vouchers are very handy for dinners. Also while this is a very big hotel, the service is still excellent. We…",40
The room was expensive but I must say it was worth it. The room is spacious and the bathroom is really huge too. Larger than most HongKong hotel rooms.  The bed is the best I've had so far in a hotel room. Very luxurious.,40

"The venetian is totally overpriced for what it is, but then again, so is everything in macau, and that's all part of the game.  We splurged for my husband's 30th birthday, and I got the early bird discount, so it made up for it a bit. The room is a bit outdated, but probably bigger than our entire flat in HK! You definitely don't need to leave the hotel if you don't want to, as you have everything you would ever need at your fingertips, yes, even starbucks, phew!",40
"Fast and organize services in the reception area. The Royal Suite room is wonderful, i have nothing to say when it comes to the furniture, interior designs, the cleanliness and orderliness of the room.The Gondola ride is an awesome experience. No hassle check out because they have express check out and luggage service is fast too.",50
"The hotel is buzzing with revelers from everywhere, and is packed through out. Unlike other hotels on the strip, its giant wave of crowd wading in through the gates and it consists of massive shopping space with all the brands. Stay here if gambling is your choice and shopping till you drop for all you crave. The vast expanse of the hotel and shopping put together, you are bound to get lost. The rooms are luxuriously spacious and well kept.  The breakfast was disappointing though with the huge spread. Lunch at the Golden Peacock and Bambu as options were good. It is easy to get from the ferry terminal to the hotel, but once at the hotel, it gets a bit tiring to check in as you have to walk from the baggage services to check in counters again which takes a while. Unlike other…",40
"The place is so huge it would take approximately a minimum of two days to get a feel of it. It is world third largest building. The hotel and services are fantastic, they even gave us a free upgrade and a free ride to Hong Kong airport.although for bachelors or travellers I won't suggest this place for the price issues.Casino is huge and can be visited any time even if you don't stay in this hotel. I would suggest Saint malo for solo or bachelor friends and for couples and families its perfect ",50
"I love Macau! The Venetians Hotel is a complete package embodied with luxury and comfort. The Malo Clinic Spa, is excellently priced combination of Yoga, Sauna, Therapeutic Pools. Shopping is great with International Brands at a low price. Will keep coming back for more!",50
"Big hotel,big casino,big room,we booked 2 rooms with connecting door.. The room is big,the toilet is big and the view is great.. And u don't have to buy water here,just press 0 (zero) and ask for it,no need to pay.. The hotel is so big you can find anything here,but the food court is so bad,few of them have great photo display but when we order it,it's not the same like the display and quite expensive .. I better eat McDonald's.. They receive HKD,RMB and MOP here so don't be afraid if you haven't change your money yet.. The staffs here are friendly.. Maybe if you want to try Asian food in this hotel I can recommend Bambu and north.. ",40
"This is arguably my favorite place in Macau. It is so grand and welcoming. its a town on its own filled with luxury! This is a general review and not for the hotel itself. I spent almost half a day in Venetian. I enjoyed the casino so much, its huge and lots and lots of slot machines. may be almost same as vegas. i loved their restaurants like golden peacock, a restobar and so many of them. there is this nice small dragon show whcih happens every 30min which is well directed. the gondola ride is also nice and gives you that relaxed time for you and your loved one. For me Macau is Venetian, just love it!",50
"Free Shuttle Bus Services. Hotel was beautiful inside and out.  Suite room is very big, luxurious interior and comfortable but a little bit old. Large shopping mall and casino.  My friendly is their Diamond member, the check-in is faster and got free wifi. Breakfast in room also quite good. However, if you want to found a relax hotel, don't go to Macao.",40
"Rooms: vey comfortable and large. Stayed in one of the suits which had two king size beds, both sealy beds and very comfy. Large bathroom. Great views.  Hotel: really grand and lots of shopping, and food available. Walk around, shop, go for a ride on the man made canals. Take your camera.  Casino: big, many tables and machines. Enjoyed many nights here.  Transport: bus available and private cars available for booking.  ",40
"We came straight from HK via a one hour ferry. The hotel location is average, but it is only 15 mins away from the airport.   The hotel has almost everything you need, a golf course, a HUGE mall (basically has everything you would probably look for), a kids playground, and Macau's biggest casino. The venetian is basically a symbol for Macau.  The room was great for value, spacious, and the view was pretty good. However, the hotel floors smells like musty old carpets, which wasn't very pleasant.   The breakfast was average, with a big selection.",40
My mom loves Katy Perry. So she took me here when Katy Perry came. The concert time is too late for me. Hotel sent a babysitter when my mom was in the concert. She's a lovely lady! It's a busy hotel. People everywhere! Some parts I can't go because there are casinos.  Good food and BIG hotel! I love the pools. ,40
"We booked 2 rooms at this hotel during our Macau side-trip for my friend's bachelor party (we could have fit in 1 room). The room is spacious and so was the bathroom.   From Hongkong, it's pretty easy, as soon as you get off the ferry, they have a shuttle to take you directly to the hotel. There's so much you can do in the hotel complex. If you really need to get out, you can always board shuttles going to other casinos or hotels outside the hotel.   As for the food, there are plenty to choose from. If you're on a budget, go to the food court. There's one stall there that sells goose and roast duck. I forgot the name, but it's the only one with bright white LED lights on the sign. It's cheap compared to the other places that sell goose and roast duck and it was pretty amazing in…",40
"I really love this hotel ❤ This hotel is so luxurious with an amazing mall I don't need to go outside to shopping.. And I got so much thing with discount price also.. About the room,the room is big, clean n so comfortable I really want to come back soon 💋",50
The feel of the luxury hotel is lost as you enter the hotel !!  It's very huge and you have carry your strollers long way till your room ... No one to help you out and that too in a crowded mess Rooms are very well decorated and huge with very grand bathroom  Breakfast has huge selection with courteous staff mainly that Nepali guys   Don't feel disappointed if you can't stay as most of the hotel is a luxurious mall within a modern Venice,40
We had visited this hotel during diwali vacations. We 1st went to macau and then hongkong. To say if the start is good your trip is successful and the same thing we experienced. We were awed by the grand welcome from this hotel. Interiors were  superb. Could see people and people all over in hotel. We felt special when we entered our hotel room. It was truly king size suite.   Breakfast spread is superb. Lots of vegeterian choices. They have indian restaurant named peacock inside the hotel. Food and service both were good. Was costly though. Average dinner for 2 at peacock restaurant could be around 300- 400 dollars.  I patted my back when my wife became surprised to stay in this beautiful property.  A must go when you plan your macau trip.,50
Could not fault the hotel.  It was beautiful inside and out.  Will come back to Macau and stay in Venetian hotel again.  Great shopping and so big!  Loved the kid's playzone.   Everyone so friendly and the place is amazing with so many things to do just within the complex!,50
A very very busy hotel with excellent services.  Expect a minimum wait of 30-60 minutes of check-in.     Avoid any security deposit upon check-in...Paid cash/credit direct to restaurant.  You can avoid the Q upon check-out.  All you need is drop off your key to express check-out at lobby lift.  Love the foods... Must eat the Portuguese egg tarts from Lord Stow's Bakery at Venetian canal shopping area. Also the Portuguese cheese tarts at the Carts outside West Lobby.,50
"Macao a land of fun and venetian the hotel of dreams. Amazing hotel , the suite room with cotai view is really very luxurious and comfortable. While booking it was like a hole in pocket but after staying its worth the experience. The casinos are awesome and specially the dream cracker works. Truly luxurious hotel.",50
"Venetian Macao is a really good place in enjoying your vacation. Since I would like to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday, I contacted with the guest relations team for arranging a surprise trip to my boyfriend. The guest relations team did their best to arrange many amenities like the upgrade of the rooms and arrange a birthday cake and send to our room at midnight and did a great job to follow up. I highly recommend Venetian Macao and hope everyone can enjoy your vacation here and i would like to visit this hotel again as they gave us a memorable experience in Venetian.",50
This is truely a dream place something you never have imagined before the feel of royalty can only be felt by being present over there. Though Galaxy looks great from outside bit the feel of Venetian is uncomparable. The rooms and indian food at golden peacock is beyond words...,50
"Possibly one of the best hotels i've stayed in. Everything about is larger than life...the architecture, rooms, facilities...just awesome. The in-house mall is a shoppers paradise ..you dont need to step out. The buffet breakfast can be a bit better though. The casino is huge....a big attraction. The room was super luxurious....all it all a winner!",50
"Large, beautiful, clean rooms with great views and extra large bathrooms. Lively entertainment, awesome shows and a million slot machines if that's what you're in to. The hotel is HUGE and I got lost several times but had fun exploring the different sides and levels of this place. Will definitely return!",50
"Traveled here in November 2014. This hotel resort is unique and special in a way that mimics Venice (hence the name). Room suite was beautiful with luxurious interior. The highlight of this venue is the Venetian Lagoon which flows within the shopping and restaurant precinct. You will see people sitting in a gondola with a singing rower sailing up and down , never got the chance to sit on one but certainly quite entertaining.   Within this precinct, the decorative exterior and ceiling is made up of fake skies that transitions with realistic building structures. There is plenty of shopping outlets and restaurants. We tried the Italian eatery which was so-so, and the Japanese Teppanyaki for the Wagyu Beef which was incredibly expensive. Never the less, a great experience but won't…",50
"I stayed two nights at the Venetian in Macau and was very impressed with the hotel, casino, shopping center, pool area and overall atmosphere of the room. WiFi worked well. The gym/fitness center was a little small, but no one is going to this resort for exercising, the in-room TVs were showing their age (2008-ish pre-flat screen), but I did not go here to watch TV, and the restaurants in the food court area offered only overpriced fast-food (perhaps to be expected in Asia's largest casino resort; if you want better options, there is Taipa a short 15 min. walk away).  There is also a small golf course that I did not use while there, but I really enjoyed the pool area/jacuzzi and it was practically a private pool(s) as I was there on a non-holiday weekday in the early afternoon…",50
i really love to come here again i love the hotel interior i love this hotel design  i love to shoppping here it's really feel like we're in venetian spain i spend my honey moon in here ^^ really wish to come again with my kids hohohoho.... this hotel is the best hotel i ever stay ^.^,50
"Hi all,  As I was wondering where shall I bring my young family to countdown suddenly I think of my favourite place Venetian at macau,this place gives me many good memories and sadness too hahaha  I really liked about this hotel is spacious the room and many shops for all kinds of shopper and many activatives to just opposite of Venetian hotel like shrekfast characters breakfast with the dream world  gang and etc  Hope all have a wonderful year ahead and travelling too",50
"What a place..It is a fabulous hotel so decorative. The canals going through the hotel with the gondolas are fabulous and the fake sky, shop facades etc to give you a real Venice feeling is lovely.Yukti helped us check into the hotel. She was so lovely and friendly. Upgraded our room view as it was our first time in macau.",50
I think we did a lot of shopping here. Its like all the brands you can think off under one roof. Got some stuff frm Lush and Bath Body Work which we reckon were slightly cheaper than Malaysia and Singapore. We found couple of halal food available at the food centre inside The Venetian. Beautiful interior and we'll definitely come by this place if we happen to go to Macau again.,50
"Whenever you in Macao, forget the rest and just check into Venetian. There may be other newer hotels since Venetian Macao but through the years the management has superbly kept it in mint condition.  When we were in Macao, we move around into the various casinos but I must say the atmosphere and environment is still tops in the Venetian playing area.  Service staff and polite and helpful. Lots of amenities and bus connections to other major locations in Macao.   Will definitely come back again soon....",50
"We visited this hotel in a package which gives you the feel of Venice. A river flowing and a person singing on boat with all the outlets on side. What a lavish rooms.! You get the feel of queen and king... Lovely decors, biggest casino around world where we lost. Alas.! But awesome place to be..!!",50
"Rooms were excellent. Service was prompt & perfect. Staff was very courteous, considerate & helping. It was a perfect holiday. Would certainly like to visit again and stay at the same place. Even the restaurant Golden Peacock was very good. Casinos were good with great service. Overall it was a wonderful experience.",50
"Good value for money,overall the stay was extremely good.Hotel has all the ameneties that you can possibly think of. You must try golden pecock which offers good food,do check for souviners that can be found in the shops near the canals.",50
"very thankful for the cake and other perks from Venetian Hotel, we celebrated our baby girl 2nd birthday there....also the room is big enough for a family of 6....for sure we will come back and stay there again...",50
"we have a memorable stay in The Venetian Macao Resort Hotel during Christmas.  Staffs are helpful.  Facilities are excellent.  The accessories (bathing accessories, baby bed, steam machine)for baby are good.",50
"I stay here when is was newly open about 8 years ago. It seems that they have not yet renovate the hotel. The TV are the old ones with a huge tube behind. They should replace it with HD TV. Everything is fine with me, from lobby to the boutique shops to the food court and casino.",40
"Hotel is really good, staff is very nice and helped me to get high floor room. golden a peacock indian restaurant is good. Hotel rooms are quite big and my kids really enjoyed there. Shuttle service is available from Ferry terminal.",50
"My Second visit to Venetian was equally good like the first visit in 2009. The Rooms, Bathrooms and the whole property were maintained impeccably. This was amazing for such a huge hotel. But the Shower looked dated and that could be updated to modern Rain shower and likes. The Indian Food served at the Cafe restaurant was indeed very bland and tasteless. Otherwise i could have given 5 stars for this wonderful place. Do checkout the Casinos, Shopping areas & the Gondola Ride. Amazing and the most happening place & it is a must visit in Macau. Service of their staff across the property was always good.",40
"I travelled to macau in March. Venation is 5 star hotel. We booked a basic room. It was spacious, had all 5 star facilities. There was carnival going on. Gandola ride is a must. The shops are though overpriced. Therea are lot of options for dinner. We only had breakfast but it was good.",50
"We stayed there for couple of days. It is one of the best in town with world's largest casino. 24/7 you find crowd in every corner of the hotel. Artificial sky, casino and gondola ride are the highlights of the hotel (Must visit/ try). Rooms are so spacious and we checked-in to a suite room, which are just brilliant to stay around with an amazing view. It does take time for us to reach to our rooms, where you need to walk a lot to find places inside the hotel(don't forget the map when you're stepping out of the room). Staff was co-operative and well trained. If you got any doubts in casino, don't be shy to ask the staff around the place. Food is amazing but very bad with Indian cuisines. Transportation will be provided from the airport by the Hotel Authority.",50
"The place itself embodies luxury. Most popular sight is the Grand Canal and you get to tour the hotel going there. Different fragrance on each side of the hotel and lots lots lots of shops. If you like branded goods, you'll find it here. ",40
"Was there from 21-23 Dec 2015. Reached the hotel in the evening. The hotel suites and the lobby are located far from each other and we have to go through shopping complex.  Reminds me of a mini township i.e. the City Hall and the houses are apart. So there is a map to show where is where.  The people at concierge very helpful and informative. But the check in time and the time to reach the rooms takes around an hour.  On the second morning my mom broke her wrist when she tried to prevent my daughter from falling.  The hotel arranged for the ambulance and someone to accompany me n my daughter to the hospital.  During our time there, the hotel manager called many times to make sure we are in good hands.  It makes a huge difference bcos I would be lost.  To the management of…",40
"Visited with friends during Christmas. It's a great place to stay, has pretty impressive venetian style decor, casino floor, loads of shopping options, food court, hot / cold swimming pool, golf course etc. Although bit far from Old Macau, but close to several great hangouts such as City of Dreams, Hard Rock, Galaxy etc.   Can be bit $$$ expensive but would definitely recommend !!",50
"Macau and Venetian seems to be go hand-in-hand. Venetian is an experience in itself. Grand lobby, grand decor, grand rooms and over and above grand casinos.  The Bella suite we stayed were of top class and the view of the entire city was just awesome. The room were fully equipped with all amenities. Room service was also outstanding.  Though the check-in process was a bit painful due to the rush, but that itself show cases the number of guests visiting the hotel.  Shopping, pool, venice lake, casino - whatever the hotel has is of top class. Even Children's had a great time.  Macau is incomplete without a stay in Venetian.  ",50
"The hotel is huge, very clean and extravagantly decorated in the Venetian palazzo style like its namesake. The room where we stayed in was the Bella Suite...also very huge and tastefully decorated and very clean. There are so many shops at the Grand Canal shoppes that it is just like a maze.  overall experience is great....the only negative side would be the huge crowds of people. Shuttles bus services were frequent and of all the casinos in the cotai  area the blue Venetian buses are always filled with people. I guess this speaks of the popularity of this resort especially for the mainland Chinese and Indians.",50
"the hotel is awesome, very big, classy, and well maintained. staff were very courteous and helpfull. you can go tour shopping within the hotel and go hotel and casino hopping with free transportation. lots of food to choose from at their foodcourt.",50
This is very European Hotel that I have been in Asia  with the beautiful view and attraction with a boats that take you go around the hotel also more popular with the casino game that make you love to find out more,50
"Fabulous is the word when you enter this hotel. A truly amazing experience of staying in this hotel. We were on the 23rd Floor facing the ""City of Dreams"". The rooms are elegant and spacious with all the modern amenities. The Hotel has a food court which caters to all types including the Indians. The shopping areas just don't seem to end, as you start exploring. Though a bit expensive, its worth staying in this hotel. The huge casino provides a scintillating view which you cannot miss. A special mention to Miss Ana at the Check in counter and Mr. Sam at the concierge who was very helpful and provided all the information that we needed. Highly recommended.",50
"the hotel itself is grand especially the Gondola. I am a Kpop fanatic (Boys Over Flower) and promised myself if ever had the chance to go to Macau then surely i will ride the Gondola. And that's it, it was a dream come true and super amazing experience. our gondoler was a total entertainer and a hottie one. He rendered us italian, chinese & even filipino song. wow, quite impressive cause he's half italian and half filipino.",50
"We stayed at the Venetian for a weekend while in town to see the Bon Jovi concert.   The Venetian was exceptional from the moment the Main Lobby swinging doors automatically opened to greet us.  The pleasant fragrance at the check-in lobby carried through the entire smoke-free casino.  Literally a breath of fresh air for a Casino!  The decor and design of this hotel are nothing short of stunning.  The Foyer grand in itself, carried right through to the ""curved"" stair esculator/travelator, and up to our suite itself on the 27th floor.  We have done a considerable amount of travel and I can say, this is the first time EVER, I have not wished a room had something that it lacked.  The bed was comfortable; the doona was cozy, the air-con more then capable of keeping the rather large…",50
"Apart from too much crowd at Venetian Hotel that makes the luggage service from the bus not too friendly, we were very satisfied with the other services ftom the hotel. The room was the best part. And all the facilities available at the hotel were great. Would stay there again next time.",50
"What an hotel. No words its a sheer luxury. stayed there for 3 days and had a wonderful time. The gandola ride was amazing. the hotel architecture is just mindblowing. the shopping street inside the hotel just gives you feeling as  you you are on the street outside, just amazing and beautiful. So many food choices, and so many activities to do. you just don't feel the need to go outside as there is so many things to do inside. The show, the casino, bars , shopping. Its one stop destination. One must go and experience it themselves.",50
"Even if you are not staying at The Venetian, you have to still check out this must-see in Macau. With the frescos, architecture and gondolas channeling Venice, it is an interesting sight. While you are there, go have a meal at the food court where there are good food such as Baked Portugese Curry Chicken with Rice (MOP 88) and Roast Goose with Rice (MOP 130).",50
"The Venetian hotel is everything you imagine it to be and then a bit more. I’d visited the original Venetian hotel in Las Vegas long ago and had a good impression of what to expect in Macau. Only this time, I was also going to stay in it.  The experience of The Venetian starts from your point of disembarkment - for us it was the pier where we reached by a ferry from Shenzhen. A short distance from the pier there are bus stops for all the big casinos in town and they are of course, free of charge. We boarded the shuttle bus for The Venetian after loading our luggage in the luggage compartment and were soon on the way to the hotel. After a short drive, we reached the coaches entrance area of the hotel (outside the West Lobby) and were led inside by a staff member. The first thing…",50
"The 39 story Venetian Macau is spectacular, grand and luxurious in every way. It is supposed to be amongst the top 10 largest hotels, and the largest casino in the world and it certainly seems that way. The complex has amazing architecture and design and plenty of space. There are lots of shops including the Four Seasons region which is for has all the top of the range, designer, luxurious shops. Then there is the Grand canal ones which is slightly cheaper. The design of the Grand Canal is amazing. I have been to Venice and they have done a great job. The Gondola right is enjoyable with the singing Gondolier serenading with Italian Opera classics whilst guiding the way. Ticket can be purchased inside the Venetian and cost MOP118. There's plenty of restaurants and places to eat…",50
"This was my first ever trip to Macao and I was accompanied by my 12 other friends. The moment I stepped into the hotel I could feel the grandeur through its high ceiling and roman era type interiors. The hotel is one of the biggest in Macao as it hold the biggest casino in the city along with the food court and shopping mall.   I checked in to my room and went to explore the hotel. The basic category of room that the Venetian provides is a Suite. The Royale Suite was easily around 800 sq ft in area and had king size bed, a lounge area with a sofa to chill and a big bathroom. I must say that 4 nights is not enough to completely see the resort hotel. The lobby consists of the reception, the casino and a hall that can accommodate crowds in 1000 of nos. The Luxury brand shopping…",50
"Excellent in every aspect!  We visited Macau to celebrate our first anniversary and they truly made our trip memorable! Right from check in- super efficient with plenty of staff to assist you,  To the room- huge suites, excellent décor, all amenities to suit a true 5 star,  To the property- from casinos to the shopping paradise to the food courts and restaurants, a mini city resides within this report..and everything has been maintained perfectly,  To the service- efficient, warm hospitality at its best Truely an experience to remember!",50
"Rooms are very good and spacious, the lake view was awesome, on the other side there is a city view, since the hotel was big it took a lot time to search and reach the other room. The hotel has its own bus service and the structure inside the hotel gives a look on the small town or city. it is situated little away from the tourist attractions and close to the market.  There room service is quick and up to the mark. If they find and stains on any of the bedsheets / towels, they will make you pay for it else you are stuck.",50
"Friendly and fast service staffs and huge rooms. Easy access from ferry terminal because they have their own shuttle bus and easy access to shops. Rooms all are huge, tidy, and well maintained. As this a huge hotel, expect to wait for quite while for check in, but for check out they has fast check out. Excellent place to spend your time in Macao.",50
"Excellent location. Accessible to shops. Just below the hotel.  Easy access to other adjacent hotels like City of Dreams, Sand resort, Hard rock, to name a few. Easy access to buses as well.  Excellent place to spend you time in Macao. Ride a boat on a manmade river just within the shopping center, Rooms are spacious.",40
"The Venetian Macao Resort Hotel is a huge property with more than 3 thousand rooms. The layout of the property is quite confusing and restricted especially with kids. Some area are restricted and family with kids need to travel up and down due to the building layout.  As this is a huge building with lots of tourists, expect to wait for quite a while for check in, check out as well as concierge.   Room all are suits and is huge, tidy and well maintained.",40
"Amazing suit for princess with two level rooms, separate bathroom and toilet room. Hotel has everything for rest , leasure and spend money ) .  Very huge with shopping mall , casino and even owned canal for gandola trip. Must to try!",50
"Though its a hotel for staying in. It is also the best attraction of Macao. You need atleast 2 days to roam the entire property. You have everything required in here. The crowd number is so high always that you will amazed seeing that only.  You have all options food, transport,entertainment here. The casino is also too good with all stakes table low to high to very high. ",50
It is good.. That must stay.. easily go to the airport about 30 or 20 Km to airport  and the Macao is 100 Km so it is easy. Heaps of people say it is good so you know this have a better stay and night. ,50
"Amazingly Designed hotel, with boat and malls services inside.. we stayed 2 nights 3 days, got a good package from hotel, though the breakfast was not included in hotel... but indian resturant peacock was worth visiting for Luch. Mr kapoor Head of peacock was very nice host",50
I stayed in Venetian for 3 nights with my husband and 7 year old kid. The hotel is amazing. The staffs are very courteous and friendly . My daughter injured her foot badly during the stay .she was immediately attended by emergency staffs and a wheel chair was provided by the hotels. All the staffs were very helpful . In fact the concierge person came all the way to the bus stop with the wheel chair. Reception lady accompanied us to the hospital and then came with us to the room.   We r very impressed and touched by the excellent service and support provided by this hotel.,50
"Nice place to stay and shop. If you are looking to indulge into luxury than it's a must visit.  Wide range of food, gondola rides and the feeling is just awesome. Staff is well trained and helpful. Highly recommended.",40
"Everything at this place is enormous: the suites, the casino, the lobby, the canals. Staying at the place will leave you indulged in a feeling, with which you would want the time to stop!! The royale suite is huge with the sitting area separated from the bedroom. The gigantic casino at the ground floor never sleeps. The famous canal system provides a round trip on any one of the three canals in the classic gondolas.  Amidst this plethora of luxurious aspects, I felt there is a bit too much of commercialization.  For example, the souvenir gifts which they prepare and offer to the people who take up gondola rides. This souvenir kit contains a cardboard photo frame and a small show piece along with 2 keychains costing a little too much. In a place which provides a wholesome…",50

"Our stay for 2 nights in Venetian was highlight of Macau trip. One must stay here to enjoy the resort completely. Rooms are absolutely beautiful, we stayed on 35th floor. Super experience, great staff. We arrived through ferry to Macau from Hongkong, when you move out you can easily spot Venetian shuttle which takes you to the hotel free of charge. In no time check-in happened. Staff was very courteous and you can place a request for higher floor room. Lifts are very fast. Plenty of places to hangaround. Got free Gondola ride passes from hotel as part of some promotion.We got it only for one however when requested for another, we were obliged. Room service was very quick too. Our room was having golf view and all the high rise building incuding city of dreams was the balcony…",50
The Venetian is grand! And they know they are! Having a big place can easily become a bane if it is not maintained properly. The Venetian (kudos to the staff) leaves little room for improvement as they carry out their chores. The attention to detail and the willingness to listen make them stand out.  I would definitely recommend The Venetian to anyone who wishes to visit Macau.,50
"I stayed here for 1 night. This hotel was grand and huge. The room was spacious. The casino was also large. There were also the shopping centres with canals.  The services they provided were also good. When I queued up and waited for check-in, the lobby staff gave us water and sweets.  But the most impressive were the swimming pools. There were several swimming pools, including the warm water and jacuzzi pools. I spent the whole afternoon in the swimming pools and was very relaxed.",50
"Where to start.. and where to end. This stunning hotel / resort / casino has to be seen to be believed. Visitors to Macau make a beeline for this hotel as its a tourist destination. And guests in the hotel must count their good fortune, because such an extravagant experience comes once in a lifetime.  A massive structure, with false sky depicting twilight, gondolas moving down Venetian canals, a never ending shopping mall, a busy busy casino, a massive central hall..... a map of the hotel has to be carried in one's pocket all the time, because getting lost in the premises is quite common.   Huge super deluxe rooms, very efficient room service, ENORMOUS complimentary breakfast spread.......... the list can go on and on.. As I said, the hotel has to be seen to be believed. The…",50
"Had a fantastic stay at The Venetian. Everything is very well planned. Rooms are well designed. Wi-fi connectivity is perfect at every corner.

"Awsome place..  I have been here quiet many times now.  Wonderful place to go.  They have food court there, they have all kind of restaurant. It has a very good security, who also help the travellers with the locations as its a huge place to be in. It has plenty of small small outlets which are very reasonable. My personal favorite is Charles and Keith outlet.",50
"all been said before and all is true: exquisite, amazing, fabulous, incredibly luxurious.   so, i will pitch in 2 cents as my notes to the hotel management:   1. make bigger towels, there is nothing more fun than a big towel at the end of your oh-so-amazing shower/bath  2. i wonder when Asia will get with the rest of the world, and add REAL vegetarian and vegan options to their menus? and i am not talking about pasta, i am talking about OPTIONS of salads, sandwiches and other hot meals that are so amazingly delicious and do not include meat or sea food. the room service lacked great options (and when you are in such a hotel you NEED great options only), so we didn't order. 3. beds are too soft, for people with back problems, it's hell.   other than that...perfection!",50
"Our family stayed there overnight.  When we got to the reception, we were upgraded to the family room.  Once we got to the room, we were pleasantly surprised that the room had a kids area - bunk bed for kids, Nintendo wii, kids bean bag, kids table and chair with a coloring book set on top, plus Mustela toiletry kit, kid's potty, kids robe and slippers.  Everything a mom could ask for is there!  My daughter was also very happy about the room.  The staff was also amazing!  One of the bell hop saw us at the elevator, struggling with our luggages, kids, and stroller.  He offered his help to us and even went with us all over the hotel.  When we were about to leave, I was trying to give him some tip for all the help he has given us, he insisted on not taking it!!! Truly an amazing…",50
A hotel of monumental proportions.  You could spend your entire holiday inside exploring this magnificent building - gondolas' shopping centers - casinos and magnificent food.  Adult swimming pools and spas - with family freindly pools in same area.Well worth the ferry trip from Hong Kong - been twice will go again!!,50
"Stayed for 2N at the Venetian.  The place, i must say, is huge.  Different lobbies, you can get lost.  The check in counter was crowded, so we were given a tag after the luggage was handed over, so we could go for dinner first before coming back, when the Q was better.  Overall a good experience at checkin.  The standard room came with 2 Queen sized beds, perfect for a family of four.  The only thing is that you need to walk like some 6 mins to reach the West lobby of the hotel, from the front desk reception area.  The temp outside then was around 15 degrees, and the heater wasnt quite working. I called housekeeping and they sent a technician, who somewhat partially fixed it, so it generates air that is somewhat not so cold, but not warm either.  Managed to bring the temp down…",50
"Had a truly amazing time at the Venetian. The staff were very accommodating, ushered me to the express check-in counter upon arrival and answered all questions I had. The room was awesome, with a superb view of the Cotai strip. Unfortunately did not get a chance to experience the pool and the golfing ameneties but will try that next time. Definitely try the different restaurants there and the Casino of course. Would definitely recommend you to stay at The Venetian if visiting Macau.",50
"By far one of the best hotels I've ever visited. Its a real huge property with fabulous facilities. Its like a city on its own. A busy city must say. Shopping, casinos, various restaurant choices. The staff were very helpful n didn't hesitate in helping us wid anything. Would really recommend this place to all the tripadvisor users to atleast visit this place once n experience the feeling. ",50
Like always it was a real fantastic journey to Venetian Macau. A beautiful Hotel with perfect service and extraordinary facilities. This place deserves to be one of the best in the world. Everything was above our expectations. Truly amazing,50
"We much preferred our stay in the Venetian Macau compared with the Venetian Las Vegas. The clientele is different: none of the rowdy stag parties who spoilt our Vegas stay. The Chinese are primarily there for the gambling and the Casino was packed, particularly afternoons when the day trippers were in. That left the other resort facilities un-crowded and able to be enjoyed.  There were a lot of shopping malls, mainly high-end designer shops, which were good to walk round. Pleasant environment with the canals, and the gondoliers had good voices.  The free shuttle buses of the Venetian and neighbouring hotels were good to get around the area.  All the rooms are suites same as Vegas but bigger at 70 sq metres. Well furnished and comfortable. Would stay here again.",50
Fantastic hotel..world class facilities..all major high cost brand products available..we stayee for our 1st anniversary..really really enjoyed our 2 nights stay which seemt to be less :) casino is fantastic and full of gamblers all the time 24/7 we lost 980 hkd but it was really enjoy ful..apart from that indian resto golden peacock was fab..a 5 star michelin restaurant. Gondola ride was a one to remember! Highly recommended for Macau visit.,50
"I visited the venetian macau in nov 2015, the venetian is one of the world's biggest hotel I have ever seen. Best part is casino which again seems to be world biggest and one unique. City is good with cool climate. One should visit and stay in the venetian at least once.",50
It was a wonderful stay at The Venetian Resort we were for three days their casino was awesome shopping mall was too good they also provide good offers if u stay their for three days (gift vouchers) .The Hotel is too big even three days stay were not sufficient. View from cotai suites was also very good I liked the express check out service which they provide but there is a lot of waiting time for check in as their are long ques and it gets boring even they don't provide any type of shuttle sevice to Macau city which they should have never the less it was a superb experience to stay at The Venetian Macau. One must visit The Golden Peacock Restaurant at The Venetian fabulous Indian food and sevice overall enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend if you are in Macau u should…,50
"After staying at the Venetian in Vegas I was pretty excited to try out the Venetian Macau. There are a lot of similarities between the two, but overall this hotel is clearly larger and seems generally more luxurious. The rooms are EXTREMELY similar, which I personally appreciated; gorgeous bathroom, extremely spacious suite, comfortable bed, etc. The biggest difference between Macau's Venetian and Vegas's Venetian is the pool. Macau's pool was about 5% as crowded as what I'm used to in Vegas, and I am not exaggerating. I swam and laid around outside for several hours and saw maybe a dozen people among all the pools, which was very relaxing. I thought ""hey, maybe it's low season or something"" as I headed back inside to return to my room. As I walked by the gaming floor of the…",50
"thanks to the venetian macao as well as mr.wynn at check in counter gives us the best rialto suits for my 25th wedding anniversary to the venetian macao,the hotel team members gives us the complimentary surprise to our room on my wedding anniversary day and thanks to god that i choose the venetian macao rialto suits from india and i am thankful to the hotels team members for such good arrangement for our stay and made memorable my occasions.The venetian hotel and their staff members are very disciplinary and very prompt so i got very check in to the room and room service is neat and clean and proper,so again i thanks all of you members the hotel for such nice and superb arrangement and hoping very to come again to the one and only the venetian macao.",50
If you wanted to enjoy the luxury of heaven while you are alive on earth this could be one place. Be ready to pinch yourselves and family to check if it is real when you get in. You normally go to a city and stay in a hotel. Here you go to a hotel and stay in the city. So big is the space you cannot  dream off. In Macau the hotel itself is a sight seeing place because it will take so much time within,50
"Now this is what you call Luxury, A very very big and beautiful luxurious hotel. We stayed at suite room on the 22nd floor, at Venetian macau. The rooms and the bathroom are very big and beautifully done. The view from the room was also excellent.  The staff of the hotel is very very courteous, the check in process was a bit lengthy but you can not blame them, as they explain in detail how you can best enjoy the services provided by the hotel. The Gondola ride was a memorable experience for us, a must if you go to this hotel.",50
"Great hotel. lovely interiors and themes inside hotel. the room we stayed was princely  . it was huge , well decorated and we loved our stay.  Swimming poool was very beautiful ;)  But its indeed a very crowdy hotel during check in and check out times, mad rush and queue to wait for ur turn at reception.  Otherwise the rest of things are great,   shuttle service for pick up drop and sightseeing !!",40
"The line at ferry terminal for hotel shuttle was long, check in was slow... after we found the reception desk that was nowhere near the bus drop. But great staff, great room, great restaurants and big casino quickly cancelled the initial impressions.  Would go back again, maybe not arrive on weekend afternoon...",40
If you are going to Macau then you should stay at this hotel only. Only one thing which we did not like is during check in you need to carry your to the counter and due to rush you have to wait in que for check in with no welcome drink.,40
"I got back from Macau a week ago and I am still wondering if Venetian can be termed as a hotel...Its a huge property and besides when you enter your room, its practically like a massive mall housing all popular brands whether its clothing, make up, accessories...name it and its there! Its so huge that you can easily plan a day out from your vacation/trip for Venetian alone! Perfect for people whose idea of vacation is luxurious stay and shopping- they won't like to get out of here (I have to say that's NOT my idea of vacation at all!)! Did I forget to mention this is also where the BIGGEST CASINO of the world is! Hola gamblers!!!! For the first timers beware, all the machines in the casino have Chinese script and not English.   The restaurants in the hotel offer a great choice…",50
We stayed for 2 nights. The hotel is way too big and wide spread hence you will have to keep in mind that you will walk a lot. The room size are very big and very comfortable.  3rd floor is exactly how it looks in Venice where they have artificially created the look which is also good 3 hours of walk and you find almost all brands to shop. The collection and price is par with market and hence one can look to buy instead of delaying for some other place on the anticipation of better deals. For old people or with any difficulty to walk you may want to be prepared to either have a wheel chair or look for an alternative.  Their pickup from the ferry was in an ordinary bus which was too crowded. While returning we took taxi.  You get taxi easily and hence don't have to wait long.…,40
"its an Amazing Architecture. A Very Hugh and Properly Maintained Property Of Macau. Highly Appreciate Casino, Night Life and Many More. Near By We Have Find City Of Dreams & Galaxy and Dancing Water Show. Awesome Service Got From the Staff and Any Complaints. My journey to The Venetian Was Awesome Will Never Forget this Journey.  ",50
"This luxurious hotel has everything you would need during your holiday, from casino, gym, swimming pool, to eatery and shopping complex. Everything in one place. The room was great (70 sqm!!) and the interior of the hotel was very impressive. Unfortunately the sofa a kinda bit smelly but the rest is very good.",50
"Having stayed here before. We auickly snapped up a promotion with wechat . Having stayed at several hotels here over the past few years, the Venetian has arguably the best rooms in town.   We decided to try the asia buffet in the bamboo restaurant but whilst the appetizers were good and dessert choice adequate the maib courses wefe disappointing and made us wish we had eaten elsewhere.  After a good nights sleep we had the buffet breakfast which was more than ample. On a previous visit i had commented on the poor quality of the coffee. The grey insipId cona style has gone and been replaced by a machine offering freshly made coffee. As a coffaholic there was no comparison . Nice to see a hotel that takes action on such matters. Will we stay again? Of course!",50
"We stayed in Macau for a night, and I am gald we stayed at the venetian, The hotel probably has one of the bigger rooms in Macau, The rooms are a bit dated but are really spacious with its own living room. The Casino is also one of the biggest in Maccau and also has a great shopping area and a food court.",50
"Pros - Awesome staff - I lost a brand new expensive phone in a taxi and the hotel concierge went above and beyond to get this back for me.  - Spectacular Room - Very large and awesome rooms - Shopping - Simply outstanding experience - Casinos - Pretty Great  Cons - Food options which are light on the wallet are lacking , food court closes very early and the food is underwhelming. I am deducting a star just for this aspect.",40
"If you visit Macau, you got to reside here! There's no place better than this in the entire Macau. It is a complete package which includes everything from rooms to casino to a huge mall for shopping to food court to indoor ambience. My personal best till date! ",50
"It is know all over the world for its grandeur. Massive hotel with 4 wings of suites, a huge casino in the middle, great shopping arcade and number of other attractions for the family. Our kids used the kids club and it is one of the best in any hotel i have been. The gondola ride with fun too. definite worth a stay if you you are getting it at the right price.",40
"Hubby and I were there for 4 nights to celebrate our 11th year anniversary. They prepared a cake and special decoration for us which was a lovely gesture.  We arrived at 11am due to an early flight. Upon entering the grand lobby, we were attended to, and directed to a baggage service where our bags would be sent directly to our room after we checked in.   We had a quick wander at the mall. Must try their Lord Stow's egg tarts! Truly the best in Macau! We returned about 1pm to the check in area though the official timing was 3pm. They checked us in and upgraded the room for us!  Love the room decor and firm bed. We were initially worried about the complaints of smell of smoke in non smoking rooms but we had the perfect room. The amenities in the room were able to meet our every…",40
"Very good ambiance, lots of crowds in every corner.  Glad to tried their Casino and have a membership card, their staffs are so accommodating, yet very crowded as well. One of the best and luxurious casino I've been.  We're amazed in their Gondola ride with a Filipino singer as the Banker, and I'm proud of it.  So many big brands to shop and restaurants to tried.",50
"Its huge , Very clean and luxurious hotel with excellent interiors. Gondola ride is good. It has got many big brands showrooms. One can say it has got luxurious mall inside it. Textiles, jewellery, watches showroom of all major big brands one can find here. A very huge casino, food courts, swimming pool. All absolutely stunning.   Rooms are palatial too.",50
"The rooms of this hotel is easily the biggest Macau has to offer. Room is very clean and tidy, only complain is it is a bit dated.  But Venetian has probably one of the best and beautiful decorated casino in all of Macau. It will be worth visiting and staying.  But also be prepared once you head for the shopping or casino, be prepared for lots and lots of tourist surrounding you. Since this is the premiere tourist attraction for Chinese tourist, I cannot blame the hotel for the sea of people visiting.  Staff were very helpful and friendly in pointing out shops and direction, and you will definitely find enough food, nightlife (Shows), and kids activity (Qube, Gondola Rides) for how long your stay.  For more shopping, you can head over to Cotai Strip (Conrad, Holiday Inn,…",40

"Visited The Venetian Maccau with my Wife and 7 year Daughter. Excellent interiors well furnished Rooms,excellent Room Service,wonderful ambience. Just one star less for breakfast Menu as very limited choice for Vegetarians.Located in city centre adds to the convenience. Warm swimming pool and Kids area add up to the positive list.",50
"We stayed in one of suites for 4 night and service was awesome. you can find everything in the hotel itself and good for a break, shopping is not competitive pricing comparing to Europe or Dubai, lot of expansion construction around the hotel made difficult walking outside the hotel.",50
"The first impression is last impression.   It's the perfect phrase for venitian.  It's just the perfect place.. The depection of Venice is just too perfect,  I was amazed to see the art in this place.  The rooms are perfect,  it's just like a palace.  The cassino is the world's biggest casino. It just a perfect place to be in..  ",50
"Without any second thought we booked Venetian for our stay in Macau and have no regrets for the same except that they have a very small Check-in counter compared to the number of checkin they have on daily bases. We had to wait over one and a half hour to have our number at the reception. But we received the free upgrade, so that makes up for it. Casinos are clean, all luxury brands exists for shopping. Shuttle buses to everywhere in Macau.   Overall, very happy for our stay. will visit again.",50
"I've stayed at the Venetian a few times now and the highlight for me is always the quality of the room. The standard rooms are huge, bathrooms fantastic and value for money is excellent.   Beware if you stay at the hotel with kids that moving around to restaurants can take time as you cannot walk through the Casino floor which happens to separate the different wings of the Hotel and Shopping areas.",40
"It is experience of Paradise on earth . Rooms, ambiance, Service, Casinos, Decor, everything is far above the excellence.  It is like staying in King's Palace.  Bus service is offered  free every where you want to go in Macao, or Airport or Ferry Terminal.  I will remember & cherish this experience for many years till I get opportunity to stay & visit again.  Two days stay is not enough. If you want to feel & experience the elegance of this hotel, you must stay at least 4-5 days.  Just have fun at Casino . You may earn money as bye product.  Food at Restaurants, Food Court are very good.  To review this hotel by staying for 2-3 days is like showing  "" 40-Watt Electric Bulb"" in front of SUN.  Must visit for once in life, and if you are capable, Once every year.  Stay with your…",50
"One of the best resorts I've ever stayed in.  We had booked a Bella Suite which was 700 sq. ft. with two queen sized beds and one sofa which at night turned into a sofa cum bed.  We also had an attached terrace and a huge sprawling bathroom.  The service was excellent although the resort is so huge and they supply unlimited quantity of water unlike most other hotels.    Once you stay here you actually don't need to go anywhere.  This place has everything.  Four swimming pools, shops, food courts, fine dining restaurants, casino, you name it.  One must actually stay here to experience it.  Will definitely stay here when I visit Macau next.",50
"It was one of our best experience to stay in their grand hotel rooms, amenities were superb, their hotel staff were great even if we requested for an additional toilletries they are very accomodating, but there is onething i observed in their food court the chinese staff were rude to visitors especially if you dont speak chinese, they will get mad at you like if you will be asking for an extra plate or fork, we were told to go away there atittude are as if they are just street vendors..i think the venetian hotel management will also set guidelines to their tenants that they must also meet the standard of the hotel. Overall i love the rooms and accomodation but not the people working in the food court.",40
Hotel rooms are grate.Service excellent.Shooping malls at 3rd. and Ground floor are good.Breakfast is also good.But too big this hotel to reach for room is too far away.Elevator system very good.Oodor of room good. ,50
"Have to admit that while entering the Venetian, it does feel a let down as the West Lobby entrance is no more than an airport gate. The baggage claim further enhances that view. But once you are inside the hotel its sheer class. The rooms are second to none. The size of rooms (suites - as they say) is huge with biiiiig bathrooms too. The couch, the dining area, the two televisions everything is very opulent. The shopping plaza at the Grand Canal Street houses all brands you need. The check in procedure does take a lot of time. The room service for such a huge hotel is very very prompt. The in room dining options are many and is very delicious. Some rooms have complimentary shopping / gondola ride vouchers, so that has to be checked while making the reservations. Prepare yourself…",50
The hotel  is  as grand in reality as its name. The hotel shuttle drops you towards the west lobby which is too crowded and not at all impressive. You have just passed the beautiful galaxy on the way n then this!  Add to it dragging your own luggage up the escalator to the checkinn area where there are long queues n you start wondering whether you have made the right decision. But a look at their Indian restaurant The Golden Peacock n you start pacifying but alas they were only serving snacks at the time so waited until 6 pm when they start taking orders for dinner. Shelled out 1000HKD for 4 adults n four kids for a hearty meal one of the best we have had given I'm an Indian myself n then we climbed to the 30th floor to our suite n my five year old was mesmerized by the room not…,40
"No words to describe such a fantastic property ! A must visit for every person atleast once in a lifetime. Its simply grand and probably the largest hotel one can imagine ! So huge that you can easily get lost several times ! You need atleast 2-3 nights here to understand what it really is. The casino, the shopping, the gondola rides, the food court, the rooms, the lobby..everything is spectacular !",50
"I visited the hotel second time , this time with family. Extraordinary experience.Check in is super efficient. I had requested a room near elevator and wheelchair for my spouce. I was informed that the room is near the elevator and wheelchair is available right there at the checkin counter.Also the room category was rearrahed to suit our needs all by the Checkin staff by name of Johnsom. The room and amentities are superb. My family really enhoyed the entire Venetian experience beyond words. The Canal shoppes are an experience by itself and so also the Gandola ride. The experience is in stark contrast to the insensitive experience i recieved at Sheraton macau. Every where the staff is curtous and caring to the needs of guests, that is a part of the training i guess. Well done…",50
"This looks like palace of a King and once we check in, they treated their guests like a very special person and make them feel very special person for them and so it's not just a hotel but truly a palace where you can pamper yourself and enjoy your stay with them like a king......yes this is the Venetian and I  felt like privilege to be part of it today and celebrating my special occasion........all front desk officer always present themselves with broad smiles and express check in with all courtesy and smiles and which truly makes ours a day very special.....so this is the Venetian ,wonderful room, very nice and courteous staff and a wonderful location..............  We definitely come back again and recommend all our friends and relatives to this palace....yes it's a must come…",50
"This hotel is one of the famous hotels in Macau, famous for ""Mini Venice"", canals, gondolas and Italian-like buildings. Room is quite big, nice bathroom; however, one thing that needs to change is the quality of the shampoo, soap, shower gel and lotion, you expect a nicer brand for a great hotel like this; so is the coffee and tea brand. Other than that, this is a good place to stay when you in Macau and to shop! They have from Zara, H&M to Chanel and Prada. Everything you have is in here.",40
"Stayed at The Venetian in Macao. Our rooms were Bella suites. Spacious rooms with all amenities. We had a huge bedroom with a huge bathroom, a very huge dressing room with amenities like hair dryers. The bathroom had complimentary luxurious bath products. Had 3 beds in the room. 2 in the main room and one in the separate sitting space(foldable bed). The staff is so courteous and helpful, they look after all your needs. The hotel is gorgeous with their 2nd lobby being the most amazing. It has Falsy Sky with beautiful architecture and is the shopping area where you can find all the brands to shop from.

"I think I have to try Venetian as it is in Macau. I cannot think of another hotel. The hotel is huge and luxurious. Only suites no regular room. Free shuttle from ferry and airport as well. The checkin queue is quite long and it takes long for me to finish check in. The lady is very friendly. She offered me high floor but without good view. She explained me how to do with express checkout. As I'm not planning to use the refrigerator she didn't charge guarantee as well, which would definitely save time for checkout. Hotel room good but a bit old. Hair dryer doesn't work. 2TVs, 1 is ok the old one seem to be 10 years old (huge box). Shopping and food court are on 3 floors. Good and average brands both available. But I cannot understand in such a hotel, I cannot use credit card in…",40
"The Venetian Macau is a city in itself. It is huge and the rooms are also lavish and huge, I loved the decor and the ambiance. Stayed here for a night and just loved it. The room service could be better. We had ordered Indian and the food that we received was very different than the one mentioned in the menu. It is better to go down and have it at the Indian specialty restaurant or the food court.",50
Venetian Hotel in Macau is easy to go there from airport or from ferry terminal shuttle are free for the hotel guest and visitor. Experience gandola ride and feel your in Venice. I love the ceiling design was great specially the sky and clouds concept.,50
I have been staying in this hotel for 3 times in the past. Normally for business conference. They have large malls around the hotel and within the hotel which I like the most as I can do a quick shopping after conference and take away the Lors Stow's Bakery before I depart to the airport. ,40
"The Venetian is like a small city in the gambling mecca of Asia.  My wife and I stayed for 2 nights on a little sojourn from Hong Kong.  Long check-in....but aside from that, we had a great time, and were very impressed with the place.  The roof is painted with blue sky and clouds, they have a replica of the Venice canal system, complete with gondolas….there’s almost no need to go out and explore the fascinating old buildings and forts of the old Portuguese colony.  In fact, you could get lost in the Venetian, speaking of which, I lost more on roulette here in 10 minutes than I spent on the room….but the whole experience is well worth it.  Rooms are huge, with a big, comfy, elevated bedroom, dining table and chairs and a mushy sofa.   The bathroom is massive.  Everything about…",50

Everything about the Venetian is grand. I was there for work with my wife and we are not gamblers but enjoyed the luxurious and very large suites that were the size of a large apartment with all the amenities. There is an abundance of places to eat and shops to max out the credit card. You need the map as you can easily get lost it's so big. If you're a gambler than I am sure you'll love it as it was very busy all the time.,50
"My family and I stayed at The Venetian Macao to celebrate our mom's birthday. Lovely Guantinas of Guest Relations arranged a surprise cake for our mom when we got to the room which was beautifully decorated for her birthday.   We were assisted by Wayne upon check-in; he was very courteous and cordial.   Gia, who I guess was part of the Front Desk team, also arranged a luggage pick-up service when I only inquired about it. She must have made a note in our booking as the staff were already aware that we will require it later. She provided such a delightful service. ",50
Very convenience. The room is luxury same as the photo show on website . The room is clean and so comfortable.  Thank you for preparing the birthday cake to my partner and we've enjoy our great moment in Venetian Hotel.,50

We visited Macau in January this year and stayed at the Venetian Macao Resort Hotel.  Opulence at it's best.  We had a huge room and the number of eating places was amazing.  You didn't have to leave the resort as all your whims were taken care of.  If we ever visit Macau again we will definitely sty at the Venetian Resort. John & Gail Laney,50
Thank you so much for your complimentary package for my friend's birthday.  It was a wonderful day that everything is unforgettable.  Your sincere services to guests were much appreciated.  We are looking forward to the next trip to Macao and another stay at your hotel.  Keep it up.,50
"well the hotel lived up top its name as a luxurious one. every intricate details are carefully created, the only downside for me is the casino. but it is a casino hotel so nothing i can do with that. for other food alternatives try to walk i the Tai Pa village the employees would tell you how it is a 10 minute walk. Tai Pa is a world heritage and restaurants there are plenty.",40

"The family decided to spend a weekend in Macau and we chose the famous Venetian Hotel and the family was really wowed by its elegant rooms and interior. It is a family oriented hotel despite the casinos at the ground floor. We enjoyed the gondolas , the pool, the shopping malls around . It is a complete package in itself. We love it there !",50
Staff were very attentive and helpful. They're always asking if we need help from carrying our luggage and stuff to finding our way around. Some even walked with us to show the way... Express Check-out is the best!,50

"A huge hotel, very artistically made especially the grand canal, one requires lots of time and ability to walk whole day to explore the hotel itself. The sign-age needs to be little better and ofcource the staff needs to be polite especially towards Indians, since maximum tourists other than host nation are Indians. Rooms are beautiful, large and comfortable.",40
This place is a city to be in. The sheer magnitude of this hotel renders it a must visit. Be sure to have minimum four nights if you want to enjoy this resort to the fullest. The first night can be used to explore the length and breadth of the hotel. The second to get a taste of the 24/7 casino. The third to take a stroll through the malls the grand canal street and the gondola ride. the final light to soak in the pubs and the night clubs around. Order your food in room its not very expensive. For Indians Spice express on L# and Golden Peacock on L1 are a clear first choice . Dont get flabbergasted by the exotic malls some of them give real good deals especially shoes and apparel. On the whole a super experience.,50
"Stayed for two nights on the 11th floor of the south tower.  Very large rooms with separate sitting area.  Bathrooms were fantastic, so much space and great lighting.   Could do with updating a little as some of the decor is a little dated now but all in all a great fun hotel.  Lots of restaurants, good choices etc.    The area with the gondolas was simply stunning.  Had a great time.",40
Amazingggggg place. Really big. We stayed there for 2 days and still felt we haven't seen the whole thing. Loved the Venice look. It's so big that you literally get lost. And the rooms are amazinggggg. Even the bella suite is big and amazing view,50
"Well what else can I say. The Venetian Macao Resort Hotel is the most luxurious hotel I have ever stayed in, and I have stayed in many other 5 stars around the world.  From the impeccable service to the amazing 70 square meter room, to the exquisite dim sum and the VIP check-in, this hotel is a must to stay in.  And there is so much to do and see with the Cotai Strip directly across the road with the Hard Rock Hotel/Cafe and one of the largest shopping malls I have ever seen.  It's a must for an adventurous escape from Hong Kong for a few days and it would be hard to find a more luxurious and fantastic place to stay in all of Asia. It should be rated 6 stars, not 5!! I will definitely be returning there in the near future and for longer than 2 nights.",50
"Impressions start the moment you arrive at the reception. Beautiful hotel with excellent service. This hotel is an all suite hotels which means your room comes with a living room and a bedroom and a hugh bathroom complete with bath tub, shower area, toilet, his and her basin and a dressing table. Lots of space especially for families with young kids. They have 3 pools and 1 is heated. They have a kids play area too. (entrance fees apply). Hotel is also linked via the shopping mall to several other hotels, thus endless shopping for luxury goods. Value for money as compared to all the surrounding hotels.",50
Very impressive rooms.we stayed in the family suite which was quite spacious.hotel is quite huge.we were stuck in the hotel due to a hurricane threat.but the activities inside the hotel kept us entertained.,40
"My wife and I are about to checkout and all we can say is, the five star service was exceptional.   Why... We had a very delayed honeymoon gift and we had a beautifully decorated suite, surprise wake up with strawberries / cake (only because we wasn't in our suite the evening).  Concierge ""Nora"" (could quite read the name on card) but she helped with the short list we had and recommended a traditional restaurant in the old part of Macau( Portuguese), which wasn't cheap at all but the food was near Michelin standards and good service (Antonios). Sorted taxis and arranged a phone charger as we brought the wrong one 😂.  Casino for us total novices was a laugh after a couple of drinks, just give yourself a limit and move on to the live lounge where drink we ""ok"" prices, more like…",50
We are staying in bella suites and the room was really big and luxurious. The bath room was spacious too and luxurious  with the toilet in a separate room from bathroom. Food was really expensive but it is still a range for 5 star hotel. You can easily find food in the food court. Shuttle bus to ferry terminal is available too.,50
Why would you stay at any other location. This is as good as it gets and in a perfect location. The hotel is big and you get a lot of visitors wanting and wishing they stayed there. Go to Morton's!!!!!!   Best food yet.,50
"This was my second stay at Venetian  The hotel has maintained its standards  Inspite of a very busy period the service standards were not affected staff were very cordial and helpful Special mention to staff at the vip lounge ,concierge and housekeeping.if I ever go back to macau I will always stay at the Venetian  ",50
The Venetian is always  a delight to go to. The specialty of this hotel is that it is 3000 rooms and all are suite rooms. It is an absolute charm to stay in the ultra spacious rooms that have fantastic amenities. One would not want to step out of the room if given a choice. A totally relaxing holiday is what one can expect out of staying at the Venetian. The staff are helpful and friendly and it also has the shopping space which has approx 300 branded shops. There is also an artificial sky lining along the lines of Venice city. The restaurants in the food court serve all types of cuisine.,50
One of the best hotels we have stayed in so far.  We were in the Royal Suite and it was amazing.  Though our room was in the South Suites a little on the left side we could have a very clear view of the surrounding area. We could get everything under one roof. The ambience is awesome.  Only that a lot of walking around and language problem though indicators are put all around the huge complex.,50
"Excellent room and views, the room is large, staff are very nice, will go there again. The shuttle bus arrangement are nice, easy to find, just a bit crowded. The food and dining place inside are quite over-priced.  But it is convenient to go outside, restaurants are around the hotel.  Overall, it is a suggested hotel.",50
"what a class,its just not a hotel ,its a complete city with a true venice created in it.the casino is excellent.rooms are awsome.staff is helpful.gondol ride u=is a good experience.there are shops of each and every brands in the in hotel markets.restaurents are awsome.it needs 2 days to explore the whole hotel.",50
This is by far the best hotel I've ever been to! Not a place to bring kids since it's a casino. There are a lot of things to do. It's great to walk around the Canal Shoppes! But the best for me was just relaxing in their amazing hotel room.,50
This place is beautiful n as big as it gets the xperience of everything in this hotel is superb Super rooms to amazing view to the classy shopping within the hotel n the boat ride where it looks like u hv reachd venice n not to forget the supersized casino n well the upgrades n goodies u get at the hotel are brilliant All i can say is not a place to miss..,50
If one wants to see heaven enjoy heaven please stay in this luxury hotel the best it has everything what u wish and what u can't think of very big casino drinks free a very well designed hotel free bus service to any part of Macau room service is quick very fast the best hotel I have seen in my life,50
"Too much fun.. Not a place for kids,, friendly and helpful staff.. Too many activities around.. good Indian Restaurant named PEACOCK.. Free shuttle buses to many places.. too much to walk & SEE in the HOTEL itself the you dont require to go out at all..   ",40
"This is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in.  On arrival we were taken into the VIP area to be checked in.  Sibyl was a wonderful help, including booking tickets for us to the ""Taboo"" show at the Hard Rock Cafe Hotel, just across the road.  Our room was 70 sq.m.  Nice view, especially at night, and all the facilities you'd expect of 5 star.  The place has a gym with friendly and helpful staff, and the pool area is a garden oasis with 4 pools.  The dim sum restaurant in the casino area is the best dim sum we have ever seen, and the Red Dragon(?) restaurant in the middle of the casino area is very good food also.  When in Macau, and paying western, 5 star prices, you might as well stay in the best.  A great experience from start to finish.  We will be back.",50
We stayed here for one night in October as part of our Hong Kong trip. The hotel (like all the others) offers free shuttle buses from outside of the ferry terminal. The journey is around 15 mins from the Macau terminal. Checkin was busy and we waited probably 20 minutes but were provided with water and sweets before being given the key to our suite.   We had opted for the Rialto suite and expected it to be big but it was unbelievable. Words cannot describe just how big and wonderful this suite is. I read some reviews about them being dated which I entirely disagree with. The room was just fantastic with an incredibly comfortable bed and fully kitted out with everything you could ever need.  The only downside about this hotel is due to its sheer size it's very difficult to get…,50
One of the grandest hotel I have ever been too. The hotel has over a thousand rooms and its a great place to stay when in macao. Located right across all the major places in macao. The hotel has one of the biggest casinos in macao. The only problem was food. Its difficult to get good food around. Overall a great stay and must visit in Macao,50
"The Landmark and the best place to stay in Macau. A Huge Hotel built in the Italian Style. Had stayed in the Hotel during our visit to Hong Kong and Macau. Although Crowded the Check In & Check Out was very Smooth, Easy & Quick. Had got a Room facing the Galaxy on the 30th floor and the view was excellent. Room itself was like a royal suite with a huge attached bathroom with tub.  My family enjoyed the stay. Had Breakfast in Cafe Deco and the layout was really good and huge. Has a Huge Shopping Area & Casino. It has a Venice Style Boat rides on the 3rd floor with artificial sky which looks mesmerizing. It is a landmark in macau and people visit to see the hotel. Has regular 15 min service from the ferry terminal to the resot. Overall a place to visit & stay when in Macau",50
Visited this place with family  It's a huge property  not possible  to count the number of shops and eateries Having 3000 suites it took no more then 10 mins to chk in which was amazing as I reached the hotel @2 pm which is supposed to b the peak time  The reception handed us all the detail with a guide to the hotel and a complimentary gondola tkt which was a welcome gesture As I was with family they upgraded my room from royal to Bella suite which was really a surprise Being a vegetarian there was no pblm as the restaurant golden peackok was fantastic Room very big bathroom packed up with all required amenities  Casino was amazing (biggest in the world with more then 800 tables) Overall Must stay here at least once to experience the grandeur,50
Your first interpretation when you walk in is amazing beautiful chandeliers beautiful decoration. We only went to the shopping mall which was ok many different types of shops you could be entertained for hours. The disappointing part being the food. The food court food was horrible suggest go to a proper restaurant.,40
Amazing place! Didn't get to stay at the hotel because they were fully booked but we went there to visit and we plan to shop (we didn't because everything there is pricey!) The place is lovely though! I would suggest visiting the place when you are in Macao!,50
There can't be better place than Venetian. Excellent property. Stayed for 2 night but not sure if I have seen the entire hotel from inside. In room dining - Service was Good and Indian food was excellent (I was not expecting nice Indian taste but I was wrong). I was surprised that the hotel asked for the payment instead of settling the amount at check-out. Do not forget to visit the main lobby area. Its like carnival going in inside - hundreds of people entering in & out but it was all structured. In house café Deco is excellent with huge spreads. Do not forget to take the boat ride. If you get time - walk around the hotel at night - excellent view. Check in and Check out takes time - so be prepared. Excellent Bus service from Macau ferry station.,50
"Stayed here for two nights, really enjoyed the level of comfort and service provided. Beautiful suite with excellent toilet having all luxury.  The food courts, the complimentary travel, travel desk, shopping, casino all are excellent...Though not much to do in Macau the luxury at hotel is something very impressive.",50
"I had stay here for only 1 night and the hotel gave me everything I had expect for this kind of chain hotel. But 4 start as rated in web is a bit too high. Shopping mall is like other just placed in a ""fake"" venetian environment.",40
"The room is big with two big beds and a couch, big bathroom with a tub, very clean.. The staff are helpful and courteous.. A gondola ride in the center if the mall inside the hotel!  Relaxing ambiance in the foodcourt.. Free shuttle buses to and fro other other hotels and nearby sites, will also fetch and take you to airports and ferry terminals.. ",50
"I booked Bella Suite.  Checkin was quick  and hassle free.As requested we were offered early check in without any additional price. Room was on 33rd floor. view from room was breathtaking.. it was super luxurious resort. In house casino, Restaurants, brands, Gondola rides everything was extraordinary. cleanness and upkeep was awesome. staff was friendly and eager to help. free shuttles to mainland Macau was quite a comfort.",50
"This place had a stranger feel to it. It was completely fake and did not feel like I was in China, however if you're into gambling and exploring replica cities this is the place for you. Amazing casino for both beginners and avid gamblers!",40
"This is one of the flagship hotels of Sands co. Beautiful hotel where all the public areas are decorated in Italian style, including painted frescoes and other beautiful and interesting decorations. The rooms are extremly big, and the amenities and the service all over are the best. for those of you who likes to gamble - the casino is within the hotel.",50
The room is very big size and luxury but walk through the casino and very far from lobby. Staff can't speak English. And then wifi is very weak and not stable.The receptionist very friendly.The hotel offer about coupon food to client. Have many hi-end shops in The Venetine.,40
"I stayed in Venetian for 2n/3d and it was an awesome experience.  Awesome hospitality, ambience, casino and everything. The hotel is so beautiful and it feels like you are in Las Vegas. The best part is that the hotel has two indian vegetarian restaurants one fine dining and one in the food court both serving decent authentic indian vegetarian food. Macau and Venetian is a must visit. It is MINI LAS VEGAS :)",50
"BEST HOTEL IN THE WORLD THAT'S IT , We had been to Macau in OCTOBER .It is very difficult to describe this hotel.This is a Luxury Hotel and Casino resort in Macau.It is having almost 3000 rooms with varied choices of rooms and suits",50
"We had been to Macau in November 2011.We were group of friends and family members,gone to gather.It is very difficult to describe this hotel.This is a Luxury Hotel and Casino resort in Macau.It is having almost  3000 rooms with varied choices of rooms and suits.The check in time is 3 p.m. while check out time is 11 a.m.We had taken suite room.Once you enter the room,you would not  feel to leave it.Furnished from all angle and needs,very luxuriously.The room was furnished with silver and golden color for all places and items.This is 39 storied building in which,you name a thing,available here.The total covered area of the hotel is more than  9 lac square Meter.Can you imagine the size?The branded shops of all items,Theaters,live performances,restaurants and food courts,Pubs and…",50
"Even if you are not a casino player, you will enjoy this attractive place. Kids will enjoy it too. Shopping? Great offer. The place is very big, people may get lost after drunk :) :) Room amenities is one of the best.",50
"This is probably one of the biggest hotels in the world. We stayed in a Royal suite (the smallest one, 70 sqm)!!.Very nice- the only negative thing I want to mention: we got a no smoking room, but it smelt, so we knew people had smoked in this room before.We stayed on the 32nd floor and had a fantastic view.All the staff we had to deal with were extremely friendly and helpful. There are lots of restaurants, but the Portofino is certainly the best.All the foods we had there were excellent. The very best was the veal! The fact that you have to walk through the casino before you can come to your room is just fun. Several swimming pools, one for adults only.",50
"OMG, I love The Venetian so much! I had a great time staying in this hotel.  The room was clean and nice. The bathroom was so big lol. The atmosphere of the room was just prefect. It was worth, even we waited to check in for like almost an hour lol. But they were so thoughtful to give us free water while waiting in the long queue.   I will stay in this hotel again for sure!!I highly recommend this hotel:)",50
It is a magnificent hotel. Every thing is well maintained and superb facilities. Lifts are very convenient and not much waiting. Only complaint is lot of walking. Even to reach the lift we have to walk through long corridors. The rooms are quiet big and has all the required facilities. Drinking water was supplied only when requested. Wish they place water every day. A memorable experience staying here. Check in took very long time and we were frustrated after travelling so much and reaching the hotel. There is also a long wait at the Ferry station for the Venetian bus.,50
"What an amazing property !!!  Everyone must go there atleast once and experience the grand Venetian. What a feeling you get as soon as you enter this property. The hotel only has suites I believe and all of them are so tastefully done. We had 4 suites on the 33rd floor with lovely views, and what an amazing time we had at this property.   Even though the hotel is huge with so many rooms, but the attention to detail and service was so good and so personal. The food was excellent.  Walking distance to ""City of Dreams"" and ""Galaxy"" was another big plus point.   We came back so happy from this Hotel and winnings from the Poker table added to the happiness.   This hotel cannot be experienced by staying elsewhere and just visiting it for a couple of hours, you have to stay here to…",50
"I had no idea what I was getting into while booking the Venetian online. If you're a first timer to Macau and Venetian, then prepare to get your mind blown because this is one of the biggest hotels I have ever seen with probably the largest casino in the world. The caveat being a torrential downpour of people at the hotel entry (most of who want to gamble). They literally have dozens of hotel buses to carry passengers from the ferry terminal to the hotel.  The check-in and check-out process was lengthy albeit well managed. Although for a reputed hotel like this, I had expected a warmer welcome than to stand with my luggage in a check-in queue for half hour.  There are over 2000 rooms in the hotel so you can imagine the rush they get on weekends.   Positives: - We booked a suite…",40
"The hotel doesnt end. Lots of shopping available. The rooms were huge and luxurious. The ferry ride that macau offers is brilliant!! The room service provided by Mr. Lau was class apart. Top class! Best hotel in Macau, Undoubtedly. Must visit.",50
Overall is a good hotel. They hv everything. Unfortunately the bed cover a lil bit smelly. I didn't know what smell it is. Couldbe saliva or another liquid. And i found one long piece of hair in the bathtub. But the rest is very good. Room is very big. No need extra bed.,40
"Travelled all across south Asia and stayed at countless hotels. The experience that Venetian Macau Resort offers tops the chart!! The ferry takes approximately 1.30 mins from Hong Kong and you are taken to this grand hotel by well organized coaches.. The lobby is true work of art and one can be easily mezmorized.. The check in was very smooth and Anna was very welcoming at the front desk and explanied the hotel with the help of a Map.. Yes Map.. one really needs a Map.. Took us nearly two day to explore the entire hotel and its a fantastic place to shop, gamble and experience various cuisines.. we had ordered room service and were dreading it wud take more time than the smaller hotels we have stayed in the past due to the size and number of rooms the Venetian has, but to our…",50
we stayed in the venetian for one night. The hotel provides pick after alighting from Boat. every five to ten minutes they have free shuttle bus. hotel is a like a dream. huge casinos. huge shopping mal on third floor. so many restaurants. we stayed in the south block suite on 34th floor. amazing view of the surroundings. we had excellent indian dinner and breakfast in the resaurant.CAFE DECO.  they also have exclusive indian food at GOLDEN PEACOCK the only bad side was we stood in queue for almost an hour to check in. while checking in they ask for cash depoist of 1000 honkong dollars or credit card swiping for one honkong dolar. so when you go enable overseas transactions on credit card.,50
2 nights on the my second visit is awesome ..... Place has got everything to offer for everyone ...be there to believe it. Excellent service by courteous staff and for those who are addicted to shopping .... you will drop dead....,50
Visited Venetian Macau with my family members. Initially while we were at entrance all family members were worried seeing the crowd at this property. The rush appeared like  scene at a Railway station in India. However these apprehensions were short lived and wrong once we entered our suite. It is one of the nicest property we have visited.,50
"I stayed two nights in this Hotel, staying in this hotel is great experience, as many people mentioned in tripadvisor, service is something which we cannot expect as it's a huge property, they take 30 mins to deliver our luggage, but still its good hotel lot to explore , food joints,Branded shops,casinos etc..they provide some discount vouchers which are very helpful during our stay,Rooms are very good and large in size, beds are very comfortable, clean bathroom and good amenities. I recommend this Hotel.",50
"the best luxury hotel i been stayed before, super big room and nice comfort room with very comfortable bed and pillows which is the most important one so i can sleep easily. very accomodating staff. will difinately go back there when im going to drop by in Macao... see you next time Venetian",50
The venetian hotel macau is the best hotel. It has a lot all the brands for shopping . The best part is you can enjoy the gandola ride . The hotel rooms are luxurious and mind blowing . The view of the hotel is extraordinany . It is worth staying in this hotel . It has shuttles from which u can travel .,50
"This is a beautiful hotel in Macao. There is a lot of shops and restaurants.   The rooms are huge suites and they truly offer a luxurious experience.   I learned to peel some cards there. That was interesting.  Unlike Vegas, the waitresses bring you milk tea instead of free alcohol. That kind of sucked. Lol",40
"As soon as I stepped into the hotel I regretted my short stay of 2 nights only, because at the Venetian you could spend a whole week without stepping out of the hotel. There is not one single thing about this hotel that brought a frown on my face. Its an amazing property which is very tastefully designed and well kept. The staff and concierge are very helpful and will have a solution to almost everything. I was impressed by the baggage handling services of the hotel. My baggage was taken care of by the baggage services right from the time I got off the shuttle bus to the time I got on it at checkout. The room size is ""huge"" and you just have to stay here to experience it. I would advise people to get a good bargain on the hotel bookings. I had booked my room through an agent so…",50
"Suite room is so classic with big huge toilet room , livingroom and good bed, service is excellent and the hotel decor is stunning. Lots of time for shopping inside the hotel with many brands, great help from staffs and big discounts",50
Very expensive hotel but good for family travelling.  I booked the suite room.  The rooms has 2 queen beds and 1 queen sofa bed.  The room is very quite big.  We had 9 luggage.  We still have enough space.  The bed is so good condition for peaceful sleeping.,40
"For me it's the biggest hotel I ever entered, an amazing place, big casino, gandola in side the hotel and out side, many resturant and fast food restaurants, ice world in it, many big halls, the best decoration I ever see in my life, lots of lovely painting even in the sealing.",50
Eye popping re-creation of Venice. Rooms were beautiful but the hotel was too big to really enjoy. You had to walk a long way to get to the facilities because everything is geared toward the casino. The 36 hole mini golf course was unbelievable and the pool area was very opulent. Worth having a look at but I wouldn't stay there again.,40
"We stayed overnight at this hotel and had a great time.  The style of the suites is very nice and comparable to accommodation I've stayed in at a number of Four Seasons properties.  Once you've worked out how to get to your room, you're fine. It's just a big place.   Unlike smaller five star hotels, you don't quite get the personal service in Macao. There will always be lines at check in, lines at a ferry terminal for a bus transfer and it's not the kind of place where someone will take your bags. All first wold problems that we shouldn't get too hung up on.  The location also meant we were just a five minute walk to our romm after the Bon Jovi concerts.",50
"I really don't like casinos!  Let's just get that out of the way first.  So the worst thing about the Venetian is that huge casino in the middle of it.  But avoiding that as best you can (it's not too hard), this is a very good hotel.  Stayed there with friends for the Bon Jovi concert - 4 of us in one of their large rooms was cost effective with plenty of space - and the visit was very good.  There was a real buzz around the place due to the concert-goers, and after the event, the bars and night-club were nicely crowded, with everyone enjoying the excellent house bands playing.  Before the show, the pool area was nice and quiet.    In the room, the bathroom is large and the water pressure in the shower excellent.  There's also a separate bath, double basins and separate toilet.…",40
"Stayed twice, one in twin room once in suite, Both experience is good, no complains on the room, it is exactly the same as Las Vegas one. But the place seems to run short of house keeping staff, so check in need to wait for room, and also quite a wait for housekeeping for called items. Only thing I dislike of this hotel is its Chinese restaurants, tried hotels and its mall, all disappointment. Also not for people cannot stand for overly crowded,",40
"wow, just wow. we had been in hong kong for a few days before crossing over to macau. the room was huge and elegant. service from check in to check out was flawless. only complain is one day the cleaner forgot to replace some amenities and one of our bathrobe. also upon arrival our tv cable was unplugged for some reason, but the technician attended to it quite quickly.",50
"My friend and I stayed 2 nights in this gorgeous hotel. It's massive!. You need a full day just to see the entire hotel and even then I don't think you would see it all. Our room was amazing, a queen suite and was huge. Bathroom was amazing view was amazing. I have seen other TA reviews and people are just picky i think. Our checkin was a breeze and Charles at check in could  not have been more helpful. Plenty of choices around the hotel for breakfast, plenty of high end shops which all link together to other hotels, you never have to leave the aircon! The casino was a great time waster, the gondolas fascinating to watch. One of the gift shops had a video of the Venetian being built and the logistics involved which I found fascinating! There are plenty of free buses which you…",50
"I am the tourist from Taiwan. I am so happy to travel in Macau from 21/9-28/9. I also stayed in The Venetian Macao Resort Hotel to live during these eight days. I think it is a best place to live in. The hotel facilities are very abundant. The bedroom also is beautiful. There have many things that I need to use. For example: free wifi, comfortable bed.......But it is bad for me is the bathroom is little bit dirty so that I think it is not worth to be five stars hotel. Also the staff at the hotel is not very polite. Moreover they are not professional enough. I ask them some questions and they don’t know how to answer me. If they can solve the problems, it will be better.  Also there have the shopping mall under the hotel. All the famous brand can be found at there. It is very…",40
"The Venetian stay was a great experience.had been there earlier with friends,and this time I took my parents.Its a grand Hotel,and you need to have a map to avoid getting lost.Staff is wonderful and very helpful.The rooms are very clean andwell equipped, room service is excellent.However,an issue to do a check in.Be prepared for a long que and the hotel is not disable friendly.Plenty of choices to eat and shop in this resort  hotel.Wifi service is good within the resort hotel.",40
The overall experience was great from the time of check in everything was in the right place the service level was mind blowing  the amenities kept inside the room was of superior quality  the main attraction was the hotel main lobby,50
"i booked 2 connecting suite last week for a friend reunion, room are large but a bit old and tired any way very clean, well prepared with the sofa bed been opened and set to accomodate our request. in room service was nice quality but a bit slow for delivery, swimming pool was nice and service was very efficent, had few beer and pizzas there as well of good quality. finally big thanks to Ms. Jessie Fu from F.O. to undestand our needs and allowed us a very late check out. People always make a huge difference with just few detail betwen a plasent or unpleasant stay. thx.",50
"Spent the weekend in Macau for celebrating Anniversary. Great experience to stay in the tidy and huge room of Venetian.  With the help of the guest relations team, I have had a great experience to celebrate my anniversary at Venetian Macau.  Will definitely stay at Venetian again!",40
"Great place to stay, meets all expectations as set by various reviews. Missed the Bon Jovi performance set to happen by end of September. Galaxy is just across the road, must visit to see the grandeur of this property as well. Gondola rides are fun, shops are that of any typical mall. Convenient shuttle service to & fro to Macau ferry points. Gambling is an all night sport, mall closes at 10. Rooms are a bit dated, room service can be a bit speedier, but i guess size does take its toll. Overall, a great stay location in Macau.",40
We went to macau just for a day trip while in hkg. after the sightseeing we were dropped at the venetian hotel. the first look of the hotel is like WOW. Its a true luxury. its so huge that one can get confused. the casino is amazing. we went to the food court and they have an artificial made up sky effect with various cuisines to offer. the sky effect looks so real. later we visited the gondola ride inside the hotel and that was the best one. Our Gondolaman Christiano was a charming and very friendly person.  Overall we had an amazing time for that evening there.,50
"If you've ever been to the Venetian in Las Vegas you have an idea of what to expect already, however the Venetian in Macau is 3 times bigger than LV.  The rooms (as you'd expect from the price tag) are simply stunning.  Big, roomy, with all the amenities one would need. The beds are like sleeping on a cloud and as an insomniac that's hard for me to find!  (As far as I'm aware, all rooms also come with a sofa that is a pull out bed). The water pressure is good in the shower and the service is impeccable.  House-keeping could do a bit more of a thorough job on their cleaning, there was quite a bit of dust on various surfaces in my room, although it didn't really bother me.  There are several eating options in either the food court (right by the south wing on L3) or the many…",50
"We booked room in Venetian for two nights in August 2015. The check in was hassle free and so was the self check out (saved us a lot of time, you just need to drop your key card into a box). Our room was on the 32nd floor and it was spacious and the view was just mind blowing. The hotel is a world in itself. There are restaurants and shops to keep you occupied for the full length of your stay. We enjoyed the gandola ride inside the resort hotel. The gondola rider sang for us too :) Overall a very memorable stay. I would recommended everyone to visit this place once. The only drawback we felt was that the food court was too crowded due to our visit being on a weekend and we had to look for a place to sit for more than half an hour.",50
If Macau is a place to visit then it is just for this amazing hotel or resort.Fantastic rooms..Great food.I m not a gambler.If you into gambling then u might love this place more as they have casino one of biggest i suppose.Just sheer size of hotel is big luxury.Enjoyed my Stay.,50
"Stayed here for 2 days. Wonderful experience. Huge place with great planning of shopping, Casinos and canals. Artificial canal and sky is amazing. Lots of food options. Rooms are spacious and very clean. Excellent breakfast, with great options. Too much crowd as Mall, Casino, hotel all in same building.",50
We felt special with the room given to us.  Spacious with the room looking over the mini golf course.  Four poster bed with lovely lace .  The bath and dressing area was well presented.  Had gold gilded taps enough and more soaps and towels exquisiteness to say the least.  Had the commode in a different enclosure and this was very welcome.  The staff were pleasant.  Will definitely talk about this room to all.  The hotel is so vast that it took some concentration to find it from the lobby or the restaurants that we visited.,50
"Venetian is one of the biggest and best properties in Macau. The property is very well designed to include a number of attractions alongwith the hotel. There are casinos, theatres, kids sections, multiple restaurants etc. One day can be completely spent just to explore the beauty of the this hotel and its unique architecture. Key Attractions: - The artificial blue sky is a photographers delight - Extremely Spacious Rooms with child friendly amenities - Mall type food court offering different cuisines (including Vegeterian Indian) - Shopping mall offering some of the biggest brands - Dedicated play areas for children (so that parents are busy in Casinos ;)  Overall, a fantastic and must have experience in Macau. Cheers!",50
"After a business trip to Zhuhai China I went to Macao for some fun for several days last week.  I checked in on Friday Sept 18 around 2PM.  There was no line at the check-in counter so checking in was a breeze.  The room was just about identical to the Venetian Rooms I have been in in Vegas. Nice big suite room with two stair step down into a living area.  Free WiFi was a plus.  Non-smoking room was nice and clean and smell-free.  The pool area (they have 4 pools) was quite nice and had a small bar and service to purchase beers and drinks.  The pool is a hike to get to though and it entry is well hidden.  With me speaking English only, it was a challenge to find staff who knew how to get to the pool to communicate with - but I finally made it.  I ate dinner at their Portfino…",40
My wife and I just returned from a trip to Hong Kong/Macao to celebrate our 2nd wedding anniversary.  We decided to spend our last 2 nights at The Venetian Macao as we were married at The Venetian Las Vegas.  Our stay was amazing!  After Jojo in guest services found our we were celebrating our anniversary she arranged for a complimentary room upgrade.  We were upgraded to the Railto suite which was bigger than any apartment I've ever lived in.  She also arranged for a reservation at Morton's the Steakhouse.  At the restaurant they had menus with our names printed on them and gave us a complimentary dessert and after dinner drinks.  We very much appreciated everything they did for us.  The hotel form the outside and my first general impression it seemed to be the same as Las…,40
"Luxury-spacious / vintage room. Very comfortable, clean tidy and also very friendly polite staf.Wide range selection of breakfast, choose from one of three huge restaurant (each restaurant has it own style). The mall integrated with hotel and casino, is remarkable, you can enjoy it all day long ( you can also get lost). Dont miss the gondola ride. Unfortunately, we go in public holiday, the queueing check in about 2 hours long despite there are dozen counter. Maybe they should provide an internet check in. However, they provite express check out. ;) ",50
"Not a big fan of the room deco. Too ""gold & royal"", missing a touch of taste or style in my opinion. Prefer low key designs personally. But it's still a comfortable stay no doubt about that.  If you find everything too expensive here. There's a new spot called ""broadway"" just besides the Galaxy across the street. 15 mins walk or so. More affordable food and more local people there.",40
"Best Hotel to Stay in Macau Taipe, With lots of amenities and luxury brands stores in the hotel it self. It also has an artificial sky inbuilt in there. There all cuisines of food from world wide are available. big place to gamble",50
The casino here is very good and the staff are very professional. Getting a taxi from the resort is a headache but they do provide a bus service which helps. The food and beverage is ok but there appears to only be expensive options and not so much snack food - but perhaps I missed it.. ,40
"This is my third visit to the Venetian. The hotel has been able to hold on to its charm. Excellent service and amenities. But Venetian is not only about stay, its about shopping, casino, gondolas and crowd. Everything is perfect.   From my first visit to third visit, I only can say that it's getting old beautifully  ",40
"Spacious, fully-equipped, deluxe, clean and tidy guest rooms. The large hotel mall itself is already an attraction, bringing Venice all the way from Italy inside the hotel. The hotel is beautifully decorated to every detail. Don't forget to ask for a map from the front desk or you may get lost in the hotel.",50
"We were pleasantly surprised with the great service from the staff at hotel and restaurants operated by Sands.  The rooms are very spacious and although slightly aged they are very well maintained, my wife and I enjoyed the abundant shopping and connectivity to other malls nearby.  My parents were enjoying the spacious Casino with numerous choices of machines and games.",50
"Venetian Maccu is amazing place to stay.. their rooms, interiors, casino everything is amazing... this is world 2nd Casino after Vegas. Further I have stayed here for 1.5 days and then also 1 part of the hotel was left for visiting",50
This is first time i stayed in Venetian Macau and overall it was satisfying experience. There is nothing much to do in Macau so you can spend maximum time enjoying facilities at Venetian. The location is on the cotai strip.,40
"Chose this hotel because I had a good experience staying at Venetian in Las Vegas. Their room, imterior, exterior all exactly the same like the one in Vegas.   The room is huge, love the bathroom area! So spacious!   Completely enjoyed the stay!",50
One of the best luxury hotel and casino resort in Macau having huge and comfy rooms. The Venetian Macao is having the largest casino in the world. Staff were courteous and efficient. 2 days were less to explore the entire property. They have created a Venice like look inside the hotel.   Worth a Visit,50
"The royal cotai suite has a fantastic view, over looking the city. Beautiful room with a seperate living area and bedding area. Bathrooms are massive with bath tubs, interiors are so beautiful. JUst brilliant. THe hotel itself has so much to do whether is betting at the casino or shopping or even eating at the best food court I have ever come across.",50
"Absolutely amazing place, stayed with young children, even though it took more than an hour to prepare the rooms for us the rooms were great, good view of the pools down below, we were given interconnecting adjacent rooms which was very good. Kids had a whale of a time playing in the pools. Mall is good too.",50
"This is not the normal hotel you're used to.  It is a property in itself.  Getting from the reception to your room entails walking...and I mean walking.  Inside the hotel compound there is the casino and a great selection of shops so you need not go further.  For those who loves to take picture, the indoor venice set up is really great and you can even have a short ride on the boat.  Really cool....Transportation wise, just go out the building and there is a bus station.",40
Stayed in the hotel for 2 night for a Conference. An Amazing and fantastic hotel with a shhopping arcade. The rooms are really huge and cosy. Great attention to detailing has been taken care.   Worth visiting and would visit again ...   Had a lovely stay at the hotel.,50
Excellent service for hotel staff. They are always there ready to answer your queries when you are lost in the hotel. The staff are approachable and friendly. Nice ambiance and convenient to travel anywhere to Macau.,50
"A fantastic hotel with a shopping arcade attached. I like the comfy room and there is a Venice-look alike canal in the shopping arcade. You can pay to ride the gondola in the canal although the real in Venice of course much better. The peking duck in the foodcourt is also recommended. Unfortunately, I only had one day to stay there. There was a free ice sculpture exhibition which is a plus point.",40
"The room is huge, very generous with the space and it was very cosy and comfortable. I love the toilet space and it was lovely for the ladies with a huge dressing table. The furnitures start to look a little old and the shower head giving all kind of funny sound. Perhaps it's time for furnishing. Generally, it's value for the money and I enjoyed my stay very much. The casino looks old as compared to the surrounding casinos around. Last but the least, if you are a shopaholic, you are going to love the retail area at level 2 with lots of shops and F&B outlets. And of cos, do take a ride in the gondola along the 'river'. The fake sky ceiling is it's best selling point, in there... you will definitely lose track of whether it's day or night.",40
"I've never been in such a large Hotel before. Beautiful property, well appointed suites, fabulous toiletries, Great attention to details. Cafe Deco offered breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Venetian offers the re creation of the streets of Venice, Colorful skyline (artificial) , cross section of shopping, There were a menu for the pools on offer, first for me. So be prepared to be pampered.",40
"Amazing stay experience, and its  as gaint as not able cover loobies in 3 days. Hotel staff and service is the best ever experienced. Though mall inside has all the luxury brands and without winning jackpot difficult to shop :).Worth staying.",50
the moment you are transferred from the ferry to the hotel and you enter the hotel you just cannot stop staring at the architecture and it is really unbelievable and its keeps on amazing you and you have to say wow. i stayed in the Rialto suite so my check in was very smooth and perfect . my room had the city view which was also good . this hotel as everybody knows is famous for its casino and shopping so if you are fond of gambling this is place to visit and during the day tme it looks like a fish market but be aware that the dealers do not know English so if you do not know any rules of the game you will definitely have problems as also most of the people playing are also not knowing English.They are very strict and get annoyed very easily if you are talking to each other so …,40
"one has to walk a lot to go to various spots. there is beautiful shopping place , where one can see an artificial blue sky giving the impression as if there is no roof. it is a nice place to take photos and take a gondola ride.",40
"We stayed for 4 nights in royal suit it was very big room with living room , big wash room , room was very good , free wifi , house-keeping was excellent . We have no any complaint .  Venetion hotel is very big , it have biggest casino inside , big mall for shopping inside , big food court , also have indian restaurants , one was golden pecock it have tasty food .  Take a room in south wing because it is near to the swimming pool . Casino is in centre so it is near to all rooms.  And also take room which is near to the lift . Its very important , we have to walk so much from lift to our room .  A very nice royal stay . Thanks for your service. ",50
The best ever experience I had in last 5 years. Wonderful and memorable trip. Great property. Great ambience. Great service . Great food. Must visit of a life time. Casino lovers can try their luck. Round the clock live property and a great mall for great shopping experience.,50
"We stayed in Royal Suite for 2 nights. Huge rooms, 2 double beds... 4 ppl can easily stay in one room. Attached sitting area with dining table and bay window were added luxuries. You dont have to step out of the hotel, the hotel itself has got everything. From big brands to food court to play zone for children and fine dining too. Overall a wonderful experience! Staff is very polite... check in check out process was smooth.",50
"This is the first time of me in Macau. The Venetian is very huge hotel and greatest weather here. Casino is very nice also.Stayed for 3 nights. This resort hotel is just humongous.Their room is very big and suitable its best to stay wif family. Location is best with easy access transport , shopping, food and of course the famous casino ! They even have shuttle bus to airport !",50
"Room is clean, big and comfortable. Customer service is really good. I like the check-out express service.   Need to take a long walk if you want to take bus to city. If you just stay in resort, that would be a good choice.",50
"Customer Relations team is very helpful and kindness, they let me and my wife have a wonderful wedding anniversary. They arranged a romantic room and presented us with a beautiful cake for free They also assisted to make a dinner reservation for the Macau Military Club. Their sincere attitude to make us have a profound memories.",50
This is the first time of me in Macau. The Venetian is very huge hotel and greatest weather here. Casino is very nice also. I'll come bace again. I stay at opposite side but there is not so good than this side and there is a lot of hotels around there. So you can enjoy and spend the time here as much as you do not want to sleep. ,50
"Stayed for 3 nights. This resort hotel is just humongous. I got lost n number of times, trying to find my way back to the room. I lost count of the number of outlets and eateries here. One can never get bored here - there were a lot of entertainment besides the casinos. The bella suites are huge,  wifi is fast. The only thing that I dislike about the suites is the toilet.  I could smell smokiness in the toilet and the floor of the toilet is a bit sticky for my liking.",40
"I have visited this hotel several times . Their room is very big and suitable its best to stay wif family. Location is best with easy access transport , shopping, food and of course the famous casino ! They even have shuttle bus to airport !",50
"Stayed for 2 nights here before and couldn't have asked for more from this hotel..  Superb suite room design, pleasant staffs at the check-in counter and also the computer service area and also wonderful pool!  Just wish there was less Mainland China tourists on the casino as they are VERY INCONSIDERATE and IMPOLITE. They even spat (YES SPITTING) on the casino's carpet floor! In addition, I could not even play the slot machine properly as there were A LOT OF Mainland Chinese people always trying to force entering their Sands rewards cards on my machine!!   But as a hotel, this is a very grandeur hotel and has beautiful rooms!  Would recommend everyone to stay at least once at The Venetian Macao, regardless you are gambling or not!   ENJOY..... :)",50
"The hotel is grand and has the wow factor. It is huge and get ready to walk miles and get lost.  The majority of Chinese staff do not understand English but thank god for the Filipino staff whom always appear to be fluent in English and very friendly.  I booked a suite in the North tower which was very executive but sadly spelled of smoke even though a non smoking suite, management need to enforce the smoking policies upon guests as it's not fair for non smokers.  The shopping mall within the complex was great.  I found the in house TOUR prices too high and nothing special, I would say your better to take taxis and hotel Jump.  The restaurants offering buffet style was the best value and choice.  I defiantly would return to this hotel is promos was on offer as enjoyed my time…",40
"My wife and I had a great time at Venetian...I traveled to other casinos/resorts but i must say Venetian was the best in terms of extracting bang for the buck...let me explain...Venetian casino, in my view, was the largest, and hence, the most crowded even way past mid-night...moreover, Venetian is connected through an air conditioned lobby with Four Seasons mall and Sheraton shopping plaza. It is a big plus for those who want to indulge in the shopping therapy ;) ...room's size and facilities were great, and the staff was sweet enough to allow us a late check-out until 2 pm...the only thing I would change is the size of water bottles that come complementary with the room. There were just two 250 ml water bottles for both of us :(",50
"Excellent Resort, had a wonder time over there in Oct 2014. Delicious Indian and Continental food available in different restaurant .Awesome architecture and one of the best hotel in the world. Every thing is up to the mark.",50
"I went with my friends to Macau for just a short visit of one night enroute to Thailand. This place is one of the most happening place in Macau.   Pros: This is a huge property with one of the finest architectures and interiors. It has a fantastic lobby, big casino, multiple restaurants, food courts, dance bar, shopping, etc. Since we were there in Macau for only one day, venetian was best as we need not travel around the city for anything. Highly recommended for short time visitors.   Cons: Since it is a very huge and crowded place, attention for the room guests was not possible for the staff. Speed of Check In and Check Out was not slow. The bathroom fittings were old. We had to walk a lot from lobby to rooms and vice versa.",40
Beautiful hotel in Macao. Decoration inside it is wonderful. This is the second time I visit this place. I like the blue sky imitation inside this hotel. The breakfast also nice.It is true that this is the best hotel in Macao Everything is nice,40
One of the largest hotel in Asia and it takes about one full day to go visit the entire hotel. Magnificient hotel with one of the largest casinos in Asia. The casinos had a very high minimum bet and one issue that I faced that the dealers at the table did not speak english. Hence you might face some difficulty if you don't know the local launguage.,50
"A beautiful world of its own @ the classy casino island Macau. It was like a dream to be at Venetian Macau, be it the grand size, the Venetian theme, the gondolas, outstanding service levels or the comfortable stay, everything was just perfect or should I say more than perfect. The family suite we stayed in was lavish with royal decor and excellent amenities. You need to be an athlete to experience the whole resort, I think it's just impossible to do it within 2-3 days of stay there. Shopping at its best with every possible brand being there. You get the best of the whole world in this island resort. It's a must visit place for everyone.",50
"Expected the resort to be crowded given the wonderful appearance of the property. Even though is packed in the lobby, staff were friendly and check in process is smooth. Unfortunately no baggage assistance was rendered, which is fine for me as i only have a piece of big luggage. Requests were attended to efficiently. shuttle bus services make the trip hassle free.  I love the scent that the resort uses for the main lobby.  Will definitely return stay should i visit Macau again.",50
"Stayed here just the one night with my wife, kids and parents for a quick two day visit to Macau.  First impression is that the resort itself is one big shopping mall and casino, with a hotel for good measure.  When we arrived it was extremely busy in the transit area (we got the complimentary bus from the Macau ferry terminal) and the mall was jam packed too.  Check-in was a pleasure, though, with free bottles of water and candy while we waited for the very courteous and well-spoken staff to get us through the details.  We booked two of their standard suites, and paid extra for one extra bed for the kids.  We protested a little that this amounted to just a pull-out sofa, so they upgraded the room to a bigger suite with an additional double bed, which was done professionally and…",50
"Pros : A very spacious guest room as they start from only the suite type. / Functional and very well designed room layout and furniture /  Fully provided amenities / Luxury and cozy decoration / Excellent free high-speed WIFI / Wide range of shops, restaurants, gambling and activities here that you can stroll around for the whole day or two without stepping out the hotel. / Free shuttle bus from the airport and ferry terminal to the hotel / Good service from staff  Cons : Some non-smoking rooms still having cigarette smell / Rather hard to find the room at first as it is very huge hotel. / Crowded and noisy lobby / Of course, It is a casino hotel so some weird or offensive gamblers unavoidably be here too. / Quite high room rate / No convenient store in the hotel or even nearby …",40
One word for the place. Wow. It is an incredible place with everything within the building. Be sure to get lost in the hotel. Always carry the map for reference. The rooms and bathrooms are spacious and very well done. Plent of restaurants and cafes for the grub.,50
We went last year and trust me there is nothing to do and see in macau except The Venetian .....rooms were king sized.....there is something for everyone.....for kids....adults....there are plenty of option available for shopping and food....really a wonderful place for the whole family.,50
"The Venetian is in an area of luxury hotels in one of three Island of Macau. It has a casino at the first floor and have more than three lobby.  I tried to visit whole of The Venetian, but I could not because of being too large it is. I were impressed the most by The miniature Venice in the floor inside The Venetian. It is a large bustling shopping center with an artificial sky. There are many big and small brands of fashion, cosmetic there.  I stayed at 16 floor. The main decoration of The Venetian Hotel is golden. I saw the luxuriance everywhere. The view in the main lobby is really gorgeous regardless off day or night.  The Venetian is the most deluxe hotel I have stayed. I were very astonished all the time I were here.",50
"Very massive! Huge! OMG! Haha.... Beautifully made. Lovin' the paintings and the romantic feel of it. Even though there's a lot of tourists, still lots of fun to shop, gamble, eat and meet new people! 1 day visit is not enough. And take your time . Enjoy the place and the people. Cheers! ",50
"a well made lobby with its climate control roof, one is able to say whether its day or night inside the hotel . the rooms and bathrooms are largest compared to any other hotel in the world. the lighting with its waterfall makes it look amazing at night.",50
"Pleasant stay for the family of 5 given that all the rooms are suites to begin with. Common area good for family or small groups to gather to chit chat. However, we were locked out of the room briefly because of the deactivation of our keycards, which the staff attributed it to random deactivation due to security reasons in case we lose our keycards. Not the most believable of reasons, but we didn't pursue further. All in all, value for money and family friendly.  Wide variety of food at the food court area but be prepared to pay a hefty amount as prices are pretty steep. Artificial ceiling paints a blue evening sky all day long that gives people the impression that the day doesn't end. Nice for phototaking, especially against the ""canal cruise"" which one can choose to pay for a…",40
"good value for money, huge and beautiful room, nice view of the galaxy hotel, casino hopping, lots of restaurants and shoppes, huge bathroom, nice hotel smell, we were allowed for a very early check in and late check out",50
"Upon arrival at the ferry terminal, we took the shuttle to the Venetian. When reaching the hotel, we noticed that it is crowded!! The guests are mainly from China, so you can see the rowdiness of the crowd.  Front desk staff was polite enough. Stayed in the Bella Suite Cotai View room, and the room was huge!! And the view is not that great during the day, but wait till it's dark. Beautiful view of the Cotai Strip.  Went to the casino, and disappointed that there's no English used. I would have spent loads of cash if I understand what's happening half the time.  Not sure if there's a bar or nightclub in the Venetian, so went to another hotel's night club for drinks.  Will probably return again.",40
"Ultimate Destination For Casino Lovers, Family's & Shopping Lovers. U Experience Venis in Venetian. All rooms are suites and ultimate cleaned, nicely maintained, big bathroom. U feel like a king. We stay 2 nights. Great Indian Food In Cafe Deco. I strongly feel ur Macau tour not complete without stay in Venetian",50
"Stay only 1 night at this hotel and find that the hotel room is very nice.. and the good thing that we note from this hotel is the service of the staff. From Macau Outer Harbour Port, there are many free shuttle bus you can take to reach the resort. Check in time is 1pm, you cant check in early. When we were on the queue line for check in, I tell to one of the staff that I am currently pregnant, and they gave us the priority for check in. So that we get the room within 10 minutes. The mineral water is free, first you only get 2 in your room, but if you need you can always call to the receptionist and they will deliver the bottle water to your room. The concierge also very helpful. We ask everything, they gave the explanations in detail.  Thank you Venetian, we had a pleasant…",50
"The hotel is very beautiful. Our room was very nice, exactly the way the Venetian rooms are in Venice - opulence everywhere, heavy draperies, . Service was great including our breakfast room service. Would book here again should we visit Macau",50
"What an amazing place. It is very busy downstairs with lots and i means lots of people just looking round  but once up in your room it is very quiet.No problems at all checking in despite what i had read in other reviews, asked for non smoking room and it was. Room was amazing and the view overlooking the other hotels was great,My only problem was so much to see downstairs but didnt want to leave room! Breakfast in room was lovely, The queue was a bit long at times for gonodola  but we waited will early evening, Got lost in the complex a couple of times thank goodness they gave us a map. Shuttle buses were great.Staff were friendly and helpful. Would definately stay again.",50
"Fantastic building, amazing architecture.  The gondolas were a great feature and attraction for the whole family.  The food court was fantastic with choices of food.  The shopping was great and the casino was humungous.",50
"This place is amazing. Visited with my wife on a honeymon trip. Amazing service. Despite the crowd inside the huge hotel staff is very courteous and of course room are amazing. To be honest the malls, casino and the entertainment inside the hotel itself is so good that there is no need to visit outside. Except of course for the shows held at City of Dreams. If visiting Macau. Its a must visit to go to The Venetian. Indian restaurants are also there for the people who prefer only indian cuisine. The restaurant is also an amazing buffet. Amazing and memorable experience.",50
"We stayed here for two nights. The suite we had was huge..larger than a normal apartment and had all facilities but everything was just too artificial. This hotel is huge and we hardly left it in two days. It has many shops and restaurants to cater all tastes at reasonable prices.  The Casino is enormous by any standards but  very busy. The staff were all well trained, friendly and efficient and we appreciated the complimentary limo ride to the ferry. I felt that the hotel lacked entertainment such as you would find in Las Vegas and it is a bit isolated from downtown Macau  However two nights is enough for anyone. I probably will not go back.",40
"I live in Macau and I often go to Venetian for shopping after work...Today I bought some gift for one of my friends and wanted to get the wrapping service before I give the gift to my friend. I asked 1 gentleman from the Venetian Souvenir Shop whoes name I will not mention here where I can get the wrapping service. He answered me that I can go to Concierge for complementary service(unfortunatly it was a wrong information that the concierge didn't provide this service for a very long time). I was in a hurry and do not want to waste time so I confirmed with him 3 TIMES. I looked at his name tag and even remembered his name...I rushed to the concierge counter, Rose was in the counter and she helped me a lot. After she heard my story, she checked with her colleagues if they can wrap…",50
". Upon entering the hotel, you will feel the grandness of the place. It has everything. Since we only stayed in Macau for 1 day, we only got to go around The Venetian.The hotel has a shopping place connected or incorporated into the hotel. So that in itself can already satisfy me.  But the thing I love most about the hotel is their spacious bedrooms!!! I would definitely go back just for the rooms :)...  I can stay in the room for a day so I can truly enjoy it. Overall, i think The Venetian Macao is a lovely hotel to stay in , in Macau.  ",40
"The resort speaks for itself. The size is humongous. We also watched the ""beauty and the beast"" show there. And shopping is another option for family if u can't take kids to the casino. All kind of name brands are there. You can also take the Gondola rides as your thing to do. The gondola paddler could mostly sing in different languages. ",50
"We came here for vacation. When we arrive Macao, Venetian arranged everything for us. Comfortable limousine to send us to hotel. The staff is nice and effective on the check in so we didn't spend long time on it. When we go in our suites, it's amazing. They prepared the birthday and decorated with many balloons. We enjoyed a lot our stay so much! ",50
What an amazing hotel with over 1500 rooms. It's an all suite rooms 5 star hotel. They have an amazing breakfast spread and the gondola ride is a must do activity. Night clubs are all just walkable distance from Venetian. The suite rooms are very huge with a separate living area and top quality toiletries in the bathroom. A complete family resort. They have a Golf putting area as well which was fun. ,40
"That is a very great experience to stay in VENETIAN HOTEL, check in time only take about 5 mins, once get in the room was surprised by the HOTEL management. That's made me and my girl friend surprised, its decorate for us for honey moon trip. The room is big and clean and comfort. Definitely will go back and stay again even though the rate are high but worth it...  PS: Sorry for poor english",50
"Stayed 2 nights with wife and 2 kids. The place is massive. It's beautiful. It has loads to see and enjoy. A lot to keep the kids busy too. We loved the hotel, staff were very friendly and attentive to all our needs. The casino is off limits for kids so we had to walk around it every time but this was fine.  Having all the shops and restaurants under one roof is a very big added benefit as it gives you the flexibility of doing what you want whenever you like and being able to retreat to the rooms any time. Especially in the afternoon when it gets a little more crowded.  They have the Qube play area which is perfect for kids. Take socks with you to avoid buying a pair as it's compulsory for the kids to wear them. It's clean and fun inside with a lot of spread out seating for the…",40
"My wife and I just spent 2 days at the Venetian Hotel at Macau. At 1st we were disappointed, but then we realised that we entered the hotel from the East Lobby which is at the rear of the hotel, and not as lavish as the Main Lobby.  The hotel does not disappoint, it is everything its counterpart has in Vegas and more.  The location is terrific, close to the City of Dreams, which is still being built and in a few years will be as developed as the Las Vegas strip.  The only suggestion I can make is to stay in the South tower, which is located closer to the pools. From the North tower it takes approximately 15min walk to the pools via a very bland corridor setup.  Macau's Casinos are top class ( however no alcohol served on the gaming floors ), restaurants are excellent, the only…",50
The best place to be in Macau. Awesome suites. Super Clean and very well manged. The rooms are very well sized and views from rooms are great. Huge mall and great places to eat. Did not expect such good Indian food.,50
"The view from the room was just so so while the facilities inside the room was quite nice. Check in was very fast, this is really out of my expectation. I really spent a lot of time to find out the hotel, very beautiful.",50
"Staying in venetian hotel was itself an experience although its an expensive affair but worth all your money..dey will provide u free shuttle from airport or ferry terminal..rooms are like a fully furnished apartment..checkin could be a pain because of long queue..its a very huge hotel .. U can also call it a one stop shop .. It has a huge mall, food court, gandola rides and casino..it took us almost 2 days to see the entire hotel..u must stay in venetian if u r goin to macao..do visit casino(dey will not allow cameras inside)..and also go to club cubic which is like 2 block next to venetian- the largest and most prestigious club in macau..altogether an awesome experience..",50
Wow ..what a great hotel...huge rooms and washrooms  with rich interior...courtious staff giving  prompt service....good activity centre for kids ...huge swimming pool. .beautiful gondola ride...A must visit place !!!,50
"Like before, always very tired when arrived at the hotel because we take a ferry from HKIA directly. But the hotel ambience can always boost up our excitement. We booked directly at hotel website and got a special price.  The room given to us has a great view but due to the connecting door, it is quite noisy and we request to change to quite room with no connecting door (although the view is not the best) The breakfast at Cafe Deco is so complete and has a great taste, the shopping arcade around the hotel are very complete and in that time have a nice offer (sale around the mall at the time when our visit)",50
Was coming for a concert. Check in with queue number from the machine. I guess it is typical Casino Hotel. The hotel is SUPER HUGE. They at least has 12.000 rooms. The room we stayed is around 200 m2. The shower room can fit for the whole family.  Having dinner and getting around the hotel is easy. Just need to remember when get out from the hotel for getting lost.  Overall -- good experience!,50
"First of all, this is one of the iconic hotel that every tourist wanna go when they were in macao. The hotel is massive, got a mall, restaurants, and of course casino. The Room is big, really big. The bed, the couch, everything is big and comfortable. The service is good, except for the receptionist, it took us more than 45 minutes just to wait for the check in, the line is too long. The great thing is, the casino of course. You should try.. The only bad experience I had was I found 1 ripped condom packaging when I'm checking in to the room. They must be in a hurry to clean up the room with so many guests.",40
"We were not fortunate enough to get the suite of our choice as we planned to book the suite from hotel reception; It was full. The one they offered was too expensive. So, we took Sheraton (Just opposite to this property).  They have recreated the Venice (Italy) experience here in Macau. We experienced the Gondola for the very first time and it was overwhelming. The hotel is huge and so the shopping arcade. You name the brand and it's here... There are some signature restaurants and we have tried ""Golden Peacock"". An amazing Indian food restaurant.  Overall, It was a nice experience and hope whenever we visit Macau again, definitely it will going to be Venetian.",40
Hotel located with casino and others hotel which is easier to get variety entertainment with foot step. Hotel environment keep in clean and good condition although this hotel did manage many years ago. Friendly and manner customer service offer. Hotel did provide a lot fatalities which suit for family trip.,40
"Very luxurious hotel.  With many leisure facilities as well as shopping arcade, theater, gondola experience, various restaurants, shuttle bus service and so many entertainment attractions for all family members; The Venetian Macao hotel is one of the most recommended hotel.",50
I went here on the Jet boat from Hong Kong and then a bus rude from the harbour to The Venetian hotel - Its absolutely massive and has everything you can easily spend days just doing stuff inside the hotel without leaving - the Casino floor is big and was quite quiet - We stayed near the Top all the rooms are suites so they have big bathrooms with separate living space from the bedroom and the view is awesome! there a huge mall modelled on the canals in venice and all the top shops there - check out the conrad opposite swell theres a epic mall there swell there linked by a walkway that goes over the road between the hotels,50
The World's Largest Casino..... Definitely a must visit if in Macau.... if your a player then you must play... if not plenty of shops and nice restaurants to have a nice meal... great architecture.. everything here seems GRAND... .... the Hotel Rooms / Suites are magnificent........ walking distance to City of Dreams and Galaxy Complex... and The Cotai Strip....   ,50
"Rooms are awesome, paradise for shoppers, casino is best and damn big, gondola ride is the main attraction, please prefer express check-in as check-in takes time. You need time to visit the whole place and its worth..",50
A very luxurious place!! A bit costly but the memories will be worth it! I am very impressed with the huge room & all the things that surrounds the hotel.  Will surely book another trip in the future..,50
"Really great & luxurious place! Visited this complex for 6 times already. This time I stayed in Verona suite (150 sq.meters). It was really royal. Swimming pools were just fantastic! Check in was a little bit long, but check out was super fast. So everything were great and fantastic!!!! Will back for sure!",50
Venetian is a nice Resort Hotel .My family get more good experience for family's trip every time when we went there . I have visited Venetian over 7 years ago. Funny Happy Best Love Wonderful  excited  delicious,50
"It was a family bonding trip and we made sure we booked at the venetian, we booked at the family suite and we are impressed very nice room and spacious.The hotel is very nice and beautiful like you are in Venice,Italy .Likewise hotel similar to the venetian in Las Vegas. Great hotel. Very nice hotel lobby and hotel grounds as well as the casino.",50
"Hong Kong is beautiful and charming.  Old school  elegance and chaotic vendors everywhere.  Macao is nothing like that.  Huge and new and elegant and grand.  Everything is over sized and shiny.    The casino is magnificent, but the restaurants and pools are also gorgeous and relaxing.  Worth the trip to Macau if you've never been here.",50
"Stay here last week, suites very good, lots of gambling and I won money so that is good too! Roulette and black jack big winners for me. Nice service, huge hotel, they have a pool area and many shopping stores.",50
"Good hotel, excellent room service team. I would go back to stay for surely. Hotel provides free shuttle bus to many places such as Zhuhai terminal, Senado square, Macau international airport or even taipa ferry. Bellman team members are helpful and attentive except the bellman manager the foreigner girl at the main lobby on day shift was very rude without any hospitality in mind. what a pity I could not remember her name.",50
"Not wanting to be redundant as the title ill just say - Its Massive. A large casino on the ground floor with restaurants and shopping centres surrounding it, the resort also fashions a street like venice on the first floor. An artificial roof lit so nice that even at 2am you will feel its just 7 in the evening. The entire area has lots of brands to shop from and a centre canal for the lovey doveys who want to do canoe rowing. There is also a food court there to help with your midnight munchies. As for the rooms there are two wings in the hotel - North and South. You can view which you like. There are also various shows that take place in the resort which are a must watch. DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT miss out on them ;)",50
"Beautiful hotel, wonderful staff, helpful and courteous. Why not 5 stars,they need good options for breakfast. The suite we stay in was perfect, housekeeping excellent. The shops were fun. Room service menu left something to be desired. Needs some good options for snacks. I would stay again.",40
"Amazing Architecture, beautifully built, clean n safe. great variety of food at 3rd floor. hats off to casino and bellini bar n lounge.   great view of cotai view suites. enjoyed my stay to fullest.  was in Venetian during final sales period.... enjoyed shopping...",50
"We were impressed that every hotel staff we met was friendly, welcoming, courteous and knowledgeable.  Thanks for making our stay a good time, comforting and secure.  We will definitely stay in Venetian Macao again if we go Macau in future and will certainly recommend Venetian Macao to friends.",50
"Enjoyed a comfortable stay at this 3,000 room mega-resort. Though it is very busy with throngs of people everywhere; they have perfected the art of experience delivery at a mass scale. I was told other than the thousands of guests staying at this hotel, 80,000 people visit the Venetian Macao daily. You can see those tour groups everywhere on property, enjoying a piece of fake Venice in the middle of hot and humid Macao!  Arrival was a breeze. They have free shuttles picking up / dropping off hotel guests at the Taipa ferry terminal which is very convenient. Buses run every 10-15 minutes all day long. I checked in through the VIP Lounge and was immediately escorted to my room. My Rialto suite # 32-109 was spacious (1830 sq. ft.) and spotlessly clean. I was much impressed by the…",50
"Thanks to Lovely Guantinas (Guest Relations, Hotel Operations) arrangement. My family stayed at Venetian Macau Hotel w a special celebration on 30th July, 2015 - 20th Years Wedding Celebration. My kids all like the swimming pool (w slide) and Gym facilities. The room services is excellent, high food quality (but better if can provide discount by my casino card). Kids also played at Venetian qube w their nephew in-law (1st time) and rating it the best place for kids. No compliants on this Macau trip. We will definitely come back Venetian next time. Chees, Lo Chi Wai",50
"It was a birthday trip and treat for my girlfriend and the room was gorgeous. It reminded me a little of the E&O Hotel back home in Penang. Service in general was above average, considering that it is a humongous hotel with thousands of guests. The hotel is huge so guests will have to walk a distance to get to their room. WIFI in the north zone was quite sucky. I couldn't connect most of the time. But the regal room made up for it. Loved the PILLOWS!  The hotel itself will keep guests entertained for a day with all their shopping, interior design, and the interior canal. Outside of The Venetian, the City Of Dreams (COD) is very much within walking distance (directly opposite, in fact).",50
"Shopping, Casino, Fun, Experience all housed in one place. The interiors take you to a different country so well recreated!   Do not forget to ride the boat.. That's why it's called Venetian Macau. Total experience!",50
"I lived in venetain for my birthday with my friends. I got two rooms. The two rooms are just beside each other and can go through with a door inside the room. The room is clean generally.  But one of our bed smells a little.The services are okay. My friends and I went down to the pool in the morning. Not many people, only us and few of the people. The pool are some what clean. But I do not like the server at the pool because when I get in the pool, that lady told me to show the room key and I did. But she told me she needs the name who booked the room in order for us to get the locker. However, I did not know the name because my cousin gave the room as a gift to me under someone's name that I do not even know. That lady had poor attitude. So we gave up to get the locker.  I…",40
"Its really awesome nd away from d world,,a must visit for everyone who wants to enjoy all the fun filled activities at one place like shopping,live events,spa ,swimming Nd roaming through out the night in a totally planned manner with your family😊",40
"A great attempt at recreating Venice. A hub for shopping, attractions, casinos and leisurely activities. Rooms are well ventilated, with coffee makers . Wi Fi needs to be purchased and you get it for 2 devices per connection.",50
"The room is huge and fantastic, it comes with a living room (2 steps down from your bedroom), 2 TVs (one at bedroom and one at living room), huge toilet with lotsa mirrors to check out your OOTDs. However, the towel has a foul smell, I stayed for 3 nights, and 2 out of the 3 nights I had weird smelling towel. Changed it and didn't make a fuss out of it. However, the living experience definitely worth 5 stars.  The swimming pool is quite a walk away and they have multiple pools to choose from. The pools that allow kids in it, are quite dirty and murky. Went into one and tried swimming, visibility was bad due to the murky pool water. We then tried another pool that's solely for adults, no kids allowed and hence not many people use that. That pool was much cleaner for swimming.  …",40
"Spent our son's birthday weekend at the Venetian less than two weeks ago. We had such a great time and have been treated very well by all the hotel staff. From complimentary Limo pick-up service, to in-room check-in and fast check-out at the hotel lobby (no waiting!).   Hotel staff were very accommodating and greets you with a smile whenever you see them. The hotel guest relation staff even arranged a special birthday cake for my son. The cake was soo yummy! Thank you very much!!!  We stayed in a Verona Suite. Highly recommended for families with young kids. It has its own verandah were my son ran around and played sword fights with his Dad and Grand Dad. The suite is HUGE! It is conveniently located close to the Mini Golf Course (putting course), which we used a lot, and just 2…",50
It's a complete paradise with everything possible in it!! From check in to express check out is so smooth disciplined and systematic. The staff too go out of their way to help and bring a definite smile on your face! Rooms are totally Royal and their mall is a mesmerising world in itself with canal and boats with performances and food court along with top brands. This hotel has the biggest casino in Asia and must visit once! It also has the Venetian theatre and must must watch their shows!! I was lucky enough to watch beauty and the beast! It has one excellent Indian restaurant amidst many other world cuisine restaurants! Food was damn tasty! Also they have a Indian food outlet in the food court!! This hotel has golf course too! Stay here is totally worth every penny! They also…,50
"We spent a day and a half in Macau on business in June and stayed at the Venetian Macao Resort due to a friend recommending it and getting a great rate for a beautiful suite,  The check-in staff were very friendly and helpful, answering all of our questions and checking us in quickly and efficiently. We had a suite on the 23 floor over-looking ""the strip"" and the on site putting green and the room was fantastic! Our hotel room in Hong Kong would have fit in the suites bathroom with room to spare so it was nice to be able to stretch out and have more room to move.  There is so much shopping that can be done in the hotel that I'm not sure if we even saw all the stores as the mall just kept on going and going. It was neat to see the gondolas along the canals with the guys singing…",50
Really it a different and unique world   Fun# rides#casino# shopping # live shows# huge# walking# art# beautiful# must visit  #romantic# love#music#game# in one line- u really FALLING LOVE WITH THE VENETIAN... ,50
"The hotel was perfect for a family the room was very big and the beds can fit few people the mall was big and we could ride a boat this is the best hotel ever there are food court ,casino and many other facilities my family and I enjoyed there.  I will recommend this hotel.",50
"I have stayed here before. I love the place. Its grand, it's vast, it has everything you need, it has great service.   The canal boat ride is a joy everytime. The gondoliers are all amazing. Their serenade rings in your heart for many days after.   Rooms are equipped well. Food is good. Prices are just right. Yes. You must stay here atleast once in your lifetime.   Just few things that the management should look into.. All the mirrors in the hotel seems to be wearing off with dark spots everywhere. Cleanliness is not so good. And most of all.. the damp stench in the corridors as you exit the lifts to look for your room.. The toilets need more attention. A healthy and pleasant environment will be in tune with the magnificence of the establishment.   Good luck!! ",40
"Theres so much already said about this hotel that I could not add to anything new about it. Had a wonderful stay at the Venetian. Could not really check out all the places as its so huge felt like missed out a few things.  The different dining options,casinos,bars,shopping area and the whole Venice thing is brilliant. The pools are also very nice. Casino is huge but for a non gambler for me, not very entertaining as no alcohol is available here. The food quality at the food court are not good at sll. Infact below average. The in-room dining options are pretty good and very decently priced.  The free wifi connectivity is great through out the property as well. But yes, I do think staying at the Galaxy will be a much better experience for any first time Macau visitor.",40
The hotel is magnanimous and truly a spectacle in itself.  Picked up by a private car from  the Cotai terminal. Went through vip check in which was efficient and refreshments were served as well. Staff were excellent and professional.  Stayed in the verona suite that was roomy and comfortable. Specifically asked for a non smoking room which was fortunately made possible. The room was beautiful to say the least with vintage wall art and painting.  The hotel in itself was a spectacle to behold from the main entrance to the lobby up to the high end shops as well as the casinos! Exploring the hotel on its own as an itinerary would be an idea.  The Venetian shuttle busses run very often so it's pretty easy to catch and is free as with other hotel shuttles.,50
"First of all, THANK YOU for your arrangement & help, especially Express Check in Team, Max from Front Office and the Concierge team.  We can get the Express Check in Pass in the short notice, then we can enjoy the speedy check in process. Max gave me a pleasurable and memorable birthday night.  We love the ROYALE SUITE so much, which has Nice View and a wonderful bed.  I really want to buy this bed for my home.  Max arranged a Birthday Cake for me & the Baby bed for my baby.  Max & the staff are very polite, thoughtful and helpful. I forgot to bring my mobile charger.  The concierge team borrowed it to me.  The Shopping area is so huge & beautiful, but we haven’t enough time to see everywhere.  We must highly recommend all of you to have this amazing experience with this…",50
"We booked a Bella Suite for 3 days and 2 nights and got upgraded for free. We were greatly impressed by the large size of their suites! Aside from the room, the casino was awesome as well. I would like to recommend this hotel to every person visiting Macau.",50
"Our family booked a Bella Suite for 3 days and 2 nights. We were greatlly impressed by the large size of their suites! We were tempted not to go out because we loved the suites very much! Aside from the place, our stay was made pleasurable and memorable by the staff who have assisted us. From the check in counter, Ms Faith Lord was all smiles and very friendly and was always ready to attend to our needs. She was really good and kind. From the housekeeping, Ms Eliza was the one who made an impact on us because she was very accomodating and friendly. Our gondolier was Kapitano Joel and he made sure that our experience will be a memorable one. He sang very well too!",50
"We spent a night at Macau, staying at The Venetian.  It was quite straightforward to get to the hotel from the Cotai ferry terminal - the big blue Venetian shuttle buses were easily noticeable.  It's a huge hotel, and was crowded as we came in around 3pm. But the checkin process was reasonably speedy. Max was our checkin person and he was super-helpful. As there was an anniversary and birthday involved, he voluntarily upgraded us to the next level, and arranged for a cake to be sent to our room. He sweetly explained the hotel layout and facilities. It was nice to be welcomed this sweetly.   The room was gorgeous. Large, well decorated. Large and brightly lit bathroom area. It felt very rich and decadent.   The hotel was huge, and we barely explored 10% of it. It was crowded, but…",50
"The hotel is a duplicate of the Vegas version,from the look of the building up to the interior are all indentical. The rooms are so big that 4 person can sleep in 1 room. Each room has a small living room. The only downside is the tv is so outdated, the one in the living room is still a tube tv and the one in front of the bed has no usb plug. The mall is so beautifully decorated, has a blue sky ceiling and a godola ride inside it. U can find almost all the international big brands there. The Venetian also has a big theater that holds a lot of big name concerts and stage shows. Look out for events during your stay there",40
It is not a hotel. It is a mini city. It is so big that you will get lost. From casino to shopping to restaurants to pool area- its magnanimous. you have to really walk a lot if you are staying here. From room to pool area is a 15 minute walk with 3 changes of elevator. The rooms are beautiful and very comfortable. We stayed in the South Wing and the view was spectacular. The bed was very relaxing and the bathroom was regal. The room service is good. However they should have more staff and better direction board as i got lost quite a few times. Also the staffs need to fluent in English as its painful to walk for 15 minutes then ask a staff about direction and then either they dont know the direction or is hesitant to help the guest in the hotel. Some more staff with a proper…,50
"Our first visit to Macau, we decided to stay at the famous Venetian. It is great, but it is just too BIG (3,000 suites) and as a result, the service is not as good as it should be, it takes too long to get anywhere in the Hotel, the pools are a bit of a disappointment, and the Casino is just HUGE and is crowded most days. This is the first Hotel I have ever stayed in that took longer to check into than it does to checkin for a flight. The checkin counters are ridiculously busy with queues so long they had staff handing out water to people standing in the queues. This is the biggest casino in the World, so many people come to see it. That's exactly what my recommendation is; come to see The Venetian because it truly is a spectacle to see and experience, but don't stay here. It's…",40
"We visited venetian macao on my birthday...and can say it was the best birthday i ever had....suites and hotel is so beautiful i cant get over it....they also arranged complimentry B'day cake for me, which was really sweet of them,,,the staff is very polite and helpful...in breakfast there were many indian options...and you get everything under one roof shopping, casino..there is also one indian restaurant in the hotel named golden peacock.. we also enjoyed the disney beauty and the beast show...it was a wonderful stay at venetian",50
"Amazing hotel, very room is very big and classy , everything is over expectation and great. with Venetian theme, the mall and the room design is great.  I definitely recommend to stay at the Venetian :)",50
"Everything about the hotel is lovely. The canals, the shops, the decor, the ceiling, the rooms. Just amazing really. The opulence of it all is just amazing. Can't say more than that. Not very helpful. But seriously though, you should check this place out",50
"Cant get enough of this hotel casino. very amazing architecture. We had to check in on a certain place and to walk to somewhere east or west where the rooms were non-smoking. Long walk. We passed by casino area, so many players. The room was just awesome, clean, complete and huge. And Expensive. The food court area is also great, with the fake sky, you never know that its night outside. The venetian river cruise is also cool, but quite short, the rowers may sing. The place is surrounded with shops, clothings, branded bags and etc. You name it they got it.",50
"It seems that timing is key to visiting Macau. I have had previous pleasant stays in this hotel several years ago and thought to visit it again.  We went on the days before the New Year and found the complex too crowded with tourist groups spilling out of buses.  We ventured to other hotel complexes in the area and found them much more pleasant.  However, Taxis around Macau were hard to get especially for big groups like us. We had to rely on the shuttle buses plying the hotel routes to get around the place.",40
"This is my first review at TripAdvisor and I HAD to start with the Venetian. Stayed here for 1N/2D in June 2015 with family, and it was indeed a truly memorable experience. The place is so huge that the duration of our stay was insufficient to fully explore all that it had to offer, nonetheless, we tried our best to cover all that we could, despite the blisters and all!  I'll try to offer some handy tips on how to navigate easily through the place, and also share what pros and cons I personally experienced at the Venetian. Here goes!  Tips:   1) First up, The Venetian is simply huge, and so if you are with family members who are aged or unwell or for whatever reasons unable to walk a lot, then the stay here could be problematic. I know this first hand, as my elderly father had…",50
"I've stayed here during my business visit in Macau in May.  The hotel is luxurious. Suites are very comfortable and clean. Daily cleaned with care.  All you need is here: - free internet - working space (a desk, printer and all u need for a business trip. Feel yourself Ina small office here) - perfect service  - lots bars and restaurants - and of course casinos :)",50
"Good bits:- 1) mind blowing interiors with VENICE look, extremely photogenic place  2) superb show of disney's 'beauty and beast"" in theatre 3) excellently done rooms, complete with in-built office desk 4) polite and patient reception, concierge 5) excellent shopping option, gondola rides, food court with Indian food (indian spice express) , great gift shops to capture Macau experience 6) extremely well mannered staff, particularly on 15 July 8 pm show who helped us with tickets for the disney show. 7) cannot comment on gambling bit, as never went there ;) 8) had breakfast at ""bambu"" asian restaurant which was well appreciated by family.  Some things which could be fixed:- 1) reception looks 'busy' place ,so could appear crowded as general public get busy with photo clicking…",50
"Didn't have to travel all the way to Venice to experience the Venetians experience! We were only there for a day, was well worth the visit! Just love the ceilings!!! Felt like we were outside and yet we were well inside. Hotel's lobby area is always so crazily chaotic! The free shuttle bus is really great, the food court is excellent as the food pricing are much more affordable than the pricing of the food from the restaurants.",40
I have been to Venetian Macao during July 2015 I have opted for Bella suite and its was amazing experience I had during my stay the hotel has so much to offer that one need atleast 3 days to discover the complete hotel I really enjoyed my stay at hotel. The staff is also very cooperative they have given me higher floor and I had option for late check out as well,50
"Very nice family hotel despite the fact that there is a casino inside the hotel.  With many swimming pools and other children activities, we definitely enjoyed the hotel facilities.  In addition, it is quite convenient to walk to downtown Taipa.  The hotel also provides frequent shuttle bus to go to Macau or the Ferry port.",50
One remarkable thing about this hotel is their posh and Italian-themed interior. Luxurious rooms and outdoor Venice-themed food court are just bonuses. They've got nice pools and burning hot jacuzzis.,40
"The Venetian Macao is a 4 star plus accommodation..From the lobby entrance,artistic ceilings, the canals,gondolas ,singing gondoliers, and the likeness to St Marks Square  you feel like  you are in the midst of Venice.. We have stayed in the same venue in Las Vegas when it was brand new, 8 years ago, and comparing that experience the rooms do look a little tired now, but incredibly clean. The marbled bathrooms and bedrooms are enormous with a lovely separated space from bedroom to lounge/dining area...And the views are outstanding..The hotel staff were extremely helpful and where they couldnt understand English, they made every effort to help.Restaurants and shops are plentiful. We particularly loved the  Pub ''McSorleys"" and ate there a couple of times. There is heaps to do ,…",40
"Had the chance to stay here, what they say is indeed true. This is one of the best hotels in the world in terms of service.  The Venetian Shopping is at second floor of the hotel, and yes it is a labyrinth of shops.  You will not be disappointed of the rooms as well as the service.",50
"Spacious rooms! Wonderful view! Enjoyable pools and jacuzzi! Perfect for a comfortable and awesome stay! The most wonderful about this hotel is their Italian interiors and sky-painted ceiling. The food court offers a lot of choices. The casino is really big, and with a lot of machine choices. There are also free shuttle buses going to other hotels.",50
"Macao is known for its buildings , casinos , portugese heritage and The Venetian Macau Resort Hotel. This is a luxury resort Hotel owned by the very famous Las Vegas Sands who have similar property in Vegas.  The Venetian Macao is themed around recreating the Venice effect in Macau. Beautiful Murals have been made of the walls , vintage lights have been used and  ceilings have been adorned with great craftsmanship. It has approx 1600 suites , a Shopping Plaza inside , many restaurants ,some picturesque views and the worlds largest Casino .  On a day trip to Macau one must surely visit the Venetian and if you're here for a short stay , you can also stay at the Venetian to pamper yourself in luxury and style .  How do I reach there ? One can take the free shuttle service from…",50
"For the the luxurious......for sure, it has it. But it was too crowded, especially for the weekend. As i am not a gambler, this place doesn't satisfy me except for its clean, big and nice room with its shuttle bus, and it could filled with 2 children inside, so 1 room is enough.  All the stores around offer items in higher price compare to downtown store, which is the same. The food court quite nice, i prefer to have set menu, which is more valuable. The gym is amazing. O yeah.....one that i don't like is there is no groceries store or convinience store. ",40
"One can take time off for few days and just live here , specially if you love to gamble .you have the entire casino round the clock , great shopping complex with three other 5 stars under one roof , four seasons is one of them . You have Macao and Venice under one roof .grab it up here !!!",50
"We stayed at Venetian during our short one day trip to Macau and there was nothing that did not please me about the hotel, right from the size of the rooms, to the bed and the comfortable mattress to the view outside. As we were three of us, we opted for the Bella Suite - which was lovely with a separate seating area and a wonderful view of the city outside.The attendant at the reception was extremely sweet and patient to our needs. The property is wonderful right in the middle of the city and walking distance to all the major casinos and shopping. However, must admit one thing though, as far as the grandeur of the hotel is concerned, Venetian at Las Vegas is much more beautiful in terms of the art work and interiors inside the hotel.",50
Bestest hotel cum resort with extraordinary hospitaltiy for everyone.Palace treatment to visitors.Royale touch.All facilities are 7 starred..Pleasing soft spoken debonair staff quick to help you with smiles...charming looking staff...,50
"My wife and I went there in December of 2014. Two days two nights fantastic price. Amazing building with great decoration around that time of year. Fantastic casino downstairs, a canal running all throughout the building with singing Gondola rides! for the Manchester United fans there is a mega store. Many restaurants in that hotel alone has to be more I believe i counted atleast 30? probably way more than that. Walking distance to some of the local eating spots and touristy area. Taxi ride to Lisboa Casino in town.",40
"How can you miss with the huge, newly constructed Venetian Hotel rivaling the best in the world, much less Macau. So large there are canals and gondolas on the third floor and an 18 hole pitch and putt gold course on the roof!. Luxurious appointments in rooms, restaurants, casinos, and shopping areas you will never need to leave to have a great vacation.",50
"We a family of 5 recently stayed at the hotel for 2 nights. Its an amazing, superb and a beautiful property in the heart of the city. The spacious and large rooms with all the amenities are beautifully built. It is a very large hotel with lots of rooms. The mall within the hotel is another peak to the pride where one can also enjoy the gondola ride right within between the mall and shops. Inculding a lot of restaurants where one can savour with all the cuisines of the world, large casinos where you can enjoy full day and night and at lot of atractions. In all, its worth a visit whenever one reaches Macau.",50
Amazingly grand.. huge rooms. the grand canal give perfect feel of Venice. grand shopping paradise along with nice casino. Ambience and mood all set for party. For Indians they have Indian Restaurant. One big advantage. Staff is friendly and helpful. Strict with Check in Check out time so be careful with same. One of the best experience one must have.,50
"The best place to stay in Macau, we were considering btw Venetian & Galaxy, but this by far is the best place to stay. Not expensive & good entertainment options. Rooms are great & you cannot complain",50
"This is our second time staying in this hotel. We chose Verons Suite this time coz we wanted a big big room for our kids to run and play. The hotel arranged  limousine pick up for us. The people were wearing smiling faces from the pick up staff, receptionist, room service and everyone in the hotel. This is one very important element in making the stay more enjoyable.  The swimming pool was general but the hotel provided bouncy castle liked slide which made my kids excited.  The hotel is cleaned, well decorated and convenient. It's no problem staying in this hotel without going out for 2 days if you just want a relexing one.  Our kids requested us to come again and for sure we will!  ",50
Pretty is not a word . Its like you are living in a dream .The place is HUGE . And i literally mean huge .  The rooms are heavenly. The mini venice on the second floor is really made well .  The Gondola ride is a cherry on the cake . Loved staying in this hotel .  The Casino what can I say about it . Its crazy fun . The food court has food for every pallet.,50
"unbelievably big hotel at it's best.  huge,spacious,planned.  great options for spending time.  nice casino  reasonably priced.  love to visit again soon.  nice food options for indian visitors.  plenty of hotel buses to transport u from hotel to different casinos in macau.",50
"this is a destination by itself. i am particularly strict with the accommodation hardware and it did not fail me. cannot recall when it was opened and started operation but the suite was still in good condition, and true to it's Venetian theme.  did not partake in the f&b or breakfast since i booked room only. all the facilities that one would require are on-site and there's nothing to complain about... maybe only the size and magnitude haha",50
"palacial hotel, suites are absolutely opulent, service good but not as good as HK, the hotel is absolutely huge and pretty self sufficient. I found the people in Macau not to be as friendly to foreigners in general, not as willing to assist, and far fewer people that are not Asian there. Also less English spoken. A fantastic hotel in the middle of nowhere really, just other huge hotels- the trip by shuttle into Old Macau very much worth it- a fantastic ethnic Portugese experience, great food, laid back. Interesting mix between the huge magnificent hotel with its own canals and Venician land and skyscape, all inside, and very expensive.......then the outdoor old town full of authentique charm and real people.",50
"Macau is a very glitzy city. The entire place always sizzles with the bright lights of the various casinos and towering Hotels that surround it. However Venetian is a cream of them. A landmark like none other in the city, which symbolizes the ultimate luxury. The entry is a bit complicated since its a big hotel cum casino they have to have a well managed way to entertain people. The receptions are pretty confusing considering the Casino is bang in the middle of the ground floor. Once you receive the keys and check in clearance which I believe was a bit on the slower side, and reach your room after confusing sections its another world altogether. Overlooking the city or the Cotai waters, the room is like a palatial suit, with living areas sofas two television and super…",50
Weird but impressive - it is about the  whole idea of building another Venice . It is manufactured like smartphones or clothes or  factories - one for a customer and one for themselves.  Packed with gamblers.,40
"Doesn't matter how many people are here, it still looks empty. Not allowed to take photos in casino area. But when you can take a photo the results are spectacular! Great Murials on the ceiling just like its sister casino in Las Vegas.  Tip-catch the free shuttle from the airport.",50
"This hotel is so beautiful and filled with lots of entertainment, food places. The restaurant price list is on a high side.   The hotel room is super spacious and really fit for a king stay. Was amazed with their bathroom and deco in the room.   Definitely recommend to stay here",50
Booked a show package for a suite & was joined by my mum & my son (6).  Beauty & the beast was fantastic.   Positives: didn't need to leave the hotel. Great breakfast & dinner options. Concierge staff were v helpful with bookings. Suite was huge. & the package was very reasonably priced.  Negatives:  we got lost multiple times. There were no floating staff to ask for directions.  Our suite had an outdoor courtyard which hadn't been cleaned.  There was rubbish & an ashtray full of cigarette butts.   But overall we had a great time & will go back ,40
"Great facilities, awesome & cheap midnight yum cha, massive casino, impressive breakfast buffet and very clean and spacious rooms. Affordable luxury! The gondola ride was relaxing and transported us to Venice so to speak. Great escape and highly reccommend this hotel.",40
I have visited Las Vegas few times and stayed in Different properties . This is my first visit to Macau Venetian resort . We stayed in a royal suite . It was huge and amazing with its huge bed bath and living rooms All exclusively done . Breakfast was sumptuous,50
"Hubby and I traveled on 27 to 30 May 2015.  Upon touch down at the Macau Airport, we could’ve taken the shuttle bus provided by the Venetian Hotel to the hotel itself but hubby insisted on taking the cab.  It turned out to be a big mistake as it’s only a short drive away, less than 10 minutes.  The cab driver almost couldn’t believe himself when we told him we wanted to go to the Venetian and he looked none too happy about it.  In the end we paid him double to make up for the supposedly wasted trip he had to make.  It was supposed to be about MOP30 but hubby gave him all the small notes we had, which was HK60) - Note: Taxi drivers there, especially older ones, are grumpy and rude.  Young ones are friendlier and more polite.  Checking in was a breeze.  The counter staff at the…",40
"Had an amazing experience of stay at Venetian. Simply out-of-the world experience, like never before. Amazing Ambiance, nice food, friendly people, and everything you would expect on a wonderful holiday. This place made my trip (and money) worth an investment.  Thanks Venetian.",50
"The hotel is very beautiful nice ambiance lots to do.food court, shopping ,brands ,fun areas, restaurants, casino,bars,cafe,shows,all in one place no need to go out of hotel. Kids like shows . breakfast with dream land films characters. Love to see all kids hero's live . inter connect with other hotel also. room are Awsm ambiance suits with sitting area big tub in bathroom bar service in room fully loaded in one hotel.can't see full hotel in one visit. Really very big hotel.",50
What's heard is seen. Its not just a hype - u need to stay and experience this property. Got an early and smooth check in - rooms were as royal as they appear. Although its a long walk from one place to the other but then there are eye catching and interesting things which keep u busy and u hardly feel the distance. Shopping in outlets such as h&m is cheaper since the price is same as hkd and mop. Overall satisfactory stay with nice memories ,50
"good: very luxurious feeling.  shuttle bus straight from ferry to hotel, extravagant lobby and hotel design, bellboys complete with uniform etc, hotel staff everywhere.   huge room, again extravagant design, comfy beds, huge bathroom, adequate bathroom amenities, loved the bedroom slippers,  super comfy and thick. but no laundry bag, I really needed it=/  do try the wanton noodles at the food court it's good(just don't mix all the oyster sauce in, way too salty)  lots of shopping at level 3  bad: NO CONVENIENCE STORE NEARBY AT ALL the concierge recommended their giftshop which also sells some essentials, and a bottle of water cost HKD60!! the casino gives out free water but I felt bad (and embarrassed) lugging so many bottles up to my room.. I would have bought from Taipa…",40
"Spending the holiday in the Asia's biggest building is itself a great experience. Great Show, Superb hospitality, Excellent Management, Highly luxurious rooms etc etc. Will visit Macau again only for Venetian :)",50
"I had heard many things about this hotel before staying there, but in our case the experience was all positive. Whilst there was a queue at check in, staff were chatty, provided waters, sweets and a fan. Our room was well presented, just like the photos and not showing any sign of wear and tear. Turn down service was nice and we we slept well. We did not hear people in the corridor during the night as others had mentioned. The swimming pools were very quiet and the adult only pool a nice touch.",50
"The Venetian is a complete hideaway for a family needing to be together. We love the exquisite design of the hallways and the golden details of the suite. Everything is great here in this hotel. For a shopaholic like me, going out of our suite is a great opportunity to browse through hundreds of high-quality stores. The casinos here have a festive air on it unlike other hotels' casinos in Macao. In The Venetian Macao Resort Hotel, there's always a festive atmosphere that sets it apart from the others.",50
"This is huge hotel with every thing grand, from lobby to malls to rooms. I would like to break down my experience   TheReception: very crowded reception as hotel is huge and always crowded, it can be pain to do a checkin or check out, you may do express check out but for checkin you need to stay in que. The staff was very good and courteous, they do consider your status and situation and you may get upgrades.   The Room: I haven upgraded to bella room which was apt for family of 3, great room you will fell the luxury and grandness.   Service: The Room service and housekeeping was very slow but accurate, you will get what you want but it takes time  food and other amenities : you have hotel restaurant but best is you have food court and many more restaurant for eating out and…",40
"It's simply awesome.  We reached macau from HK and in comparison it's huge and decently priced.  The whole experience was great.  Boarded the bus from the ferry terminal and reached the hotel.  The checkin process was super smooth and we were shown into our rooms. They only have suites and the smallest of them too is huge and very pleasing.  Apart from rooms, it's got huge shopping and eating options.  And yes don't forget the casino too.  If you don't want to, there is no need to step out of the hotel at all and can lavishly spend your time indoors and relax thoroughly.  The checkout was even smoother with dropping the keys and a comment card in the drop box.  They are doing a fab job of managing this huge property. And we just loved it.",50
"Superbly done. The setting & architecture is similar to Venice, including a small river & gondolas with singing boatmen. The ceiling is covered & looks like the sky. Restaurants were good. We had gone around Christmas time & the decorations were superb.  Nov 12",40
"We stayed in the hotel for a day on 5-6 May 2015.  Fantastic experience.  You may book the hotel through Tripadvisor with all meals inclusive in Coffee de co restaurant withing the hotel.  It will cost Rupees ten thousand plus.....worth much more than that.  The hotel has a fantastic ambiance. Though the place is famous for casino, no need to play, but one can enjoy the proceedings there.  Great design overall.  The simulation of Venice in the hotel and the model are treat to watch. It will be a life time stay in the hotel with its beautiful surroundings.  The staff are friendly, and highly courteous.  The bottle water, the coffee / tea packs and the bath room packs are free, but for that everything inside the fridge is highly expensive.  Better to avoid the items in the fridge.…",50
"Very nice hotel, the room and the bathroom are very spacious. Comfortable and well designed. Friendly staff, warm and courteous.  Make sure you ask for the map and do not get lost in the hotel.  Shopping and food are very convenience as you can have it the hotel but he food is much more expensive compare to outdoor restaurant. If you are looking for beer, i will suggest you to buy from outside instead of the food court in hotel. The different of price is like times of it.",40
"Staff were very friendly, warm and courteous. Room very spacious and beautifully  decorated with complete amenities. Many different cuisine restaurants and shops at ground level and casinos. Nice swimming pool area.",50
"I visited the shopping mall and the casino at the Venetian. Shopping mall has a great design. It is a little Venice. You can even take a tour with a gondola and enjoy the songs of gondolier's such a soprano or a tenor. Also inside the mall ceiling is decorated as the sky and sun never set. It is not possible to understand what time of the day it is. You can get abandoned when you go out in the middle of the midnight :) However I don't gamble, I visited the casino to see what's going on. Casino is huge indeed. It is not possible to see the other end when you are inside. What I don't get is the tea service with milk as complimentary. I didn't see any alcoholic drinks :( This shouldn't be the attitude for a casino which has the biggest casino area in Macau (they say the biggest in…",40
This has to be one of the best places to visit in Macao. The casino is huge and the setup is the same as that of Venice. The stage performances are amazing. The place to play casino is also big. It's quite amazing the way it has been designed. It's a must visit place in Macao. ,50
"One of my travel consultant friends call it the biggest bus stop in Macao and I totally agree as it has all the reasons why you should visit this place.  This trip was the second time for me to go to Venetian but it's my first time to actually stay and try their hotel room.  And after a night of staycation, I'm glad I made the right decision.  Here are 3 reasons why you should stay here and not just visit the resort:  1. It's an all-in-one place!  From Casino to shopping to dining to shows/events a quick stop will never be enough! Even a day was not enough for us to explore the whole of it, it takes a lot of walking and it would be a huge advantage if you are staying there as you will not need to rush and be selective of the places you want to visit.  2. It's nice to indulge in…",50
I stayed for 2 nights with my daughter in a suite that was supposed to be a non smoking room but it was stale and it smelt of cigarettes. The room it self was huge and beautifully decorated but the wi-fi gave us nothing but trouble. The staff did do there best to try to rectify the problem but it remained intermittent for our entire stay. As its such a huge hotel I felt it lacked the personal touches you'd perhaps receive elsewhere. Outside our room well it's a city within itself! It's actually quite amazing but be prepared you will get lost! ,40
"The Venetian hotel and mall is a must see in Macau. You can easily go to this hotel using a free shuttle bus from any ferry terminal, border gate, and from Macau Airport.  First time arrive at the hotel lobby, you will be amazed of the luxurious interior. From hotel lobby, follow the sign to go to the shopping mall. And again, you will be amazed of this Venetian/Italy like environment inside the shopping mall. Food and drink were every where. There also one big food court inside this mall, with huge varieties of food from around the world. But the price were not considered cheap. You will need at least 3 hours to enjoy the mall, took pictures everywhere, before you continue your travel to across the road hotel, the Sands.",40
"It was really a Majestic stay at The Venetian Resort. It made u feel as if u are in a royal palace. Its true in actual as its in a pictured view. Had a wonderful experience in using their services. Lots of shops for shopping, casinos for elders, kids play area, restaurants, etc… all under one roof!",50

Anyway, some smoking smell has been occasionally happen.  -Very good service from guest relationship team who has helped in providing birthday cake and annivesary decoration in the room  -room is big, neat, clean and comfortablr.  It is a very great and enjoyable stay.",50
"As we expected before, this hotel is very amazing. Good interior design inside room and also overall hotel. Exterior environment good for taking picture. The hotel integrated with shopping mall. Many restaurants, branded stores, and of course the casino. Quite busy when check in, however it takes not to long time cause they prepared many check in desk. This hotel provide free shuttle bus to many destination, like Taipa ferry terminal, Macau ferry terminal, Macau airport, etc. We stayed in Bella Suite with 2 double beds. Very suitable for family.",40

"during our 3 week thailand trip we decided to go to the venetian hotel in macau china for 3 nights.the first thing we noticed when we got to macau was that the people were not nearly as nice and friendly as the people in thailand,with that being said we still had a great time at the venetian, they were a bit more friendly than the typical people of macau. The hotel itself was impecable. It is an exact replica of the venetian hotel in las vegas. Every room is considered a suite although there is no kitchen in the suite, but the bedroom is large and you walk down 3 steps to another large living room and even the bathroom has 2 rooms.  There are plenty of places to eat here,many restaurants in the food court and a la cart restaurants thru out the complex.there is a very large…",40
Initial arrival at the Venetian was quite hectic..we arrived at the Hotel West Lobby and was confronted with so many people. Once we found the baggage services we left our bag as our room wasn't ready.  We found a restaurant and had lunch which was ok.  The attraction of the hotel is the internal canals complete with singing gondola rides.  The lines are quite long but worth it if that's your thing.  Pool was too far from our room and once we did finish the trek (600m+ one way)..the pool was underwhelming but clean with plenty of sun lounges. WiFi was free and good speed.  There is a Kids Club called Quebe I think it was called...extra charge but all the kids that came out were very excited and happy.  The kids club is near the pool...quite a distance from where our hotel suite…,50
"A resort unlike any other, with two small 'rivers' included. The words most apt to describing The Venetian Macao are huge, grand and luxurious. The rooms are big, and the ambiance is great. The only drawback was that some of the staff were rude, as if we were troubling them by asking something or were treating us like a herd of animals. This isn't expected of a hotel with such a reputation. Other than that, the overall experience was great and one that must be on your bucket list. I would definitely love returning back to The Venetian Macau.",50
Hello everyone i am back with another review  I was on a holiday to Hong Kong and Thailand I had stayed at this hotel for 2 days as per my itinerary in Macau This is too huge and there system is bit different from other hotels i have stayed  They don't provide spl pickup from hotel as they have shuttle service at airport which is well organised  On the Arrival we were given few Coupons which where very helpful  As we had requested for a non smoking as despite reconfirming at the reception they gave us a smoking room on non smoking floor After calling for 1 hr they shifted us to another room and for the hotel manager gave us complimentary drop to Macau terminals. As we had to go to Hong Kong by different terminals the chauffeur dropped us on wrong terminals  We had to take a cab…,40
"wonderful, luxurious atmosphere. once you step in, you're never gonna wanna leave ;) the shops are great albeit a bit more expensive. had a funny incident there at the casino when the guard asked for my ID (apparently he thought i was below 18) lol my companions and i got a good laugh over it. never leave without trying their gondola rides!",50
"There isn't much to see in Macau,so The Venetian is the saving grace of your trip.This is the main highlight of Macau.The entire hotel is filled with families having an extremely fun time,having casual banters and the social atmosphere is energetic and there is a conducive bonhomie.The hotel is filled with mirth,fanfare and gaiety.The property extends for vast expanses and the hotel room equally great and amazing.The only problem was the bathroom which was a bit of a squalor.There is the main attraction here:Gambling,Shopping. Even though the hotel features top brands,everything is so exorbitantly priced .The 2 main casinos are wonderful and the stay was really memorable and fruitful.The pools are so beautiful which gives a view of The Venetian.The staff were so amiable.The…",40
best hotel to live in  this is more type of mall than hotel. best thing in hotel is casino  if are fond of casino  this is the place for you its las vegas of asia indian food also available   rest.name peacock serves indian good food..its expensive  but worth it,50
"The atmosphere here in the evening is amazing, especially in December. There are live band performances, a small movie clip projected on the wall of the hotel. This place is known for it's casino, and it is indeed a large one, but I didn't enjoy the atmosphere there( Not a casino person). Take a walk through this place if you're not living here. ",40
One of the most interesting place to be. Great rooms with amazing views. Nice architecture inside the hotel. They have a big casino. Highlight of the hotel is Gondola ride. The resort is very big and has many restaurants,50
Dont think anything just book it   Handsdown this the best hotel in macao  forget rooms size even the bathroom area can be equivalent to my bedroom in mumbai (lol)  Just wanted to sit back and enjoy the room   Huge huge humongous hotel .one can easily get lost in the hotel if not having maps   Its almost a big shopping mall with a hotel attached to it   Restaurants named fogo  samba and golden peacock serve lip smacking indian  delicacies   I must say its better than some indian buffet I tried In mumbai   Casinos I wasnt allowed to go there  But my father had a fun time there but it surely looked amazing from an elevated level  Overall one should really stay at venetian only if they are going to macao  ,50

Proceeded to Priority check in was met by Jo Jo at check in offered a welcome drink after normal check in procedure, was given a map of the hotel, Proceeded to 32nd floor, had the Bella Suite the suite was large and spacious with a view of the cotai strip, the view is great even better when the light show starts, the rooms are well appointed but are starting to date. The hotel is massive you need a map to get around if you are traveling with any one under 21 years of age you cannot take the short cuts around the casino, there are plenty of up market shops if you are looking for a place to eat there is plenty of food outlets on the 2nd floor,…",50
"Its a huge hotel with a large shopping mall. It is one of the biggest casinos in the world. It has far bigger setup than any casino in Las Vegas.   Almost all luxury brands are present there. All rooms are suites. Good big size, good view from suite.   Its pretty big so you walk a lot. Many restaurants are there.",50
"A visit to the Venetian Macao, is a holiday in its own right. The entire structure housing the casinos, shopping districts and hotel is insanely colossal to behold. But it doesnt end there, every wall, ceiling and corner is artfully decorated either with statues, carvings and paintings akin to a Royal Palace just as so many has referred.  I say this is a holiday it its own right because of the sheer pleasure and excitement alone to explore this reosrt. It will even outshine any other activity you find outside the hotel within Macao.   Now to the room, as many has stated the room leaves no stone unturned when it comes to full amenities. But this is also where the drawback stems. As the laws of statistics would have it, the more items/amenities you introduce, the higher the chance…",50
"We had a perfectly wonderful experience, way above our expectation.   Check in was a pleasant, friendly process, not usually encountered at most hotels. After knowing I was traveling with an elderly, the lady attending to us arranged for wheelchair and safety arrangements in our room even without me asking.   The room was simply huge and luxurious ! We had a lovely view too. So nice we didn't want to step out..  Will certainly return !   ",50
"Have been here twice, i enjoy their all suit rooms. Stay there for 3 nites, very good linen and down comforter, the best about the bed are the pillows, so comfy. I want to purchase it, but they dont sell it. Its a big resort its fun and lots to do at every corner of the resort. i think only the down side is its too big to explore. there are shuffle bus takes you to other casino and also the Macau(downtown of the city), make sure you visit Taipa villiage, take the free shuttle bus to Galaxy once you get off just walk cross street, theres lots restaurants. price is more cheaper than you have meals at the hotel. ",50
"Loved the shopping, food, rooms, casino and the pub. The Indian food was alright on the buffet nothing great. Hotel is a city by itself, not much helpful direction signs to move from one part to another, kids area is chargeable and if ur keycard stops to work, you have to go all the way to the reception to get another, they do not deliver another one !!",50
"A self-sufficient with everything you need for relaxation to entertainment fully available. Love the space of the room and especially the size of the bathroom that is amazing, felt like a royalty when I was staying there. Be prepared to pay for whatever that you're spending there to be of an above average price in Macau.",40
"We did enjoy our stay in this hotel , our room is Florence Suite. We enjoyed harbour pick up service, the driver is nice and polite. Thus we have fast check in, the VIP room is great. We will come again",50
"Upon arriving at Macau from the port, we rode on the shuttle of The Venetian. Almost all of the hotels have their shuttle. We took the west lobby entrance. As we arrive at the hotel, we were welcomed by their staff. I can feel the hospitality and another plus is the scent you smell as you enter the lobby doors. The first thing that you would notice is the ceiling. it is very high. Like a palace. It is huge. As we went to the center, of the hotel, paintings in the ceilings were very stupenduous. I heard they paid italian painters to paint those. The room was huge and cozy. Enough to sleep up to 6 people. I have never seen complete toiletries like they have. Up to the needles and the like. If you plan to visit the casino, bring your passport with you. they will check it upon…",50
"There is a bus that takes you directly from the ferry station.  The place looks great.  Lots of shopping and great food, many different cuisines for great prices.  I got some pho noodles.  Another plus ( for me anyway) was the ban on smoking.  Be sure to bring Hong Kong dollars, the machines only accept them.",40
"it's too good hotel ,best location ,top hotel service . very good Indian food . never be lucky in casino. best for family .  if you alon traveler you also can get company from casino .  I will like to visit this place every year  ",50
The scale is huge. Checkin is 3 pm but it takes almost 2 hrs of process. Astounding staff on Reception. Yukti Upgraded us to the Bela Suite on Higher floor and also with good View. Shopping vouchers provide are very useful and they give 120 HKD vouchers  per Adult for Tax Refund also.   One needs a Map if u really want to see the Hotel. The Artificial Skyline is amazing. At Food Court u should try Indian Spice Express and Pizza Pizza. Largest Shopping facilities but costly. Good Food and Breakfast spread. Very convenient transport arrangements ,40
"Although is new customer and only stayed one night. The staff treat you very well, outstanding services fro your arrival until your departure. The room is spacious and offer all amenities you want. Water is provided but i guess you need more, you can always get it from the casino for free. Comfortable stay and sleep, the bed is good and big enough. The room is clean! Accessibility is good, can hop in the free shuttle bus to the city or other casino (If you want to go St Paul, hop in a bus to Galaxy hotel, then take Galaxy free shuttle bus to San Ma Lo, Venetian has discontinued this route).

"Right from arriving at the macau ferry terminal, our trip was a luxury sort of stuff. the shuttle buses were waiting right outside of terminal and it took us 20 mins to reach the hotel. the check-in was over within 15-20 mins. inspite of a queue and I was told that there were 3500 suits in the hotel. the 5th floor market place was a paradise to roam around and it took us some time to realise that the sky above us was artificial. Finally the bella suite given to us was ultimate luxury to live into.",50
"I'd go back just because the rooms are spacious and you can practically just stay within the hotel and have tons of dining experiences (aside from the casino). I've only been to Macau 3 times and can't even remember the hotels I've stayed in, in the past.",40
This is my second visit to Venetian Macau. One of the best hotels. This time we were with kids and trust me it is more enjoyable with them. so much to do around. Ahh if you like to gamble this casino was also great quite and calm. This time the only thing which i didn't like was the Swimming Pools they were not maintained properly. I will not deduct any marks due to this as there were attendants trying their best but the construction in the near by vicinity is a major issue for this. I would surely go back when in Macau. Lastly i saw an Eiffel tower being built nearby.,50
"The biggest and the Best Hotel with lot of things to do inside the Hotel itself, Casino's Shopping, Getting a feel of Venice(which is Crappy). Visiting real Venice is Stupid. Save your bucks and Visit Venetian. Excellent Service Encounter. The Best Bed to sleep out of everywhere I have been",50

"Too huge and beyond expectations. Stay at Venetian wouls surely make your trip worth a lifetime. Simply perfect. It's actually more than a hotel. Hotel that doesn't sleeps. Shopping, restaurants, nightclub, roaming around and amazing rooms.",50
"Stayed for a day in this fabulous hotel. Got upgraded upon check in. The room was huge with a separate sit out and amazing views of the garden.  The hotel in itself is like a small city. Difficult to see everything if you are here only for a day or two...  The Casino is largest in the world in terms of floor area and has games to suit varied interests. The slot machines are literally countless.. Though I was dressed in semi formals, saw a lot of tourists in shorts and flip flops. So dress code is not strict..  Amazing stay.. Highly recommended  ",50
"We didn't check-in actually. We just went there to try the gondola ride in the canal with a song from the rower. The hotel was huge and beautiful. I'd love to go back there one day, and hopefully, check-in. The ceiling of the hotel lobby was majestic.",40
"This trip was for our 13th anniversary and we took our little ones along this time! Venetian kindly upgraded our room and with an excellent view. They decorated the bed with ""hearts"" and rose petals.... not to mention that they sent us a suprised cake for our celebration too... with a little card of blessing! The express check-in and check-out is effortless and we simply in love with the mindblowing property! We will come back for sure!",40
"This was by second  stay in venetian as i was not disappointed at all.  Room size and services always 5 star , makes you feel like a king in a suite with all the amenities world class.  Food was just great , breakfast was a lavish spread.  For all indian looking for a lunch or dinner don't miss a chance to dine at golden peacock at west side lobby for excellent veg & non veg Indian food .  Over all a great experience .. try to take room facing the galaxy it has one of the best view on the higher floor.  thank you venetian for the excellent stay",50
"They should call it a palace! Its mindblowing ! Its Venice recreated in a hotel complete with the grand canal, gondola rides with a song and guitar truly Italian style. Everything is as grand as it gets, from the lobby to the rooms which are all Suites, the bathroom, the pool, the golf course, casino, the restaurants and the food.Iits simply worth every penny you spend and you never feel like stepping outside the hotel. The grand canal has all the luxury stores you can think of and for people on a budget there is also a food court at he same level. You can also do your duty free shopping right here. The service is impeccable especially the HouseKeeping. Keeping in mind that the hotel has 3000 rooms, the maintenance was immaculate !!  3 cheers to the soldiers who run this…",50
"It was our 7 years anniversary so we took our little one for a one-night staycation at the hotel. They kindly upgraded our room to the Bella Suite, which was huge and beautifully designed with a great view. They even sent us a small cake as an anniversary gift - how sweet and thoughtful. The express check-in and check-out service were very helpful. We totally enjoyed our stay. There were plenty of shops and restaurants nearby. Hotel provides free shuttle buses to almost everywhere in Macau. The swimming pools were more for family fun as they were not standard pools, but good for the little one to have enough fun, and it's with a beautiful surrounding to relax a bit. Also if the hotel guests could enjoy the free access to Kid's Qube that would be lovely. All in all, we had a…",50
"We had our offsite business meeting here and this hotel is just great in every respect. Perfect for holidays and family thought. After work i tried to locate low limit poker table but there were only 5 and always busy. I believe galaxy is good if you wish to go for gambling but for family and fun time, venetian is one of the best hotel. Their gandola ride and theme is simply superb.",50
Check In: We were not allowed to have an early check in so we left our baggage with them and looked around the Venetian. The only downside is that the check-in/lobby is so far from the rooms. It would be better if the check in counter is actually nearer.  Rooms: Rooms are huge with very nice amenities. Beds are comfortable. The view from the room is great. Bathroom is also huge. Downside for the bathroom is that they do not have any bidet.  Mall: Mall is huge with so much to offer.   Transport Service: They also offer free shuttle service to almost all parts of Macau.  Definitely will still choose this when I go back to Macau.,50
Such a memorable experience to have stayed in this luxurious hotel for 5 days. Hotel rooms are situated NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST wing of the hotel with the same arrangement so better take note of your Room or you are sure to be lost 😀 Shops and Foods are equally elegant and tasty with food court to suit your budget and taste 😀 Friendly staffs 👌👍,40
"Stayed here for one night. During a recent stay in Hong Kong I left for one night. Taking the ferry over, only about 45 minutes. I have been to Las Vegas lots of times. And, unless you walked outside you wouldn't think you were in Macao. The place is huge, with restaurants, shopping, and yes lots of gambling. The rooms were very large, and nice to stay. Well worth the price for my room. One could easily sleep you kids in there too with a rollaway bed. I enjoyed my stay, and would stay here again. ",40
"Venetian is one of the most expansive hotel I've stayed till date . It's so huge that one can easily get lost in it . It's grand and beautiful with huge reception, casino and expansive shopping areas with canals and gondolas. But the hotel staff and functioning is impersonal bordering towards rude. It's like one is staying in a glorified dharamshala. We had to carry our own luggage to& fro from our rooms . When you stay there you feel that all services are for high roller casino players. Suites are large and bathrooms are larger but all in all when you go to Macao stay in a smaller hotel and visit Venetian just for fun..... Staying there is not worth it",40
"The Venetian hotel was really huge and its was so great. Smells so good and very impressive and very vast ceiling masterpieces. The hotel was a one stop shop - suites, shops, restaurants and casino.The people was also nice.",40
"Venetian Macau is an outstanding property in every way. We visited in summers of 2015, were a party of five including our 8 year old son. A lot has already been said about the amenities and grandeur of the hotel so would rather spend some time rebutting some of the points raised in previous reviews.  Venetian is a huge hotel with close to 3000 rooms. There are bound to be some queues during Check-in, Check-out and Morning breakfast. One can't expect to just turn up, be greeted by name and shown to a table at a hotel like this. Venetian is a lot better than many other huge hotels we've stayed at, like say Atlantis, Dubai when it comes to people management. Our check-in took 20 minutes despite queuing up behind ten other guests and the morning breakfast queues that looked scary at…",50
We stayed at this Hotel last week for a two day trip to Macau. The sheer size of the Hotel cum Casino cum Mall is mind boggling and sometimes confusing however once you check in all seems pretty simple. After pickup from the ferry terminal by hotel coach we reached hotel in 10 minutes. We were a family of three hence has requested for an additional bed with a delux room however we were given a free upgrade to a palatial room with two Queen Sized beds and the best of amenities. Reaching your room is confusing specially when you have kids as the casino limits use of the Level 1 area. Room had a spectacular view of the adjoining Hotel Sands. Thry gave us complimentary Macau $ 800 coupons and return ferry tickets. These coupons can be exchanged for meals/items from designated…,40
"This was the first time we stayed here although we have been to the Venetian several times before. The complex was huge, with mall, casino, restaurants, everything, and it is reachable by shuttle buses at the ferry terminals, from both Macau city and Taipa. It did not take long for the check-in. The room was huge, breathtaking as soon as you saw it when the door's opened. Our room has a large living area by the window. Bathroom was spacious enough to allow a few people using it at the same time!! It's a luxury to stay there just for weekend but we believe it worths the value, especially when you have the time for a nice tea nearby the window with the view of the Macau city under the sunset. There are lots of choices on hotels in Macau but we will definitely come back soon.",40
"The room is spacious. The architecture of the bldg is well thought. It is like living inside a dome protected from the elements, free from gusty winds and rain.It is an all weather all day and night shopping mecca. The price is reasonable. The service is very good.We will go back again in the near future. ",50
"We just celebrated my husbands birthday at the Venetian and were spoilt with a suite upgrade to a higher floor, birthday cake and a late check out.  The service was fantastic, the room beautiful, and the dining experiences memorable.  We were very grateful and impressed by the Venetian.",50
You need two days to get hand of this place in entirety. It is so huge and so many things to cover.   Casino is best in class and you would spend hours in there without any regret(cash loss might be a regret) :P  This hotel give samples food options ranging from specific restaurants to food court. Macau isn't too huge so location isn't a problem either. Hugely recommended!,50
"We stayed in Venetian hotel for two days . check in que very long they started at 3 pm we were tired from flight & ferry, I requested lobby manager for early check in he was a English speaking Europian guy,he helped us & taken us to vip lounge and got early check in , I felt obliged.",50
Venetian is exquisitely designed and beautifully constructed.It was so surreal that you could forget your mundane troubles while you are strolling around the massive property. I was lucky as I visited the place on a Monday. Thus it was not so crowded as compared to my previous visit. ,40
"The hotel was so big and you can lost your way easily.  The hotel shall considered to have a clear direction sign for guest, especially when talking about North, South or West wing. The room was very big and the price of this hotel was not cheap.  However, I found meals were terrible when compare with its performance.  Other than the food, this hotel can be graded as average.",40
"The stay was my best stay ever . I went with my family and had a ball.the rooms were very spacious , neat abd clean . The staff was very nice and helpful. The food was also very yum . The ambience of the hotel was very nice . I loved my stay in this hotel . Everythkng was perfect . I will come again with my family and i will surely recommened this hotel.",50
"Room was spacious, pillow, bed very comfortable! A bit pricey but you'll get your money's worth when you enter the room and feel very royal! There's tons of visitors in the hotel too!  The bathroom is huge!",50
"Stayed at Venetian for 2 nights to celebrate Anniversary. The check in at the reception was quick & the receptionist provided us complete details about Venetian - Rewards Package details as well as the details of Shuttle Bus Service.We has booked Venetain Rewards Package - suite room with choice of breakfast or lunch and 500 HKD per night.    The rooms were big enough with all modern amenities. The hotel had massive shopping area, food court & huge casino. The food at The Golden Peacock (where we had lunch) & Cafe Deco (where we had breakfast) was good. Both of these places had good Indian options.  The hotel provided shuttle bus service to various casino hotels as well as the ferry terminals",50
"Collen and Golden from South Lobby Front Desk made our fantastic stay start, they both polite, friendly, attentive, focus and anticipate our requests. The FO manager(?) tall guy personally handing out candies and water while queuing for check in was memorable. Thanks all for your warm welcome.  The Bella suite is very cozy and lovely, but wifi doesn’t work well.  Recommend Golden Peacook, near South Lobby Receiption if you want to try Indian food in Macau. The staffs very friendly. Foods so tasty.",50
"I cannot remember the map inside this hotel. Its very big area, connected with mall and casino. We also have trip by gondola boat (similar with in Italy), but indoor experience. I also enjoyed experience  Manchester United shop, because we are the fans of MU football club! My son bought MU shirt, and print his name on shirt. We may enjoy experience in food hall, lot of food with acceptable price. You cannot say that you have ever go to Macau if you never stay in this hotel.",50
"I stay two nights in the Bella Suite and it was wonderful, the ""super big"" hotel is totally amazing with stunning view, great facilities and stuff, it is so luxury that you might feel treaten as a king (or queen)  Sunny, the reception who handle us upon checked-in was doing his job well to explained about the suite location through the casino, however, he forgot to ask whether we travel with a minor or not, we finally took a detour from the main entrance, but don't take it to the heart, I believe he's a good guy, he just need to smile often, cheers . . . Sunny . . . cheers!  Kiki, at the concierge if I'm not mistaken, was totally helpful when we have ATM incident, one of our friend's debit card stucked inside the machine and won't come out, she did everything she could to make…",50
I loved the place... it was like a palace... huge rooms... huge passage... casino... amazing artificial clouds... fake colourful windows for a sense of depth... only being a veggie... food was a disaster... gambled and won... amazing packages... could ve been better- would love to stay for longer!,50
"I have been here and stayed in the deluxe suite for 2 days and my stay was perfect. I felt like a royalty here. The ambience, the environment and the casino is just wow and I even found an Indian restaurant here (yay!!!). The staff is friendly and suggest you sightseeing options. They also arrange  (they have packages) the sightseeing tours. Overall a marvellous stay.",50
Very friendly and easy check in. Well organised. The rooms are some way from the check in desk and the signposting in the hotel can be confusing. It will take a good 10 to 15 mins to get to your room.  The rooms are all Suites and excellent with amble room and all mod cons. Room service was great as was the food.  A very busy hotel with a massive shopping area but be prepared to walk!,40
it was an outstanding experience for me and my family to stay at this hotel. It houses world class facilities and the rooms were great. Leisure activities are awesome here especially gondola rides. We had a great time in macau.,40
"Stayed in Venetian's Rialto Suite and was surprised that check in was quick and easy during the Christmas period. The Suite was super big and spacious, 1800sq ft. The bed was a bit of a disappointment because it was not as big as I expected for such a large room. For the price I paid, it was a good deal, so can't complain. Sands group of hotels offer good deals yearly so watch out for them.  This is my second time staying in the Venetian in Macau. It is a huge place and you can easily get lost. Have lots of shops and their food court offers variety if you want a quick bite. The Bambu is not worth going as their buffet is one of the worst I have ever eaten.",40
"I had booked two bella suites and we were very happy with everything...from the check in, room service etc. I want to give a special thanks to the security staff, outside conceirge and the pool staff. I had left my phone in the cab and how they helped me track it down goes beyond regular customer service even though it was not their concern. I want to specially point out for Ms. Nora, who went out of her way to do all she could to help me. Despite this incident, my stay was very comfortable.",50
"You have to be well prepared for check in with your own guide map. The staff would just point you to the same direction that is eventually a complete circle. Meanwhile don't expect someone to help you with the luggage either. They expect you to travel light, it is not their fault if you don't. There is East, West, North and South Wing. Make sure that your taxi drops you in front of the right one. Once you conquer all the obstacles and reach the right desk (Though none of the staff members care much if you do but they will just keep asking you to not stand and obstruct the way while you are clueless and asking your way about) you get your keys within seconds. Even then don't expect that you will be helped with your luggage.   Ones inside the room, it is a pure luxury.  From…",40
"We were a group of friends visiting Macau. We booked about 5 rooms for four days. This hotel is awesome !! The deluxe suites were unbelievably good, the casinos wonderful...and the ambience great....The place will make some of the Vegas hotels look out of date..Food at Golden Peacock was simply superb...better than home (;->)",40
There is a shuttle from the Ferry at Taiba port and Macao port. The hotel is massive to say the least. You could end up getting lost and confused. The rooms are just fabulous and royal. The pools are good for the kids. The play zone is at a price. The Gondola ride is expensive but not to be missed at any cost. The casino is huge and a heaven for the gamblers. There are lot of cuisine options. A food court houses a lot of variety of foods.  A two day stay at this Hotel is recommended. The entire experience makes  You feel like a King. ,50
"We booked two rooms for our family trip last May 18-20 2015. It was a great experience and we will probably go back.   Pros: - The hotel have everything. Mall, Casino, souvenir shops, duty free, restaurants and access to other nearby malls and hotel - Spacious rooms  - Free shuttle from/to the airport and port area - Good breakfast buffet choices -Complimentary pictures in the main lobby, with their exclusive photographer.  (You must buy the photos tho)  Cons: -Very crowded lobby -not enough floors security. Anyone can go to whatever floors they like.  -Considering that we mentioned that some of our guest are senior citizens they still booked the room farthest to the elevator.",40
I had booked a royal suite for two nights. Stayed with wife and two children. All of us loved the suite. Each and every part was amazing.  The shopping malls were huge. We got lost almost every time because of the sheer size of the malls.  The gondola ride was great. The gondolier sand some great songs. It really caught us by surprise when he spoke a few hindi words and in the end came up with a hindi romantic song too.  There were heated pools which was great since there was a nip in the air. The children did not want to come out at all.  Overall a great experience. Highly recommended.,50
Huge Hotel that you will get lost. Would suggest to go with a room at the top floors to get nice view especially on cotai strip side. You will still be left over with unexplored places inspite of staying there for days. Huge casino makes you occupied till late hours.,50
"Overall experience is good, impressive room size and comfortable bedding.  Lost and found department is excellent and helpful.  Reception desk is pleasant and satisfy our request.  The advice for hotel improvement as follows: - frontline of housekeeping staff speaks Mandarin only, could not communicate with English or even Cantonese (their local language) - noisy plumbing (shower head) and slow water flow - outdated TV system, no HDTV, small size.  Total two TVs, but one of them is a CRT TV! - no free access for kid's facility (for our room rate over US$400) - noisy AC unit",40
"Just wanted to share that the luggage services in The Venetian Macau are no longer free. They charge HKD10 per 24hrs.  The bus service they offer is also commendable, especially coming from the airport and going to the ferry station. The terminal to ride the free bus at The Venetian can get a little crowded after lunch because there are many tourists wanting to use it. Queue for the taxi is also very long.   The food court also offers cheap eats. Suggest to get there early ahead of people wanting to have lunch because it's hard to get a table.",40
"This is a beautiful, pulsing hotel. Inside and outside you can find little Venice and it is really very nice. The room is spacious, clear and the King size bed is the must comfortable I have ever tried :) The hotel offer shuttle bus service to the port and to the city center.",50
"this is the best hotel i have ever stayed in my life...i booked this hotel online from agoda,as i was getting an excellent deal of royal suite for only 10000 INR,i kept it surprise for my wife, and the moment she entered the lobby,she was so happy, and the moment she entered the room, she really loved it...amazing hotel,beautiful is small word to describe the room.it gave us a ROYAL feel.casinos were amazing.the shopping area,which is covered by an artificial sky and a man made venice looks is just amazing.with all the major brands and a variety of dinner options at food coaurt, it completes the hotel...we missed the beauty and the beastg show, as we were short of time but will definately go for it next time.",50
"All I can say is that if you happen to visit Macau, you have to stay here. The Bella Suite Rooms are very spacious and it has the biggest casino in the area. For first time travellers it gets a bit confusing to find your rooms, as its a very big property and ppl tend to get lost, but once you get the hang of it its no problem at all.",50
We are staying at The Venetian at the moment in a Royal Suite.  It is very luxurious and nice to have a living room separate from the bedroom.  All amenities are provided in the bathroom and they are great quality.  The bed is comfortable and the room is 70 sq meters.  You have to walk through the Casino to get to all the rooms.,50
Best family stay option in Macau as we all enjoyed a lot . We stayed in bella suite it was perfect  an Indian restaurant was also available in the Venetian mall near the north suites. Awesome experience it's almost a replica of Venetian in Las Vegas,50
Our trip to Macau was the final stop on our tour of China.  We arrived in Macau on the Turbo Jet and once we exited the ferry port we easily found the complimentary shuttle bus to the Venetian Hotel.  When we arrived at the Venetian reception it was really busy but we were impressed with how efficiently they dealt with the queue of people and the guy that served me was very helpful.  As we made our way to our room it was very clear that the hotel looked practically identical to the Venetian in Las Vegas.  The difference being that this hotel was newer and also that when you hit the casino you were not overwhelmed by the smell of cigarette smoke.  Our room was really nice - it was a suite and was comfortable and clean.  Again pretty much the exact replica of the Vegas room.  We…,40
"Stayed at this hotel for 1 night (22.04.2015) Trip didn't start in the best way. Arrived early morning (9:30am) expecting an early check in which I had asked for and was told I had to wait until 3:00pm. Having a meeting at 11:00am, this was unacceptable and after much discussion and getting extremely annoyed, Max comes to the rescue. I'm not sure if he is a manager or just a staff member, but Max was able to diffuse the situation and find me a room, so very thankful for that. It's strange that a hotel with 3000-4000 rooms doesn't have a room available at 9:30am, especially when it had been requested in advance, but thankfully everything was sorted.  The hotel/resort itself is MASSIVE. Not too difficult to navigate if you know where you want to go as there are signs everywhere,…",40
"If at all you decide to go to Macau,stay in Venetion hotel is a must.You will enjoy every moment of u r stay,Food at Fogo Samba is good,Being a vegetarian,they have lot of it.Overall nice experiance.No need to buy water bottles,they r giving free.",50
Excellent hotel with very good staff. I personally liked that the check in & check out were done so effortlessly. Without any hassle. Also they explain you everything very clearly & are ready to help if you have any queries. Concierge is too good as well as there luggage service. My luggage was in my room before reaching the room. Just too good.,50
"Hi, my girlfriend and I (both 26, Male and Female, London/ Staines UK) are travelling over two weeks through Hong Kong and China. When staying in the Venetian, I was blown away by how impressive the hotel is and how incredible the staff were. There isn't too much I would say but beautiful hotel but my luck on the tables only came out at the MGM.",50
"At a conference, food resort, rooms etc all good. Enough restaurants close by that delagates are spoiled for choice. For quality food I would stay around the hotel,  have eaten in twice at local venues, whcih have just beenok.  The town centre only about a 20-30 minute easy walk away has enough history etc, that you can do a simple team building - with a race around the world style.  Make sure you give your delagates a easy map of the hotel, as it is big.  The grand canal with the gondolas could seem tacky, but qt the same time it is pretty ok.  So over all ok, but limited activties outside of hotel.",40
"the size gets you. the glitz , the shows, the expanse to explore it's breathtaking. the shops are mostly high end, the food court friendly and enough cuisines to choose, very affordable too. the check in n checkout services are streamlined and extremely efficient. enough hotel staff all around to assist you with directions. ferry buses a plenty. great choice of restaurants and pubs especially the Irish pub",50
The VENETIAN hotel at macau is the best hotel here. The hotel suit are king size and the staff here is very kind and very honest. The venetian concierge members are very kind. Michelle #26515 supervisor Bea# 57546 team leader & weston #32154 team leader Ken Su #52980  receptionist this members have helped us so much And I will  like to visit again and again.I am again thanks to  the staff member.  Dr Harshad Raval.,50
A huge hotel must say. The main attraction is d casino. Macau is just for casino crazy people n d fortress is Macau Venetian. As I was told its has d world's biggest casino. The hotel has pool n jacuzzi was d best one. The golf course z nice n worth visiting. The restaurants has Indian ones also n I loved golden peacock d most. The shops r great n connectivity wid all the other places are good. Go Macau go Venetian.,40
"This is the copy of the Vegas hotel. The rooms are very nice,  the hotel is a big mall. You can't axpect any personal touch. It is great experience to sleep here. The breakfast is basic not more. It is lacking the Vegas athmospere but it is nice  ",40
Huge suites well appointed. But long walk to rooms from main lobby. Very good small golf course view from the room. Indian restaurant golden peacock at the basement level. Food court for other cuisine. Good breakfast at cafe deco. Massive casino for gamblers. Lots of shopping. Kids activity centre. Gondola ride. All in all if you want to stay in the middle of huge shopping complex then look no further. ,40
"Let me begin my review through a background:  In May 2006, I went with my newly formed family (my first daughter was just 5 months old) to the vacation state of my country India - Goa. And I chose the best that Goa had to offer - Taj Holiday Village (now known as ""Vivanta by Taj). Me, my wife and my 5 months old baby enjoyed 5 nights of bliss in that garden by the beach property with a sea-view villa. That was the most luxurious holiday of my life - a holiday that we still remember vividly and very soon want to repeat.  Cut short to May 2015 and I booked 1 night in the captioned Resort - Hotel. And must I say... the luxury of this hotel has topped the luxury we were provided by the Taj.  Absolutely superb!!!! Amazing!!! No need to go out of hotel because there is nothing in…",50
They released affordable rates that why we booked this hotel and they exceeded our expectations. Everything was very clean and spacious and the staffs handled us very well. We highly recommend this place.,50
"For quite sometime i have been wanting to visit this resort and got the chance recently and stayed for one night and also witnessed an international show at the  a 13,000 seater arena inside the hotel on another night. This place is something...simply awesome. I can say it is probably the best ever Hotel i have stayed in. Overall the property is spread over a huge complex. one can easily get lost in the hotel as i did. This All Suite Hotel has 3000 'suites'. These are really luxurious to say the least . The bathrooms are the sizre of some of the rooms i have stayed in Hong Kong ! Check in most efficiently handled and staff greet you pre checkin and direct you to the staff behing the counter. They take pains to explain the facilites and provide you with a map of the hotel.The…",50
We capped our vacation with a weekend at Venetian after Bali and Hongkong stay. Perfect check-in was followed with the Best Hotel Room that we have ever stayed in during all our previous vacations. 34th floor with a beautiful view by day and by Night. The food court provided all that we could have asked for. Shopping experience was beyond our expectations. Needless to say we would love to get back any time.,50
Could not express my appreciation to this place.  Words are not enough. Have visited and stayed to this hotel three times and the excitement was always like the first time.  Staff are very nice from check-in counter to housekeeping.,50
"The first thing that strikes you is the sheer size of the resort. Undoubtedly the best in Macau so far. (MGM is coming up next door, so thats something to keep an eye out for). The rooms are extremely spacious, with fine gold leaf detailing in the walls and fixtures. We booked the bella suite, which overlooked the Cotai strip, giving us a good view of the other hotels and the main entrance of the Venetian. It has some amazing restaurants (Veg food lovers, you have plenty of options here). Entertainment options are aplenty. There is also a huge shopping complex with outlets of all major international brands. An attraction is the venice style gondolas that wade through the shopping area. However, we didnt find it to be too great, but a good idea to replicate all the same. The…",50
"my friends and i stayed here the room was nice.but i actually wanted to specify the check in process,its a big hotel yet they accomodate you very efficient.you dont need to go out actually coz of its hugeeeee shopping center!we got lost many times.perfect replica of vene.vegas.great place!even if lots of poeple weeing around its still really worth to stay or visit this hoootel.",40
"The Venetian is as grand and opulent as they come. Well appointed rooms with a sofa bed to comfortably bed three people. Plethora of food, shopping and entertainment options available.   Wonderful location with the city of dreams and the hard Rock Cafe just across the road.   Great connectivity to all parts of the city through their fleet of coaches.   Must stay! ",50
"I have been to the Venetian two times, and I have been very satisfied with the service and the amenities in the rooms - two televisions sets, a mini refrigerator, a spacious living room and well appointed comfort rooms, the fittings of which are all shining brass.  You also have a wi-fi in the room, an iron, an ironing board, a bath robe, slippers, hair drier, a kettle with complimentary coffee and tea.  The view, at the 36th floor,  is breathtaking.   The restaurants within the hotel are also real nice like Mortons, Bambu, Lei Garden and Cafe Deco.  I also like to watch the gondolas at the Grand Canal and hear the gondolier sing some operatic love songs. What an experience!",50
"This hotel is so amazing! It gives you that great feeling that you are in different world. So magical! It is so grand, it makes you speechless for the first couple of minutes and then all you could say later on  would be, WOW!! #neversettle #keeplooking",50
"looks like i have seen venice in small place ( not that small for a hotel though) ! my god , how do they manage it i wonder and of course gandola ride , must do it  , even if it is not included in your package , you must experience it , shops are expensive though and golden peacock is the best place for indians!",50
"This place is HUGE. You could use golf carts to go from pt. A to pt. B. Its not a hotel its a fair that you can live in. Everything about this hotel is grand, the lobby, the casino, the food court, the canals, the outdoor arena, everything amazes you. Its like when you are at the venitian you can spend days and days at this place without stepping out and still miss a few things. The hotel is great, i had a suite which was beautifull, at the 22nd floor with amazing view, the room service and the food was great. needless to mention the biggest attraction is the casino. Though i didnt spend a lot of money there but i thoroughly enjoyed. Must visit even if you decide not to stay there",50
"The hotel is so big. You cannot finish roaming around for 1 day.  There are so many shops and restaurants inside the hotel/casino.  Hotel rooms are big.  Bed and pillows are comfortable.  Service is great.  We asked for an extra pillow and blanket around 1am, housekeeping delivered the stuffs in less than 10mins.",40
"From the time you arrive at the main lobby of the Venetian it amazes you - the structure, the service, the ambience. The staff at all stations of this huge property is exceptionally courteous and make you feel special.  The suites are impeccable and what size!!! It's worth every penny of what you pay.  Of course, they say it has the biggest casino in the world today.  However, it takes you more than a day to familiarize yourself with this large spread out property to find the shortest way around.  If you haven't been to Las Vegas, this one is a must visit. ",50
"A very impressive experience, with beautiful decoration, luxury shopping, several very good restaurants in the neighborhood, good bar and entertainment in Bellini Lounge, magnificent outdoor heated pool.",40
I stayed in Venetian but forgot my iPhone in rest room at lobby of Conrad. If you ever been to these properties you know how busy they been. I never expect to get it back because of the crowd however with security of these properties under same owner and well connected I got my mobile back. Thank to all staffs. ,50
"This is one of the best hotels I've ever been. My room was on 34th floor, but was on the backside of the hotel. Magnificent sculptures, beautiful marble beams, glossy flooring. I was given the Bella Suite. Marvelous malls, interiors and a great casino!!!!",50
"We enjoyed our brief time at the property. While we did not stay overnight at the hotel, we grabbed a snack and some souvenirs at the Starbucks. The staff were very friendly and there are always cabs present in case you need transportation. The lavish decorations in the lobby are breathtaking and are worth the visit alone.",40
"This hotel is an exact replica of the Venetian in Las Vegas.  It has great shops, the canal, food court, amazing rooms, superb beds, and great entertainment.  Macao is a very small city that is still developing.  This hotel and casino is probably one of the best on the Cotai strip.  Lots of eating choices and good service.",50
"We stayed in this hotel for one night and that is the best stay we had in any hotel. The check in process is smooth. All the rooms are large and spacious with palatial bathrooms. The restaurants, casino and shops are amazing. Good Indian foods are available at restaurants like Golden Peacock, Fogo Samba & Bamboo. The free shuttle coaches run every 15 minutes to a number of locations. Overall atmosphere is excellent.",50
"Staying at The Venetian is like being in the middle of all the action. Having spent our past few vacations at relaxing beach-resorts, the lively atmosphere at The Venetian was the exact opposite...and we certainly enjoyed it!  TAIPA FERRY: We arrived at the Taipa ferry terminal via Cotai Jet ferry from Hong Kong and took the free shuttle bus to the hotel (official frequency was15 mins but sometimes may take longer ...nothing worrisome though).  RECEPTION: We arrived to a sea of people at the reception! Despite such huge crowds, the staff was going about their business smoothly. We were told that the check-in would start by 1:30PM and we could deposit our luggage with them. It meant we had an hour or so to kill. But it was not an issue as there was such AMAZING ARCHITECTURE…",40
"Had a fun visit here, we were staying across the road and came to see the Circus they had visiting. Very entertaining and then stayed for the fireworks show at night! Enjoyable day out and lots to offer here including shopping and many restaurants to choose from!  Family friendly environment bar the Casino area!",40
"I got the best hotel stay experience at Venetian, Macau. The place is a city in itself. Good restaurants, bars, Casino, Shops. You can find most of the popular brands inside. Free shuttle from Venetian to other casino was also an advantage. Had a great view of Macau city from my room. Overall i had an awesome outing in Macau.",50
"A huge place and a tourist attraction in itself ! Everything is grand in scale and opulent....but a few chinks here and there !  Stayed 2 nights in April, along with a friend-couple. Our luggage was tagged through from Bangalore to Macao and this was a nice surprise when we checked in at Bangalore. Immigration at Macao is a breeze and the turbo jet ferry journey to Macao from HKIA is very nice and FAST, with free wi-fi on board !  Getting from the Macao ferry terminal to the Venetian was a bit of a hassle with so many buses, a bit of a confusion and taking our luggage along the narrow walkway to the buses could be a bit of a struggle for older people or those with kids or heavy luggage.  The Venetian is a huge place, more than 10 million square feet ! And so, a lot of walking to…",50
Stayed again at the Venetian. Crowds were lesser in the casino. Overall a good experience. Room service was slow during breakfast time.  Were living at the Paiza club which has very high level of hospitality,50
"One of the most amazing hotels i have ever visited. Beautifully interiored. Shooping, Casino, Relaxation, Shows all under one roof. also has connectivity to Four Seasons and Cotai. Loved my stay. The rooms are very spacious and beautiful. also the hotel has an indian restuarant so vegeterians have no problem at all. staff is extremely hospitable. my favorite is the shopping area and the gondola ride at the shopping area.",50
"My friend and i decided to book a large suite (as there was a very good deal) and another one of our colleagues joined us and booked the standard room.  We were picked up from the Ferry and taken into the VIP lobby which was lovely and then given refreshments whilst our keys and check in was arranged. This was managed beautifully and efficiently and were told we had been upgraded to the next suite up,  so entering our room there was a lovely pair of double doors and a huge lobby with a bathroom off to the right of the absolutely living room... which turned out to be very useful with 2 women sharing a room.   The bedroom was very nicely appointed with a dressing area, another much bigger bathroom that was very well equipped.  The hotel arranged cars for us to another hotel for…",50
Hotel room is awesome. Pools and Jacuzzi are nice. The casino is great. Has an Indian restaurant right next to the hotel lobby. Also has another one is the food court where Jain food is available. Perfect place for people to relax. Easily accessible by ferry from HK or China.,40
"Stay at Venetian in the weekend with girlfriend. I booked a Royal Suite, which actually is not a suite but a bigger room split in living room and bedroom. The hotel was opened in 2007, so we also expected that the hotel condition is not new, but surprisingly the room is much worse than expected.   The room was 27 floor, so the view is quite good. I have to mention that the room amenity is not matching 5-star standard. Quite a lot amenities need to order through operator, so this is one of the things can improve in future.   Hotel staff are friendly and very helpful. Concierge gave us some good restaurant suggestions in Taipa, we finally pick the Portuguese restaurent 10 mins walk from the hotel.  Cotai has many new hotels coming up, so Venetian is facing big challenge with its…",40
"In my opinion is it hard to find a Hotel with better Service, cozy Apartments and surrounded by very nice Restaurants. Also iam very impressed - if you have special wishes - the staff try everything to help or Support you(in my case a german newspaper (very hard to get in Macao) and i got the newspaper very quick. The Suites are very large with nice Interieur and perfect clean. The ""Venetian"" my first choice.",50
"We took a free shuttle from the Macau ferry terminal to the Venetian. The Venetian is beautiful, especially the canals and the ceiling inside. We spent about 3 hours to visit the hotel. The staff were friendly. The restaurants at the food court were NOT good. We took a free shuttle to the Taipa ferry terminal.",50
I am sure this is the best hotel I have stayed in till now. As we see the services and the antique and unique interiors it surely appears as a value for money hotel.. I can compare this hotel with Burj al Arab and atlantis without any doubts. especially i loved the roof where it seems like it is daytime but its actually night outside... resembling the ceiling at hogwarts..,50
The hotel was on the Cotai island of Macau if you come from Ferry or Airline you can use the free hotel shuttle bus to go there. The management of the hotel was superb! Because they have so many guests everyday. They use the computer system to manage your baggages since you arrive at the hotel the bellboy will help you carry your baggages and give you the card with barcode that you must present at the check-in counter and when you get the key card you just approach your room and the bellboy will send your luggages to your door. The grand canal shopping area were so big and have everything you want to buy there. The hotel room so beautiful and have everything you need. The bella suite that I checked in was so nice. They have so many restuarants in the hotel. If you wanna go to…,50
"my husband and I stayed at the Venetian Hotel for four nights recently. The service was excellent the whole way through, from check in to check out. This place is massive so be prepared to do a lot of walking! Our room, a Royale Suite was very spacious and comfortable. While we aren't into gambling on a regular basis, we did have a little fun (and a small win) playing roulette. We would recommend Portofino and The Golden Peacock for a beautiful meal with great service. The shops are more ""high-end"" designer stores so if you aren't a millionaire it's still good for window shopping. I just wish that Macau had more ""open-air"" bars outside as being inside got quite claustrophobic. A pleasant experience all round.",40
"Went there with my parents & sister. Have selected Venetian Hotel as we heard quite a good review of this hotel. To our surprise, this hotel is better than expected.  The room can fit up to 6 people, as it also comes with a sofa bed. The room is clean, toilet & bathroom are clean too. When we first step in, we know we are going to enjoy our stay there.  However, there is only 1 thing to note, their wifi is bad. Though my room came with complimentary wifi, i have not been able to connect to the wifi at all. So, it is basically like no wifi at all.  The shopping & casino are so convenient. The view of the shopping are just awesome. Though you might not get a chance to stay here, no harm to just go shopping and take some good photos too.   If given a chance, will really recommend…",50
"We arrived early at the hotel around 12 o'clock. We quickly found that check-in was not open until 3 PM, however very efficient staff collected our bags and held for our return. We returned to check in at 2 PM and was greeted by efficient staff who checked us in. Quite a distance walk to our hotel room however this is to be expected in such a large hotel. Room was large and finished to a high standard, and no real issues. Public areas are very nice and sometimes over the top and all the shops are hi end and some quite expensive however well worth the experience. Huge gaming area and excellent restaurants throughout this hotel. Macau was great to visit however one or two nights would be enough.",50
"Although it is getting old this hotel is still a place I prefer to stay.  There is a food curt, a mall and free shuttle service to almost everywhere  The hovercraft is one hour travel time to hong kong!",50
"by far this is the largest hotel in Macau. It has everything in house; a huge shopping center, theaters, casino, a lot of restaurants and also very close to the Galaxy which is also a huge complex.  We had a very nice experience staying there for 3 nights. Actually we didn't face any major problems however I have 2 comments that Venetian management has to take care of:  1. I was staying in the south suites and actually I had my kids with me who for sure were not allowed to pass thru the casino. So if we need to reach our suite from the main lobby, we had to go to the shopping mall in the third floor and then find our way to the suite which takes with the kids almost 15 mins or more to go in and out from the hotel which is not practical at all.  2. As a five stars hotel, the…",40
Visiting macao wouldnt be complete if you dont book or visit venetian hotel. We stayed there for 2 nights and we really had a great tiMe. Wifi is free once you book directly in their website. Rooms are huge and comfortable. Felt like a queen. My  son a prince my husbund a king. Will definitely go back.....,50
"We decided to bring-in our daughters 10th birthday at The Venetian & stayed for 2 nights. 2 nights aren't sufficient to appreciate the magnificent hotel.  The moment we stepped into the hotel, everything was WOW!!. We opted for express check-in and getting in was a breeze. The check-in staff (Susane) was very courteous and helpful. The best part, we got an upgrade to RIALTO SUITE!!, which is 170 sq. mtrs size and Susane floored us by saying that they wanted to make sure that the birthday girl has a comfortable stay. Awesome!!. Additionally, they surprised their little guest with a lovely birthday cake.  The room was impeccable with large living and bedrooms. The interiors were tasteful and exudes luxury. The hotel is BIG with casinos, gondala ride, shopping, food court etc. and…",50
"I stayed at the hotel for 8 days. Huge! Got lost a few times going round the whole place. Took me a good 3 days to see everything inside. Lots of eateries, shops, and you can even visit other hotels without stepping foot out of the Venetian Hotel. Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. You can buy the local sim for your phone at the lobby and they would even fix the settings for you. You'd have to pay for Wi-Fi access so I recommend getting a local line. Doesn't cost that much, around about 100 Patacas. All in all, a great stay.",50
"Tips to fellow travellers: (a) The Venetian Macao Resort Hotel provides free shuttle bus between the ferry terminal and the hotel; (b) some of the taxi drivers in Macau are known to be over-charging customers by longer routes - good luck; (c) per-determine how much money you would/could spend at the casino and set your upper limit for winning and/or spending for stopping and leaving; and (d) take a walk along the amazing recreation of the Venetian canal scene from Las Vegas and enjoy window shopping.  The Venetian Macao was designed and built to be great.  Unfortunately not much care has been put to maintenance and regular renovation.  Thus there were signs of deterioration and lack of proper maintenance (e.g., toilets) which tarnished the image of this once great resort.  See…",40
"We took the Cotai Jet Ferry from the Skypier at the HKIA and went directly to the Venetian. The first class in the ferry is definitely worth paying a little extra for especially after a long flight. The service of the Cotai Jet is better than the Turbojet. We stayed at the Venetian in the Cotai View Suite for 2 nights...could have done 3. We were with our kids 9 and 11 and we individually loved the entire experience. The suites are huge and can accommodate I think 6 people as they also have a sofa cum bed (other than the 2 queen sized beds)!! While the whole experience with the shows, gondolas etc. is spectacular we found the suites slightly dated. There were so many options at the food court that we never bothered with the restaurants also perhaps because this area is livelier.…",50
"Stayed twice at this masssssive hotel. Loved every bit of it. Very comfortable room, fabulous view( 20floor n up), lots n lots of eating options that u'll b spoiled of choices. Has a mini golf course. N yes one of the best casino, allthough few prostitutes in couple of corners but it doesn't spoil much",50
"The Venetian Macau (located in Cotai) is a bigger version of the one in Las Vegas. The Cotai property has 3,000 keys. The hotel tower has two entrances after check in, the North and South entrances. I stayed in the North Tower in a Royale Suite which is a very large split level studio of 755 sq ft. My room overlooked the Cotai strip and being on the 31st floor there was no noise from the road.   When you check in you will realise that the guests are 95% from the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) and much of the signage is in and the Hotel Staff speak as a first language Mandarin Chinese. This does not mean that you can not communicate, but just be aware that whilst Las Vegas has many more casino's than Macau, many of the Macau casinos are much bigger than those in Las Vegas and…",40
"Stayed one night in the Royal Suite at the Macau Venetian.  The room was affordable and fantastic.  After sleeping in a double bed for a week in Hong Kong the king sized bed was palatial.  The staff at the hotel were very helpful, most spoke English or you could easily find someone that did.  Everything clean and well maintained.  Be prepared to bet 'big' as the minimum bets are much higher than most entry level tables you will find in Vegas.  The Venetian is also close to the City of Dreams and Hard Rock as well as many other attractions/casinos.  We took the Cotai Ferry from HK, upgraded to the 1st class (min upcharge) and enjoyed the easy ride.  The Venetian shuttle bus was just outside and 10 min later we were at the hotel.  Excellent all around trip/service.",50
"Just beautiful. I love the gold fixtures everywhere in the bathroom. Superb experience. We got a free upgrade! Just a little downside, the room was quite musty I must say. It was my allergies that got me sneezing the entire stay. I requested for a non smoking room, Im not quite sure though if the room they gave us was a non smoking one.  Easy breezy check in. And the express check out was cool. Free ctm prepaid Sim cards for Macau use.  ",40
"Family with 2 young kids. Stayed in Bella Suite, 2 queen beds with separate living room. Nice all wooden interior decor, spacious bathroom with a bath tub & separate standing shower. Guess bedroom's wifi speed is good. Hotel staffs are generally helpful during our one night stay. The Venetian has a very  impressive interior design. Attached to big casinos on 1st floor and big shopping arcades at 3rd floor. Restaurants & cafes are everywhere. Within walking distance to City of Dreams. Other shopping centres just across the hotel if Venetian is not enough for you which I doubt. Free shuttle bus provided from hotel to tourist spots including ferry terminal. However it can be overcrowded due its in house casinos. If we were to come back to Macau, we would most probably stay at the…",50
"...What an amazing place! The rooms are awesome, the pool's are amazing, the casino is out of this world and the shopping centre is that big you will get lost at least once!! A must see for everyone!!!",50
"It was such a delight to have a room in the VEnitian. It was big, comfortable and most of all it has 2 sets of TV! 😊 . My kids got to watch their  own show, while me and husband get to watch our own show. The kids had so much fun they kept on telling me that this is the most awesome hotel ever!!!😂😂",50
"As what has been reviewed, this resort is pretty impressive due to its size.  Although considered slightly old with all the newer and more glitzy neighbours around, I think this resort can still hold its own.  I have visited the resort many times but never stayed in the hotel so it was an eye opener.  The resort is in Taipa and very near the airport. You can easily get to Venetian at any public transport hub, either ferry or airport as the resort provides free shuttle buses to the resort. Vice versa, the shuttle busses will take you to these public transportation hubs. So convenient and it is free!! You can also do casino hopping easily by getting into any of these free shuttle busses provided by the respective casinos!! Really great service!!!  Stayed just a night with some…",40
"The Venetian hotel is top-notch. The rooms are spacious, elegant, clean and very comfortable. Ours was a small suite that had two slightly different floor levels, making for a nice division of the space into living room and bedroom areas. Elevator areas are security controlled for guests only, and noise levels are low due to excellent construction. The gold-encrusted faux sculptures, attached gambling casino and snooty high-end shopping mall are all pretty tacky and extremely overcrowded though, so not everything is perfect.",50
Have just arrived back after 6 days staying at the Venetian.  All I can say is that we (my husband & 14yr old daughter) had the most amazing experience. From the moment we were picked up from the Taipa Ferry Terminal to the moment we left we were accommodated in every way.  On greeting Lovely in the VIP lounge to all the other staff our stay could not have been any better. The hotel is AMAZING. The restaurants are AMAZING. Our favourite was Portofino's.  The Venetian is a must do for anyone. Thank you Venetian for making our stay the most memorable holiday for us. We will recommend the Venetian to all our family & friends and we will return soon.,50
"Wow .... This Venetian Resort Hotel is huge. Lucky we have special VIP check in lounge ..... if not there were huge line up in the common check in front desk. There are 10 check in front desk counter open but the tourist is huge coming to stay in this hotel.   I need to know which entrance my room can be access because there are South , West , East and North. Even the entrance lookalike .......first day I was lost and confuse ......!! Hahaha this resort hotel is huge too. There are so many restaurant and shopping are the best.   I book a suite room which is very big and beautiful. Is like a penthouse ......... The room amenities are top quality and the design layout is more European style.   I cannot describe or express more because you need to stay in so you can feel it…",50
"It was my second stay at Venetian Macao, except the very long queue for check-in (keep serving water and candy), and a bit remote from the hotel lobby to your room (5 minutes walk), you cannot find something to complaining. I was visiting on a China public holiday, too many ppl guaranteed you with no free room upgrade; the free WiFi access simply not working, I did not try the premium/charged hotel WiFi, and I was happy roaming with my work phone (always faster when you paid). The view of my room was not bad, it's a full view of the golf playground. I was visiting with my wife, 2-yrs old daughter and parents-in-laws, so I spent no time in the casino, yes, I had to pay for the whole trip without sponsorship from the Sands =p  All in all, Venetian is a brand you must try in your…",50
"I must say the stay and visit to The Venetian Resorts at  Macau was one of the best stay I had in my years of travel..its a complete city in itself created with the best of facilities and amenities for the family to have fun. The staff top rated  professionals trained to serve the customer best.Must mention about Susan at the front desk who made an extra efforts to make us aware of the resort facilities as well briefed is to use the short time wisely. The facility itself is more than enough to be there and have fun with family & friends for days together along with shopping,dinning ,fun activities for children and of course last but not the least the casino.  I thanks all the stake holders who ensure to keep the property and services to the best of standard in the world....thank…",50
"Without a doubt, the best experience you can get when you travel to Macau with excellent in house restaurants and a central casino. It's one of the top 5 most expensive hotels. Do visit it whenever you visit Macau.",40
3 nights my husband and I spent at the Venetian and really enjoyed our stay.  The only down fall was the smoke smell still prominent through the casino and the hotel. New laws started Jan 2015 but still very smelly. The room itself didn't smell but the hallway did.  The room was amazing and very spacious. Extremely clean and the cleaning staff were wonderful we requested late cleaning each day and they catered for our needs.  Must do the putt putt golf the course is just like a real golf course only a mini version. We had a ball playing putt putt.   Shopping centre has an array of shops some very high end brands and some reasonably priced stores.  Casino had a prominent smell of smoke which frustrated me so didn't spend too much time there.   The food court in the shopping…,40
"I came here with my 89 year old mother for two nights during a Easter weekend from Hong Kong.  The line at check-in was very long.   The reception staff at the check-in line saw my mother and we were directed to the VIP check-in.   She was very respectful.    The room at the Venetian is large with a sitting area.   The style is just like in Las Vegas.   The lobby area has more marble,  is luxurious and much more upscale.     You get free wifi if you book through the hotel website.",40
"I stayed for 2 nights at The Venetian Macao after a week in Hong Kong. From the painless transfer from the Ferry terminal on the Venetian courtesy bus to the quick check in, we were soon in our luxury Suite. Very impressive, from the large sunken lounge room to the spacious and palatial bathroom. The beds were large and very comfortable. The Venetian is a huge property,but it is relatively easy to get around as the area is well sign posted. Luxury shops, bars and restaurants provides lots of variety for all tastes, from top end to relatively inexpensive eg the food court with tasty options from many forms of cuisine. The casino is vast and a bit daunting but caters for the big and small gambler. Breakfast was included in our rate and could be taken in 2 cafes. We chose fogo…",40
"This is the best ever stay I ever had in any hotel/resort.   There was a direct shuttle service from the Taipa ferry terminal which took us directly to the hotel. The entrance to the resort is magnificent and looks really nice in the evening. We had booked 2 rooms through an agent and the checkin process was really smooth even though the hotel was very crowded thanks to the ongoing ""carnevale 2015"" . The rooms were neat and very well maintained. We had a room on 38th floor with a view of the cotai strip and Galaxy resorts on the other side of the road.  We had our dinner at the Indian restro ""Golden peacock"" which was just average. After dinner, we spent about an hour in and around the hotel. The structure looks as exotic from outside as from inside. The casino area is massive…",50
"This property is very likely the best in Macau. I recommend one night, the restaurants and the casino tend to be less crowded once the majority of visitors return to China or Hong Kong after a day visit. Very crowded. I recommend booking restaurants, transportation and any other event in advance. Very noisy because of the crowd. Table gambling is expensive and low return, slots are much more affordable and better for their return. Shops are the best in design and look. We dined at North, I recommend it for a genuine North Chinese cuisine experience. If you leave from HKG airport, I suggest a night there before leaving with the first early Water Jet to the airport directly from Macau. Affordable, convenient and efficient. Book your own transportation to/from the water jet pier to…",50
"The hotel is fabulous and huge. The environment is electric. Its a city in itself - shopping mall, restaurants, casino, golonda ride.   Airport shuttles are also available. Rooms are exotic and luxurious.   The biggest problem was the room service which was not upto the mark. Also, the hotel is so huge that u have to walk long distance and initially you require a Map.",40
"The hotel has a very good elegance look but you need to walk a long to reach rooms or places. The escalators dont work at many places, you need to take stairs at times which is most disgusting.This Casino is excellent and its main attraction too.",40
"Have stayed twice now. This time prices were sky high due to Easter wknd so for a few bucks more I splurged on a Rialto suite. 1700 sq ft but like many double door entry suites it is sparcely furnished and rather cavernous feeling. Love the extra bene's though. Limo service to hotel. Breakfast included each morning, personal assistant and butler.  Ok just kidding on the last two.  Very big resort and easy to get lost in. ",40
"Shuttle to and from the port and airport,  check!  We didn't need to wait more than 15mins for the shuttles.  Great atmosphere and ambience, check!  Friendly and efficient staff, check!  Lots of friendly Filipino staff ready to help.  Lovely city.  Carnavale at the Venetian was fun!  Would go again if travelling to Macau.",50
"Was there for almost a day roaming around, witnessing it's elegance, it was like you are in Europe visiting. The details, the design and it's grandeur! The Casino is still in Venetian Style, the boutiques, their very own Grand Canal is perfect! I will be back Macau !",50
"You name it - they have it. If you like a splendid room to stay with your family, they have it. If you want to eat any cuisine, they have them all at the food court, shopping - a big YES, Casino - the biggest, shuttle service - yes.  Overall it is a place that you need two days to explore within, leave alone going places in Macau.   Stayed in this hotel for 3 nights with friends during middle of January 2015 and found this place really Amazing and overwhelming.  Cannot miss this place if you go to Macau.",50
Very very nice hotel casino and mall lots of branded stuff everywhere.. Accesible with free shuttle to anf from..i played a little in slot machine hehehe... Will probably back with the kids:) must visit!,50
"Breathtaking! Right from the entry in the main hotel lobby, to the shopping arcades, the covered Gondola rides, the HUGE casino floor, beautiful healed pools, jacuzzi. beautiful huge rooms with brilliant washrooms! The hotel is a pleasant maze! Calling it a hotel is unfair. It is an experience in itself! It is a world in itself! Every big brand that you can image has a showroom in the resort. The restaurants are artfully designed with the food to match! It is luxury redefined!",50
"Rơom with 70 m2 are big enough,  all suites room,  shopping and food arcade so big and you can easily get lost,  best for gambler,  but hidden prostitution everywhere you can easily recognize,  two or three nights here more than enough.",40
"Really enjoyed my stay at the Venetian. Rooms were HUGE.. spacious and bright. The hotel is huge so it doesn't have a personal feel to it but all of the staff I encountered were amazingly helpful and kind. The breakfast was massive, tons of variety. You don't need to gamble to enjoy your stay at this hotel. We also had a great time at the Bellini bar in the casino. Fun music, good drinks, great time all around! This place is definitely an experience and would recommend for a weekend trip!",40
"Venetian Macao is A great experience for gamblers. Large Casino Area, A lot of people (in comparsion to other hotels in Macau). Room are not so clean and low level on maintanance. Very surprised that one of the TV Screens was CRT !  Generally, in Macau is lack of Nightlife and attractions - all around Gambling. In Venetion Macau you can find alot of Stores! Western Resturants are missing there.",40
"this hotel is very very very huge. i travelled here with my family last year. we were in macau for 2 days and we were just didnt get time to get out of this hotel and there was so much to explore. we also got some free coupons for shopping,ferry ride,food and many more with the room key.the rooms were large with royal look. this hotel attracts many tourists and sometimes can be rushy.",50
"My first thought when I step in this hotel last month : ""Is this a hotel or a castle!?"". It's so amazing. Large and luxurious. In one building there are hotel suites, casino, shopping mall and gondola ride. I miss Venetian so much. One word - SUPERB! Trust me, you won't feel regret to waste your money to stay at this hotel!!! :D Free wi-fi for 3 gadgets if you booked direct through their website.",50
"second visit in space of 4 months. This time my room is in the lower section of the hotel rooms. This section seems older and less polished. Smell of cigarette smoke in corridor. A little bit of mold in the shower. Overall though, still a lovely hotel compared to many other hotels I have stayed in. The room has everything you can think of as a business traveler. Make sure you get out of the hotel and look around macao, it is worth it. This hotel is about a 20 minute drive from the center of macao.",40
"was here on my last holiday with the family. Huge room and shopping mall inside the building.   Unfortunately, if like us, with children under 18 yo, we have to go up two level and passing the shopping mall to get in to our rooms from the reception due to casino area at the centre of the building.",40
"The Venetian is 1st class all the way! Location, food, entertainment and shopping is to be had everywhere! Macau in general is pricey because of ALL the mainland visitors. I myself know what similar hotels and casinos offer in Vegas so I felt like most ALL attractions/venues were over priced!",50
We stayed in the Venetian for one night - it was not enough to enjoy the hotel and the sightseeing nearby. We were not interested in the gambling (even though it is the largest casino in the world - so I am told!!) . The facilities are superb - food and restaurants very good. Food court excellent. The Venice replicas are very good - down to the gondola's and the singing gondoliers!! Staff very helpful and friendly.  Lots of people and very busy at all times of the day.,50
"It's a wonderful hotel to spend your holiday - lot of happening events, shopping, casino and food street - delightful experience. All the great brands are present s around the canal - which makes a grand walking shopping area. You can take a boat to travel as well. Casino is great and for every budget.",40
"The best hotel and the best attraction in Macao!! We stayed there for 3days and was well pampered and well served!! The view was spectacular. our over-all stay here was luxurious! Our bathroom was all in gold! Everything was so fascinating! The shopping area was great, the granola ride was lovely. Complimentary photos in the lobby with your family are given if you will book your stay here! Casino staff are strict and always mistaken me as a minor! I love this hotel and will always book here if I will comeback to Macao!",50
We went as family with friends and had a wonderful time staying at the Venetian Macao Resort Hotel. It is located centrally and is a breathtaking property that also has a large Casino area within. Convenient bus/ taxi counters right in front of the property make commuting within Macau very easy. Overall it's amongst the top properties that one can come across anywhere in the world.,50
"Booked the twin Bella room, the experience was just luxurious yet cozy. Beautiful interior. Although we did not spend time in the casino as out group of friends were not into gambling, the shopping areas and food court was a great past time after days of sightseeing in the city.",50

Within a 2 days, I received another email inviting me to participate the Express Check-in Program.  This Program is very useful! While the normal check-in time is 3pm, this Express Check-in allows me to check in anytime from 9am to 1pm (with a fee of MOP230) or from 1pm to 3pm (free of charge).

"Plan to spend at least 2 - 3 complete days at Macao in general, and 1.5 days complete at Venetian. I was there with my family (wife, 2 girls aged 5 and 8, and parents in law). We had a great time. We took the gondola ride, visited the Ice Wonders, saw the Carnival, witnessed the The Lightening Storm show, went to the Casino, of course and generally roamed around in the hotel.   There is an Indian restaurant there called Golden Peacock (just besides the South Side Lobby Check in counter). The restaurant serves decent Indian food. The food is decent from Indian standards and very nice considering that its Macao.   The Staff is courteous, but vegetarians might have a slight problem with choice when it comes to in room dining. Since there is no market or shops nearby, one has to…",40
"Awesome big Hotel If you are going to Macao for Holiday,Business any other purpose - I'll not recommend any other hotel apart from Venetian - its a must stay Hotel is itself a grand attraction which will take almost a day to visit completely and the night will go in one of the biggest casino in the world kids are not allowed in Casino This hotel being used for many Bollywood finale and shows - I am sure if you or family member is Bollywood crazy - then you will love this place.",50
"Really this is one whole package entertainment hotel, casino, shopping centre, restaurant, sport center, arcade.

"loved it , feels like you are in Venice ! But more fun ;)  I am a frequent traveller to  Hong Kong and this is one place I always like to visit as its a short trip and can take the speed ferry but you need a VISA .  Ideal to stay if you wanna explore Macao.",50
We were in HK and decided to do a day trip via the Cotai Jet ferry service. When we arrived at the ferry terminal we followed the signs to the bus terminal where the free shuttle buses to the various casinos were. We chose the Venetian. The place is huge both inside and out. The main item we did here was the gondola ride. The gondoliers were very friendly and entertaining to the kids. Overall it was a nice one time experience.,40
"The rooms of the hotel are  big and elegant, very comfortable beds and I love the set up of the entire bathroom !  Everything you need is under one roof ! There are a lot of branded stores and unlimited food choices inside Venetian Macau. One day will not be enough to do your shopping coz you will be amaze of how big and beautiful inside the entire complex.",50
"The Venetian is really big, great shopping areas, the casino is huge with a great sealing just like the sixteen chapel in italy . Even the sky is fake and 3D I was impressed , it's good to visit for 1 day but I would not stay there more. I day in Macao was enough for us , but definetly The Venetkan it was the highlight of the 1 day trip.",40
I went there a couple years back with my family. Apart from the huge rooms with great views the resort boasts a large casino and excellent restaurants. The resort is located in the heart of the city with different areas easily approachable. I recommend it for anyone and everyone who wants to spend a nice stay in the great city of Macau.,50
"Ok so I am a little late actually in writing this, I had meant to do this long back but somehow kept putting it off! Anyways, about the journey, one of the best ways to reach there is the first class cabin of the boat that takes you there. The hotel coach waits just outside the airport for a complimentary drop to the hotel and you settle in comfortably. The first thing that gets to you is that there are so many hotels in Macau! Have you chosen the right one?? The suspense ends when you enter the Venetian and stare with awe and admiration at the lobby! Stunning is the word! Smooth check in , professional behaviour and genuine smiles greet you. The rooms are fantastic and well appointed. The food in all the restaurants just brilliant! They even have an Indian restaurant! Of course…",50
- requires improvement to room hygiene and clean up quality. - room looks posh and spacious ... Worthy of luxurious suite - fixtures and amenities are seriously worn and old  Wouldn't pay the price for personal trip. Better options available.,40
"Visiting this hotel is an experience in itself. You need 3 days just to explore the various attractions, shopping center, restaurants and casino that this hotel has to offer. The rooms are spacious and have that classic feel. Its one of the best places to stay in Macao.",50
"The Venetian Macao is a luxury hotel and casino resort. It is a 39-story, on the Cotai Strip in Macau. It is the seventh-largest building in the world by floor area. The Venetian Macao is the largest casino in the world, and the largest single structure hotel building in Asia. The hotel tower offers 2,905 suites. I like to stay at a reputable hotel and the Venetian is far from middle-of-the-road it's out of this world! Literally, you don't ever have to leave this property to find excellent food, entertainment, shopping and excitement! My favorite feature is the Grand Canal. The rooms are perfect. Yes they are over the top with sunken rooms, and all the over the top decor and details, but that's what makes them stand out! Our room was stunning, clean and featured all the…",50
"OMG, what a great resort, the rooms are fabulous, the service is excellent and the food is good all over the resort, from the Food Court to the Breakfast included and do not miss the Seafood Buffet at Bambu, it is to die for - fresh, fresh sashimi and sushi, a variety of cooked fish and meat dishes, salad bar, great desserts.  The casino is the biggest you will find anywhere - and there is a great poker room.  It's a great place to spend a few days in Asia on your next business trip to Hong Kong (and just a jet ferry ride away from HK or the HK Int'l Airport)",50
We're stayed there for 2 nights for our anniversary. We received complimentary cake and decorated honey moon bed style. We're impressed the service. Huge hotel with good staff. Hotel signs are very helpful. However I'm a bit disappointed about Hotel breakfasts or i'm expected more from a kind of casino hotel.   ,40
"this is my first time to stay in Venetian in Macao. and the reason why i choose here because of Cats Musical. They have a reasonable price for the hotel package. when we check in, the staff Yen said happy birthday and also sent us a birthday cake.He was so nice and give us detail information about the hotel facilities. the check out staff(western man) also provides excellent service,  he have great smile, friendly remind for belonging, luggage storage...etc. I will back forsure.",50
"Been here twice, first time was with group of friends and the second time was with family. We didn't stay here, we just included Venetian Macao as part of our 1 day Macau itinerary (3 days in Hongkong & 1 day in Macau). From Taipa Ferry Terminal, they offer free shuttle service going to the Hotel (about 15 minutes ride). I've read before that you can leave your baggages at their concierge free of charge so you can explore the place freely. But I guess they change their policy and now charge 10 HKD/10 MOP per baggage (nothing to complain because it's just a minimal fee compared to the inconveniency having to roam around with your baggages). We went there during the Chinese New Year so its really crowded particularly in the food court area. I guess it's still the most popular…",50
"Brilliant and beautiful hotel. The Casino is undoubtedly the best if your looking for luxurious and classic theme, the gondola ride is a must. The rooms are spacious and luxurious with all amenities. If you prefer rock theme rather than Luxury/classic then Hard Rock will be advisable.",50
"Visited the hotel several years ago with family and was really fascinated, but this time we decided  to have an overnight stay to explore the place more The suite was huge and very comfortable with almost complete amenities and the bathroom was perfect! The food choices and restaurant selection in the vicinity is more than enough that you don't need to leave the hotel.The Grand Canal gives you  a nice and serene feel that you can just walk around, shop or maybe sit and drink in one corner and be in total state of calm and rest.",50
We booked the royale suite and the room is really spacious with a sunken living room.  It also has a big and nice bathroom.  The hotel is huge and it really takes a while to walk from the hotel elevator to anywhere.   The hotel is always crowded because it is one of the popular hotel casino in Macau.  There are several shops and restaurants that you don't even need to go out of the hotel complex.  The decorations all over the hotel is great for photos.  The gondolas cruising the canals are worth trying for.  There is a big foodcourt with many choices for those in a budget.  There is also a huge casino for those who want to try their luck in gambling.  Lots of slots and tables to pick from.  We also went here for the Ice World 2015 and everyone had fun and wonderful experience.  …,50
"This is totally a fantastic hotel in Macau. The view was so awesome. The room was so clean and stylish, the interior was so great and I loved the shower room because of its elegant design. I had a great time swimming in the pool. Perfectly stimulating water.   When I travel, one thing I never forget is the food that they serve and it is totally delightful here.",50
"This hotel really great, the basic room here ""Royale Suite Hotem"". I felt like a king there, the bed, the toilet amazing. Worth to try when arrived at Macau. There are so many store to shop and amazing view. Free shuttle from/to Taipa Ferry Terminal.",50
We had an amazing experience at the Venetian Macao. The hotel is a super luxurious property with all the facilities that one can ask for. the experience is so awesome that we do not remember feeling the need to venture out of the hotel for 2 days..,50
It was an extended stay on our visit to Hong Kong. You get free bus ride to hotel from Ferry Port for most hotels. It takes about 40 minutes to reach Venetian; however check-in process takes abnormally long- even with about 22 check-in executives it took us about 35 minutes to get the room keys. If the hotel management needs some advise I can help. The suites are well appointed and are decorated with great care. Queen beds are big enough for two. Except for some noise from the air-conditioning system room were reasonably quite; however the main door was not well insulated and the talks of other guest passing through the corridors were audible in the room.  One very important aspect for the suites toilets are not usable by more than one person even though the commode area is…,50
This hotel is awesome. The front desk people were friendly and the checkin was smooth. The rooms in the hotel were very nice and the view from the rooms was amazing.The hotel is connected to the mall. Most of the top brands are available in the mall. The food was amazing. Checkout procedure took some time.,50
"It was my first time in Macao and I loved every aspect of the hotel, right from the decor, room, food  etc etc.  even though the hotel is over crowded, the service remains good.  Even 3 days were not enough to explore the entire property.",50
"I had a weekend in the Venetian and still loved it. Yes, the rooms are now from 2007, but they are still huge and nicely done, shopping is still awesome, the scale of the place impressive plus I discovered a fantastic Indian restaurant (Golden Peacok) and italian (Portofino).",50
"We didnt stay in the hotel but we were able to tour around esp on their attractions inside the hotel that were open to everyone. The hotel itself was very grand. I love how Venetian the feel is. If we only tried the gondola rides, it would have been perfect. :)  Travelled 2012",50
"If you have a chance to come to Macao please do yourself right and stay at the Venetian. Do not even bother thinking about it,  it is hands down the most fabulous hotel there.   Service is great, the rooms are awesome, and there are plenty of dining options from inexpensive to absolutely amazing. Yes it is huge but that is ok as it is awesome to walk around in. The rooms are as to expected, really nice.",50
This hotel is super luxurious and the rooms are too spacious and ultra luxurious.  We went there for holidays and to reach our room it took us 1 hr as we couldn't find the way though hotel staff showed us the way to reach there as it's too big and it seems same from all ends.  We stayed in North block and rooms were just wow.  There are 2 blocks for rooms and suites.  North block and south block.  We stayed at 31st floor of the hotel and that experience was awesome and unforgettable.  It take atleast 4-5 days minimum to explore the whole hotel.  Casino there at the lobby is the biggest casino in a Asia and this hotel is biggest hotel in Asia too.  One Shud stay there only if they are going to Macau.  If I would get a chance to go again to Macau I would stay there only.  I don't…,50
"One of the largest hotels in the world, as well as maybe largest casino too.  Even with its immense size, staff continues to produce great service.  I had booked the trip via a travel agency, who couldn't handle an additional night to my trip.  I separately booked (outside of package) an additional night.  Hotel upgrade my ""package room"" to match my last night booking, as well as the need to check out/check in again.  As busy as this hotel is, really appreciated the service I got from the front desk.  bags were sent directly to room, already waiting for me when I got there.  Really outstanding.  No shortage of sightseeing, immense variety of gambling games (cards, machines), will keep everyone happy.  noticed that hotel also had a large amount of families as guests, must have…",40
"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Venetian for 2 nights in early Feb and it was spectacular.   We were travelling as an early birthday trip for my boyfriend and they gave us a free upgrade to a Cotai view suite AND delivered a small birthday cake with candles, which we thought was so lovely. The gentleman who checked us in was also incredibly nice even though it was 11 pm at night! Shame we didn't get his name.  The room was magnificent, beautifully decorated as you would expect! It was great having little complimentary bottles of water in the room and also in the casino area.   Housekeeping were very attentive, even folding our clothes for us and putting down a towel for my makeup brushes!   We had a late meal after checking in, in the 24 hr restaurant (not the one in the middle…",50
we were here for a two day stay at this hotel and i must say that was one of the best properties i have ever stayed. Casino is one of a kind and here was my first ever casino experience. you can definitely count in this hotel for a holiday,40
"I stayed here for 3 nights and can't complain.  Check In - It was smooth, gave us early check-in, gave us good direction to the room and was very friendly.  He also advised that we could you use Cotai Sands Wi-Fi which is free. Room - It is one of the biggest room I have stayed at. I had 2 rooms, one with awesome views of golf course and one with views of Galaxy. We could see laser show of Galaxy from our room. Bathroom was huge with bath tub, separate shower cubicle and dressing table.  Room Service - This was best. He set the table for us. Food was very tasty specially paneer curry and Paratha . It was so good that I ordered next night as well.  Complex - It is huge, an entire city. Food court had endless options, Imperial house Chinese restaurant had only 3 veg dishes but…",50

Superb shopping opportunities and yummy food joints. Great facilities for all ages. Very good bell service was the icing on the cake.",50
"We had been to the Venetian in Las Vegas, so was not surprised by the excellent similarities. The suite was superb and the service prompt and courteous. The breakfast layout was extensive by all means and what took us by surprise was a separate layout for Indian Vegetarian items. Lovely Resort!!",50
"Again, WOW!!! I stayed here back in 2009 without my husband (then boyfriend) for work and thought it was amazing. I come back this time and it’s still amazing, except there are now more people visiting Macau. We decided to spend 2 nights in Macau as a side trip and thought I would treat my husband to the same experience I had.   Same as last time, the place was amazing, still huge, staff very helpful and the food was great! We didn’t swim because it was cold, but I forgot that the pool shut at 9pm so the first night we were there I wanted to show him the pool so we started the walk and got ¾ of the way there and then finally there was a sign saying it was closed for the night. The sign should probably be near the lifts instead of near the entrance to the pool.  The room is still…",50
"This resort is beautiful and we enjoyed every moment of our stay there. For a family of three the suite was extremely comfortable, very neat and well stocked with all essentials. Room service and reception staff very helpful and courteous. Good variety of food at different restaurants is superb though the buffet breakfast (not included with our room) was over priced. Overall a very nice experience.",40

Interior of the Hotel, Mall is simply awesome.The front desk people were very nice and helpful.Process of check in and check out was quite fast.The room service was superb keeping in mind the size of the hotel.Room cleanliness and the interior was fabulous.The sleep quality was very good.Absolutely nothing to complaint.Great job done by the management and staff of the hotel.Keep it up!!!",50
"Just spent 5 nights at The Venetian for Chinese New Year ......this was our second time here and this visit was just as good as the first a few years ago.  The staff are very helpful a courteous, the shopping and dining facilities are excellent and of course you have the casino.  Can recommend the Rialto Suite as it has a very large living area, dining area and separate bedroom ....at 190sq.mtr it is the largest hotel room we have ever stayed in !!    For dining we can recommend Vergnano Italian Restaurant (try the pork steak here) and Morton's Steak House .....both restaurants are expensive but worth it. ",50
This is the best hotel in the world as per my experience. The best luxuries hotel. All the luxury is available in the hotel. casino of the hotel is the biggest hotel in the world. It is operational 24 hours a day. The best hotel in the world...,50
Me and my wife stayed on 12 feb 15 and overall experience was simply awesome.  Right from the shuttle bus at the airport which was hassle free to quick and systematic check in which was very well organized in spite of crowd.  They even made some special arrangement as it was our anniversary and it was pure bliss.  They were very prompt to reply on all mails etc and I would give them full marks for everything.  All in all best place to stay in macao.,50
"We visited Venetian Macau for 4 nights after our fantastic stays at Kowloon Shangri-La and Ritz Carlton Hong Kong and I had a feeling that their hospitality would be hard to match for Venetian, which though is a 5 star resort - is much bigger and personalised service would be missing - but I was easily proved wrong.  However the check in was really quick and smooth and the staff at the check in counters were very helpful, explained to us patiently everything that the resort had to offer and so on. We stayed in the South Tower and the suite was really nice and tastefully decorated. This hotel has over 3000 rooms and even i was surprised by how smooth our stay was. The icing on the cake was that they dropped off a few pastries and a bottle of champagne when they found out that we…",40
"I went for my sister's birthday and this hotel was over my expectation. The room was massive and there is a ""living room"" semi-separated with the sleeping area"". There are printers in each room (i.e. the floor we were staying) and the decoration was second to none. Inside the hotel, there is a massive shopping place, which is decorated like in Venice, with a canal built between shops. You can take a ""cruise"" in this canal with additional cost.  Transportation wise, there are free buses from the ferry terminals (both of them) to the hotel. It's not far to walk to the ""Souvenir Street"". It's also in walking distance to go to watch the famous Musical ""The House of Dancing Water"". This is fully recommended as well!",40
"I spent 2(two) wonderful days at Venetian Macao during my stay for a week in Hongkong for Christmas Hoilday. The Venetian hotel environment was relaxing, it's so different from a busy city Hongkong. The room so spacious, my family enjoying so much staying at Venetian, the cleanness of the room maintains well. The reception and The tour guide was really helpful. The food was great with so many variety, we enjoyed eating at Bambu resto. Going around also was so easy, there were so many bus provided, where we can choose where to go for free. There was few Christmas show which was very entertaining for my family. My stay with Venetian was remarkable.",50
"this hotel is just fantastic with almost 50 buses running all the day from both the ferry terminals to hotel and also to city tourist spots throughout the day and even in night. Upon my arrival at the doors of hotel, i saw all 3 buses loaded with guests running to this huge reception counters with almost 20 counters running at full swing for a speedy check-in and check-out.  Tip: Before you check-in make sure you have a minimum of HK$ 2000 for security deposit as the hotel does not accept any other currency, plus if you have to change currency then you need to go to casino.  Everything about the hotel is just amazing, rooms are just what you can imagine when it comes to luxury( spacious,, bright fresh smell, lots more), Room service is also very good, only thing about hotel …",50
"The room is very very spacious for me n my hubby only. Spacious bathroom as well. But getting into room tower might be little tricky as its surrounded by stores. Other than that, good room with good price.",40
What a place to be at.....all possible amenities freaking great room and outstanding service. its a complete city in a hotel. you actually require 2 full days to explore the hotel have a great time there.,50
compared to Las Vegas Hotel it is having very serene atmosphere. if you want to be in crowd you can join any time whether Casino or Food Court or shopping area. You have choice of food from all parts of world. There is one outlet of Indian food in Food Court. There is also excellent Restaurant for Indian Food - Golen Peacock.,50
I really enjoyed our stay here at the Venetian. The suites were simply outstanding and the staff was very helpful. There was so much to see and do in the hotel itself that we spend an entire day exploring it.,50
"A one of its kind hotel, resort, shopping Mall etc. rolled into one. The moment you enter this place you feel that you are transformed into another world. We stayed here a few days ago for two nights. To begin with i was really surprised to see how quickly we checked into this hotel. Even though there was a serpentine line of people waiting to be checked in, the staff at the reception who were almost a dozen in number saw to it that we did not wait for more than 10 minutes to get our room keys. The ""Royal Suite"" on the 30th level given to us was immaculately furnished with everything that a guest could dream of. Even the minutest details have been thought of while providing the guests with a comfortable & luxurious stay. Room service was of the highest order even when you asked…",50

"Venetian Macao never fails me every time I go to Macau. It is a must stop place while I was there. Even though I stay at other hotel some times. I've been staying at Venetian Macau for about 4-5 times already. I love the spacious room, the music jingle every time I turn on the TV (My parents are addicted to the song. They even asked me to find the music theme in store. Unfortunately I haven't found the CD yet), the shopping center (Super HUGE!), and the food at the food court. I always going back to the Dae Jang Geum, the Korean food there.   Kids activities are not bad too. One time my brother drop his children there, and they are very happy to stay there for hours.   Overall, we love Venetian Macao a lot!",50
"The place is HUGE and grandiose. Excellent in service and a fun place! You can literally spend the whole day just browsing through the stores and shops. The architectural design was superb, the interior looks beautiful and very well planned. Though the place is a bit crowded, and we had a hard time finding a place to rest, the chairs were all occupied with travelers. I suggest put on your gorgeous dress, get a comfy shoe and extra cash! If you ever visit Macau, don't miss this place!",50
"Great service, facilities and room. The location was very central close to other casinos and many shops and restaurants.  The Venice theme was nicely done with lots of class and imagination. I loved this resort/casino as it also had great atmosphere. Well done!",50
we enjoyed ourselves. The room was better than expected. Shops were very conveniently situated. Food courts were very clean but mainly Chinese food outlets. We managed to find one that suited our tastes. I would definitely stay there again. The Golden Peacock was an excellent restaurant. Food was five star and so was the service.,50

"The Venetian Macao Hotel has been famous for its spacious size. I did not take it seriously until I feel it myself during my 2 days trip to Macao. I stayed one night at the Venetian Macao and feels like a royal since the room was very spacious. They separated the closet, the bathtub, and the shower. They closet area was very big. They even provide a make up table in the bathroom.   The bed was so big that it feels like 4 people could fits into the king size bed. There were two televisions, one provided at the bedroom area while the other one was provided at the living room area. They even provided dining table and a printer at the working space.   The downside of this hotel might be the distance between the lobby to the hotel room. As you may be aware, the Venetian Macao is not…",40

Hotel lobby was very grand, however, it was VERY crowded during the day and there were no chairs/waiting area for guests. We had to stand for a very long time as the check in process was so slow and we managed to only check in at 4pm.",40
"We stayed 2 nites in this spectacular hotel. Once in the hotel, you will be spoilt for choices as there are many activities within the hotel. The best part is the articial sky which is forever in good weather. The canal and shopping arcade is a shopping haven. The food court offers a variety of food and choices. The design of the canal wth gondolas compliments the whole setting and we enjoyed just strolling along the artificial canal eventhough it is not like the real Venice.  The room was great and luxurious for the price we pay through Agoda and the casino was so huge. Its a great hotel and we would come again next time.",50
"we were staying in Hong Kong and decided to check out Macau for one night ! We found a great deal as there were 4 of us bit took a large suite ! It was pretty divine, very ornate and full on ! we thought we were in Vegas. We had to walk through the Casino to get to our room which was pretty ordinary as far as casinos go, but it was fun ! The shopping in the Venetian Mall was great, but there were an amazing amount of locals which was a little intimidating, and very crowded ! We went into old Macau the next day and that was the high light of our little side trip !",40
"The title of the review speaks of our experience at Venetian. Its a massive property and you need a lot of time to explore the whole of it. The free shuttle service from the ferry terminal to the hotel takes you to this enormous property on the famous cotai strip. We booked a Royale suite.The mood was set the moment we got in. The room defines luxury and i was in love with the bathroom:) the false ceiling, gondola rides and the casino of course is an experience in itself. The food court area offers an extraordinary lineup of cuisines from different parts of the world and the for shopping enthusiasts its paradise. We were on our honeymoon trip and when we look back at our trip it couldn't have been better if it was not at The Venetian.",50
"We stayed 2 nights in the basic rooms - Royal Suite which was massive. We didn't have the greatest view looking into building sites for the new Parisian Hotel but we were on 34th floor and could see beyond and down over the pool area, and it was still nice. The Rooms are luxurious. A lovely are to sit and relax with a lounge, chairs and dining table. The bathroom was spacious and we really appreciated the separate toilet and lovely make up table area. It is worth every $ spent to stay here and I don't think you will be disappointed. It is a big hotel and once you get your bearings as to which wing you are in, makes it so much easier but you will need your map just in case. If you want a quiet intimate little hotel, this is not for you. If you want luxury, beautiful surroundings…",50
"My family and I went for a tour of Macau. Having a shuttle available to and from the port to the hotel was very convenient. The place was really crowded as there were buses filled with tourists heading for the hotel. Inside, the layout of the high end shops were overwhelming. We specially loved the path that leads to the Sky Ceiling, the interior, canals and apartment facade reminiscent of the lovely Venice. Their dining hall provides many options and everyone will surely find something that will satisfy their food cravings at any budget. The souvenir shops, specially the larger ones were charming, offering unique pieces for all ages. Over-all worth the stop.",40

"Like her sister in Vegas, the Venetian Macao is really massive with lots and lots of people swarming the whole property. We arrived in Macao via ferry (Macao Ferry Terminal). From there, we could easily find the hotel's shuttle bus outside the seaport. The shuttle was free and they did not even check whether you're their hotel's guests or not. The trip from Macao Ferry Terminal to the Venetian (Cotai Strip) took around 15-20 minutes. Upon arrival, the staff promptly ushered us to the check-in counter while another staff arranged our luggages. I must say, their system was impeccable.

The room is quite spacious and clean. The hotel has great shopping area and there is never a dull movement in our four days stay. the awards evening was very well managed. It was totally a great experience. The pricing is also decent. The breakfast is also very lavish and The Indian restaurant - Golden Peacock is great too. Overall a very good hotel. ",50
We enjoyed our stay at The Venetian. The hotel is big and grand. So It took us a while to find our way around.   The rooms and bathrooms are spacious.  There are activities for all ages within the hotel premises. ,50
"If you are planning a visit to macau only fr  1 or 2 nights than this is the place to be . Its a world of its own.Its got everything for everyone. Casinos..restaurants..shopping u will love it all. Breakfast spread is huge. Indian travellers should not miss Golden Peacock (Michelin star rated restaurant) for Indian cuisine. On the whole a must stay place.If you have opted for city tour in your package cancel it and spend as much time possible in the hotel , therez so much to see n do in the hotel itself.",50
"This isn't your run-of-the-mill Vegas-like hotel. It is much better! We were here for 3 nights and our experience was a-ma-zing! This hotel is huge! If you're thinking of the Venetian Vegas, think much bigger. They had this whole tiny city indoors. There's lots to do here. I was lucky to have been there during the time they had the Body exhibition and the Titanic exhibition (for which we got free passes!) There is so much to do here and several restaurants that will keep you busy. If you're traveling here with kids, don't worry about finding something to make them happy...they will be satisfied without trying!  The rooms were huge and a step down took you to the seating/lounge area. Bathrooms were huge and had all the amenities. The only drawback of this hotel was walking from…",50
"Venetian has staple facilities-luxurious enough,but without attention to detail.Good service and housekeeping.No views.All inhouse,so great if you dont want to step out.In any case,nothing to step out for,except Club Cubic,Galaxy and City of Dreams restaurants and shows,and Panda watching in Coloane.Doesn't have life at doorstep as in Old Macau.Inhouse casinos,restaurants and shopping,which is terrific.Newly opened small stakes Poker on Casino floor in a remote corner(privately run in a errr....strange fashion,with compulsory rotation every few rounds).Winter treat was Winter in Venice,with Ice Skating,and a nice bracing swim in a heated pool in the open air!!Here is how we did a not the run of the mill NYE in Macau-Did a dinner at the Wynn Old Macau(great vegetarian…",40
I stayed with my family at bella suite cotai view in room no 34060. Excellent room with excellent services. Opulance is the next word i would like to use. Ice world was out of this world. Gondola ride was too good Well connected to galaxy by shuttle and sands cotai with overbridge. Did a express checkout. Received mail that i am being charged for minibar use for 299 hkd. I replied back that minibar was never used by me and to my surprise they immediately reversed the charges. Great. Thanks to venetian for making my stay great.,50
"we arrived as a group from shenzhen to macao venetian.  the hotel - casino - shopping complex is huge and very intimidating for a first time traveller. the multiple lobbies, multiple wings, multiple squares will leave you confused very soon.  the entrance from the main gate and then into the lobby filled with frescos from the vatican sets the tone for all the dramatic surprises this resort has for you.  cannot comment on the check in and baggage service as we were a huge group so check in was group. apparently there is only one room type with bed options.   each room has a spacious royal bathroom, a bedroom with Tv, and a sitting area with sofa - workstation - dinning table - another TV. we had a high floor with view of the golf course from the window which was cool.  the…",50
I cannot forget the Venetian experience. The hotel is a town in itself with ample opportunities to get lost. We stayed in the Royale Cotai suite and it was awesome. Great view from the top and a truly royal feel to the suite! Most recommended and truly worth all your money spent. Cheers guys enjoy ur stay.,50
"I have been enjoying this wonderful stay with my family. If you really wanna discover this place fully u need atleast 5-6 days…. Amazing stay with great location. Variety of options for all cusines. Indian have good options at Golden Peacock restaurant. The Hotel itself is of 3000 rooms so you can imagine how huge it will be. Too crowdy as it has Casino and mall in itself. it’s a bhul-bhulaiya  if you don’t remember your way out. Rooms are spacious as they are Suites and not rooms. Suites have all amenities and are really royal with amazing view.Overall service was quick, good housekeeping, helpful and co-operative staff. Enjoyed my stay and will visit everytime I visit Macau….",50
"We did not stay at this hotel but have visited the sister resort in Las Vegas. I knew what to expect as we know how great these properties are but we were blown away by how helpful one lady in particular was. We visited just before New Years and were trying to visit the Panda Pavilion. We approached the concierge and a lady helped us by giving us excellent directions on what to do and although she did no speak any Chinese herself, she got her colleague to write down the name of the attraction for us to provide to the driver. We felt as though we could have asked anything and it would not have been too much trouble for her and I think that she is a great representative of a fantastic hotel.",50
Really cool hotel the size of 56 Football fields. Huge and difficult to navigate around.  Easy to get lost.  However recently They launch a interactive 3D Version of the hotel .  http://www.3rdplanet.com/VenetianMacao.html  Really helps in understanding what they had to offer from a overview perspective.,50
"Since it's my first visit to Macau, I had to try this well-known hotel. Entering the lobby I can't stop being awed by the interior. Integrated with mall and casino, this hotel is huge. Luggage was immediately attended to and automatically sent to room, impressive! Front desk and concierge staff was very courteous and helping. Checking-in was fast and efficient.  Room is very luxury and spacious, very satisfied. Had small problem though, both TV was powered off from the outlet, and can't be reached to switch it on. Since I'm staying for a night only and went outside hotel most of the time, I didn't bother to call room staff to have it fixed. Wifi was poor for this class of hotel, it keep disconnecting.",40
"I travelled to HK and booked one night in Macau, it was the best decision. You HAVE to stay at the Venetian once in your life. Venetian Macao is a luxurious hotel and we spend 2 days just shopping in there. It is huge! The rooms are beautiful and everything you can imagine. The gondolas, food, shows, and casinos are amazing.   As I said, don't think about it, you'll regret not staying there. Don't forget to book the Dancing water show.   Great for couples",50
"This is my 3rd stay in Venetian Macao and still nothing much changed. Always excited to see what happening inside the hotel and surrounding and i have to stay still stay the same as my previous stay - my last stay was on 2011.  Gigantic hotel with enormous of facilities which i cant learn by heart yet all impressive despite for the ""gaming"" as the main attraction there, perhaps hehe:-)  Overall my stay always fun and i have nothing issue or complain or problem. The only thing is Internet in the room still chargeable which should be NOT charged anymore nowadays...please be consider to removed this kind of old policy!!  Thanks,",40
"We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights. Room was spacious. It was so relaxing , very clean. House keeping staff were so kind. Grand canal just within the hotel was so nice. We spent our day shopping and  looking around. Shuttle bus was just in the entrance of the hotel so it was easy for us to go to other places for free... our stay in this grand hotel was great. We will definitely go back ....  ",50
Shoppers paradise and a hotel so huge and big and so Wonderful.....amazes me how they manage the logistics. Would be a case study. Enjoyed every second of my stay. At 16 degrees temp had a swim at the hotel pool with water temperature @ 32 degrees and the jacuzzi at 39 ... Worth it and an experience by itself.,50
"An experience to stay in Venetian Macau! Unexpectedly large size hotel, very beautiful architecture and great shopping aracade, cananls etc. Its very dificult to have good service in such a place, however we were surprised to experience very hood service everywhere, be it housekeeping, room service or at restaurants, lobby etc..  Good efforts by the team!  Worth the experience!",40
"Spending 2 night and 3 days.  We started off on the wrong foot.  Was charged for invitation to Express Check in and being address as MR. even thought listed as MS.  Received apology and charges were dropped. Was offered free wi-fi.  Housekeeping was excellent as to all 3 request for additional amenities.   Next day, housekeeping did not show up at all until we requested, due to misunderstanding with front desk.  Very quick to please.   Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the staff at the West Lobby, very impatient in explaining direction by both Jordan and Bruce, and was definitely of no help.  Concierge was excellent.  Overall, service was good despite some disappointment.  Waiting for surprise Birthday cake.",40
"Venetian is one of the best hotels I have ever lived in. We were there for 1 night and 2 days. The artificial blue sky, the gondolas, shopping, casino  everything was just amazing. Their rooms were huge. Our room had 2 queen size beds and the bathrooms were so elegant. Definitely worth a visit again.",50
"Venetian Macao is a luxurious hotel. It is very huge and elegant. Hotel staffs are nice and polite. We stayed in their royale suite for 2d1n. The suite has a king size bed, air conditioning unit, fridge, 2 – tv, living room and elegant bathroom with bath tub. The room is big and spacious. By the way, it doesn't have free wifi and the toilet doesn't have bidet. We had our lunch in Bambu Restaurant which is also located in Venetian. We tried their photo booth and unfortunately I didn't receive any pictures from my email address. We also ride in Gondola and we were serenade by our Filipino singer/driver. I think it’s a 10-15 minute ride. We weren't able to have a groupie shot because she told us that they are not allowed to touch our camera. Hehe. You can also have free water in a…",50
"well... it looks ""like"" Venice. Allthough the looks and the search for detail is there it obviously has more of a Disneyland feeling as it transposes you into a fairy tale world with a lot of make believe.I would say it is certainly worth seeing and experiencing but it is hardly beareable for mor than 48 hrs...unless you are into gambling and you spend your time ( and money ) in the casino. Everything is fabulous, but it is at such a large scale that it is like a whole city within one building. The feel is obviously like in an anthill where thousands of people gather, walk,talk and yell... so no romantic feeling coming up... just very stressing and you will seek calme and peace after a couple of hours. This is not a bad judgement on the hotel itself, it is just the whole concept…",50
"This place is amazing.  Firstly, the room itself, to die for! It's practically an apartment. So spacious, luxurious - and so many other words I'm struggling to think of now.  Secondly, anything you could possibly need on a vacation, shops, gambling, fast food, restaurants, pools, and so much more. We were only there for a couple of days, but boy did I wish I could stay longer, so much to do, so little time.  Probably not the cheapest rooms usually, but we got a special rate. Either way, for a romantic get away, a vacation with friends or family, this place has what you need, and so picturesque!  ",50
"This place is monstrously enormous. You can lose your way in the hotel if you don't pay heed to the sign boards. This place is good you could spend 3-4 days just exploring the hotel. Very nice rooms. Gives you the feel of a castle. And makes all of us the little kings. The free shuttle bus picks you up from the airport\harbour and even drops you off there. They have kept special universal adaptors in the room so your power plug would work, no matter where are you from. Amazing place must visit!",50
"I spend 4 nights in this hotel with my familyin Dec 2014. The hotel room was great. I booked the room for 4 adults, include my 2 teenage children actually.There is 2 queen bed and a sofa bed in the room. Just perfect for us. Our room was on 20th story on the south wing number 021. The room is clean and well maintain. All the staffs that I had met were very courteous and helpful; from check-in, throughout our stays and check-out; the whole process was so smooth. I want to say ""thank you"". If there are areas for improvement, then the shower head needs to be service and a fruit basket in the room will make my rating excellent. However, there is no shuttle bus service to the city area near the historic tourist attractions. If not because of the availablity of shuttle bus from the…",40
there is nothing to complain about this hotel.....room is big....nice design.....bathroom is huge....bed is comfy.....one stop entertainment at macau....shopping....hotel.... casino.....big hall for big event......highly recommend!!!!,50
"VENETIAN   One of the biggest hotels I have ever been to. Stayed on 14th and 15th dec,2014. Spacious suites and bathrooms. Sprawling casino without any extra entry fee . (The age limit is 21 years) . You can travel in gondolas at about 600 HKD, with the boatman/boat woman singing a song for you. I stayed at 27th floor in the south suite which gave a remarkable view of the coati strip.the hotel seems to have innumerable shops. The food court with sky roof is amazing. Entertainment is going on somewhere or the other. We got the chance to see 'winter in venice' - an opportunity to get clicked with many characters, to see the theatre performances and the wonderful laser show on the wall. The hotel is so huge that even after staying 2 nights we feel we couldn't see it much. Nor could…",50
"Huge shopping area, even with directions provided at their directory, still very hard to look for specific shops. Gondola ride a must try. Food court has every type of food u can think of. Only 1 halal pita shop available though. Toilets are superb. ",50
"A great Hotel, rooms a very spacious and well furnished and catered for. Room service staff was very good, check-in was smooth and staff was great. Checkout staff and concierge staff were very ordinary.  Room service staff is good, and room service food and prices are great  Did Gandola rides which we loved and highly recommended.  However we went in the holiday season and the hotel was too busy, the buffet breakfast in the morning was very ordinary, no napkins, no table service of tea and coffee. Serving samosas, chickpeas, rice and noodles as breakfast food for Indians (you must be kidding those are lunch or dinner menu items). Bread choice was limited and stale.  Lot of Chinese visitors there who openly spit on carpets and I don't think hotel has any signs discouraging…",40
"I stay at Venetian Macau. The location is great and the room ambience is great. The most impressive time here is great service I had from Mr.Will,the concierge counter. He is so helpful and very polite. He assists my group and me with great pleasure and politeness. Making reservation,recommend great restaurants to dine,arrange errand as I request. If I come back to Macau, Venetian is definately my choice.",50
"An all suites hotel, Venetian Macau offers tourist a place that caters to people of all ages. Being one of the biggest hotel in Macau, it contains adequate facilities and to top it all off is the unique wall papers on the ceilings coupled with the design of Venice right in the hotel. Hotel staff are nice and friendly. Suite rooms are fantastic and nicely designed. However, signs may not be clear sometimes and the fact that the hotel is big makes getting lost twice as easy. Food is expensive too so be prepared for it. Alternatively, just take a bus out to enjoy the local dishes in Macau. Although it is slightly more expensive but definitely worth trying once! Enjoy your stay!",40
gambling shouldn't be the only reason to visit Macau but also the spectacular and extravagant city. Ventetian Macau Resort Hotel is properly the most spectacular place. go visit! right now! what are you waiting for?,40
"Stayed for 1 night in November, free shuttle bus to/from the ferry terminal and quick check in process. Had a suite on the 33rd floor (great views) which was very large with drop-down living room area and an amazingly comfortable bed! Luxury stay, although no free wifi which is annoying considering the price you pay for the room. The casino is obviously huge and we loved just walking around the many shops. Didn't get the chance to ride a gondola as they don't start operating until 11am.",40
"As staying here was one of my dreams after seeing it in a popular TV series, I have booked our overnight stay here in May of 2011 well in advance to secure discounted rate as prices do not come cheap since the accommodations are all suites. The hotel is in Cotai Strip, a location quite far from the more popular places in Macau but still worth the trip.  Reception was busy when we arrived so we need to queue. The moment we stepped inside the room, we felt like royals...the spacious room, the glittering beddings and its aristocratic design speak volumes. Once you get over being in awe, the first thing you'll do is to take pictures to commemorate being there. Our room over looks the area where the other huge hotel, Galaxy, is located so it is a sight to behold especially at night. …",50
"A great place to visit. The property in itself was so big that we did not have to step out during our stay there. Despite the rush, the checkin process was very seamless. The management was very co-operative and they even arranged for a limousine for the drop us to the port.  I would love to visit this property again whenever possible.",50
"The Bella Suit can easily fit 4 adults, although it is written there 2 queen size bed, but the beds are more like 2 king size. Absolutely spacious room with 2 tv and a lounge, not to mention the humongous toilet. Hotel is quite clean with no funny smell",50
"I stayed with Venetian Resort Macau in the month of December 2014. The stay was overall above expectations.  The complimentary resorts buses are available at Macau Taipa Ferry terminal and Macau Airport. The check in was a little time taking, but it is expected out of a resort with 3000 rooms. Extensive details and explanations about the resort were provided upon my check in.  The luggage took some time to reach the room and a couple of calls had to be made to the reception for the same.  We got a free upgrade to Bella Suite as Royal Suite was unavailable.  The room was based on italian architecture with a lobby area and two queen beds. The minibar had quite a number of options. The slightest things such as the coat brush, shoe lifter, etc were taken care of.  As the concept is…",50
the hotel is still nice after 7 years of near 100% occupancy usage in this hustle and bustle city with all the gamblers from the region.  The Malaysian girl who checked us in was very helpful and staff in general were courteous. it was a very crowded and noisy place.,40
"The room at the Venetian was very nice as was the resort.  There was a lot of Holiday decorations and the Winter Wonderland going on.  At times you could hardly walk through the place because of all the tours groups unloading people who would crowd in to gamble, shop, and take pictures.  It became a little ""zoo"" like.  We did enjoy the free shuttles to different areas and were able to get were we wanted to go in Macau without the use of taxis.    Shopping in ""Venice"" was much like Las Vegas but I thing that the gondola ride was more enjoyable here in Macau. If you want Wi-Fi there you need to pay extra.  We felt that we were paying enough so short trips to Starbucks in the Old Town across the street and past the park. (about 1/3 mile). Good things to shop and snack on in the Old…",40
"Venetian is a good location with easy access to many entertainments, restaurants and shopping. My husband and I had stayed here for 1 night and was amazed with the hotel. We made the booking with the hotel website directly and was notified by hotel to reply with the pre check-in form. This was really great as we got advanced express check-in on the day itself which save up time and fuss. The reception staff was very helpful and explained clearly on the hotel area with map. The room was very luxurious and spacious for the price it charged. Really delighted with it. The only unpleasant encounter was staff at concierge was rude and did not apologize after knocking me with luggage bag, Room service pricing was on high side, however, the food courts close late which can solve late…",40
"I stayed in this hotel in November 2014. It was a two night stay. The hotel is too big to remember the paths and locations in hotel. its just amazing...you find yourself lost manytimes , in absence of hotel map & guide. the stay is very luxurious and comfortable. Bathrooms are beautifully made.  Staff is courteous and helpful all the times.  casino is grand  and it has tables for all type of limits. Canal is mesmerizing connecting hotel lobby and shopping area. Over and all one should must stay in Venetian  for at least a night if one is in macau.",50

It also has a very big and crowded casino in the ground of the hotel, where its casino also become the object for city tour. This hotel also has some restaurant in it, so we have some option for breakfast. This hotel also directly connect to the Venetian mall, where offering many stores for shopping and has a river for canoing like in Venetian.

"When we booked this hotel, we knew that it was the largest building in the world. But once you arrive there you really realise the sheer size. It's simply massive. We stayed there for two nights and we probably spent the majority of the time in the hotel. The check-in was efficient and they even provided you with a map so you could find your way around. But do be aware, there is a lot of walking to do. Navigating to your suites can be tough the first couple of times because you can't walk through the casino with children. The rooms were extremely spacious. They had a huge bathroom (which had either a bath or shower facility) and there was a separate living room from the bedroom. Room service was average because some days they just made the bed and left without washing the used…",40
"Stayed here for a night and was simply blown away by the extravagance. From the hotel lobby to the size of the suites everything was grand and massive. Suites had a separate living and sleeping area, toilet had both bath and shower facilities. Service was prompt. Navigating from the lobby to the suites for the first time can be daunting, especially if there are kids in the group as one can't cut across the casino. ",50
The hotel provides a shuttle bus from the Cotai ferry pier. Check in was efficient and a late check out was not a problem. Even the regular suites are very well appointed with a very comfortable sitting area. Very comfortable beds. The shopping mall under the hotel is huge and there are plenty of restaurant facilities. Our only moan was having to pay for wifi - the rooms were not cheap so in this day and age charging for wifi is a bit unnecessary,40
"If you want to forget about the problems and  find yourself in a magic world, than it is better to be there. Spacious, great, full of attractions, rooms are comfortable, service is amazing. Very beautifull place to be.",50
"Just Wow For  Which ever suite you stay in whatever you eat where ever you go in this resort from breakfast to amazing food options, shopping to Gondola ride, Tour organised in a great way. Handling huge rush and that too very professionally  The biggest and best casino make your nerves thumping. Kudos to the people managing the place",50
"It was ok, checkin was efficient, we managed to get 2 rooms next to each other's which was ideal. Travelled with our 1 year old baby, crib was ok not great, and not many things else for the baby unlike the four seasons next door which offered all kind of products for the baby. Getting to the room with the luggages was a real mess as we had to walk at least 5 minutes through the shopping mall, weird if you ask me. Other than that, the rooms were spacious and comfortable,although I preferred the style of the Sheraton next door and certainly the four seasons but it comes at a price. That being said location is great with direct access to a big casino, a great shopping mall and a few great restaurants including portofino. Not the case for the Sheraton. Overall a good stay but not…",40
"I stayed at the hotel for the Manny Pacquiao fight and highly recommend it. You can fly directly in Macau or take a ferry ($40 U.S.) from Hong Kong. The Venetian about three times the size as the one in Las Vegas with about 8x as many people.  There's non-stop gaming if you don't mind going elbow to elbow with the natives. The rooms suites, clean and well decorated. The shops are pricey but the food is reasonable and plentiful. Everyone except the guards checking IDs are friendly and speak English.  Look for the quiet bar next to Portifino",50

There is no acres of resort space but it has a massive huge building with lots of suites,  restaurants and shopping plazas.  All the suites are very well furnished although may seem a bit old.they have all the amenities inside the rooms. The hotel has one of the biggest casino in macau.  Thehotel is a shopper s paradise with all the brands having a store there. The shopping galleries are wonderful with skylike ceilings to give you a sense of eternity.  The time stands still.

Huge Lobby. Good room. One of the biggest casino. Huge market with gondolas & food courts. Nice & help full staff but apart from water & breakfast every thing is chargeable. But over all very good experience.,40

"170 sqm on the 30th floor, pick up at the ferry port and personalized check in and all very fair prized! I really can recommend the venetian, it's hard to get a better value for money! We ordererd room service at 4 o'clock in the morning and the food was really good and again fair priced :-)",40
"This is one hotel which is the most organised,no mess ups with luggage,specially with soooo many rooms,fast house keeping,nd room service. A very safe nd secure hotel . One can Rome around in the middle of night also. This is a town by it self,I m impressed by its shuttle service",50
"We were booked for high end suite for two nights. We were checked by max who was Dutch. He was very helpful, thanks to him we would have been lost in the hotel. It is huge with 3000 rooms. The room was superb over 2000 sqft, never stayed in such a big room. But Internet was a problem for both days. We were woken up a false alarm to evacuate the room in the night at 4.30 am. Luckily it was a false alarm. We kept calling front desk to find out. We expected them to call and tell us that it was a false alarm. After half hour we were told it was a false alarm. Otherwise it is a beautiful hotel. We loved the room and hotel. The false alarm was our bad luck. Worth staying.",40
"What a lovely place to enjoy your holidays. Rooms are very large and spacious. Of course, much away from your check in point. You need to walk a lot to reach to your room. The separate area for relaxing containing all your needs is enjoyable.. Nice sofas, well crafted chairs, round dining table, lovely carpets in the room as well as hotel gives you a different feeling. Large size well lighted bathrooms containing golden fittings and superior mirrors refreshes you.",50
There were a lot of people in the gambling halls. We were there for the jazz festival. The performers were awesome. We took the fast boats from Hong Kong and the free shuttle to the hotel. The staff was nice and spoke English adequately. It was a fun place. ,50
The room is very spacious even though there are two queen beds in the room. There is separate area for sofa and TV area. Will definitely stay here again on my next visit to Macau.  The toilet is big and clean too. It is very convenient to shop and eat as you can find almost everything there within the resort. ,50
The rooms is so amazing u can see the incredible view of Macao through your window. There bathroom is so clean and so classy i love it! The grand floor is very impressive and so busy too! The hotel is so beautiful...,40
I went with my family for a vacation....Our experience was just par excellence...It's a huge hotel with almost 3000 Suites...A complete mall is made in the hotel...The architecture of the hotel is just like Venice...Gandola ride is just too good...Worldwide cuisines are available inside the hotel...Suite is also very comfortable and spacious too...The casino is very Beautiful....A must recommended Hotel to stay in Macau...,50
The size and magnitude of the hotel are met right from the check in that takes about an a hour!! The rooms are big and very comfortable. The hotel is very busy all the time so you get a feeling of a busy city rather then a hotel. ,40
"An amazing building both outside and in. The lobby area is grand and very impressive. Staff are impeccable and the whole experience is amazing. Our room was on a high floor and boasted incredible views over Macau, and was very large! With his & hers sinks in the bathroom, and a lounge area, the hotel was perfect.  Would love to visit again!",50
"For those who lounge for a romantic trip to Venice without having time to travel to Italy... It for sure is not the real thing, but the ""carton pate"" like shopping mall does the illusion. Its shopping alleys are charming and will take you to an exotic place far from your daily life in China. Rooms are spacious as there are rather suites than standard rooms... Beautifully decorated, with their own living area. Bathroom is huge and rather well fitted. It is worth to plan a travel there as to enjoy a show... Not being a gambler, I did not take a tour to the casino. Breakfast at one of the restaurant from the hotel is terrible: food is way below international standards... Overall, food is expensive in the hotel complex. We tried the food court in the shopping mall at lunch: prices…",40
"We stayed in this hotel for three nights last November. Even though this may be one of the busiest hotels in the world, everything did go off very smoothly for us! Right from check in, to having our luggage delivered to our rooms, everything happened quickly and smoothly!  The casino is the biggest in the world and one can truly get lost in there. Their bars and clubs in the hotel are also pretty good and is frequented by a good set of people always. Nothing much to fault with the hotel otherwise, except for the fact that the restaurants and food court should be kept open longer than 12 midnight (considering its Macao) and also should have more vegetarian options.",50
"Our first stay over in Macau as normally we will come here for a day trip. Choose Venetian as we have been dreaming to stay here since it was open years ago. Took the opportunity of sale period and managed to book a suite at S$270 - 2 Queen size bed. Great value for money.  The room is spacious (62 sqm), well maintenance and equip. It come with a separate bedroom and living room. All room amenities is up-to-date and the room that we booked come with free wifi. Bathroom is well equip and maintenance. There is a separate toilet cubicle, 2 hand basin, a bathtub, a standing shower and a dressing table. The only thing that is lack of is rain shower. Otherwise, we definitely enjoy our time here.  As the hotel is huge, there is two check-in area within the building. Front Office…",50
"We didn't check in from this Hotel, we just simply roam around the Hotel and it's just so amazing!  Usually, there will be live performance from very talented performers, the last time I was there, they decorated the whole area with a 'snow' effect with a title ""It's Winter in Venice"" and it's just too nice to take a picture from outside, you'd really feel the essence of snow and the feel of Christmas.   Once you'll get in, you can take a picture with a very fantastic design and I totally love every detail of the structure.   You'll love the smell when you enter the building too.   There's few guys in costume so take a picture with them too!  If you'll go up, you'll be surprised and amazed by the beautiful Grand Canal Shoppes, it's basically the same with the one in Las Vegas…",50
" Like this hotel like heaven , best recommended hotel , cheap food at level 6 and the room is the best comfort that i ever sleep with my wife !! Only one thing , this hotel is expensive but you can get all your money back by gambling at the casino at the firts floor and good luck !",50
"We always stay at the Venetian Macau during our trips to Macau.  There are convenient shuttle buses parked outside the airport to take us to the hotel in 5-10 minutes. Upon arrival, friendly Bell staff will greet you, take your luggage and give you a stub which you can then present to the Front desk upon check in. The rooms are very spacious. Our room of choice is the Bella Suite which boasts of two queen beds and a sofa bed, comfortable enough to accommodate 5 people.   The Venetian Macau has everything… casino, spa, shopping mall, food court, kids' play area, Gondola rides, souvenir shops, theater, restaurants, street performers etc etc etc. One day would probably not be enough to see the whole place in its entirety.  Should you want to venture out, shuttle buses are outside…",40
"I was there for a business event and I was impressed by the services offered through out the complex. The rooms are very spacious, the beds comfortable, the bathroom is properly equipped (bath tub and shower, private toilet). The room is divided in 2 areas: sitting room with desk, sofa, mini bar and TV and the sleeping area with large bed, tv, wardrobe, ironing table. I was a bit disappointed on the quality of the breakfast. Although they displayed a wide range, a wide food selection, the bread wasn't fresh. The hotel is not entirely covered by WiFi, but most of the restaurants, all the rooms and some of the lobbys are covered with free or secured Internet connection",50
"Super mega beautiful hotel/mall/casino we had a great time here, the gondola ride, food, stores, rooms, beds, design, service, hotel personnel, free shuttle ride, Lunch at Bambu Asian feast the best for me. Food court area is also nice and clean. We went to Macao for the 30th Transformers anniversary as a surprise gift to my son. Super happy when we finally get inside hall F he started playing games, looking at the collections, taking pictures.  Last day we had a prob locating the exit for checkout you have to go to the other side of the mall as entrance to the lobby for check out and airport transfer.",50
"A very unique place to stay in Macau. Beautiful Architecture , shopping area on 3rd floor, canal street,  Italian gondola ride with songs, unforgettable site. Superbly laid Belle rooms. Breakfast with kung fu panda and other characters made our stay very memorable. A must stay hotel.",50
Beautiful suite like rooms. Its like a small apartment in size. The food quality is excellent. Bath and separate shower in the bathroom. The conferencing facilities are huge. Actually everything on a grand scale. The hotel staff were very helpful and prompt in my request for extra amenities. Macau itself seems like a massive construction zone right now.,40
"Its amazing place, lovely architecture, beautiful suite rooms, everything under one roof, its a magical experience there, totally recommended, they also had tours to explore the city, definitely recommended.",50
"Been here 2 times .. Was at the opening of the hotel way back in 2007 .. What a chaotic time ... Stunned and marvelled by the beautiful architecture .. Lovely suite rooms which indulge you in luxury .. Second time we attended the IIFA .. And it was so worth staying at the venetian .. The hotel is a city in itself .. You need 2 days to visit it completely .. Grand casino - one of the world""s largest ... Amazing FOOD Court .. In short one of the best hotels in macau ... ",50
"An all Suite Hotel - the rooms are like reallllllllllly huge !! Excellent is an under -statement ....everything under 1 roof - eating , shopping , entertainment , casinos - you name it , its all there. The stay is an experience itself. Free wi-fi in rooms , the gondola ride is very magical and the food - amazing excellent food. Only hitch being the check-in procedure takes really long and so does the concierge service but still the service is prompt enough taking into consideration how enormous the Hotel is !! And yes you do have to walk around a lot.....",50
"Venetian Macao has to be visited to be believed. It's a city within a hotel with canals, gondola rides, shopping, restaurants and a massive casino. You have to spare a day to experience the place. It's worth more than that actually if you are fond of casinos.",40
"The Venetian Macao Resort Hotel is a lifestyle, an experience; not just a mere accommodation. An sprawling resort hotel complex in the Cotai Strip, its like a city under one roof - where you need not go anywhere else to find the things you want - inspired after the lovely city of Venice characterized by its 'Grand Canal' complete with gondola services and connecting bridges. Dotted along the banks of the canal is a seemingly long miles of specialty stores, shopping arcade, and high-class boutique offering high-end products and pricey signature brands. World-class dining and leisure facilities make one's stay truly enjoyable albeit expensive. The hotel itself has spacious lobby although crowded, very elegant. Checking in and out is fast and hassle-free. Suite room is opulently…",50
"Booked two suites (connecting) for a family of 6. Rooms are spacious, with big bathrooms and cosy seating area. The hotel itself is self centered for all kinds of shopping/entertainment/food... Everything is simply all under one-roof! There is also a well-known food street within walking distance from the hotel (via the sky bridge). We were offered an express check in during our arrival at the hotel which we simply avoided all the queues for check it! That was so lovely! Despite the luxurious and comfortable environment of the hotel (both interior n exterior was a gem!), the best thing I would praise about this hotel was the great hospitality of their staffs. It was very unfortunate that my mother had experienced a serious health issue during our time in Macau and also had to…",50
"The humongous property isn't just a beautiful place!!! Its magical!! Everything under one roof....The rooms are spacious and all the luxury it brings along definitely makes a great experience....The room service in fact is swift..the place also offers food for all kinds of taste buds....and a Pretty decent casino....If you're there, also don't miss the shrekfast as it is a lot of fun....In the end....it was splendid!!!!",50
The hotel is small world in itself . Great place for shopaholics. The mall in it is huge. The casino floor is very large.we stayed for 3 nights didnt see the sun for the first 2 nights as we were busy exploring the hotel.The rooms are huge . The service is good and helpful overall nice experience ,40
At first i got a little disappointedbecause i thought that the famous gondola ride asian version is outdoor until we arrived thou the copied version is fair so we did tried it since thats the reason why we had an over night in macau from HK when we had our turn the sad part again is you need to share it with another couple and the ride starts the guy who did the ride is the most exeptional one its like you went there for them not really the ride itself he is so entertaining knows different types of languages will sing romantic songs to you from the country where your from fantastic i just really had fun just because of that overall we had fun thanks venetian!,50
"Not like I've stayed in all the hotels in macau but when you have the biggest casino in the world, fine dining restaurants, shopping mall, spacious themed rooms, mini golf course, gandolo water rides, free shuttle buses, tour guides  all within the hotel premises then why look for any other option.",50
"It was a friends gathering and we booked two suite rooms to sleep over among other rooms as well since we had so many ppl, but it was a great stay. The room was quite big but I didn't like that the bedroom and living room were all connected (as in no wall in between them) but it was still nice...I liked that the fridge is packed with drinks, very convenient but a bit pricey! ",50
"Just stayed in the hotel for three nights and am happy to say that it was a pleasant stay there. The check in was fast as we completed the Express Check In form sent to us.   Considering the size of the hotel, was impressed with the speed of the staff in getting things done. Firstly we requested for extra pillows and the staff turned up with the pillows in less than 15 minutes. The second instance was where our key card cannot opened the door as we left the other card in the room. We saw a housekeeping staff in the next room and told her our problem. She called someone on her handphone and after identity verification, the staff on the phone told us that he will send us new key cards. Again this was received in less than 15 minutes. This is very fast considering that the hotel…",40

"This is the hotel which everyone should visit and see it. Excellent services and rooms. Very very well decorated. Huge property. This hotel cannot be explained in words you should visit it. I think it is one of the best property in Asia. Everything is inside the hotel starting from Casino, Shopping areas, Restaurants, Food Courts, Gondola service like Venice, for Indians there is an awesome restaurant The Golden Peacock. Rooms are very big with great toilet.  This is Hotel is like a small gorgeous City inside with all things that you are searching for. Free WiFi is available in certain areas. There is golf course inside the hotel, then great gym and swimming pool is also there.",50
Name says it all. I walked for 3 hours. yes 2 hours inside Venetian hotel and never walked the same street twice. It is enormous. Usually it is reviewed for having the world's biggest casino but the real splendor is hotel itself. Gondola ride is excellent though half of the operators are Chinese still they know how to make you feel in Italy. My first recommendation is gondola ride. it gives you the best view of this hotel.,50
"I thought the Las Vegas Venetian is big, but this is three times bigger. You look into endless tables of black jack and roulette, and most tables are full. Lots of people. The hotel is very nice, has lots of high end shops.",40
"I've stayed at the Venetian and the Palazzo in Las Vegas, and twice at the Venetian in Macao, as must say that the properties are all very similar. The Venetian Macao is a massive casino/resort with plenty of food, shopping and gambling options.  The suite-style rooms are especially spacious and very well kept, but include television sets from the 1990's and a channel selection that rivals the 1960's.  Clearly they've built the property and the rooms to focus on gambling, so if you're into that, this would be a great place to stay.",40
awesome hotel.....one of the best luxury hotel i ever visited ...just wahoo..interiors casinos exteriors..location everything was out of the world ....it is such a huge hotel that you really get lost ..breakfast was awesome,50
"Stayed at the Venetian for a conference being held at the hotel. Rooms were huge and clean, hotel was like being in a mini city, I never found my bearings, but all good fun. Casino was actually one of the better ones, and full all the time. The staff and service was something out of this world. Shuttle bus runs continuously between hotel and Macau Ferry and other parts of Macau. Plenty of food options around too. There seemed to be 2 sections to Macau, the Venetian is in the Upper Section with other big hotels, there is then a more ""Vegas"" style section just a few minutes in the shuttle bus away. Cannot fault a thing! Wonderful experience.",50
"We stayed for a Night on our Trip to Hong Kong last December 2013. The Hotel complex is the Best. It has unlimited  shopping, Casino and eating options. As a Hotel to be at Home it is too huge and is very crowded. The Rooms are Big and very good. They are kept well. But since it is a huge hotel every thing takes time including the luggage arrival, check in process and also the checking out process.",50
Stayed here for 1 night with my husband and 2 children (age 11 and 12) and booked Bella Suite as they provide 2 queen size beds and suitable for family of four. The room is spacious and luxury and we really enjoyed our stay here. Walking through from one end to another constantly is a struggle.The swimming pool is very far from our room and my advise to ask nearer room to the pool if you intend to swim every day.,40
"I stayed here for 2 nights, I must say staying inside the hotel and enjoying shopping and playing casino is more fun than going Outside into the city. The hotel boasts of 3000+ suite rooms and has around 2000 shops..In short it encapsulates a city within itself. The food @ Cafe Di Rico was awesome. ",50
"Suite was very spacious and nice with a separate living area and 2 queen sized beds. The bathroom came with a bath tub, toilet and shower stall, all 3 separated with a dressing table. Very nice and spacious. Had problems unlocking our door after checking in and subsequently had to call for help. Overall service was good, but there were too many rooms and the corridor was very long and quiet, feels a little eerie as you don't see people around. On our last night stay I was awaken by someone trying to open the door and it wasn't my room mate! Guess it could have been a mistake... But it made me feel very uneasy. Overall, stay was comfortable and pleasant other than the incident on the last night.",40
"I had visited the Venetian Macau a few years ago and came back for a recent visit to the Macau Grand Prix.  The rooms are all suites and are very spacious and well appointed. I had requested a non smoking room and there was certainly no tell-tale stale smoke smell in the room which was a relief. Alas, some of the other guests on the floor seemed to take a more liberal interpretation of the no smoking signs.   Fortunately, a smoking ban had come into force since my previous visit which made walking through the casino, other public areas and dining in the restaurants much more pleasant. Such a shame that the main bar still allows smoking: I was looking for a drink but the smell turned me away.   There are several restaurants which all look decent. I used the dim sum restaurant on…",40
This hotel is amazing Indian food at peacock restaurant is amazing Hotel staff very friendly and guided as properly when we checked in The only thing which I didn't like was there was no private areas for hotel room guests But then also if it's Macau then the Venetian is best option  ,40
"Property is one of the best hotel i visited inn my life ,I am 59 years old.But over crowded it is huge ,well maintained ,good service hotel. Only problem is this that when you come from hongkong by ferry you will take the hotel shuttle service ,hotel has provided this service for helping us but staff of this service is very bad ,we were received by a slim short Chinese girl ,who can not speak or understand English,she was very rude and hopeless ,we were having two big suitcases ,we look for her to just give a helping hand to load it on the bus but she refused it and after sitting in the bus during our 7,8 minutes drive to the hotel ,she was talking very loudly with the driver of the bus ,she was not thinking that after a long journey we need some peace full time,Hotel should…",50
"I would have never chose this hotel by myself, I came to the Venetian for a congress. Really not the type of hotels I really like, but the Venetian is not only a hotel, is a concept, a city in the city. Everything is huge and if you are a LasVegas fan, you will not regret it! If you hate crowd and noise, avoid it! You can easily get lost but this is a really funny experience. The flow of hundreds of customers is quite well managed by a very helpful staff, rooms are spacious and well equiped.",40
"Its my honeymoon in dec-13, very awsome hotel , nothing else to watch in macau either this hotel, if anyone want to stay and enjoy in macau , then he must stay in this hotel , service is quit slow but its ok....staff is very cooperative ",50
"The hotel is huge and luxurious,full of activities going on everywhere.Staffs were very friendly and didnot have to wait for check in. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in Venetian.The food court offered different cuisine and very versatile as well,rooms were big and clean and was very convenient for me to shop,as it had all the major brands..Casino was very huge and crowded.Overall had a awesome time in Venetian.",50
"We stayed there during our honeymoon and enjoyed every minute. The hotel was great and luxurious, had a helpful staff, the atmosphere was always fun, the casino is huge and was full of people all the time, the restaurants and food court were versatile and tasty. One of the best hotels!!",50
"Nice hotel and nice verona suite.  Only upsetting was when you first enter the room(7043), the smell of the cigarette was bad. I had to immediately open the balcony door as i have a 4 year old girl. The stench of the smoke stick to the sofa and carpet. I suggest the hotel should air the room everyday and ensure strict regulations for people who smoke in the room.  The balcony is huge place for smoking. I have to think about staying in this hotel next time.  Also the room looks tired...... overall nice stay and staff were all great especially nice was Faith Lord, Ben and his partner working in the south wing.",40
Very huge hotel. Easy to get lost here. It is an all suite hotel so the rooms are huge and hence VFM. The restaurants are plenty and nice specially the indian restaurant. Do try the huge casino and connected shopping and food arcade,40
"Spacious living room with individual washroom.  Not the best hotel in Macau but acceptable with its pricing.  Despite the noisy travelers all round, I have nothing to complain about.",40
"The Venitian Macau , A Huge , A beautiful, and We can call it a city inside.. Everything is there, whatever u want. All the rooms are suites..They have very large, comfy, luxurious and spacious rooms. Bathroom is very big and king size.. So for rooms i can say 10 out of 10. They provide free pickup drop from ferry terminal throughout the day.The staff of the bus is very rude.  As its a Casino cum Mall cum hotel ,When u reach at hotel, u will find that u are roaming in a very crowded mall or street.Very noisy place. So nw its time for check-in, the hardest thing to do in Macau  (Even bungy frm Macau tower is easy then to check-in at Venetian) A big que was there and we had to wait in que to get our rooms key. So after 3 hrs of waiting we finally got our room..Its like an…",50
"This is a beautiful hotel and absolutely massive.  We were still getting lost on our last day.  Hotel room was amazing and big.  Rooms are split level and had a settee and chair, dining table, office space, 2 TVs, gorgeous bed, beautiful bathroom and felt luxurious.  Main areas are a tourist attraction and you have to fight the hoards of tourists to get anywhere, in fact it felt like living above a large shopping mall due to the number of shops, restaurants and people.  However rooms are quiet.  Took around 20 minutes to get to the pool but once there this area was always virtually deserted and peaceful, with four pools to choose from.  Visited the Galaxy hotel across the road for their buffet which was fantastic for food choice and quality.  The Galaxy felt a lot calmer…",50
"1st visit in macau & stayed 1 day (Wed) in this hotel with my family of 5 with young kids after HK. Exit from ferry terminal, turn left is the free shuttle bus to hotel. Swift & early check in with free upgrade to two queen size bed when the counter staff noticed we have 3 kids but booked 1 king size bed. Clear guidance to room with map given as kids not allow to walk through casino.  Our mega room is at South wing, 28th fl, nice view.  Wow wow wow my kids commented when we entered the room! Two tv, separate living room & beds, huge bathroom with bathtub. Kids channel and lots of channel to choose.  Walking to swimming pool was a tiring way from our room. We surveyed the pool before we buy swimsuits. The pool staff informed us that the kids can change swimsuits in our room &…",50
"We were here in November first week, probably the best time to visit Hong Kong & Macau. We stayed in a suite which was beautiful. The Gondola ride with Neilo was an amazing experience! He could even sing beautifully in Italian. You could spend a day here and take another day out for the local Macau site seeing and casino hopping.  The casino within the hotel is also a great attraction. In spite of the hotel being huge, the room service is great and prompt.",50
Its not good to say any words for this its just beyond words you really need days to exolore this resort must stay actually worth for a seven star just amazing its really pleasure to stay at this hotel plenty of indian food nd shopping within the hotel u can enjoy not only macau but only hotel too,50
Unbeatable Luxury time with my love! The rooms were huge with all the facilities! Free Wifi was the most aspect for me! Spent a lot of time shopping and at the casino! The restaurants were amazing at the property!,50
"This is one of the best and one of the biggest hotel in Macau.The ambience is excellent.With more than 3000 suites rooms, you get a lots of option to choose from.The rooms are well decorated and really spacious.The service by the hotel staff is excellent.Anyone staying in this hotel will have a gala time with 24 hrs casino with lots of shows and events.People from all ages can have full entertainment during their stay in this hotel.This is the perfect hotel for hosting large conference, meetings etc.With spa, gym, mini golf, and swimming pool it becomes a complete package for relaxing.The food is also excellent, you can choose from Chinese,Japanese,Asian,western varieties of food.Ultimately this is the best hotel with full entertainment, if anyone visit macau.",50
Our family consisted of 5 adults and 2 children (10 and 5 years old). We booked Two (2) Bella Suites. The Bella Suite is a huge room with 2 Queen Beds and a Living Area with a sofa bed. The sofa bed was transformed to a comfy double bed when we arrived but opted not to use it since the 2 Queen Beds were more than enough sleeping space for our family. We also chose the Cotai View and we had a nice view of the Cotai Strip at night though I do not think that this is a must really because there are still a lot of constructions ongoing in the Macau skyline.   We made the booking directly at www.venetianmacao.com website when they offered an 8-day flash sale with a 40% discount on all their suites. The benefit of booking directly at their website is the free in-room Wi-Fi (very good…,50
"Stayed here for 5 nights for a business meeting/ conference. The room is very big/ spacious, but a big old. It is not really a ""business hotel"", too much of distractions (casino). The toilet facilities are not many, so have to walk a far distance from meeting room to toilet. It's located at new macau, so hardly see any heritage buildings here. I could see the huge Galaxy Hotel from my room. Generally i am happy with the hotel.  ",40
"We stayed with our 2 kids for one night during Mid Autumn festival in one of the Famiglia Suites. The Venetian is such a giant building, but the check-in went super fast and friendly. From the moment we stepped into the building the kids were excited because on every corner there is something to see. When we finally got to our room the kids absolutely loved it! Their own bunk bed, an area with toys and a place to color. During the evening we just walked around, enjoyed the street entertainment and went for dinner in one of their Italian restuarants. The family knows the Venetian well, but it was a super fun and entertaining destination to stay overnight.",50
"after a second visit, this huge resort still awe me! big comfort room.. good food.. good entertaintment.. lovely lil venetian and gondola ride...   magnetic stores that give good sale price... everything is here! though the crowd at the main entrance was kinda packed and tiring, after taking the stairs and met the 'inside'... wow...  what a complete complex of resort!",40
"We had a wonderful stay at the Venetian with a blend of luxurious stay, shopping and good variety of food.  After 4 days in Hong Kong, we travelled to Venetian via Cotai Ferry Service from the Macau Ferry Terminal to Taipa Ferry Terminal. From the Taipa Terminal, there is free Shuttle Service available to the Venetian Resort. The service is every 10 mins. Quick and very comfortable. Carrying luggage with you is not a problem at all.  On arrival, Baggage Service is available till you complete the check in formalities. We took around 10 mins to complete all formalities and the luggage was directly sent to our room from the baggage service. Exceptional!  We had the Royal Suite on the 33rd floor with a view of the airport and the main cotai strip with a view of most of the other…",50
"Only stayed for 2 days 1 night ,probably the biggest Hotel in Macau. Great prices and a Big room  Top spot,not really kid friendly as it is a Casino. Like i said the rooms are Big.Some with good views some without. Reception was nearly as big as the MCG. probably the only thing is taht you have to walk thru the Casino to go anywhere. Heaps of places to grab a bite to eat or shop if you want. If you like a lot of people around this is the place to be.",50
"Macau is suffering from shortage of labour, thus I don't have high expectation on the quality of service in Macau Hotels no matter how high the price is. However,  this one really exceeds my expectation. First of all, they have very good express check in /check out service which minimize the waiting time at the reception counter. Second, receptionist who is an indian lady, is very hospitable. She noticed that I am allegic to cigarettes and reminded me to avoid the smoking area inside the casino. Thirdly, rooms were clean and decent with comfortable beds and plenty of amenities, housekeeping is also very prompt to attend to orders for replenishment of amenities which is very rare in Macau. Fourth, very quiet inside the room even though it is such a big resort. Fifth,early check…",50
"I stayed there for 4 nights last year.   Spacious, elegant and very opulent rooms.   I had it by my lonesome as I was covering the Pacquiao-Rios fight. The buffet for members of the media was free flowing so were the sparkling water, juices sandwiches and all in the media center -courtesy of the promoter and the hotel. Except for the overwhelming presence of Asians, one would think he or she is in Europe.  I had this spectacular view of the sunset from my room window as it disappear in the middle of the high-rise buildings. We in the press were given a very generous discount for the rooms and it was worth.   Worth going back again this month.",50
We had a 2 day stay at the property checkin process is slightly slow as there are always lots of guests checking in but fortunately they have many counters across the hotel but the handling the welcome of the hotel is out of the world.From checkin to checkout every process is handled with through professionalism and great care for the guest.The rooms and staff behavior is fantastic I would recommend everyone going to macau to visit the property,50
"The very big hotel look is amazing with fine modern architecture with very big shopping arena,casino and fine food court with all kind of cuisine.Room is studio with lounge big bathroom with very nice lay out and good amenities.It was a large king size bed in a room.We had the best holiday at resort except it is a long walk to room from elevator.Hotel has finest security all around to look after their guests.We strongly recommend this resort for very good holidays and shall visit again.Hotel has paid wifi which is wrong as modern concept of hotel means very good room with free wifi.",50
This is an amazing hotel and one gets to feel the luxe of the placeas soon as one steps into the Hotel. Large suites that are over the top in ambiance. Steaming with people and an over crowded casions.   The restaurant area that they have is just amazing and filled with people round the clock. The best of brands in the world make their presence here.,40
"My family and I stayed at the Venetian Hotel in Macau in the 2nd half of October 2014. We traveled via jet boat from Hong Kong (which I prefer!) and upon arrival there was a free shuttle bus that took all of us from the Boat Terminal to the Venetian—so convenient!   Getting to the hotel lobby, which is incredibly ornate and smelled really fresh, there were a lot of people just taking pictures of anything—the ceiling, the sculptures, the door people, the garbage can, the carpet... anything. It's a tourist haven. Since we had a free room because of the frequent times we had gambled there, we were invited to a separate, more shorter, line. It took less than 10 minutes to get our hotel room key.  Walking to the hotel room was intense. We had to walk through the casino, amidst many…",40
It was a very good experience at the hotel. Very good service the staff is also very helpful. The casino is one of the best in the eastern part of the world.. Had a great time there. Its a bit on the expensive side but its worth the money,50
"Stayed here to relax after a business trip, I am a big fan of the themed hotels like this one and it did not disappoint..felt very special to stay in and the room was huge. 70sqm!  Shower isn't good and WiFi should be free but otherwise this was an awesome experience!   Tip: you can purchase ferry tickets and a 3g sim card from the hotel concierge, its better value to get a sim than pay the daily WiFi fee. Concierge was great too.",50
"Just to be sure, I'm reviewing the Venetian Mall, because I didn't spend the night at the hotel (I could've if I won my money back at the casino- LOL) I've been to the real Venice before and I must say I'm impressed. The interior design was actually good! There was some time when I felt like I was really at St. Marco piazza! They even made a fake sky to make it feel more Venetian!",40
"It's an enormous and beautiful hotel with many activities and spectacle. I could spend the whole day exploring this hotel. The room is beautiful and large with separated living room and two TVs. The bathroom is also luxurious. I got the view of the new Galaxy hotel in front of my room which was beautiful at night. But underneath my window was part of the hotel's roof (lower roof) which was quite annoying. They have WiFi but not for free, which was sucks. The breakfast was plain and boring with not much choices. And the biggest downside was the lack of smile from the staffs. Not a very friendly place, especially if you want to gamble and waste money at their casino.",40
There isn't much more to add to what has already been written about this incredible property. This place is much bigger than the one in Vegas and has the world's largest casino. Despite its size and enormous crowds it turned out to be a surprisingly relaxing place to vacation. That's because it offers a variety of activities to partake of and you can do as much or as little as you like. The highlights of the Venetian Macau are: large and luxurious rooms; fantastic food courts with choices from around the world; many fine dining options; hundreds of shops; a number of shows; fabulous outdoor pools including one that is fully heated for winter; the world's biggest casino with low-betting options for low-rollers like myself. I especially enjoyed pretending to be James Bond at the…,50
Big luxurious beautiful rooms. We were on the 30th floor overlooking The Galaxy Casino. We had booked our room through Agoda and only paid $210 a night so was a bit dubious as to what we would get but was very impressed that we stayed another night (purchased again through Agoda as The Venetian direct was more expensive). The bed was big and comfortable. TV in the bedroom and one downstairs was great. To say you have stayed in the biggest Casino in the world is pretty cool. The duty free shopping malls and the canals a thing to see. You are positive the clouds are moving and when the gondolier starts to sing it is magical. Pool area was great with adult only area (downfall pool was only 1 metre deep) and cocktails by the pool a must.  Fogo Samba (just head up the stairs) for…,40
My Ma & 3 sisters went to Macao to celebrate Ma & a sister's birthday last Aug!  The welcome & special treatment we got was beyond anything we dreamed of.  Thanks to Russel & the fab Guest Relations Team who made visit memorable!,50
"Stayed 2 nights, loved the huge rooms with 2 comfy king size beds, big lovely bathroom and nice living room. View from room ok and could see a little of Macau's airport. Lots of shops selling branded items.  The river cruise was lovely as the boatman sang in Italian opera, great voice. Only down sides were it was too crowded all over and you can get lost due to the size of the hotel. Food was average and rather expensive!",40
The Hotel itself is crowded as it's one of the tourist spots in the area. This is smaller than the LV Venetian. The Bella Suite is big enough to accommodate a family of 6: 2 queen sized beds and a sofa at the living room area. The best part of the room is the bathroom and shower area as it is spacious to do whatever you like. There are lots of swimming pool here.,40
"The hotel is definitely the best and biggest in Macau but that also means is always super crowded. If you don't mind that, then it's the place for you. Very lovely rooms and the mall inside the Hotel literally has every brand you can think of. It was an amazing experience but the next time I go to Macau will stay there only for a day, not much to do if you don't gamble.   You must try Lord Stows Bakery, their egg tarts are absolutely heavenly. They have a branch in the Venetian Mall.",40
"We stayed here early October and we arrived early and they let us check in which was great. All staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was very clean and well furnished and had lots of magazines and brochures with info about the resort/shopping centre. The casino is massive and you can get  lost in the shopping centre as its huge and stocks all big brand names, which is really convenient if you love shopping! The resort offers free shuttle buses to other resorts and attractions in the area so no need to waste money on a taxi and run all day and into the night.  Overall worth every cent I paid!",50
"This was our visit, and must tell you i wil definetly come back for this place. All the rooms are so big and lavish it will definetly make u feel pampered. Superb rooms!! The hotel itself has so so so so muchhhhh to do that u wont get time to go around macao. We saw galaxy hardrock and many more but nothing comes even close to venetian. The casino venetian is the biggest in macao and the best one, all other casinos are worth just a visit but better to play ata venetian if you need to play low stake. The in-room dining option has so many options to choose from that you will get confused what to leave and what t order. The food is brilliant. The wi-fi is chargable to residents which i found was annoying, as for 1 day use the vharge is USD 20. However there is free wifi at the…",50
"This is more than just a hotel. The city inside Venetian never sleeps, always lit and full of people from around the world.   This is probably one of the best stays of my life, as of now. If you are in Macau, you can't miss Venetian.   The casino is nothing less than awesome. I made some HKD 5000 - and then lost them all in a single night :) but a casino night I won't ever forget.   Rooms are decent, choose a nice cotai view. We stayed on super high floor (it was 50th or higher).. The view was amazing. Decent bar, and you can buy the right movies via television too (if you know what I mean, the collection was nice)   In Macau, if you have a good company... You don't feel like coming back home!   Cheers to Macau and Venetian, we will definitely come back! ",50
Very good room and very big room. 3 swimming pool and kids room is specially good for family guest. Macau famous water show running building is just walking distance. But too huge hotel so that room is too far. Also you have to get through of casino without any choice is not good.,40
The only problem we had with our stay at The Venetian was the fact that we kept getting lost in the shopping centre.    The hotel is massive. Every corner leads to another canal or row of shops.  We had a wonderful experience. The room was beautifully appointed and the bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. The room was large and had a lounge area separate from the bedroom on a different level. The bathroom was beautifully appointed.  The only down side from the experience there was the high charge for wi-fi.From memory it was about $AU20/day. In this day and age this is something that should be included in all hotel packages.  We eat in a number of restaurants and from our experience you will be well served by any of them. We dined in the Golden…,50
"Stayed at the Bella Suite (with Cotai View), and it was pretty nice. What's truly impressive about this hotel, however, is the service. All of the staff were very helpful and quick to respond to requests. We had a bit of trouble with the Wi-Fi and ironing board, but we got help with both fast!  As for the view, it's much better at night: You can see a lot of ongoing construction projects in the morning, but that's fine. Actually, we prefer the view and overall area in the Macau Peninsula, but we still think it's not a bad idea to spend a bit more to get a room with the view.  The casino here is very busy, but you really won't notice this if you're playing since it's so big and you have a lot of tables/machines to choose from. Shopping is also fun because the shops are diverse…",50
Venetian is a beautiful place to live in while you are in Macau. There is a shuttle bus service from the Macau ferry wharf. Its a massive sprawling hotel. The suite was made ready to Wow us when we first open it. It has good shopping options and an amazing food court. The artificial sky is quite close to being the real thing with the whole architecture modeled along European style buildings and rivers. The shopping area with the river is a Must See. There is an amazing Indian Resturant - Golden peacock. This is a must for anyone who loves Indian food and is worth the money. Only minus point is the Paid wifi.,40
Arrived there in the morning and did the tour around the place. The place is really big that I got tired of walking around and I even got lost when I went to the swimming pool for a dip. But the stay was really worth it. I even saw many friends who happened to be performers there. Many of them singers and instrumentalists. I love the gondola ride. The next time that I'll stay here I will just do a staycation.,50
"I have just spent an amazing couple of nights at this fabulous hotel. The sheer size of this resort is staggering. You will have to walk some distance between your room and the casino, restaurants, shops and swimming pools etc etc, but it is well worth it. The style of decoration is pure Hollywood, but that's what adds to the experience. The suites have every modern convenience and you could comfortably stay there for hours, but then you would be missing the pleasures on offer - dining in a selection of restaurants, we enjoyed both the Portuguese and Italian restaurants near the canal; swimming in one of the five pools; having a flutter in the casino; enjoying the live band in the Bellini Lounge or just people watching. We popped over to Macau whilst holidaying in Hong Kong and…",50
"I wasn't staying in this hotel, but I was also nicely served at the shuttle bus stop.  Arrived at the outer ferry terminal this afvo, I was bit confused at the shuttle bus stop opposit to ferry terminal since it's under construction. I asked a guy passing by where to get the shuttle to my hotel, he showed me and brought me all the way there instead of just pointing or refer me to other counter. Thanks Anthony! Gives me good impression on Venetian! Please keep it on!",50
"Spent two most amazing days at this massive resort with my family. Just the sheer size of the property is awe inspiring.   Given the sheer  size, it's surprising how good and prompt the service is. Or package allowed us to choose either the breakfast or the lunch at 3 different restaurants. A lunch we had at the Bambu Restaurant was probably the best meal we've had in our life. And that too on a buffet! The only slight downside is that generally speaking some members of staff behave with a little bit of prejudice against Indian guests. We're a fairly well travelled lot, but we lost our cool with a steward who was managing the queues for coaches to various other hotels one evening as he kept prioritizing Caucasian and Chinese guests and kept other, mostly Indian, guests from…",40
"Macau is a relatively small place, so the likes of the Venetian and Galaxy are well known. These hotels are a marvel of modern engineering not failing to capture a luxurious ambiance. We stayed in a suite in The Venetian, which seemed like it was straight out of a magazine for most extravagant hotels in the world. The casino is ginormous. The hotel is huge to say the least. Worth a visit, even if you are not planning on staying there.",50
"The Venetian Macao is a hotel like no others - it is more of a small town then a hotel really. The hotel area contains casino, restaurants, shopping areas, food court, concert hall as well as a small venetian town with canals and everything. You can spend hours just gazing over the beauty and size of the hotel.  The rooms are huge and spacious and feel very luxurious as well as the bathrooms. The room service is impeccable.",50
"Four of us checked in on the 7th of Oct for 2 nights. Wonderful hotel. Rooms are nicely done and large with a separate sitting area. Two TVs and abundant toiletries. Well stacked mini bar but very expensive. A bottle of Heineken was for 60HK$ whereas in the shopping area it was for 30HK$. Could be even cheaper outside. The Hotel is so huge that one can easily get lost in the network of corridors and have to keep on seeking directions. Wi fi expensive, very expensive, so avoid. Just walk into the adjoining Hotel Sands, again very elegantly made, where Wi Fi is free in the lobby! Bus shuttle service is great and frequent but remember to be clear about your destination as most staff does not understand English properly and you might end up boarding the wrong shuttle. One aspect…",40
Yes i am right for Macau you can say that if you stay & enjoy in the Venetian hotel 90% is done.All other sight seen will come in rest 10%.Go to Macau only if you are interested in Casino  & night life.One imp.information:In venetian wi-fi is chargeable but if you just cross the bridge & go to the Sheraton Hotel lobby which takes hardly 2 min .wi-fi  is free.Water is chargeable but you can take water bottle from casino to your room free of charge.Enjoy good Indian food in The Peacock restaurant Venetian.Remember to take hard drink from hong-kong airport if you are interested.,50
"Stayed one night in this huge hotel. Hotel decor are grand but dated. Its quite a long walk along the corridor leading to the gym and swimming pools. The room And bathroom are clean and big. Bed are comfortable and soft. The hotel are linked to shopping area, restuarants, food court and casino. I feel safe even there's a casino at the basement of the hotel and the air smells clean as long as you are not inside the casino. The linkage from different tower is a bit complicated especially when we got an underage teenager in our group we were not allowed to cut through the casino to get to our destination But the ground staff were all very friendly to direct us around. ",40
"Took the ferry from Hong Kong Airport and arrived at the Macau ferry terminal where i was greeted by pleasant hotel hostesses giving you directions to the hotel bus. What then greeted me was hordes of Chinese tourists jamming up the lobby and a snaking taxi queue of over a 100 people.  The room itself was comfortable, spacious and had all the mod cons expected of a large hotel. Service was polite & professional with no complaints whatsoever. The shopping mall was XXL and a map was needed to navigate the grounds. At the Casino area, the most enjoyable non-gaming activity is probably people watching. Enjoy the spectacle!",40
"If you haven't yet, and you're about to visit Macao, this hotel is worth trying once.  Huge hotel grounds - think mega mall + mega food court + mega hotel + mega casino + concert hall - all this with a gondola ride.  The only issue I had with the place is the cigarette smoke.",50
Beautiful hotel. Very huge. One can easily get lost here. Once you enter the hotel you are in a different world of luxury and excellence. You feel like alice in wonderland.No need to step out of the hotel for many days.   Beautiful lobby. Lots of good restaurants. Relaxing swimming pools. Worlds biggest and happening casino. World class shopping. Qube the child room is very much missed by my child. The hotel provides free shuttle for all hot places and hotels in macau. The hotel is interconnected with cotai central hotels and city of dreams is just opposite the hotel.  Gandola ride was fun. Indian food in their food court was delicious.  Rooms were pure luxury. Large suites with lots of amenities. Room service was very caring and always ready.  Always keep a map of the hotel in…,50
Worth it for the gondola ride. It's huge so be carful you don't get lost. A casino where no one is drinking at the tables except bottled water!! Some very expensive shops and a lot of gold leaf. Be carful if you do win as there are people watching when you go to cash in,40
"So from Hongkong I Continue my experience to Macau. I stay at Venetian Hotel. This is a Huge Hotel thaht Provide Casino, food court, souvenir shop and there is a Gondola at the center of the hotel. You can ride it by purchase a ticket near there. At Gondola you there are a person that ride the Gondola that sing a good song for you, his voice is really great. After that you can try a casino there don't forget to bring your passport for sure ! after that you can buy a lot of souvenir and also snacks there. Remember it is a huge hotel so you can get lost there so be careful hehe.. Now the room. the room is huge and so well managed, this is a hotel that you need to stay when you visit macau.. a great hotel ! if I go to Macau i will stay there for sure..",50
"We came to the Venetian if for no other reason that to stay at the biggest casino in the world - and we weren't disappointed. The resort is a huge maze but lots to see and do. Not overly crowded and plenty of restaurant options. Only issue is that it's the same feel as staying on the Las Vegas strip, which we were hoping for.",40
"Complimentary bus service from the border with China to the resort, and from the resort to other major hotels. Check in done in a flash even without a booking. Very lively atmosphere, with a ceiling that makes it look like daytime anytime.   Room was tastefully designed and furnished beyond expectations. Can't find gondoliers inside a massive complex anywhere else in the world",50
"The Venetian was beautiful! The rooms make you feel like you're royalty. The rooms are clean and amazing. The bathroom has a huge tub and a shower, everything was gold and white and blue. It was really nice to walk around the shops. There was also a hotel taxi that included wifi which was nice and convenient, we hung out at The Galaxy for a little while.  I would definitely go back to this hotel. The staff was friendly and the hotel was just so extravagant.",50
"I check in at the Venetian Macau as part of my birthday tour. I really appreciated the gesture of management of sending a complimentary birthday cake to spike up the celebration. For that, DOUBLE THUMBS UP TO THE VENETIAN MACAU MANAGEMENT",50
this hotel is amazing <3 .. the room is WOW ... the rooms bathroom i liked alot.. also its view is best from north wing near golg course ! the hotel is extravagent .. no one can complete the hotel in  a day ... so its a bit tyring ... also the meals of indian vegetarian cuisine is very expensive .. :/ all indians will not get gud food here .. except 1 restraunt in venetian - golden peacock . the food at indian spice express at food court is smelling... of non veg :( ... they should take instant food there. in macao 1 shaow to watch out is the house of dancing water in city of dreams :)... service of this hotel is terrible because of its huge size :(  overall : the place is lively and enjoyble :),40
Always wanted to stay here.Had the time and opportunity during the recent school break. Was a bit worried about the ease of check-in/out considering the size and popularity of this place (3000+ rooms) but was pleasantly surprised  HOTEL/RESORT: located on the COTAI strip just 5 minutes away from the Airport.There are numerous free airport shuttles to/from the airport (Most hotels have these) but we decided to take a cab which costs us abt US$5.Cabs (we took a few during our stay) were generally kinda dirty and kinda hard to get in some parts of town.  ARRIVAL: We arrived early (c.11:00am) and was greeted by some friendly bellboys/doormen dressed as gondoliers.driveway wasn't too crowded then and we proceeded to the front desk.we were later informed that there were 2 receptions …,50
"I have stayed with my son. Since we have opted for express check in, we got the room key 2 hr earlier after completing formalities in just 3 minuts. Very good staff attitude at reception. Our suite ( Venetian is all suite hotel) is almost 800 Sq ft in size having seperate Dinning and Leaving room,  Bedroom and Bathroom with seperate Bath and Deessing area. There are all the good things in the suite, one can expect from any great hotel. Shopping arcade and list of Restaurant is mind boggling. Food is available for every one visiting from any part of world. Good court is not expensive. You can experience Gandola ride and feel like you are in Venice. 5 Swimming pool suits for every one in your family. Free Wi Fi in rooms and To and Fro transfer to ferry terminal is added…",50

"The Venetian Macao Resort Hotel is the name of the game at Macau . Excellent place to stay in . the hotel is extremely huge , has 5 Casino's , big mall with food court , variety of Shows & events within the hotel . The rooms are absolutely cozy , friendly staff . I have noticed huge number of visitors to the mall & Casino's all the time which makes it advantage for the hotel . if you are looking for comfort then this is the place .",50
"Who needs vegas when we got the same in our door steps  I have stayed here twice so far and it never ceases to amaze me  The shoppes area, the indoor which looks like outdoors, the gondolas, etc etc...the list is endless  Must visit during xmas tho as they have light shows at night and artificial snow....;)",40
"We decided to come to Macao from Hong Kong just to spend a Friday night in a fun place,p. We couldn't have chosen a better hotel to stay in. The ambience and environment at the Venetian are absolutely stunning. The complex of the hotel, casino and shopping mall is gigantic and the style is sublime. We were given a suite on the 30th floor on the south side, the view at night was brilliant. The room was spacious and the bed very comfortable. The staff proved to be extremely kind and helpful, the service was excellent: the hotel provided free transportation to and from the ferry pier and a very handy luggage storage after check out. The only bad note is that we were told we would have a sofa bed in the suite but when we arrived it turned out to be a normal sofa. It was alright…",40
One of the most awe inspiring and biggest hotel I have ever seen or visited in my life. I was there for three days and still couldn't see the full hotel. The rooms are awesome and have the best quality  interiors. being such a large hotel the hospitality is great and the food is amazing!!,50
"The place is very beautiful.. perfect for pictures! It's like a city inside a hotel. A lot of great stores for shopping and food you can indulge in. There's the casino, if you feel lucky! Free bus ride from the port to the hotel. We enjoyed our brief stay very very much!",50
"I loved my stay at the Venetian: service was perfect, staff very attentive, dinner and entertainment were great. Overall I cannot complain as our event was a huge success and we pleased both the employees and the management team.  Highly recommended for business meetings/events",40
"Traveling to Macau for the first time as Westerners, we were a little apprehensive, but everything turned out great.  We took the TurboJet ferry from Kowloon to Macau - went thru customs in about 5 minutes.  Once in Macau, followed signs to the Venetian bus - it was easy to find and dropped us off at the Venetian at around 11 AM.  We were directed to drop off our bags at luggage check and then checked in.  A room was ready for us and the whole process took only 5 minutes :)  Staff was amazingly friendly. I was surprised how empty the place was - the casino tables were a little busy, but the hotel, shops and restaurants were all deserted.  It was a little weird to see it like that compared to Las Vegas where the casino may be empty but the rest of the place is usually packed. We…",50
"My hubby and me stayed there for 5days/4nites, stayed in their Royale Suites. It was wonderful. The place is so beautiful! Starts from the main lobby, everywhere and the rooms you can fall in love in... it was an experience of a lifetime it felt...i am planning to go again!!",50
"This is my second review for this hotel. I wrote this new review to share the following unpleasant experience:  My husband is a big Transformers fan. I got the ‘Transformers Package’ from the Venetian website as his birthday present. The package included: - Accommodation for two in a luxurious suite - Choice of daily breakfast for two at Cafe Deco or Fogo Samba; or enjoy daily buffet lunch for two at Bambu or The Golden Peacock - TRANSFORMERS 30th Anniversary Expo Entry Ticket for two - In-suite free Wi-Fi  Upon check in, we were given a “passport” which contained our vouchers for everything during our stay – i.e. the show, the meal, drinks at 1 of the bars, free photograph, to be redeemed when needed.   Everything was fine and dandy until the next day, when I tried to collect…",40
Hi  I stayed for 2 nights in October month 2013.the hotel property is excellent and its one of the best property in macao.people go Macao for gambling and venetion.   It has shopping area too.the boat ride is a good experience.   The rooms are big and no doubt one of the best in asia.,50
"Forget Vegas, Macau is the real Pearl for International entertainment and resorting.  Being in Cotai, the other side of Macau, id refreshing, and your own oasis.  This place is massive, and you will not see everything in a few days!  Casino has everything, shops are great, and food is awesome.  Rooms can simply be defined as decadent, and are huge.   You will want for nothing, stay a few nights, as grandeur such as this is alot more expensive in other parts of the world.  21 out of 10!",50
"I stayed at the Venetian in one of the more expensive rooms for 2 nights just for the experience and found it amazing. The check in staff were great and everyone in the casino was helpful. Its better than Las Vegas in many ways. However being charged $20 USD per night for Wi Fi took the shine off the experience. I would have much preferred that this charge was hidden in the room rates than charged as an add on, especially when I consider what I paid for the room. I travel extensively, and this was my fifth trip this year with visits to Tokyo Seoul Busan Taiwan and Macau. In all my travels, I have never once been charged additionally for Wi Fi, by any hotel. This made the hotel proprietors look cheap. Unfortunately it dampened my experience at this great hotel. One thing I was…",40
The summer of 2014 we embarked on a journey to Macau and Hongkong...whoa...what a holiday it turned out to be... After landing at Hongkong we took the Ocean route to Macau... We were booked for the following three nights at one of the most exotic resort..The Venetian. The rooms were so spacious and good view and royal toilets...especially the evenings ...the City of Macau boasts a vibrant night life...a delight for gambling enthusiasts. Our package included the city tour. They took us on a whole day guided tour to a few important locations.  If you are at the Venetian you dont have to go out much coz this resort itself has enough to keep you engaged for 3-4 days. The massive Casinos are an experience in itself. The shopping experience is just unbelievable. All the global brands…,50
this is the best ever that i had in my travelling. Big hotel beautiful n nice. So in love in this hotel. Full of carpet. A lot of activity. Shopping and can releks in  gondola and so ever. Easy to excess to this hotel.,40

"I read up reviews on this hotel before arriving in Macau last December. Was quite worried since most of them are negative, fortunately ours turned up to be an excellent one!  Check-in the first thing we reached Macau and it was a long queue (had anticipated this since it was famous for the mainlander crowd). To our surprise, they were really efficient and we got checked-in after around 20mins of waiting considering the length of the queue.  Was so happy to see that our room is exactly what was shown on the website. I love the interior design and the idea of separately the living area and bed. It was so spacious and everything was perfect. Sound proof was excellent that we couldn't even hear anything from the room.  The food was surprisingly good! Ordered in-room dining thrice…",50
The rooms were huge with the view towards the garden. Very luxurious! The hotel itself was massively huge and was wonderful. There was so many activities for kids and adults to do in the hotel itself that we didnt have the necessity to go out.,50
Wow what a huge hotel! We stayed 2 nights in a Bella suite with our 2 children. Great sized rooms fitted out nicely. Great restaurants and shopping in the hotel and great bus service to surrounding hotels and the ferry terminal. Shame that the wifi was not free as per most hotels. Kids enjoyed the pool and the gondola ride through the hotel.,40
"It's pity that no free WiFi in whole hotel.The guide is easy to understand,the shop is full of every kind of things.It's easy to shopping~",40
"The guests who stayed at this hotel are either here for the casino or convention.  Macau as a sightseeing destination is very much limited.  The room is spacious, elegantly designed and equipped.  Probably the room is planned for the weary gambler after a long haul at the table.  I had ordered room service but it took a little longer due to the central kitchen catering for the rooms and for conventions.  In my second night I was advised to hop into any of the many cafes, wine bars and restaurants in the complex.  At first glance the complex seems huge with turns and twists around the canal shoppes.  On the third night, one would have discovered many of the nooks and corners.  Many guests spent their time away in the smokey casino which I hated.  Manage your expectation !  You…",40
"The venetian overall experience is unbeatable.  The venetian is a destination itself. I visited the hotel in the month of April when the venetian carnival was going on. It was truely the awesome evening with lots of events happening.   We stayed at the hotel for 1 night which wasn't sufficient enough to explore the entire hotel. We entered the hotel after arriving via the shuttle buses from the ferry terminal. We booked summer spring package - which was fantastic including breakfast, lots of freebies, MOP 200 to shop and return ferry tickets to hongkong.  Luckily, we also got a free upgrade to the Royal Suite which was truely ROYAL. It had 2 queen size bed, living room, 2 televisions and all 5 star amenities.  The bathroom was really big with all the required things placed…",50
"If you are just travelling to Macau for gambling, shopping and entertainment, staying at Venetian really means you don't need to set a foot outside the hotel complex to get everything you need.   It was generally a good stay at the Venetian. I don't have any adverse comments, but there wasn't anything that particularly impressed me either, except perhaps the room size.  The rooms were extremely spacious, on top of two king size beds, there was still room for a small sitting area and two televisions. The bathroom was equally big, with a bathtub, a shower area and two wash basins. Big is not necessarily beautiful, but I guess it's better than being in a cramped room.  To get to the hotel, remember to take the shuttle bus from either the ferry terminals or the border gates. The…",40
"We stayed at the Venetian Macao for two nights.  We entered the hotel after arriving via the shuttle buses from the ferry terminals.  This is not the front entrance and therefore we did not use the main lobby reception desk.  After walking a little and dragging our suitcases, we did find a desk area to check in.  The whole experience was a little underwhelming using this check in area!  After getting our keys, it was another long walk to the room elevators.  We had a pleasant suite for our family of four.  The beds were comfortable, we we liked the living room area.  There is a pull out couch.  To our surprise, at turn down, someone had come in to open up the couch and get it ready for the night!  We were all prepared to share the beds, but this was a great option!   They also…",40

A perfect hotel to spend a Christmas leisurely vacation. Although Venezian is the biggest hotel my family and I have stayed yet the customer and information service is just perfect! Not a minute wasted and we were immediately checked-in our room when we arrived from Manila. We have stayed in the hotel also in Dec. 2012 and we returned last Dec. because of the good hotel service. The room was very clean specially the toilet and bathroom. We did not miss our toilets at home. The ground floor with all the casino games and restos were great. Some of the waitresses were Filipinas we enjoyed talking with about home in the Philippines. We intend to return to Venezian this Dec to celebrate my birthday again!,50
"Travel Date Dec'2010 We went on our honeymoon and stayed for 2N3D, there was so much to see within the hotel that we hardly got time to visit the city and go side seeing. The hotel was decorated for christmas and it was a beatiful during this season. The rooms were beautifully done and the lavish bathrooms were cherry on the cake, the casinos, hot water swimming pool & the live shows will keep you buzy throughout the day.",50
"We booked the 'Bella Cotia Suite' thinking we would get what's shown on the site; after checking in, we were not happy with the room, we were informed by the operator that the images on the site are spruced up so it's not going to be like what's shown on the site.  The upholstery was shabby, the carpets worn out, the cleanliness was not up to the mark, the housekeeping staff seemed overworked , the only good thing about the room was the view.  Decent Breakfast spread. The Venetian Macau is like a world by itself, it feels like Disneyworld.  The Hotel is spread out and be prepared to walk everywhere, 15 mins walk to any restaurant from your room.  This is more a place for young adults. Senior citizens be prepared to hike. Couples with young children, carry your prams.   Loads of…",40
One of the best properties in Macau..  just the moment you enter the resort you are transported to a different world.. Amazing place.. Amazing people..very friendly staff..  Amazing Indian food at Golden peacock restaurant ..  The super amazing Gondola ride with amazing singers from Italy...Best Casino..Just the feel of the place is soo amazing..  It's worth every penny you spend here.. Amazing memories.. wanna go back there again and again.. 😍😍,50
"The Venetian is a destination itself.  When in Macau, one should experience staying here.  Checking in was a breeze with the help of fellow pinoy who works in the hotel.   The lobby is very grand, we must have took a hundred pictures in the lobby alone. :)) The room is very spacious and can accommodate 4 persons.  I love the sunken lounging area in the room. If you're a shopaholic, the mall downstairs includes everything, from the delicious Lord's Stow's egg tart to Victoria's Secret boutique. We love the signature sky ceiling of the Venetian, we might have gotten stiff neck looking at it.  A must stay when in Macau!",50
"Very popular hotel.  Nice spacious rooms, large casino, huge shopping mall, elaborate decor (water ways, paintings, scultptures, exhibits.  I really like the rooms (large) and service from hotel (bell, desk clerk, bellmen, room service, managers) is top notch.  As an example, room service includes full setup of the meal, including a real flower display.  I was told that this was the ""standard"" of the hotel.  Real first class.  If you don't care for crowds, not the place for you.  However, hotel is so huge and they're used to handling the huge flow of guests/visitors, its tolerable.  Rooms and service make up for it.",40
"Ive stayed here twice before.... no change in my opinion, except I'd say probably its even better, it is being well maintained, I feel like I'm coming home when ever I walk into the rooms...love it.  Service... genuinely seems like its improved, better each passing year. (the place seems to get busier too... more and more people coming) The rooms... still exquisite, huge, spacious, luxurious. All the amenities you could need...  It is still, as I said once before - 'palatial'. This is a great hotel, great resort, great everything.... good food, good service, good shopping... if you didn't try it yet - get yourself a room booked.",50
"Our family stayed at the Venetian Macao Resort Hotel in July 2014 for an overnight due to a concert located at Cotai Arena, which was inside the hotel.  From Hong Kong, you take the 1-hour hydrofoil to arrive Taipa, Macau.  Then you go through Immigration, and as you exit to the left, you will see blue shuttle buses that will take you to the Venetian Macao Resort Hotel.  They are complimentary buses, so very convenient.  As the hotel resort complex is huge, you have to listen to the recording on the bus as it gets closer to the complex, advising you whether you'll be arriving from the ""East Wing or West Wing"".  The recording message comes in 3 languages - Mandarin, Cantonese, & English.  Hotel rooms are located on the North & South wings.  Our room was located on the South wing,…",40
"The hotel is huge. It's easy to get there because of the free buses from the ferry terminal. We stayed at the royal suite. It had a queen sized bed, living room, & 2 tv sets. The bathroom is really big. It was a good stay. I had the best sleep after a tiring day. There are shops where you can buy souvenirs from. It felt like I was staying in a mall with hotel suites upstairs. Must try: the Gondola ride. I think the hotel should get newer models of TV sets. As they had one crt and an old lcd flat screen. ",40
"My husband booked a room for us (3adult 1child; 3D2N) when we visited him in Macau. It was indeed a pleasant surprise! We checked in easily and since venetian hotel was so huge they included a map and instructions how to get to our room. It was on the south wing side, there's a bit of a que towards the elevator going up but its okey. We located our room 2083. It was beyond my expectations!   Two queen sized bed, plenty of pillows and comforter. 2 tv (bed & living room area) living room; sofa is also a pull out bed, few lamps, coffee table, fridge with snack and drinks (for a fee ofcourse). Complimentary water, sachets of coffee, tea, sugar and electric water heater, mugs, teaspoons, chopsticks. office area; printer/fax, (bring your own laptop or comp) 3 phones (bedside, office &…",40
"The Venetian Macao Hotel is the right place to be if you want to enjoy a Great Stay! You can spend hours in the room watching TV or lazing in the bed. You can also sit together and have some good quality time with your family in the living-room area of your suite. To add to it you have a well designed wash room equipped with all the necessities. If you have enough budget and you really want to pamper yourself with the best; this is the place you want to stay! However, the life outside the room and in the Casinos and the Shopping area is very crowded. This is primarily as you have the locals visiting these together with the hotel guests. You will experience this mainly over the weekends. The same place will feel good and calm when you venture out of your rooms for the breakfast.…",40
"It was our first stay on our honeymoon. Venetian was awesome n soon all tiredness of the journey was gone. The best place in Macau!! The casino is huge and so is Venetian.

"What a hotel to stay at!  We were in a Royal suite in the North tower and it was spectacular to say the least.  The hotel is mind boggling, it is so huge and stretches so far, if you go be prepared to be lost most of the time.  You must take a canal ride, it is wonderful, be prepared to sing some classic love songs with the gondola operator.  It is well worth the time.  This had to be the most awe inspiring hotel I have ever seen.",50
"Booked this hotel for my mom and wife and had a very good review [August 2013]. Lot of options within the hotel; good choice of restaurants, bars and nightclubs; good shopping. Lot of shows which are a must see.  Amazing architecture. Very spacious suites with lot of bed space and good bathroom amenities. The casino is must visit and operates 24 hours. Excellent customer service, hospitable and helpful staff.",50
"worth for money, entertainment everywhere and nice location if you have spare money, just try to play in their casino  or take the tour around macau, but once again avoid when holiday season in China or you will come together with noisy group everywhere",40
"Largest hotel room I have ever stayed in and yet I've only paid around $250 AUD for this sheer luxury..... all you need in a 5 star hotel and much more....It may not be the best and newest hotel in Macau anymore, but you must visit this hotel to see the artificial sky, grand canal and Venetian decorations.",50
"Stayed for a second time at the Venetian, would say everything is great, will start with the pros:  1) Super spacious suites, good for family, very attentive service with baby cot with mini pillow and bolster  2) One of the grandest bathroom ever, complete with the works!  3) Great service directory within room, and top notch room service.  Now the Cons.  1) Horrible wait and quene for check in, this is something which has been ongoing and ongoing but can't seem to improve  2) Super long walk from reception to the rooms, depending on where you are being located to, THEN you have to walk a super long way from the lift to the room  3) Inconsistent service, sometimes I have great service from the reception and sometimes you wanna throw something at them, because they simply can't…",40
"The sheer luxury of the suites at the Venetian was the biggest comfort we all felt as soon as we checked - in. The Venetian with its three thousand rooms was perhaps the largest hotel i have ever stayed in and it was amazing to see with what efficiency the hotel was being operated by the ever smiling and helpful staff. The food for the in-room dining specially the Indian menu was excellent. The night club ""Bellini"" was another great experience. The round the clock casino , the shopping mall and the golf course are world class. Great experience overall !",50
"We had been at a holiday at Venetian Macau.. The Hotel is just amazing as its size. It has  all the fun places like the casino, sightseeing, entertainment etc. The rooms are value for money. ALso the overall feel is good.",40
"I was stay at florence suite for 1 week with one of my family 2 years ago on february. the suites was amazing. the lobby is huge and they were real quick for the check in process. it quite busy at that time. it just like one stop entertainment. the room, the shopping mall, the show( at that time they have cirque the soleil show) and of course the casino. they also have free airport transport at that time. and the concierge really help full with the direction (hence the hotel is quite big) but after 3 days we already get used to it. makes me wanna go back again. it's really clean, the security is awesome, they were really friendly too. the service is great. really have great experience at that time.",50
"Unbelievably huge. Its a small city by itself. Make sure you stay there for at least 2 days to get time to explore the entire place. Huge shopping malls, food courts, casinos, etc etc etc. All depends which package you choose, but its worth trying at least once in life. This place never sleeps. You go there any time of day or night, you will see crowds. As this place is open to all, in the day time you will see shoppers and diners as well. So its not only for room guests. Anyone can walk in and explore this place. Food is expensive but you cant expect Macau to be cheaper. Wifi is chargeable unless its in your package. Its a massive property and its worth trying no matter how much is costs you.",50
"So basically I went to Macau for day use and I heard so much of the activities in the Venetian. It did not disappoint. They have free shuttle buses to and from the Macau ferry terminal.  Basically, it will drop you off the west hotel lobby; when you step inside you will be able to have the luxury to explore. They have gaming lobbies from that entrance so you can try your luck. But if you go to the Venetian, don't leave without visiting the Venetian canals. The detail is to die for, and its' great for selfie moments. Shopping is fun there too. A lot of shops to choose from and if you are lucky you will be able to see he opera singeer.  ^.^",40
"Indeed this is the biggest and the most luxurious hotel i have ever been into but if you wanna chose this hotel for your holiday there are some points you should keep in mind :  1- From  the entranrnce  you should walk a lot to get into your room since there's the casino in the main floor .that could disturb you when you are back to the hotel too tired to walk .  2- Location : good .. near the galaxy (with a great Cinema ) and City of dreams ( texas holdem poker center )  and many other places trick : there's always a bus taking you to the place you wanna go or at least near that , so check your navigation for an economic pick up   3- Rooms : Great , infact the best part beside the mall  4 - Do not waste your time looking for the other shopping and food center since the best in…",50
"By now you would think all five star hotel would have free WiFi however not this one. 160MOP a day. Pretty much everywhere else had free WiFi and the grand hall had it too, so random people can use it but not guests who pay. The hotel is quite old and you can see it in the motors, but they've managed to keep it clean. The rooms were really spacious although the view isn't great.",40
"A wonderful hotel and if you ahve been to the Venetian Hotel in Vegas then you feel like you are in the same place as Vegas. The hotel is wisley located right in the center of entertainement. All major casinos are jsut in walking distence and if to lazy to walk just take the free shuttle buses outside.  The rooms are great and huge in size, shere space to relax and enjoy a day with a view ove the strip. The best of course is the shooping since the four season and venetian  are connected you have endless shooping opportunities. Restaurants are great and lots of choices right at the canal insode the complex.  We had a great weekend and will be back again here.",50
The inside is very 'Venice like' as expected in all Venetian Resorts. The casino was great and the parties were awesome. Actually visited this place in March 2011. The shops had a huge range within brands and also the decor was very attractive and appealing. I just went in for a walk and didn't stay because it was too expensive. I would recommend tourists in Macau to just have a walk inside and enjoy the luxury of it and as well as the casino (I've almost lost my jacket there). Price warning: 5 star or above! ,40
"This was our 2nd stay at this hotel. My kids were so impressed for the first time and requested this for the 2nd time.  They love the Qube playroom, swimming pool and spacious room. This time we booked 2 rooms and the hotel upgraded us to two connecting rooms which were so convenient for a family to look after our kids.  We ordered room service for breakfast which was much better than going to crowded restaurants in the mall. It was so relax and enjoyable. We do recommend to try room service if breakfast is not included in the package.  Finally, one reminder to Venetian is that they should not be so mean in offering free internet service to guests. Internet is not free by default unless your package has included. Last time, our package had included free internet but they still…",50
"My first impression of the hotel from a distant was wow. and till the next day of my stay i held the same opinion until i realized one thing which i shall share little later in this post.   First the good things : The casino, Gondola ride, the Golf Course, Indian Restaurant - The Golden Peacock, endless dining options, exhibition center(that time they was the transformer exhibition), painting exhibition by a renowned artiste, shopping, shows, complementary shuttle service - what not, a complete world in itself. Vibrant..!! Efficient and quick room service.   Not so good things: Once you step in to the hotel you are stunned and little disappointed seeing the number of people getting in and out of the hotel gates and the rush to get inside the hotel. Although people abide by the…",40
"I have no doubts in saying that this is a brilliant hotel. Excellent rooms....  excellent casino... good food....  the ""artificial sky"" shopping area etc..  all are too good. But i would suggest stay at some other hotel and come to this hotel as a visitor. There is no charge for visitors and you can see all the things here just not the room. If you are staying at may Hotel Galaxy which is just a 5 minutes walk from this hotel then you can access the artificial beach in that property and you can come to Venetian anytime to see the artificial sky shopping area or casino or to enjoy food at any restaurant etc.   People in limited budget can stay at any three or four star hotel near Venetian and visit this hotel in day time.",40
"The hotel was simply marvelous. You get awe struck the moment you enter the hotel. It is literally a world in itself, you would need 3 days just to cover the hotel. If you are planning for Macau, plan for The Venetian, nothing else. Also i recommend this hotel as i had won a Jackpot as well at the Casino :) They have created Mini Venice inside, with Gondolas, shopping, a ceiling that looks like sky etc. The Casinos are huge, therefore there is always place for everyone. Try it to believe it.",50
"This is one huge facility with a lot of shops and dines. The architecture really makes you feel 'royal' haha. They provide complimentary shuttle too!  Though I have not yet been to Vegas definitely I could say I felt like I'm in Vegas, the Fabulous Vegas; but they say this one does not have the Vegas spirit; well maybe I have to go to Vegas to see. Still, this place is Vibrant enough to experience fun.  Whatta cool place to be in. The ceiling looks real clouds... simply amazing. One visit is not enough; you can dine one your first day, shop on 2nd, play and gamble on the 3rd and so on! haha.",40
"Stayed in their suite for a night  Beautiful suite. Spacious, comfortable and well equipped.  Checked In via Express Checked In but have to pay MOP 230 if you checked in  before 2pm but you can go to you room earlier to enjoy your room longer.  If you are new in Macau, the shuttle bus to all tourist destination is free and available from various hotels, including Venetian.   Four of us stayed in suite.   Checked out us a breeze via express checked out. What is great was you can leave your luggage at the luggage counter and you continue to shop.   Great hotel and services.",40
Huge casino hotel. Grand entance and big lobby area. Room are spacious and clean. Shopping and dining with the resort itself and there is shuttle bus provided as well. Casino is crowded and one could tell that the a huge percentage of guest and gamblers are from the mainland. Worth a visit when you are in Macau.,40
"Landmark in macao ,spacious rooms ,very big and beautiful property ,must stay .lots of activities in the hotel itself for kids as well adults ,complete package for all ,casino is decent ,amazing part free unlimited bottled water in room service ,problem long check -in ,cant be relaxed after few drinks in reaching your own room as long passages in hotel n confusing ones ..staff not that helpful ..but overall its one time good experience ..Marina Bay sands better option in Singapore... ",40
"This is a massive hotel and the main activity here would be gambling. It is very very crowded & noisy. The Hotel can be classified as grand as one would expect for a casino hotel on par with Las Vegas. The room decor is again grand but clean & spacious. Luckily once you get into the lifts to the rooms, it is quiet & quite a nice escape. But beware, lone male travellers, there are alot of prostitutes hanging around the lift areas soliciting, occasionally a male pimp will be sitting by the lifts also looking for suckers. There are ample restaurants & a food court. There mall is very nice, there is a canal running through it where you can be serenaded in a gondola, looking up is the blue sky.  10 mins walk from the north lobby will take you to Taipa Old Village.",40
Venetian takes you into a different world as you enter.. Huge casino.. Amazing architecture.. They have depicted Venice very beautifully inside Venetian.. They also have some very good restaurants serving delicious food.. A must visit place in you are in Macau..,50
"Our stay with the Venetian in May 2014 was a perfect family holiday experience. The hotel within itself is self sufficient and hosts several shops, cafeteria, restaurants. The rooms are spacious and luxurious. The artificial sky and the boat ride in the river beneath the artificial sky are the most memorable and enjoyable moments. We travelled with with our twins and mother. Lots of in house activities for kids. The restaurants were superb and catered to needs of all in the family. Over all an awesome experience for entire family.",50
"If you know what you are getting in to you will LOVE this hotel!  This is not the kind of hotel you go to for rest and relaxation - although I will say the rooms are HUGE and I slept like a baby, I did not hear any noise whatsoever when we were inside of our room.  However, the main reason for going here is for exploring the casino region of Macau and maybe a day trip to the old Portuguese quarter - both of which we did and both of which we fully enjoyed.  The hotel is basically one big wonderful illusion. We sat along the rivers drinking coffee and watching the gondolas go by -  yes, they really have a river flowing and men singing on the back of gondolas, very surreal!). We sat under the bright blue sky, at 1am!! (A fantastic light show of different skies above you). We loved…",50
"With so many hotels in Macau, I did not expect to see such a fine and elegant hotel.   The rooms were exquisite.   It was more like a suite. Two queen beds, living area and sofa bed.   The rooms were relatively big. Fine décor inside the room.  The only issue we had was that the linen did not smell fresh and even a change did not produce a better result. Great gym, super number of pools and even a putt-putt golf course. Venetian overlooks another highly-rated hotel next to it.   In fact  a walk inside this other hotel revealed how gordy it was and how elegant Venetian was.   The bus service to and from Venetian was so useful.   We had no idea that we could access other casinos from the bus station.   The food court in Venetian has a fine selection of foods but tends to be…",50
"Enjoyed the stay at the venetian for 2 days as the rooms were really huge, great view and comfortable bed. The in room dining was really good and liked the way they set the table and placed the food for us. There is a food court and a mall connected to the hotel which is a plus point and the interiors of the hotel is just beautiful!! There was a transformers exhibition inside the venetian which my son enjoyed a lot   Downsides of the hotel - The shower in the bathroom is a bit annoying as it has no settings to make the flow of water slow, it hurts when the water splashes directly on you at full force. The bath tub has no shower line which makes it more difficult.   During check out we had to wait for more than 40 mins for someone to come take our bags.. eventually we carried our…",40
"My travel agent booked Venetian in for my vacation in Macao. I have read good reviews about the hotel. The hotel was beyond the imagination. It was amazing and exciting experience in the hotel. Every possible amenity is there in the hotel. They have lot of eateries including an Indian restaurant in the hotel. Complementary  meal can be chosen between breakfast and lunch and you can choose any restaurant available in the hotel. This has the best and awesome shopping place. The architecture of the hotel was amazing. We could not see the complete hotel in the 2 days available with us. Given a chance, i would definitely love to go there.",50
"everything you need all in this hotel and the shopping center, free shuttle bus to many area in macau city, ferry terminal and airport. room big and comfort, unfortunately the breakfast are average and need some time for check in.",40
"This is a fantastic facility in terms of grandeur, service (absolutely exceptional), room (fabulous size, bed, lounge/dining area, super fast wifi, bathroom - you need nothing, stunning view) ... ... ... however it is a 3,000 room hotel in the middle of a huge shopping complex and a vast casino - so there may be 5,000 guests but there are 15,000(?) shoppers and 10,000(?) gamblers.   The restaurants on the ground floor, though not hotel exclusive, are fantastic too, especially the Chinese one.  As such the hotel gives you a 5 star room with 5 star restaurants and 5 star service but not a 5 star overall experience.   In London, the Savoy or the Ritz would not survive were they in the middle of a massive casino and an even more massive shopping mall. In Macau, I guess this is how…",40

"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Venetian and had a wonderful reception to the hotel by Russel.  Nothing was too much trouble.  We had a Rialto suite which was wonderfully spacious with a fantastic bathroom and it was the best sleep I had on this trip. The only downside is the distance to the main town, so if you are there to be able to wander around the town, the Venetian may not be the best location for you. If you just want to spend an afternoon sightseeing, they run sightseeing tours which are excellent.",50
"Late Post: This is my go-to hotel when visiting Macau. I have probably stayed here more than 5 times and each time gets better and better. One of the managers at the Front Desk (RJ) is fantastic and always ensures we have a pleasant stay. The rooms are big, spacious and most importantly super clean. There's free coffee and tea in the room which is standard and I love. Great selection of shops  and restaurants. Much better than the Venetian in Vegas for sure. Can't wait to be back!",50
"This is my late review. Went there for second time. They are still the same. One word can describe it. Majestic! First time went there on late 2007 with my future wife and parent in law! Now i officially went with my wife and daughter. Last time you couldnot see city of dreams from your room. The problem if you went there is 2 days still not enough to explore the hotel facility, huge mall and casino. Too bad i lost that time. Overall for traveler whom come to Macau for first time, you must visit this hotel.",50

"The gaming city in the world macau is known for its famous casinos, and there are many of it. This resort does need any intro many of us must have already visited . This is a world within. Such a huge property with 3000 rooms but still so well managed and well maintained cannot even imagine. Getting our luggage fron macau ferry to the hotel shuttel was little trouble some but otherwise it was a grt stay. The indian restaurant the golden pecock served delicious indian cuisine in buffet lunch and dinner we got our 2 lunch and 1 dinner included in the package after skipping bf. The other amenities were grt too. So overall enjoyed the stay.",50
"From the moment I stepped foot in the Venetian I was charmed by its luxurious interior - the beautiful high ceilings, chandeliers and European architecture. The hotel is incredibly large with many facilities and much like the Venetian in Vegas, there are gorgeous canals and gondolas floating under the sky painted ceilings.  The suite my partner and I stayed in for the night was absolutely huge and I loved the Venetian-style décor - especially the King sized bed which was draped in thick curtains (a very ""royal"" feel about it). The bathroom was huge too, with beautiful mirrors everywhere and a separate toilet.  The location is great and it was very easy for us to get to the hotel. Once you arrive at the ferry terminal in Macau you will notice the bus station outside - simply make…",50

"Worst things first! The pickup from the ferry terminal to the hotel is through hotels own coaches, which at peak times are too frequent. But the helpers at the pickup point are extremely rude. I travelled at 25 weeks of pregnancy, which means it was obviously visible to everybody that i am a pregnant lady. i queued up for ascending at the pickup point and was indicated to move to coach by the man and the lady helping there. just when i was about to give my luggage to be stored at the bus bottom, they indicated my husband very fiercely to move away from bus. initially they stopped everyone else too to climb the bus, but then instead of us (we were four), they let in 9 more people and just shooed us away. again they asked us to queue up, by which time there was already a big queue…",40

My wife stayed there for three days and two nights for our honeymoon and it's one of the most memorable experiences that my wife and I will treasure. The room is spacious and beautifully decorated like an Italian villa. The furnishings are exquisite and the bed is big and comfy. The bathroom is equally roomy and sparklingly clean.  Take a tour inside the hotel and be awestruck by how cleverly they made the interior look like an Italian village.

In general observation was that drinking water is not always served or provided unless u ask for it. The water bottles in room were of small size and to cater to thirst atleast of Indians we had to ask for water atleast 4 times a day in room. The glasses in room were of narrow diameter and they hit your nose while drinking. It might seem awkward but that was my observation.  Checkin was slow as the counter takes a lot of time to input your details on system. I shall suggest management to procure passport details etc along with credit card details at time of booking only for security authorization so that time of checkin can be reduced.

You get almost every brand to shop including duty-free shops. Casino is huge and one can always be short of time exploring the complete hotel. IMPORTANT: This hotel is on island Taipa, rather than in Macau. So for everyone coming from Hongkong, please take ferry to Taipa rather than Macau. It will save you about 1 hour of traveling.",50
"The place is so massive it makes a week feel like a day, shopping, food, casinos, gondola ride, kids activity centre, restaurants for all, theatre, pool, bars,  just everything under one roof, makes a perfect holiday place. A MUST VISIT. -- ps very crowded, but you still will have your space.",50
I stayed for 2 nights in venetian. The rooms are so good and big. Whole hotel staff is friendly. worlds biggest casino. hotel is so big tht all 4 gng anywr we have tp depend upon the boards. Hotel cafes were also awsm. Wish 2 stay 1nce again whnever possible...........                                                                                                                            ,50
"Huge casino, unending shopping area, bouquet of restaurants. The property has everything in it that you might ever need. Jacuzzi and pool area are awesome. Check - in was quick. Golden peacock serves amazing indian food. Truly the heart of HK- Macau vacation South wing is better.",50
"Everything about THE VENETIAN is ""Glitzy & Grand"". Service was good..in fact I was pleasantly surprised to see the welcoming staff in a Saree. THE ATTRACTION was the recreation of Parisian street & the gondollas...must visit !!",50
Great hotel golden peacock is excellent experience is awesome beautiful ambience excellent rooms and best room service it's best hotel gondola ride is perfect. Hotel staff is very polite and nice helpful ,50
"We stayed two nights in December and were a family of five staying in two rooms.  The hotel is humongous and very well laid out. We were checked in quite quickly (less than 10 mins). If that sounds longer, there have been instances in my travels where we had to wait couple of hours at other large hotels.  The rooms were very well laid out, have a nice seating area, nice bedroom and a huge bath. The amenities are all first rate.  Due to the size of the hotel, personal attention is impossible from the support staff. You need to show the keys to access the guest elevators as there is a huge shopping area inside the hotel with shoppes around the st marks square replica.   This is bigger than the venetian in Las Vegas even though every thing from the lobby to the shopping area are…",50
"In a time when reality is being 'recreated' , this resort takes the cake !! It's a virtual yet real city within a city having its own sky, canal ,walkways n city cobbled streets. Perhaps what they will now add is rain on demand !!  Truly luxury redefined...large super comfortable rooms n an approach to pamper the guest at every stage. Stayed there about 2 years ago n have friends who have been there since then...the standards and the wow factor are all intact   Worth spending a few nights at this resort even if you are not he casino types.",50
Grt hotel. Staff was helpful and polite. Don't need to go out of the hotel. Food court was grt with all cuisines. A lot of shopping. Rooms were grt. Free shuttle to the airport. Wi Fi is not free. Even after we purchased it did not work in the room. The charge was waived off. Grt hotel for a grt price,50
"Of the many casinos in Macao, The Venetian is my favorite. It simple has it all: casino, hotel, shopping, entertainment. The building is designed with an eye for detail and the inhouse boat cruises are a charming extra to the Venetian atmosphere. Of shops and dining options The Venetian offers the widest selection and targets everyone from high roller to one-time casino tourist, at least that's how it felt to me.",50
"For those who want a quick break, this is the hotel to stay. Whilst it was frustrating to have to take the long way to our rooms, the surroundings are lively. Rooms are large, the bathroom is marble and the room is split so there is literally a bedroom and dining room. Some renovation should do the trick.",40
"stayed 2 nights at the venetian in macau and couldnt have been happier. What a grand hotel.The hotel has one floor dedicated to shopping with all top brands and lots of restaurants to eat available there .They even had gondolas sailing on manmade waterways inside the shopping floor.The bedrooms are equally grand with High definition LEDS , top notch toiletries in a huge bathroom,tea and coffee.The rooms are huge with a  sitting room and seperate bedroom.",50
"I stayed at venetian for one night. at first I booked royale suite. but at that time the royale suites are full. So, they upgraded our room into the bella suite for free. the room is bigger, with 2 double bed, living room, a bigger bathroom and city view. when we said we're on honeymoon, they gave us a honeymoon present. They gave us a honeymoon cake. it's nice to stay at venetian. we just have to go to level 1 to the casino and and 2nd floor to the mall and we can ride a gondola at the canal side. than at 3rd floor we can eat at the food court. We can use Macau dollar, Hongkong dollar or USD dollar for any payment at macau. I love the hotel interiors.  breakfast at the restaurant near the lobby and it was great. They have so many choice for breakfast like american, dimsum,…",50
"Excellent interiors, royal exteriors, awesome place.... One of the best casinos in Macao... Its refreshing. Rooms are spacious and royal. Its refreshing to be there.  The boat ride was the most beautiful thing.  Not to miss visiting this place, even if you are not staying at the hotel. Its public area is as good as the hotel are. The casino is extravagant and one of its kind. In all a Leisurely place though very expensive,",50
"The rooms were nice, little old school type mixed with modern architect. Worlds largest casino , round the clock was an experience. The real attraction was the mall below. Wow! The Venice streets, artificial sky, gondola with singing boatman, shops on the sides of the artificial waterway, all type cuisines were all amazing. Walked around till 12 am and shops were still open! Architecture on the walls and roofs were awesome. Great place.",50
"I was fortunate enough to stay in this magnificent hotel with a couple of friends when we visited Macau one weekend.  The building is HUGE and a complex in itself, it's practically its own city and has anything and everything to accommodate a diverse range of wants and needs…and free beer in the casino cannot be argued with! There's even a facade of ST Marks Square, in Venice that runs through part of the hotel with false canals and gondolas that row up and down, you can even board them and be taken for a ride!  Our suite was exceptionally comfortable and offered a panoramic view of the island.  The bathroom even mimicked a deluxe spa.  I couldn't fault this hotel and even find it difficult to write about it, it's really a place you just need to go to and experience for…",50
"It was best experience ever in terms of place, food, location. We stayed for 2 nights but it was an outstanding experience as hotel is really costly but worth spending. Night life amazing with lots of bands and great food.",50
"A girl loves to shop, and probably they would also love to have a wonderful boating in the canal near those brand shops, then they would probably love the Venetian. I visited the place for a few and it was worth the trip. It's a refreshing scenery having a canal inside the hotel, with lots of places to look around. The staffs were also nice and helpful. So, if you have any questions regarding anything about the place, don't hesitate to ask them.",40
"We stayed at the Venetian for 5 nights while in Macau. The hotel itself is huge and there are multiple entrances and lobbies which took some getting use to so we didn't get lost! We stayed in the Royale Cotai view suite which was spacious with its own lounge area with a dinning table, a large bathroom with separate toilet and the bedroom was spacious also.  Our last 2 nights in the hotel were noisy with neighbours who had their room doors open until nearly midnight both nights and they woke up early too. They were talking loudly and we could hear everything, I would've thought a hotel as grand as the Venetian would have sound proof rooms!  The buffet breakfasts that was included in the price were rather average - we tried both of the restaurants that were included in the costing…",40
"Beautiful hotel,fabulous staff,great food options and activities to keep the kids entertained during the day,and great for the adults in the evening.Only came for the weekend but would definitely return!",50
The only reason to visit Macau is The Venetian. It was an awesome expirience being there. The luxurious suit rooms and world class decor. The neatness crossed expectation. Venetian has made people visiting macau more frequent with the largest casino in macau. the artificial river ride gondola ride is one of the highlight there. There 300+ big brands shoppers paradise.,50
"Few words.  Fun fun fun.  If you're looking for fun place to just enjoy, spend money, and have a good time shopping, eating, and enjoying, this is the place to be.  The suite we had was excellent and spacious.  Price was reasonable.  Check-in took a while; long lines.",40
"A lot was heard about Macau resorts, but was not imagined what it could be. Landing at Venetian was surprising as  large crowds of people, children were rushing in out. Thought we were stranded at wrong place. When in, we were taken care by hotel staff and comfortably escorted to check in counters. Offered water bottles much needed at that time. Our Royal suite no. 2571on 25 th floor ovelooking Grand Hotel mesmerised the scenic view. Room was so big 75 sq mtr provided with each and everything what we need daily in our homes was a sheer luxury. Housekeeping staff was very polite and smiling. Inside hotel we enjoyed a lot. Food court having whole world's restaurants at   3 rd floor at great canal street was amazing. 1000s of shops inside hotel  with all brands of the world was…",50
"The finest all-suite luxury resort, world-class duty free shopping, sensational entertainment and irresistible dining - all under one roof. The room has the luxurious amount of space and very fantastic with artistic design.",50
"29 and 30th june....was a great visit njoyed a lot the pool, food court ,shoppin, ganola ride etc...was a nyc stay with kids and superb spacious rooms as we are a family of 4 with 2 double beds in the room...great keep it up",50
We stay 2 nights. The room is very big 72m2. Suitable for 4 or 6 adults. A lot of shopping mall around the hotel. Free shuttle bus to and from Ferry Terminal. Free shuttle to Galaxy Resort. From Galaxy we took free shuttle to Senado Square and Ruin of Church. No need to take taxi in Macao.,40
"We spent one night here, we caught the shuttle bus from the ferry terminal, the drop off point was a long distance from the check-in counter and not very easily sign posted.  The room was on the 26th floor with a lovely view of the pool and surrounding Hotels.  The room did not offer Free Wifi which was a little disappointing.  We did go to the Day Spa which was lovely and relaxing and the staff were very friendly.  There are lots of shops and eating places but too big to see everything in 1 night.  Overall we enjoyed our stay here.",40
"This is the second time I have stayed in this hotel for a conference. It's big, grand but starting to look dated and worn out now. The hotel rooms are very large. On the other hand the dinner we attended (Western) for over 700 was pretty good given the number of people they were catering for.   There are some newer hotels in the Cotai area which I suggest may be a better and newer option than the Venetian.",40
"Its a great hotel with spacious rooms, lobby, restaurants, shops, casino, shows etc. One need not even step out of this hotel for anything else. The only thing I didn't like about this hotel is that it is too big and has too many people.",40
"i was informed that this is one of the best hotel in macao, to my surprise it turned out be a very bad experience. My son fell ill while we were staying in the hotel. he had high fever and was not able to walk so i called the front desk for medical service . i was informed that a docto will charge $800 to visit your room. i told front desk that i am myself a doctor and what he requires is a hospital. they gave me the address of hospital. I requested them that i am in south wing and your taxi stand is in west lobby i will require a wheel chair. She asked me to deposit $2500 for the wheel chair. I told the fronk desk that they already have authrization on my credit card. she insisted on $2500. i had no cash with me at that time as i was supposed to check out next morning. We had…",40
"Stayed at the Venetian in April 2014 for 2 nights. All i can say in word is this place is ECSTATIC. the architecture of the hotel is just amazing. Its so huge we would get lost everyday and not find our room. We booked a royal suite and the rooms too were very nice. comfortable beds, spacious room and clean bathrooms.Very Good WI-Fi too. The rooms offer comfort and luxury while the rest of the resort offers almost limitless entertainment . If you love gambling this is the place to be. The casino is HUGE. The staff is extremely polite. Amazing boutique shopping. Amazing Lineup Of restaurants and lavish breakfast. Will surely recommend.",50
This hotel was worth every penny pad for. The rooms were big and spacious.Room service was nice and prompt. Breakfast in the hotel was nice and elaborate. Nothing to complain about this place.At checkin you get some vouchers. Make sure to use them before checkout as they are not applied to your final bill.,50
"We had heard so much about this hotel & after seeing the making of venetian on Discovery Channel we decided to stay in this Hotel. Its a huge hotel with 3500 suites rooms.There might be chance that you may lost in this huge hotel lobby is very far from the entrance so you had to carry all your luggage yourself. There is so much to do like shopping casino, gandola ride,pool & also peacock indian restro with tasty food. One can't see this Hotel in 02 days. Its like monster huuggggge. If your are travelling with kids you might face problems as casino doesn't allow child below 21 yrs of age. so take this into notice",40
"Spent two nights at the Venetian, Macau in the second week of June 2014.  In the last year we had stayed in the Venetian, Las Vegas and for this reason we chose this resort for our stay as a part of our Holiday Trip to  Macau and Hong Kong.  I should say the courteousness extended by the staff here is admirable. The property  is relatively younger but four times bigger compared to that in the Vegas.  The check in timings are very strict (not before 3 PM) unlike the resort in Vegas wherein we had been allowed to check in much before. On the positive side, apart from the very courteous staff,  shuttle services are available not only from and to the Air Port but also to few other places including the Ferry.  Complimentary water bottles are given by the House Keeping as many times…",50
"You know a luxury hotel has nailed it when your conservative mom says ""I feel so comfortable here, I can be myself!"". This is truly a place where everyone feels welcome - race, age, size, style no bar. Despite the huge milling crowds, their processes and service are so efficient that one feels no pain whatsoever, whether checking in or out. The decor takes you back in time to a more charming, old-world era. Its teeming with great restaurants and the food options are excellent. All in all, they create an environment that you don't want to leave. A minor quibble is that the casinos could have better and more signage in English. For non-Chinese first-time players, its a little difficult to navigate the different games & slot machines. Some of the attendants/security  on the floor…",50
"We stayed here during New years eve 2014. Although the room tariff was double during ur stay, we felt it was worth it.. this place is huge and every single cornr so well lit during the festive period.. there was a carnival, countdown to the new year, live band performance through out the night and more throughout our stay.. the duty free shopping also was an added advantage.. we never felt the need to step out during our 2 day stay as there was so much to explore within the hotel.. Also, let's not forget the rooms.. every room is a suite here and after having stayed in tiny rooms in HK this felt like a palace.. the room and the bathroom both are so grand and victorian in decor.. loved loved our stay there.  to read more about my HK Macau trip please visit my blog:…",50
"It was overall a nice stay.  The hotel itself is a very big one with all suites.  Apart from the overcrowded lobby + casino + shopping mall, it was a very good experience (mainly the Mainlanders but it was kind of expected everywhere in Macao).    Howeveer, the hotel room itself is a little bit too old, probably it needs a renovation after opening for 6 years.  First, we found one of the lamp in the bathroom is broken, the shower head was not adjustable as it supposed to be, and I can still see the grandma TV in my suite!  The checkin and checkout progress was very smooth, but it could be better if the staff is better trained to let the guests know that it has no difference between express checkout and in person checkout if we already paid the room rate and used credit card for…",40
"A Grand hotel with amazing facilities. THe Shopping arcade, All restaurants, great casino. The rooms are comfortable. We took a suite on the 19th floor. THe breakfast buffet offers a great variety and has a lavish spread. Lots of things to do within the property. A fun place to be",50
"Having been to Venice twice I wasn't keen on staying at this theme hotel in Macau, but at the insistence of my friends I booked a one day package before my wife and I left for a three week tour of the far east. A few hours inside the hotel, I was so dazzled by its beauty that I extended our stay on the spot.   Staying at the Venetian is an experience. They have recreated the beauty of Venice but taken away the stench ! On the third floor where they have made a [smaller] replica of the Grand Canal with gondolas and singing gondoliers, the roof is painted and lighted in such a fashion that even at midnight it seems that you are standing in St Marcos square at high noon.   The hotel suites are very spacious and the sitting area and bedroom area are at split levels that gives the…",50
We stay 2 nights 24 to 26 June 20014. We went to Macau by Turbojet from China Ferry Terminal Kowloon. 1hour arrived at Outer Harbour Terminal Macau. We took free shuttle bus to Venetian. We arrived hotel at 1pm and very quick check in process. Only 10min we got our room key. The room is very big. The mall has many shops and the foodcourt has many kinds of foods. We also tried the egg tart in the grand canal shop. Very delicious. We took free shuttle bus from venetian to galaxy resort. We saw the diamond crystal show and peacock dance at galaxy macau. We took free shuttle from galaxy to senado square and ruin of church   ( take Sanmalo bus ) only 20 min. No need take taxi in Macao. We can take free shuttle from one place to another place. The bus has free wifi.   ,40
"We celebrated an important family milestone in Macau and chose to stay at  the Venetian. We were not disappointed. Everything in this hotel was grand and impressive. Our room was huge with two huge beds, big bathroom and toilet and a relaxing sitting area/salon. The hotel staff were all friendly and accommodating. Room service and food were very good. The shopping arcade offers many choices. There were many restaurants to choose from. It was also easy to move around the Cotai area because the hotel provided shuttles to its guests. It was also easy to get a taxi going to Senado square. Overall, our stay in the Venetian was wonderful and memorable.",50
"The reception queue seemed like a airport check in queue. Everything about this hotel was grand- the reception,  the shopping arcade,  the gondola ride,  the rooms and it's bathrooms.. Overall a grt experience,  booked via makemytrip. ",50
Hotel is amazing! The rooms are massive and very lavish. The only negative is that we had issues with room service/account. The poor room service attendant had been given the incorrect information about our account.   There are plenty of things to do for couples and families!!!,40
"This is my favorite hotel that I've been. Staying at this hotel made me feel like a royalty. The hotel area was humongous! You will need a map to walk around in this hotel even getting to your own room. There were so many things to do while staying. Shopping, eating, gambling, anything just name it! You even have to stay for a week to completely roam around and enjoy this prestigous hotel. You will have to allot an hour to two hours to eat your breakfast. You have several selections of food in the buffet with quality taste. The casino was really huge! (Well hey, you're in the gambling mecca of Asia) I just adore the aesthetics of this hotel. It was very refined and luxurious. You will stand in awe staring at their well decorated ceiling, paintings, wall decorations, etc. Their…",50
"everything is so big n grand about this property. enter the hotel n feels like a palace. rooms are so beautiful, feels royal staying in them. neat n big bathrooms with tubs. two queen size cosy beds, seperate living area, free wifi, all so gus about it. my kids aged 7 n 10 loved the grandeur. they have shuttel bus service for all the nearby visiting areas n ferry terminals so commuting is not a problem at all. this huge property requires more than a day to just go around itself. shopping, food court( with indian food outlet) near south suites and a dedicated indian restaurant in west lobby area with great food is added happiness. casinos r also gud. Overall a great grand experience.",50
"We booked the most basic suite and yet were still blown-away by the large room and its decorations which are very detailed and exquisite. Shopping, dining and entertainment are all within walking distance and the views inside and outside the resort are magnificent. We find the resort crowded and noisy during peak check-in and check-out times with tour guides and tourists shouting at the top of their voices, but well, we tell ourselves that this matches the hustle and bustle of Venice :) Overall a nice experience of a lifetime! p/s : the sound-proofing in the rooms needs to be improved, we can hear conversations going on in the corridor clearly.",40
"Fabulous resort.. One of it kind.. Huge rooms like kings bedroom.. Nice view.. Lots of things to do in one place.. N number of restaurants for all kind of taste buds.. Casino was good but not like Vegas.. No need to step out, you get all luxuries at this place.. You have to be here once in your life time.. Cheers",40
Venetian hotel room is the best hotel room i have stay in my life time. its so big and beautiful can accommodate up to 4 person with a living room too. the room itself has the power to make us stay in the room to rest instead of going out for sight seeing. its so comfortable. and the hotel has shuttle bus service to other hotels is so convenience. i will be back for the room again.,50
"Venetian by itself if a wonderful hotel. The beds are super comfy, the rooms are HUGE, so are the bathroom. The lobby is wonderful by itself, with all its decor. Shopping there is easy, all within the same building, there are uniglo, Macdonald's, Lord Stow, most branded shops, foodcourt.  The only drawback is that there are too many people. These are not tourist staying there, but rather tourist there for a visit (like tourist attraction), and tourist from mainland China, there for a day of gambling. And these people has no qualms about pushing their way past you to go to the Casino. My advice is don't use the public toilets located at the hotel lobby, my personal bad experience is that some tourist from certain country do not know the courtesy of flashing after use. For people…",40
"we went there on 17th June, west lobby entrance was just like entrance to a mall. So many people always on the move, But as one moves ahead towards reception one realises the scale of operation of the hotel. as we had reached quite early, we booked our luggage at concierage (which automatically reached our room after checking in) We took a taxi to macau tower and enjoyed there. we came back around 2 p.m. and there were long queues at check in, the service is efficient and our cotai view room was huge and beautiful. It needs a lot of time to explore the entire hotel..... markets ,casino, swimming pool, gardens and all. At night we were so busy in the maket area that didn't realise that food courts closed at 11p,m, we rushed to Golden Peacock' which was still open. the food was…",50
"A beautiful hotel to stay in. The decor is magnificent, gold leaf ceilings in the lobby and half tester beds in the rooms. Very comfortable. The Italian restaurant, Portofino's was worth a visit. Had the best mojito at the Bellini Lounge. If you book 3 months ahead can get rooms relatively cheap. The food hall is worth a visit for an experience in Chinese cuisine, no Aussie meat pies here.",50
"We had a pretty good stay in The Venetian Macau. As we arrived in the hotel, we were immediately upgraded to Bella suite. We stayed here for  2 nights and we felt that we should have stayed more. The staff was very good and helpful and the concierge also helped us greatly. As we are pure vegetarian , we had pretty good options for vegetarian food. The golden peacock restaurant and Indian Spice express in  the food court served pretty good Indian and Vegetarian food. Altogether, it was the best hotel I have stayed in my life.",50
The hotel is castle like. It is huge beyond words. There are 3000 suites in the hotel. Countless designer shops. A grand casino. And restaurants that serve delicious food. The food court will delight your senses. The artificial sky transports you to another magical world.  But if you want peace and a restful stay then you should choose another hotel.  The rooms are big. Extremely clean. Bathrooms make you feel like royalty.   If you are travelling with kids... Be careful.  There are too many people. Kids can get lost easily.   Also when I was there we saw a thief trying to snatch a girl 's bag. But the security came to her rescue. The thief ran away like a maniac and disappeared into the crowds. So keep your belongings close to you.  The suites are divided into north and south.…,40
"Massive hotel in Macau. Was the first trip to Macau which seems to be pretty dull place otherwise. Found the ""soul"" / life of tourism missing in all the places! Huge investments have been done which is making Macau a better place every year.  Venetian is one of its kind hotel & casino. Four wings, different entrances, no kids area right in the middle of the hotel due to casino can make walking and searching for places in hotel difficult at times. Even though i consider my sense of direction pretty good, it took me more than a day to figure out the plan in the massive property. It is full of water bodies, open entertainment areas, shopping, shopping & shopping areas, casino areas, restaurants / eating areas, kids areas.... overall amazing concept.

"Excellent. Wonderful experience. Shuttle bus picks you from the ferry terminal and drops you at the west lobby, fast check in. The hotel staff immediately upgraded our room. We stayed there for 3 nights. We had a Bella Suite Cotai View, on the 34th floor. Great Suite and a wonderful bathroom, you need a day to explore the hotel. We had the opportunity to visit the Transformers 30 year anniversary. A memorable experience.",50
"The rooms were huge, well appointed with views overlooking Macau. Staff were very helpful. The room it's self had a sitting room and very large bathroom with separate toilet. The shopping mall had something for everyone. It was lovely to wander the shops, whilst listening to the gondolieries singing songs from famous Italian opera's. You really felt like you were in Italy! Overall, couldn't fault the Venetian, just don't get lost! It's huge!!!!   Its just marvellous , mesmerizing and magnificent. Everything is spectacular....",50
First time I reviewed a hotel that we haven't stayed in. Only because of this big fight (Pacquiao-Rios) that we watched at the Cotai Arena last Nov-2013. It's such a fabulous venue. It was our 2nd time in Macau and we're not done yet admiring this hotel. It glitters in gold and they painted a sky at the Shoppes' ceiling. Superb!,50
"stayed there for 2 nights in may 2014. upon check-in we were upgraded to Bella suite. the property is too big and it takes time to understand the internal routes and openings to north and south gates. we had dinner at 'the golden peacock' Indian restaurant which is the best option for Indian food. the suites are spacious and comfortable, the bathrooms are big. one of our suites was facing the golf course i.e. the internal side and it had the best views compared to those facing the external side. the hotel's north gate is in proximity to other hotels. there are regular free shuttles to everywhere in macao from both the gates. The casino is big but it did not have texas holdem poker tables which was a big dissapointment for me. However overall a nice experience and worth the price.",40

I stayed in Venetian Macau for 2 nights .. We took 2 rooms .. Excellent view ... Great casino ... Indian food at Golden Peacock is awesome .. Excellent service ... Well behaved and well trained staff ... Belyni Bar is good for live rock band !! Shopping is quiet expensive ... Must visit is Dancing water show at City of Dreams ... ,50
It was such a bustling place.  The interiors of the hotel was really amazing.  The staff is very cheerful and ready to help. Considering the high number of check in and check out the process is very smooth and fast. Co-ordination between the bell desk and reception is streamlined and one need not worry about the bags. The staff ensures proper information is disseminated to Guest prior to check out. At the Ferry point they also have staff to help Guest unload their bags from the shuttle.  They had good offers on the vouchers to choose from.The stay at the Bella room was an experience. The kids enjoyed the Shrekfast. The rooms were very clean and well kept. The restaurants were also amazing.,50
"This hotel was beyond our imagination, it was the most amazing that we have seen till date (as we have not visited the one in Vegas). The opulence is visible from the moment you enter the hotel, as you find your way to the reception. Check in was smooth and pretty fast considering the number of people checking in each day. The only odd thing is that they ask for a deposit of 2000 MOP, even though you have paid fully before check in. They return it to you when you are leaving though, deducting the amount that you may have used in the restaurants, in room dining etc. They are so well organised as we wondered how our baggage will reach the room, but it did and quite fast. Our suite was on the South side and a long walk from the reception, passing the restaurants. One can easily get…",50
"I stayed at the Venetian for 2 nights from 12th June to 14th June 2014 and it was the best exeperience ever.  The hotel is magnificent and everything right from the suites to room service to staff, everything was exceptional. Awesome choice of restaurants and the food court also caters to all types of tastes. venetian is the only great thing about Macau and nothing more to see or do. But its definitely worth visiting once.  The hotel has 4 pools and beautifully maintained. I would definitely recommend visiting Macau only for the Venetian at least once.  Only one thing they need to change and that is the television sitting area of my suite was a really old one. Though there were two of them and one was an LCD, it didn't matter much!!",50
"This is just amazing.  You need a map to find your way around at first and you need your walking shoes.  Girls leave the stilletos in the room!!!! Flats are the way to go here.  But seriously the room was beautiful clean comfortable and we were in the cheapest room, but what a room.  The staff were generous with their time, helpful and attentive.  There was no shortage of retail outlets, restaurants or bars.  The pools (yes there are four plus a spa) and one was adults only which we enjoyed immensely.  cocktails and quiet time  just fabulous.  Want to try some pitch and putt no problem they have it... gondolas yessiree (and they sing) and of course casinos  but dont worry if you have kids there is a way around the casino so they dont have to go through it.

"Non-smokers beware - this hotel is full of smokers. My first room was labeled non-smoking, but it reeked of smoke. After a miserable night, I asked for a room switch. They really struggled with this, but finally were able to accommodate and my new room was infinitely better.  The rooms are set up just like the Venetian in Vegas. They are lovely, with very nice bathrooms.  The hotel is massive and it's easy to not leave the hotel for several days (especially if you are there for a tradeshow that is inside the hotel). Lots of restaurants and, of course, the canal shops (for those with deep pockets).  The transfer service from the ferry terminal to the hotel and back is excellent.",40
"Its just marvellous , mesmerizing and magnificent. Everything is spectacular for eg. service,staff,food,rooms,ambience ... just royal and at unbelievable prices. The food, staff and rooms are just amazing.",50
"We stayed here in June 2014 and had a great time. We booked the Rialto Suite and they provided a complimentary limo service from the ferry terminal to the the hotel. When we reached the hotel, there was a very pleasant representative called Jojo who lead us to the room and did the check in there. As well as that, she gave us a map and showed us how to go around the hotel and the shopping centre. The room was well furnished and was very large. We had a wonderful time in the Venetian Macau and will highly recommend this hotel. The service staff are simply excellent.",50
"Venetian is located at taipa  20 mins from Macau ferry terminal. You can take a direct shuttle from the terminal to Venetian. At first it won't seem as huge but the moment you enter every corner is a delight. I was staying at 27th floor royal suit north side , facing towards galaxy hotel. Shopping area is very well designed, food court offers almost all cusines, Indian also! The casinos are filled at all hours of the day and the entry is free for adults. Whosoever did the architecture deserves a bow, it feels nothing less than a streets of ancient times and aura is splendid. Staff is extremely friendly. Services are good. I am definitely staying here the next time I visit Macau. ",50
"We stayed for 2 nights here and honestly we dint get time to step out of the hotel property! we reached here by free shuttle bus from the Macao ferry. The hotel is massive and the casino is huge, we almost always got lost and asking for directions! The room (suite) was quite nice and had 2 levels and ours was overlooking the airport and hard rock hotel. Bathroom was lavish and something which I really liked. We put the kids in the play area for a couple of hours and they really had a good time! We had food at the food plaza which had a nice variety of quality food. We had got to the Hard Rock (across the road) for a couple of hours and it was nice too with a more modern casino. Overall this hotel is a complete package and a destination in itself!",40
"We stayed at the hotel for 2 nights. The hotel itself is really big, we made use of the complementary bus service from the ferry port to the hotel which is a great idea. Check in was busy however staff were really helpful. Once in the room it was really big and had everything we needed which was great.  The only complaint of the room was when you had a shower the bathroom floor flooded as water leaked from the shower door We made use of the restaurants staff were always friendly and could not complain about the food at all.  I would recommend joining the hotel sands rewards club, free to join however gives you discounts when shopping and eating.  Overall nice stay and would return.",40
"Worth the Visit.  Spend couple of days but could go around the complete hotel. Hotel is so big, sometimes it looks how things are managed but we were able to get through pretty smoothly.  Casino is quite big and spend good time there.",40
"Its My 2nd Visit to the Hotel after a Gap of 4 Years. Its still as Brilliant as ever.. The rooms are well maintained and The Walking Strips to Sheraton Macau, City of Dreams has been added. A Whole Lot of Shops being created near the Four Seasons too.. But Almost Zero Noise and Still as Vibrant as ever.  We were checked in smoothly and given rooms on the 29th Floor (South). Was travelling with Family, which included 2 kids and they Enjoyed the Large Rooms with the Cotai & Golf-Course View.  My Daughter had a Great time in Qube too.. The Golden Peacock Restaurant is a Wonderful addition, although Pricey the Food is good.. The Service is Painfully slow in the Restaurant thou.  I Feel The Venetian is a Great Property but We Visited the Galaxy Macau next door, and its time for The…",40
"Venetian was the best part about our trip . Stole our heart completely . From the friendly staff , to the huge rooms , to the free shuttle buses taking the guests to places it was all so well managed . We were a family of 4 so we booked ourselves a kotai queen suite .. As it was more economical . But at the Venetian spending that sort of money you get amazing rooms with great view . It felt unreal . Overall I'd give it a thumbs up !",50
"We stayed at the Venetian for 4 nights in June 2014.  After reading the reviews on Trip Advisor, I was a little worried that I had chosen the wrong hotel.  But everything from check in to check out was perfect.  A very very very busy hotel, with visitors outnumbering guests, but once you're in your room it's like a little piece of heaven.  Our check in was very fast and efficient.  We were given good instructions on how to locate the room and it took less than 10 minutes walk to reach it.  The room was beautiful and absolutely huge.  We loved the separate sitting area as my husband had to work two full days from our hotel room.  The bathroom has dual sinks, a separate toilet and a makeup table.  The pool area was perfect - a little oasis away from the madness of the casino and I…",40
First of all there's free shuttle bus from the pier. Check in can take a while due to the vast number of people checking in and out. The hotel is quite large and it can be hard to find your room and get around. We did get lost a couple of times.   The rooms are very large even for the cheapest kind. All rooms are suites (have a separate sunken living area). Even the bathroom have marbled floors and are beautifully renovated. The bed is large and comfortable. Our rate didn't include breakfast so we had to dine in the food court.  Overall I think it's great hotel for couples and bachelor/bachelorette weekends,50
"This was a grand experience for me. Room size was huge, bar stock within the room was great. The resort has a no of swimming pools, a great golf course, a huge huge casino & no of shops on the 3rd floor. It also has a huge space for kids to play around.",50
"One of the best hotels, I ever stayed till date. Everything is there under one roof. Lot of choices for Indian cuisine. Variety of shopping and the best- Casino. Swimming pool, Golf, must be experienced here. Gandola ride must give try.",40
the hotel is nice....great casino n very large rooms the only problem is you have to walk a lot.... the staff is amazing and always ready to help......it is better to stay in the south area as der is indian restaurant in dat area......the food is out of the world....n the best thing abt the hotel is you can choose between breakfast and lunch which is in the package.... overall superb.....,40
"Awesome,The rooms -very spacious clean ,absolutely stunning view,felt like a queen.It is like a small city in a Hotel.The Venice like canal with gondolas was enchanting.The recreation was perfect.The shops in there were great.Enjoyed the casino.",50
"Opt for express check in.. which was really great, the check in staff were really friendly & helpful.. The room really makes my family happy.. kids had alot space & luxury was all i get.. The shopping area were good..the 2nights i stay..i think i do not need to leave this resort. The shuttle were really helpful for me to get to city center to explore..",50
"We spent three days in The Venetian Macao Resort Hotel. We were in Hong Kong for four days. On the fifth day, we checked out from our hotel and took the fast ferry from China Ferry Terminal in Kowloon to go to Macau. We took only two small bags leaving the others in our Hong Kong hotel. The Ferry is a super fast Turbojet and takes only one hour to reach Macau. In Macau, at the Ferry terminal, there are free shuttles for all the major hotels. The queue for the Venetian Hotel was the longest, but there were continuous shuttles coming one after the other and the queue was moving very fast. When we got down from the hotel, the crowd was so much, we did not want to leave our bags with the baggage handlers. We carried them to the reception. The queue at the reception was not that long…",50
"Went there with my parents and my hubby. One of the room has an option to 2 queen bed. Thus helpful for us.   We enjoyed the facilities - casino, retail shops and food. The architecture of the hotel was grand. ",40
"It is on the Cotai strip located between Sands, Galaxy and City of Dreams. The resort has good restaurants and is a big casino. Sands is connected to it and City of Dreams is walkable. Galaxy is close but is not walkable. There a bunch of others that are being constructed around it as well.  Rooms are the same as in Vegas with sunken living room.",50
"I have stayed here twice, both occasions with family for a 'casino and local cuisine' weekend. Both stays were lovely. Beds were clean and comfortable, as were the rooms. Can not comment on the hotel's restaurants as we travelled out of the strip to local places... I did stray from the group/casino and wandered the mall to kill an our or so before dinner.",50
"I seriously don't understand what people don't find good at this place. This was my second stay here at Venetian, first one with my family. We had taken a Verona suite and trust me, it was as plush as a suite can be. The suite, the bathrooms, fixtures and furnishing and everything else was just class apart.  The check in counters are always crowded, but the staff actually works with great efficiency and one does not feel that you had been waiting for long. Checkin process is smooth and efficient, staff very polite and extremely helpful and everything is just about great. Apart from this let me elaborate the other impressive things of the hotel. 1) inspite of the size of the hotel, the upkeep is simply superb. 2) the shopping arena offers a huge selection of brands 3) the food…",50
"The hotel doesnt really need an introduction, Its awesome , lots of fun options, all very good...howewer I wouldnt recommend staying in , I stayed last month with family, Firstly check-in took almost an hour, very chaotic, no difference between hotel guests & normal tourists flocking around, best is to stay at other hotel which will save you lot of money , and instead spend that money on shopping & entertainment",40
This hotel is one of best options for people who desire to spend vacations in Macao. The hotel is located not close to city center and to ferry pier but once you get into Venetian you'll be immediately immersed in a magic atmosphere that reminds Las Vegas hotels. Hundreds of people (almost  90% Chinese) are moving fast into enormous lobbies. Casino is right in the middle of hotel wings and offers several gambling opportunities. The hotel is interconnected with other hotels in the area and offers the great opportunity to visit different hotels and different casinos without exit from Venetian  buildings. The rooms are luxurious and spacious with several amenities. The hotel offers several restaurants but the one that you cannot miss for any reason is the steak house. There I ate…,50
"Went there for 2 nights during Aug-Sep 2011. The place is enormous ... it has everything from Shopping area, food court, specialty restaurant, Ice Lounge and much more. One thing is for sure .. you won't get time to explore Macau if you really want to enjoy this place.  The rooms are great and offer split type floors and they are definitely luxurious.  It also features a casino and you must spent some time here to really get a feel of it but you will find mostly local playing here. The rooms are located across the property and you will find yourself walking quite a distance after you check-in ...that way you also get a glimpse of what is there in the property. Don't miss the zaia show ..its really a treat to watch.  All in all a nice stay and would definitely recommend this…",40
"Glad to be in this place, I met filipino workers. I believe 50%  of the workers here are filipinos.. kudos! We went here with my friends, we're so amazed with the structure of this hotel.. I feel like I'm somewhere in US. Love et!",40
"Stayed with a friend...it's the best hotel resort I've ever been. We call it All in One place: resort, rooms, amenities, playground, hang outs, shopping...everything you need is in there.. You will not ask for more, they are all here.. I enjoyed my stay in Macau",50
"There is just so much to do at the hotel itself that you really don't feel like leaving the hotel much. The hotel is huge and like a maze. Took us good 25 minutes to reach from reception to our room. You cannot go from one place to another without the aid of a map, which is very informative. The casino is huge and a lot of fun! The shopping mall is also beautiful like its namesake. Has some very good restaurants as well.  The rooms very also grand and very good size with amazing view. All in all a very good experience.",50
"My third visit back to Macau and third time stay at The Venetian again! Every time I would say I want to try a new hotel on my next Macau visit, but each time I will end up at Venetian again. It's great coming back to this ever familiar resort hotel, it's just like my second home in Macau! And it's heartening to note that service levels have improved (from my last stay) back to the great service that I had experienced during my first stay. Great service from the Baggage Service staff who offered to help us send our luggages to our room direct upon check in as we reached way early before check in time and had deposited our luggages there before going out. Staff were helpful as well when we checked out of the hotel the next day, he took the initiative to ask where we were heading…",40
Venetian is a huge hotel with all facilities starting from shopping to gandola ride it has got everything under one roof. The ambience of the hotel is amazing but is a bit crowded at times. The shopping centre inside the hotel is amazing with a variety of luxurious and international brands. The gandola ride is a must try inside the hotel itself. There are security guards to guide you inside the hotel dressed in yellow suites. The hotel is very spacious and the rooms are very big with a heart melting view of the city at night. The beds are very comfortable and the facilities provided is mind blowing. Dont try to take your suitcase on your own till the room because you will tired of the never ending carpets and will be difficult to carry it over the carpets. So hire a suitcase…,40
"The room is big, clean and comfortable for stayed 2 nights in Macau. My family stayed on bella suite room with 2 queen beds. Near to food court. Overall is good, but WI-FI must paid. Free shuttle bus  to airport, ferry terminal and Sands Hotel..",40
"My husband and I stayed here for two nights in April 2014. We used the free Venetian shuttle bus from the ferry terminal which was handy. There were heaps of people, tour groups etc where we were dropped off. It's easy to lose people here so best hold onto your partner/family.  Our room was very nice and very comfortable. It was split level with living area downstairs. The bathroom was probably my favourite part of the room, it was very elegant with a useful dressing table and magnifying mirror in there. However the way the shower head sprays water was kind of weird. It is adjustable but still didn't come out quite right. I also liked the handy light in the wardrobe. We had cool views of the Cotai strip which lit up at night time. We enjoyed our room service and the service…",50
Heard a lot of this hotel and hence I stayed in this hotel for two days from 26/5/14 to 28/5/2014. We were picked up by the venetian bus when we arrived by boat at macao. The staff available were rude and were not giving proper directions. We were dropped at the west lobby of the hotel. I was wiTh my family. There was a huge rush at this lobby of visitors. we had to push our bags through this huge crowds.Inside the building we were told to deposit our bags at the baggage counter. the lady at the reception was extremely helpful .We were informed by the travel agent to book our return journey by the cotai jet .NOw for this again we made a trip to the conceirge. stood in the line and then were told to get our passports for the booking. I was told there was enough time and i could…,40
"hehe...everything in the hotel is huge and elaborate in every detailing. The rooms are spacious, bathrooms are huge and the beds are nice and comfortable with some venetian decoration. The Casino in the hotel is amongst the best and biggest, attracts a lot of crowd but yet maintained and serviced very well. Once you are here you would loose all sense of time. The shopping gallery is also impressive with some of the best brands and merchandise.  Venetian on a whole is quite some experience, one need not go anywhere else if one stays here.",50
"Had a meeting here.  Was very good.  Food, entertainment, shopping, etc... Service was very good and the meetings rooms/food/service was also strong.   A massive, impressive place which is sure to impress your teams if you have an event here.",50
"This was my first time in a hotel like the venetian. (Atleast after I was old enough to visit the casino) The property is HUGE. At first when I entered, with so much rush I thought I had entered a fish market and was scared and wondered how could someone take care of so many people and still keep everyone happy. To my surprise they showed it to me very well. There are endless things to do and to see and to eat. Everything you wanna do you'll find here and you'll love it. I changed my dates of travel so that I could stay here and I'm so glad that I did. I am not mentioning anything specific because I would suggest that you just to there and discover for yourself. The rooms are in proportion to the hotel (i.e. HUGE) We LOVED the room. Btw, we also won in the casino. I din't try…",50
Very good experience. If u r staying at this hotel u need go anywhere else. Free Pick up and drop service from airport or ferry. Very good room with beautiful washroom. Good service with polite & helpful staff. Wide range of food choice with number of cuisine available at the hotel.,50
"We spent 2 nights here on their Spring package that included breakfast, one way Jetfoil transfer to Hong Kong, MOP100 shopping/food voucher. The rate was reasonable because it was mid-week. The hotel had made a mistake with our reservation that meant we had to spend close on 30 minutes checking in. They compensated us by providing a car to transport us to the ferry terminal; a free shuttle bus is available for all guests.  If you ever had doubts about how much is in gambling then staying here clears those doubts. Everything about the hotel is large, from the reception area, through to the casino, vast shopping arcades and concluding with the rooms. even the smallest rooms are larger than most of those is regular, non-casino based hotels; ours was 70m.  We had a huge bathroom,…",40
"When i walked through the alleys inside the Venetian, I couldnt help but imagine I was actually in Venice, minus the humidity, minus the blazing sunlight, and yes, minus the mosquitoes and minus that ""what is that smell"" feeling you ask when you are there in the summer hahahaha. I watched the making of the Venetian on the Natl Geographic channel so I was really amazed to see it in person. This is definitely a must see, and by the way transportation to/from the ferry and airport is free and very convenient.",50
"Second time staying here, it's an all suite hotel and the rooms are massive. You don't actually want to leave the room. I recommend the south wing as it's the most central to everything. This is a first class hotel. The complex itself is huge. There's a shopping centre, casino, great leisure facilities (4 pools) great food court and restaurants. It out shines all the other hotels and  casinos in Macau. There's a shuttle bus to everywhere from the Venetian. Wouldn't stay anywhere else",50
i visited this huge hotel in December. stayed  in a bella suit . big room big living room bigger neat and clean bathroom  a good experience world class casino . they should change there decades old color tv,40
"this time, I stayed in Rialto suit because I got 30%off deal from venetianmacao.com. When I arrived at a ferry terminal, the hotel already arrange a limo for us. Unfurunately parents decided to join me this trip in last minute, so I could not make a reservation for a limo. But hotel staffs changed a sedan to  a van for us, very nice . For check in, we have hotel represent lead us to our rooms. nice service",50
"One of the reasons why we want to come back to Macau is this hotel. It is an attraction in itself. Our room was a Bella suite, get this one if you have kids. Five or even six can sleep in this room. Our companions had a royal suite which was as grand as our room. The bathroom is very elegant as well. We had a nice view of the city of dreams right across. With hundreds of high end brands and shops, good restaurants, free performances, gondola rides. One day is not enough to go around. Loved this hotel. Even my kids loved it.",50
I stayed in Venetian for 3 days with my friends. We went to visit Hong Kong and Macao after completing our graduation. We had a great fun in Macao only because we stayed in Venetian. Venetian's Casino is very big. Rooms are also very big in size. Gondola ride and some magic shows were really good.,50
"This amazing hotel has a wide variety of amenities, including a world-class casino, many fabulous restaurants, and shopping malls for all tastes.  They also have two fantastic theaters/arenas.  We saw a Cirque de Soleil troupe performaing one of their amazing shows.   All in all, it's a world in itself.",50
"We were there to celebrate our anniversary. The resort people gifted us a chocolate in the shape of gondola as a anniversary gift.We had opted for a royal suit n the view out side the room was very nice, our room was on 32 floor. We found few vegetarian restaurants in the food court, but we found jain food n that was a surprise for us.. There r many things for children to do there like the Qube, pool area, gondola rides. Good shopping all good brands available there. They have the largest casino there in Venetian.. All over njoyed n had a Grt tym.. ",50
"Its pretty much old style charm !! With a royal suite for yourself you feel like a King and Queen !!! Must stay if you like the old world charm and not bothered to step out except for shopping and casino. The food is nice though the staff is little unfriendly. Check in comes with a lot of free coupons to use like the Gondola ride, Free ferry ticket back to hongkong , free breakfast or lunch etc etc. Very huge not recommended if you have small baby or old people travelling with you. Cafe Deco service is very very poor. Dont have breakfast over there.",50
Amazing Stay Value for Money Great Experience Love to come back again & again Stayed with family and friends Good swimming pool Great Kids zone Food court is good Comfort level was too good Keep it up,50
"Well this hotel is really huge ..it is almost a town..never forget to carry your maps (yes , YOUR MAPS) ..There are around 3-4 lobbies..a majestic food court..3-4 swimming pools..and hundreds of shops..and of course the signature Gondola Ride..which is just beautiful! The rooms are huge...i have never seen such a huge room and the bathrooms are also big....the hotel staff is really helpful ......Well a must-visit for everyone!!!  ",50
This place does blow you away in terms of scale. Where else would you see an indoor fake sky as you leave Victoria's Secret or any of the other numerous shops. The canal is impressive. Rooms are nice and large and good value. A great base camp to see shows also.,40
I can't get over how they built the mOck-ups in the Main Canal area to look like facades of shops inVenice. And the indoor lighted sky cloud ceiling that makes you feel it's still daytime even when it's already night. Awesome.....cool.....a place you won't forget. Watched Cirque du Soleil's performance of Zaia. Unbelievably amazing.....too awesome to forget. 😊,50
"We have been on the Venetian 3 person for 2 rooms and we spent 2 night. (19 April to 22 April).  Check in was ok but the personnel make some mess with my visa and I was some how concern about possible problems. A part this this more then hotel is a show room, inside is very nice great, all the channel and the shops are great including the small show on different places, is like to live in a day without end.  The food is nice from the food court to the restaurant, we have been to the Brazilian restaurant FOGOSAMBA and it was great  as well the manager a very nice lady ready to help in any way possible.  The over all price of every things is little higher then other places but ''hei'' this is a touristic place.  This is the second time we stay on Venetian Hotel and I have to say…",40
"I just came back from a conference in Macau. The hotel is beautifully decorated, the rooms are very nice, and the hotel itself has good size conference rooms, a very large casino, restaurants, bars, etc.. walking distance from Hard Rock Hotel. If you want to go to Macau and stay in a classy environment, outside the downtown area, then this is the place to be. The area is all new and walking around is an experience by itself.",50
"Venetian is one of the greatest - in terms of size - buildingsin the world. One of the older hotels (although relatively new under normal standards) in Macau, offers abundance in any dimension. Great rooms, views, halls, shops... you can find it all there. From some of the rooms, especially the ones in south wing, you can see continuously growing City of Dreams. Macau changes all the time, especially the new Macau, and Venetian was one of the first to start the change. Staff is friendly and helpful, but within certian recipes (or rules). Try to venture out of it, and you will be in trouble, at least until someone with greater experience will be called upon. This refers to things like late check out or ""custom"" restaurant orders or other, non-standard, requests. Staff does not…",40
"The magnificent hotel has left nothing undone. It is a beautiful place in itself to visit. The casino, the restaurants, the food court, the shopping arcade, the gondolas etc. The hotel from the check in to the check out it was an unforgettable experience. The suites and en-suite entertainment, the sheer grandness off this hotel gives it the winning edge. This property has left nothing behind. There is absolutely nothing you wont find here. The only thing is that its a bit heavy on the pocket but that is acceptable for such a majestic property.  The most amazing part being, its connected to the sheraton, holiday inn and the sands. You can hop the casino's and the shopping is amazing.",50
"The major advantage of Venetian is that it is the only hotel in the town with an Indian restaurant and that too of great quality and taste. All rooms are grand and are of suite categories. Check in was a long process but till then everyone was enjoying the grandness of hotel, a city in itself. Luggage system is well manged and is automatically received in our rooms( in contrast with other people reviews of problem of carrying luggage). The only problem was they didnt allocate us all rooms during check but promised to do so within 1 hour but then also after 4 hours we asked bluntly for allocation, only then they allocated us the rooms. Free transfers to most of the other hotels but need to hire taxi for some hotels but that was ok. Venetian itself is a city and everything was…",50
"We stayed at this awesome place in May 2014 for 2 nights and could not get enough of it. It was like lying in the lap of luxury. Everything was just fantastic. Right from the beginning when we checked in. We had booked royal suite for us (2A+2C) but on checking in were instantly and without any charge upgraded to Bella Suites (awesome room). Do check out the pics. The staff were so courteous. We did not have to cart our luggage only leave it at the entrance of the hotel and by the time we were done with the check in formalities and we reached our room, the luggage was there well stacked in its place. Everything about the place exuded luxury.   The hotel is a huge place and a must check out is the level 2 where they have created replica of Venice with the Gondola rides and a fake…",50
"We stayed at the Hotel for two days(April 22 & 23rd 2014) and the experience was one of the best i could imagine. The hotel is huge to say the least. There are plenty of visitors visiting the hotel because of its casino so the ground floor and the entrance is always crowded but as you move towards the check in counters it becomes better. Check in was smooth although slow. We hd to wait a good 20 minutes for our turn but nevertheless its worth the wait. We got room number 3 on the 13th floor and the rooms are just awesome.They are huge, very clean and has everything that modern luxury desires. The rest rooms are also big although i found the shower cabinet a bit small.They have 2 LCD television in the room. The complex is huge and we barely managed to scale the entire place. Our…",50
"We spent 3 nights at The Venetian,Macau and now I can highly recommend it. It was a great stay. Also the hotel also has a mall inside it. You cant just hate this hotel, its too good!! It had Casinos nearby and at the night the scenery of the buildings and rivers was the best. Our room had 2 king size beds. The place is massive in size and the crowd is always present inside the hotel no matter what time in the day it is. I specifically loved the mall inside it.",50
"My partner and I recently stayed at the Venetian for four nights, including two weekend nights.  Our initial impression was that it's difficult to get over the incredible size of the place.  Everything seems a bit over the top, which is what one comes to expect from a hotel/casino ""destination"" like the Venetian.  It was our first time in Macau, and chose the Venetian based on recommendations from co-workers that it is ""the"" place to stay.  We were neither disappointed nor entirely impressed.  First, the general positives.  The room (I believe ours was the smallest on offer at the hotel) was huge and comfortable.  Step-down living area with a couch, desk, coffee table and two chairs.  Two televisions, although one was a very dated non-flat screen due for replacement.  We were on…",40
Stayed in the hotel(?Mall) for two days. Roamed around shops. Went on a ride at Gondola. My child played at kids zone. Had fun at swimming pool. Purchased souvenir in the stalls. We also got 100 HK dollars as promotion gift. Good shuttle trips. Had good breakfast and dinner at pogosamba.,50
"We spent four nights at The Venetian in Macao and would highly recommend it.  Positives: - The rooms are huge and our package included free Wi-Fi, which was a real bonus.  - General scale of the place - it's massive, and we barely left the hotel during our stay. The pool complex is great and the rooftop mini golf is also worth a try, even in 90% humidity!  - Breakfast - the buffet at Cafe Deco is enormous.    - Efficiency - everything is clean and works, the transfers from ferry/airport were smooth etc  Negatives: - Casino minimums - gambling in Macau is EXPENSIVE! If you've been to Vegas, forget about $5/$10 tables. Most table minimums start at $500HKD (approx. £45) per hand.   - Baccarat, sic bo and slots dominate. I knew this before arriving, but there's very little else.…",40
"We stayed there for 5 days, but still dint manage to complete the whole of venetian !! It is that big! Amaazzzzinnnggg place 😍😍 . You get the feel of Venice , Italy. The gondola ride is mind blowing. If your crazy for brands , venetian is the place 👍 you dont have to go out of venetian to shop. LV, Prada , Chanel , MJ , MK are the local brands there! Different restaurants inside venetian . So you have variety to choose . In short , venetian is worth the cost👌",50
It is very good sample of fabolous architechure  the food is very good and the room is very good                                       the casino of the hotel is very big that i was not able to explore it even in 3 days   the 3 card poker game is very good             the interior of the hotel is awsome i had never seen the like that in my life ever the canal and the artificial sky and the food court is lively round the clock all in all a excellent hotel,50
"We thoroughly enjoyed everything about this hotel..We could not believe the size of the place.You can take a Gondola ride on the river running through the shops The rooms are very large and lavish.The Casino is absolutely huge. Went to the Walking on Water show.It was mind blowing,have never seen such a fantastic show in all my life.Worth going to Macau for just the show.",50
"One of the largest hotel, I have stayed in. This was my third stay and was as good as the first. First timers tend to get lost in the Hotel. You do have to walk a lot. Very good shops and a must is the Gondola ride. Not be missed.",50
"The last time we stayed at the Venetian was about 6 years ago, when the hotel was new. Now 6 years later, the rooms are showing their age, although they are still well maintained overall. Small bits of wallpaper are coming off, doors have scratches on them and the taps are tarnished. Still the rooms are breathtaking due to the sheer size and elaborate design.  The whole complex has everything you'll need under one roof and unless you want to check out other casinos, there won't be a need to leave it. It has shopping, dining, activities, theatre and of course, an extensive casino - for all budgets.",40
"This hotel is a city in itself.. sprawling over the magnificent city of macao.. the venetian offers its guests everything you can imagine. Magnificent royal suite leaves u bedazzled with its view. Ideal place for honeymoon couple.. Both romance sightseeing and shopping. However macau as a country only offers magnificent architectural wonders. Mind one important fact that macau patakas, the local currency is not accepted ib many of the neighbouring countries. So deal and accept onky hongkong dollars. Shop ur brands and make ur better half feel high headed...lol",50
"I would say no difference between the Las Vegas Venetian and this one. Great rooms, very spacious and clean. Also within great distance from any place in Macau. Amazing shopping areas. The Casino I can't tell because I don't gamble. Also no free drinks in the casino.",50
"It's a LARGE hotel - more a venue than a hotel. We'd taken the Royal Suite (take with 2 beds) and it is a beautiful room - exactly as is shown in the picture. There's lots to do - The Venetian is faithful to its counterpart in Vegas but this one just seems a lot larger. Good quiet room service, efficient directions, lots of shopping. The only thing missing is that it could have had far more activities, buskers, performances - it has the space. Also unlike the Vegas Venetian, the kids play area is payable and I did miss having the huge breakfast spreads that exist in all hotels in Vegas.  Unfortunately the 2 nights we stayed at the Venetian in Macau were rained out - a mini typhoon and so didn't really get around to walking about Macau and seeing the place....",50
"We only had one night at the Venetian and it was my first experience at a hotel complex of that magnitude.  It was impressive but once was probably enough for me.    We arrived on the shuttle bus from the airport and were dropped at a side entrance where we encountered our first problem; trying to navigate ourselves to the reception!!  Having missed a turning and we started to get rather lost, eventually we found a member of staff to help direct us back the right way.  Reception then thankfully provided us with a map but it did take a bit of a walk around to understand the hotel layout properly.    The room was lovely, very spacious with a good view out.  The shopping centre, built like a mini venice, was also very well done and great to see.  The pool was slightly…",40
"We stayed for one night at the Venetian recently and whilst our room was absolutely stunning - with a great view of the strip - one night was enough in Macau. Having visited the Venetian in Vegas, I knew what to expect but somehow the Macau complex had a very different feel compared to Vegas. The complex is very large and with the shops and the food court, feels more like a shopping mall than a hotel. We ate at the italian restaurant which was ok but pricey. Macau itself has lots of interesting parts away from the casinos and the opulence of the casinos and hotels gives an interesting contrast to the place. We visited the casino and the hotel night club where they had live music for the whole evening. Service was great and made for a very enjoyable evening - even if the club was…",40
"The room & bathroom is amazing huge, spacious, beautiful interior with all the appliances, facilities & clean. The Wi-Fi is strong and stable. The food available within the hotel is good and a lot of varieties of choice to choose. The entertainment for both children and adult are a lot. It feels like is hotel never sleeps and operates 24/7. The staff and security are friendly, helpful and nice. It is really magical and enchanted hotel stay. It makes a person feels like they are in another country or place. Not in Macau anymore once a person enters the hotel. The only bad thing is a lot of China people there are ill mannered and rude to others.",50
"The hotel and room were excellent, the room the casino hotel grounds and pool all excellent,  Unfortunately my trip was ruined by guests in the opposite room smoking on our non smoking floor which made our 4 year old cough with his asthma all night, they kept slamming doors shut and having a party, i went out in the hall way to find prostitutes and other hotel guests openly smoking in the hall way, downstairs the casino was full of prostitutes, i got approached 4 times by them  Now the hotel is not to blame for this, they sent security up at least 3 times and when i checked out Sherian one of the hotels managers came to see me off and really apologised and was very understanding even offered to upgrade me next time i visit,  I will be visiting again and do recommend it to…",50
The hotels is huge and magnificent.... One can loose the sense of direction in the hotels casino and also in the shopping area. The suites are luxurious in its true sense... The food served specially the indian food is superb. A must stay if you visit Macau.. ,50
"If you have been to Las Vegas and stayed at the Venetian, I would maybe not recommend staying here. It is similar, but I just found the atmosphere very different. The Hotel itself is gorgeous, as are the rooms - again we had an awful view so a nice view may have made all the difference. Bathroom us amazing. The Hotel is huge, quite daunting and easy to get lost. As someone from the UK I did find this hotel didnt cater very much to the UK/USA market with only 1 food place (Fat Burger) I'm quite glad I only stayed for 1 night as more than that would have been too much. There was not a lot in the resort outside only around 6 other hotels in the area. I only visited Macau as was told it was Asia's Las Vegas, unfortunately it just didnt do it for me. I would recommend the hotel if…",40
"stay here for a night was most memorable . felt like staying in a palace.even though our tour was booked by touragent ,  they gave us extra gud offer too . 3rd level is worth watching ..loved the way its designed . as we are not casino lovers... we had nothing much at macau. but have to be in macau to just stay at venetian  lovey stay worth going to macau.",50
"well Macau visit is incomplete without experiencing this Grand Hotel. The Venetian is an Edifice which adds to the beauty of Macau skyline. my jaw dropped the moment I saw this imposing structure. we stayed at the Royal suite for two nights on the 13th and 14 april. and truly as the name suggests it was a royal experience. Be it the check-in, Check-out, the temperature  regulated pool, gym, kids zone, the food(at golden peacock) the service, Everything was par excellence. Despite having thousands of guests to cater to they make each one feel special. There were a couple of guys from Philipines ( Sonny and another guy at the golden Peacock) who really went out of their way to make us feel at home. The down side is of course one can get lost in this maze  and all ameneties are…",50
"Fabulous. Check in a little daunting but hotel made up for it. Breakfast was the best I have ever had. Loads to do even if you don't fancy the casino. We stayed in the Bella Suite and I would highly recommend it for families, loads of room and 2 televisions.",50
"Looking for the best hotel,surely this is the one. I had visited most of the hotels in macao,all look good, But in terms of service and beauty it is the best,better than galaxy. The most luxurious hotel in macao.",50
"I have been travel twice to Macao, it was feeling great to stay in Venetian Macao. Where you may found everything is under one roof. The rooms are so beautiful decorated with all the amenities. And the Gandola ride was so awesome.  I will suggest all my freinds to visit once to see the nice place.",50
"Stayed here before the Labor Day till lots of people. Room is fine. There are huge shopping malls with lots of shops from the SaSa, Sweet Way to Gucci, Chanel and LV, all shops u can imagine, a good place for shopping, I really loved it. The casino in the grand floor is said to be the biggest in Asian, I m not a fun of gambling, so just walk around before checking out. It is a massive casino with massive gamblers.  There were always concerts holding in Cotai Strip CotaiArena in Venetian, besides those Taiwan or Hongkong singers, Rihanna, Justin Bieber and Beyoncé ect. were invited to performed here too.  I m a big fun if Riri. And lucky enough to watched her show on last Sep. :) I hardly spent much time in the room, just for rest only. So didn't find any thing special abt it. …",40
"We were lucky to be chosen for the Key Express Check-in, saved us more than 45 mins at Check-in, considering the endless queues. The Bella Suite was so spacious and nicely done -up with Victorian decor, two twin beds and a single bed at an offset level with a huge glass window looking over the city. The view from the 34th floor was awesome! Dinner at their Michelin starred Golden Peacock Restaurant serving Indian food was the high point of the stay. Meeting David Beckham in the restaurant, having Dinner was absolutely unbelievable and unforgettable. The Gondola ride in the canals and the shopping were very memorable. Kids have so many things to do. A single night stay is just not enough to do many things you want to, but our itinerary was a bit hectic. You should be prepared to…",50
it is awe inspiring hotel. massive and beautiful. the rooms are big with huge bathroom.the casino is amazing. the hotel has a mall attached to it. though it is a bit far from the main city but there are free coaches to and from the hotel. there a lovely restaurants n gondola ride there is a play area too.It was a lovely luxurious experience,40
Venetian macao is a grand property with over 3000 rooms.the moment you enter the hotel you will feel  like entering a palace.the check in is smooth as compare to check out as you have to wait for your turn at check out time. The hotel is so big that you need more than two days to explore the hole property.the pool area is very nice with heated pool the food in the breakfast is also good with lots of Indian as well as Western options.the house keeping staff is wonderful.  one of the negative point is the concierge staff dont speak proper English and they by mistake board us on the wrong shuttle and we almost missed our flight this is only reason for 4 star otherwise I will definitely give it a five star. ,40
"An amazing hotel,got a class of its own it just looks fabulous the rooms are spacious  The Royal Cotai suite package is just amazing.The hotel with its mall and casino is really huge but make sure you stay atleast 2 nights to see this place.Make a booking thru the hotel website or else you need to pay for the internet in your room.The Buffet Breakfast or Lunch they offer along is worth the deal along with free Ferry tickets to HKG or a Gondola ride.The room service team is fast and quick , not over priced at all if you compare it to other hotels.Transport to the hotel and from the hotel to various areas in Macau if totally free and you get to view the city that way.Hop across to the Galaxy Hotel.You could use the walk bridge and explore another big mall. The issue i had faced…",50

"The only bad part about staying in the Venetian was our duration, which was only one night.  After more than 6 hours on flight, subway, and ferry from Jakarta-Hong Kong-Macao, arriving at The Venetian was like arriving at an oasis after long walking on the desert. We were there on 31st March 2014, and it was rainy and cold, with all the thick fog covered the top of the Venetian. Entering The Venetian for the first time was such an overwhelming experience. What's going inside the resort was very different with the cold and unfriendly weather outside. It was so warm, fun, lively, and people were so excited inside.   The room was huge with very comfy beds and pillows. Although we stayed at a smoking room, we could barely smell the aroma of cigarettes from the previous guests. The…",50
"This enchanting hotel screams elegance and sophistication in its lavishness, for sure.  The rooms are spacious, beautifully furnished with all kinds of amenities at your beck and call, as well as a team of courteous and efficient staff on sergice.  The casino is huge and bustling with guests as well -so there is entertainment provided on top of the many boutiques and restaurants to keep the guests plenty entertained.  The best part is the bridge, streetlamps and indoor canal providing a European-feel for this gorgeous place - one tends to feel lost in time here. There is one part that has a blue-ceiling painted with white clouds, so it feels like a beautiful sunny day all the time, regardless of whatever hour or however late it may be.  From the exterior, this hotel looks just…",40
"No words can explain the Venetian Macao Resort Hotel experience - you must experience it for yourself. They have it all - great shops, restaurants and entertainment - you may even see a celebrity or two - there is something for everyone to enjoy - just go!",50

"We lived in Venetian Macau for 3 nights. The rooms are very good. The property seemed little old but venetian has that vintage look. The place is not cheap but if you are going in group of 3/4 then they give very good package called spring package with free breakfast, wifi and one way ferry from Macau to HK. There is an Indian restaurant called Golden Peacock. It serves OUTSTANDING food. The taste which will challenge some of the authentic North Indian restaurants in India as well.   There is one good thing about this package is either you can have breakfast of lunch, so even if you miss breakfast timing due to late night adventures you can still have lunch till 3 PM.   While going to Venetian, take the ferry to Taipa ferry terminal and not to Macau ferry terminal. There are 2…",40
"Services in all sectors were exemplary and worth emulating There was long ques for check in but considering our advance age Hotel offered Key Express option as a result we could check in instantly.Without our request, we were allowed extended check out upto 2 PM ALL services were almost instant and exceeding our expectations. Movies in TV were on chargeable basis but we found that they were shown as complimentary in our bill.Staffs  were very courteous and professional. Busses to and from Ferry were luxurious and no waiting involved. Eating at GOLDEN PEACOCK Restaurant in Venetian will be lifetime experience for Vegetarians.  Location is perfect. All rooms are suits of approx.800 Sqft.",50
"This place is not cheap but I feel it's worth the money if you are going to Macau for a family trip, or for a weekend blast with friends etc. The rooms are HUGE, there are loads of restaurants (incl. Golden Peacock that I reviewed quite favourably and a very large and cheap food court). Just in terms of room, we reserved via the hotel and we got free wifi and free breakfast OR lunch (first time I saw that option in a hotel). The lift to the rooms opens right down near the Grand Canal Shoppes/Food Court. I would say the rooms may be a bit too big if it's just two of you traveling.  Another reviewer mentioned that the place is flooded with Chinese mainlanders. I would like to mention that is the case with all of Macau, and it's the bigshot gamblers from Mainland China who make…",40
We were lucky that we had tour guides around macau for we only have a day to visit .   It was like a dream visiting this Hotel. The interiors were grand! Everything feels luxury. Love it!  We look forward to staying here on our next visit,50
"I have been staying in the Venetian Macao hotel the sixth times. This visit was attracted by their Promotion Package. The Package included free Breakfast or Lunch and return Ferry ticket to HK. It comes with 2 persons. So make the room price falls below HK$1700 within Easter Holiday period. The room as usual was a suite with 750sq ft, with sitting area, in room free wifi, huge bathroom with shower cubical. Room was well maintained. Casino was full of people in the morning & afternoon. But comfortable in the evening for gambling. Receptionist & Concierge Desk Ms. Kiki was helpful. one of the good place to stay in Macao",40
"the venetian macao resort hotel is absolutely gorgeous.  the overall appearance of the lobby, the rooms and the overall service was superb.  the rooms were superb with good lighting and fabulous toiletries.  the hotel has a huge selection of name brand shops and restaurants.  it also boasts a huge casino in the basement. I loved it and would go back again.  Overall a very impressive hotel.  I would recommend to everyone wanting to go and stay there.",50
What I love about this place is it's concept. I just had my meals here and walked around the area. Walking around the place feels like walking under the sky. The public restrooms were a bit dirty though.,40
"I'm not sure if I visited during the holiday season for them but when I arrived at the hotel, I could've sworn the whole place was filled with Chinese tourists. Yes, the hotel itself was amazing but with the crowd, I just wasn't able to appreciate it all.  The queue for check-in was horrendous, we had to wait more than an hour to get our room. I'm not sure what the hold up was but all they did was offer everyone in line a bottle of water to appease us.   When we finally got into our room, I have to say it was extravagant. The most basic room was the size of a suite and the furnishing was just gorgeous. Even the decoration in the toilet was amazing. The design of the room was just as splendid as the rest of the hotel.  The Venetian itself is a tourist attraction. Lots of shopping…",40

Its a huge hotel so be prepared to walk. and walk and walk is what you will do to get to the restaurant and to the buses. however, there are a lot of things to see and experience.  Do not, I repeat, do not book this hotel for only a one night stay, you will get disappointed, to fully experience the venetian, you have to stay at least three nights.

I will not re-write the amazing experiences which is already been written by others. I just want to underline a few negatives that i found during my second stay first is bathroom amenities, its very standard which you can find the same in 3 star hotel. The second is the breakfast that we have in cafe deco, the breakfast menu is same for 2 days, only a few item changes and taste poor and totally not 5 star breakfast.

"Our stay at the venetian has been a memorable experience be it the rooms, resort itself, food, casino. The resort itself is a place to go around and enjoy. The casino is large. They have restaurants and food courts offering different cuisines.   The only negative I see is the crowd, especially during weekend. People not staying in the resort also visit to see the place and for the casino. Hence there is crowd everywhere near the lobby, for the buses, for the taxis.   Venetian should offer separate transport for its guests that are staying in the hotel.",40

It has a very good shopping mall, casino inside the hotel. The room was very clean and big with massive bathrooms. It has adjoining sofa area with very nice view. We stayed in the Royal Suite. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay for 2 nights. The main advantage is the Indian restaurant Golden Peacock which is inside this hotel. The food was very yummy and had a good variety of options in veg.Will love to come again and highly recommended.",50

It turned out to be a steal. We were upgraded to a Bella suite which was so huge and the Bathroom was just massive. Be prepared to walk , walk and walk. And sometimes directions are very confusing. Our son had a great time there . They had a Parade of animated Characters every evening and it was brilliant. The kids play area ""CUBE"" is equally nice.

I'm not gonna repeat what most of the reviews here have said about Venetian, so I'm just gonna share you my little story.  I checked into Venetian for one night in Macau with my elderly parents after spending the last few days in Hong Kong. Unfortunately, my mom had a fall and sprain her hand at the ferry terminal. Upon arriving in our room, I've called the reception for some ice but seeing her hand have gotten worst, I've then decided to ask for a nearby clinic to have mom checked. The direction given was clear and they even called the clinic prior to our arrival so by the time we got there, the attending nurse was already aware that…",50

"I have been here a couple of times, still it remains one of my favorites. Why? simply because it has everything within walking distance. The rooms are very spacious. Not to mentioned that it is probably one of the Hotels in Macau in which a ""non-smoking"" floor really means a ""non-smoking floor"". No smell of cigarettes in the room at all. A variety of restaurant are available(from food court to high end restaurant). Walking distance to all the shopping places. So probably the place to be in MACAU",40
"The hotel is simply amazing. I was travelling with family (5 adults an 1 child) for 2 nights. We did not feel the need to go out of the hotel. This should say enough. Everything was awesome (staff, rooms, service, facilities etc).  The gondola ride is a bit overhyped in my view. On a lighter note: the only issue was the amount of walking one has to do in the hotel.",50
Spent a night here during a Hong Kong stay and it's well worth while. Keep away from weekends when it's manic but during the week you can get good rates with Venetian. Com which offer a free breakfast or buffet lunch plus one way ferry back to Hong Kong which is valued at £14 pp ( buffet lunch normally £18 pp plus a night in a huge suite for approx £160 inc taxes. Sadly the majority of the gaming tables are in a smoking area as the Chinese are heavy smokers but as long as you don't sit immediately next to a chain smoker the ventilation is very good. To see and do everything you need to have more than one night and it involves a LOT of walking so take comfy shoes!,40
"This hotel is such an architectural marvel! The Main lobby is most breathtaking with its amazing replicas from the actual Venice on its ceiling. The hotel is so charming we love to visit it again and again. Shopping at the canals is such a sweet pleasure. It can easily turn into an out-of-control, paranoia.  Having a cup of coffee in the main plaza listening to the gondola man sing can be a most pleasurable experience. The plaza stirs in me a feeling of utmost peace and tranquility with the world. Every person on this planet, fighting and struggling from within, is doing a remarkable job surviving in this world if you ask me. We are all nothing short of a miracle today. We are all so able, even we cannot fathom our own powers! It's people running and managing the show who are…",50
"We booked our stay at the Venetian Resort in Macao very well knowing that it was going to be a huge hotel with massive numbers of guests and possibly impersonalised service. However, we had decided to stay at this iconic hotel/chain to get an authentic Macau experience.   I am pleased to say that we all really enjoyed our stay in this grand, luxurious hotel. I had pre-ordered a birthday cake for my sister which they brought to us in our suite on time upon checking in and she was very well surprised!   Our suites were large and well appointed with a touch of real luxury - large bathtub with gold-laqured taps, big, flowing curtains and a four poster bed. It all felt quite royal, though when one went downstairs to breakfast or at the casino or stood in the lobby, one quickly…",40
"Just come back from a family holiday, and i once again stay in Venetian Hotel. From my experience stay here twice before, i know that Venetian hotel is a great choice. Its my parents and my sister first time stay here, they got amazed. As for me and my brother, we already know it because we have stayed here before. The room is still great and spacious make my parents feel really comfortable. At this time, the check in and check out more smooth, maybe because less people travel here or maybe because not the holiday season. Only takes 5-10mnts for check in and check out. My parents really enjoy their time to walk around the mall and at night my dad also try some his lucks at the casino.",50
Overall pleasant stay. Spacious well appointed suites (bit dated now). Service ... Specially room service needs to go up a notch to make it super. Good choice of eating places. The casino at city of dreams slightly better though. Would definitely go back to stay.,40
"amazing experience, visiting Venetian should be on your bucket list. beautiful room, amazing shows and the best part was the gandola ride. casino is huge and has no comparison. a great experience of being to Las Vegas at the shortest time and cheapest way",50
"We were bowled over by the English furnishing in our enormous Bella Suite! The staff at the check-in counter was efficient and friendly as she tried to engage in small talk with me during the transaction. The concierge was helpful by providing us the direction to Taipa Village (short walk from The Venetian) and the free shuttle bus services to Senado Square.  The downside will be the slightly long walk from the lobby to our room which we had to cut through the casino. By the way, I was told that there is no free Wifi as the booking of our lodging was done via a third party agency instead of directly from their website. And we have to pay more if to request for a Cotai strip view.   Overall, the Venetian is a luxury hotel with many prestige brands and the experience was good!",50
"I should have good walking shoes and a map in hand to navigate through the hotel. Its enormous and is beautiful. One can't stop looking at the ornate ceilings and marveling at its beauty. It has replicated Venice and its canals with gondola rides, which is also an architectural wonder, because its all done at Level3 of the hotel. Its an all-suite hotel, so the sleeping quarters are as enormous as the public places. We were given breakfast voucher and a choice to pick a restaurant from 4-5 outlets. The shoppes are extensive too. Busloads of tourists come daily on day trips to visit this resort which also has the largest casino in the world. With 3000 suites,its advisable to carry your own luggage for checking out, as waiting for a bellboy would take eternity.",40
"I had planned a birthday getaway (for my fiance and I) and Venetian offered the best deal possible - we had Macau ferry tickets, Royal Suite, Breakfast/Lunch for two, and BBQ dinner for two and received a late check out. This trip completely value for money the rooms of Venetian are the epitome of space. The pool side facilities are amazing, especially the Cabanas, it does offer luxury and choice of pools to swim in. The hotel itself attracts a lot of people which is fun to have character but it can be overwhelming at times. But there is something for everyone to try and enjoy.",50
"So I've seen this hotel in Las Vegas, and the one in Macau comes a close second.  The rooms are spacicious, beds a little to tight a fit and soft.  A little provincial for my taste, but nonetheless a good size.  The package/deal offered was good, but cost of the high side for these rooms.",40
"The all suite hotel is a great place to stay in Macau. The property offers excellent rooms and great service. I was provided a complimentary cake for my anniversary. Plenty to do in the hotel, It houses one of the biggest casino floors, some great food options, special mention to Golden Peacock. The Gondola ride is a must do when staying/visiting Venetian Macau.",50
"I stayed with my family for 2 days in Venetian Macao on occasion of my birthday. The resort was wonderful, kids enjoyed in the pools and the Qube, casino experience was good. the breakfast was lavish in  Cafe Deco and they provided complimentary wifi also. Kelly Lao, supervisor Guest Relations made my day by providing a complimentary Birthday cake. Special thanks to her.",50
"This place is basically a small city in and of itself. Pretty much anything you want (food, shopping, entertainment, a boat ride (!!), etc.) can be found inside. If there's a downside to the Venetian, it's that it's kind of separated from the historic part of Macau (Cotai was only recently dredged up, after all), though it isn't difficult to find a taxi or bus that will get you where you want to be. Also, it's often jam-packed full of... rather rowdy guests. This didn't bother us much when we stayed, but you might not find it to your liking if you're looking for a quiet getaway of sorts.",50
"As soon as we reached macau ferry terminal ,we saw lot of people from venetian hotel .  They guide us to their shuttle service.  We reached to the south lobby n there is no waiting. We check in with in 10 minutes with all the details of our breakfast n lunch too. They also give a room upgrade without any hazel n too much convincing.  We also got good view room ( we can se the galaxy hotel n harbour as well). No problem of smoke as I read in other reviews.  Hotel is huge n lovely.  I love my stay. The only problem I faced in hotel is that whenever we hav to go to hotel main lobby, we have to go through level 3 n that is because of my son who is only 8 yrs. Main lobby is near casino.  Everything else was perfect.  ",50
"I had often heard of Venetian Macau as a grand destination for casino lovers and a must do as part of places to visit in Macau. Come March, we had a sales conference set here and I was quite excited to see the property.  Venetian is as grand as its reputation, with a huge building with 100's of rooms and hosts Asia's biggest casino.   Due to size, the suites are divided into zones like west side or south side. Rooms are spacious and royal, and the view is quite good too.  There are multiple dining options from different cuisine styles, along with a generic food court that serves the general population who come to site see or gamble or shop. The shopping arcade is in general very expensive, but hosts good brands. Room service is horrendously expensive. Exchange rate at casinos is…",40
My partner and I are currently living in Hong Kong and decided we would llike a romantic wekeend away in Macau with a bit of casino fun mixed in.  I decided on the The Venetian as I had previously visited the shops there and thought it would be fun to stay in the hotel. We were not disappointed! The hotel was everything we expected it to be and better - the room was huge and the view out to the Cotai strip was very cool (especially at night). The bathroom is very glamourous. The only fault would be that the shower head was a bit old and the force of the water not great. Other than that I wouldn't change anything else.  Check in was very quick and efficient and on the last day when we checked out we left our luggage with the hotel so that we could do a few tourist things. Despite…,40
"Loved staying in that place, and would not hesitate in staying again. Not good if you prefer quiet places as it is quite busy, but the atmosphere , the facilities are just amazing. the rooms are lovely  decorated and offers anything you need!!!! I LOVED LOVED this place and hope to get back one day!",40
"Grand hotel with beautiful eye-catching interiors. You can easily spend a whole day exploring the place, but still miss out on some spots. Was there at the hotel to attend a conference, the conference and breakaway rooms were excellent. The casino provided a great option to breakaway from the routines. The food court had fantastic options of different cuisines. The rooms or suites itself was fantastic. Overall a great stay.",40
"Stayed there in March, eye-catching structures around the check in area. not much queue, agent was very pleasant, giving complimentary upgrade to a city view (over-seeing Galaxy Hotel). Everywhere was people walking here and there, crowded place I would say. And the thing I hate the most, is the security standing at every exit of the casino entrance, I may look young but checking identity every now and then when i enter the casino. Simply pissed my day off.  Maybe they should come up with something like a tag or whatsoever, so they dont have to check my identity even when I just want to go thru and back to my room. Overall, room is awesome, cosy & I'll recommended to go back for the hotel!",40
This hotel is every bit as lovely and comfortable as it is in Las Vegas.  The only thing that we found significantly different was the service.  We travelled to Macau from Hong Kong and the hotel has a coach from the ferry terminal.  The check in lines were not as long as Vegas but the lady at the counter did not do a very good job explaining that they needed to secure a deposit for the value of our stay plus additional amounts in case we used other services.  We understood it as a charge to the card and any unused amount would be refunded to the card within two to three weeks which we found quite outrageous.  Her colleague then stepped in to explain that it was not a charge but only a block for the additional amount.  The entire hotel including the suites are as massive and…,40
I stayed in Venetian Hotel with my family for 3d2n in March 2014. Reception was friendly and efficient and i had my room earlier than expected. This is my third stay in venetian and i am still as impressed with the room and facilities as usual. Only thing that i feel that improvement can be made is the pillows.. The pillows are too soft and flat probably due to the long usage... Hope this could be improved over times.  Location around Venetian is just great.. walking distance to Taipa and transport around the other areas through the free shuttle bus was great..,40
"The Venetian is a very large and amazing hotel. It is so large that I went lost when trying to look for my room. All the rooms are very large and spacious. The breakfast here was also amazing as they literally had everything. Also, there are many lobbies and lift lobbies at the hotel, making us confused. While you are staying here, you should try the Gondola-ride as it is a must!  Stayed Here at March 2010",50
"Stayed at the Venetian in March'2014. Absolutely enormous hotel with hundreds of shops, thousands of suites and the largest casino floor in the world. Was surprised to see how seriously the Chinese take their gambling, they aren't here to have fun - they mean business. Very different feel than Vegas. The hotel complex was so large that we didn't even venture out. Positives: Easy to get around, Great food options & helpful staff. Negatives: Filled with cigarette smoke.",40
"i was staying in this property for the second time and every time it makes me want more of it. last i stayed was 5 years before and after so many years the quality of service is still amazing. the rooms are luxurious and clean. The hotel is nicely maintained and food quality is really good. if you are looking for a family gateway, this is the place to be.",50
"Been to Macau twice, stayed here both of my trips.  Love this place, the deco of the rooms, the grand feeling...must go there at least once with your love ones.. Enjoy a swim at the pool, have a cup of Starbucks if you are not in to casino..   Will defiantly go back there again...=)",50
"This is a property which I have loved to stay ... Amazing, grand, uncomparable hospitality and services, food ..... Next to Ultimate ... Everything was just fantastic : Housekeeping, staff, courtesy, services ... Name it and have the one of the best in the world... Grand enough to get lost in the property .....  I have stayed there for three nights...",40
"As many other users have already mentioned: the Venetian is HUGE. So if you have an aversion to such large places, then this is not the place for you.   On the other hand, given lack of choice for smaller boutique hotel choices in Macau, the Venetian is not a bad choice. Also, for those coming in from Hong Kong for a concert/show/sporting exhibition, the Venetian is a very convenient and comfortable place for an overnight in case you don't want to rush for the ferry back to HK.   Given the size of the complex, all the rooms are amply sized, as all rooms are suites: bedroom + living room + large bath (which includes shower, tub, 2 sinks, and vanity table).   Check-in service is far improved from when the hotel opened several years ago. The staff are very welcoming and…",40
"Staying in  a hotel like Venetian is an experience in itself. We stayed there for two night,and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.The hotel is very big,and you need two days to see the hotel  itself,you can download the Hotel Venetian app from the hotel website which will give you the directions to move around freely without getting confused in the hotel.There is another app which tells you the details of the shows currently running in the hotel. The restaurants and foodcourt is very good, We dined at an Indian restaurant, the Golden Peacock, which has a great ambience,the service was good and the food was delicious. The size of the  room and the bathroom are very big, the interior is awesome and luxurious.The shops by the canal on level three and the gondola ride gives you a feeling…",50
"Since this was my first trip to Macao, I decided to play it safe and go for what most people would say as a balance between price, comfort, and convenience. Well, the Venetian Resort in Macao fits this bill pretty well (albeit the price is a bit on the high side, but hey, it’s only a weekend).   While I’ve never been to the Macao Venetian before this trip, the one in Vegas gave me a good idea what to expect. Yep, the same glamorous interior and big-enough-to-not-find-your-way building – that’s definitely what the two resort share in common.   The rooms were big and spacey – especially the bathroom. The toilet was even located in its own separate chamber! The bathtub and shower areas were apart as well (the bathroom was big enough for such arrangement).   I believe a lot of…",40
You dont have to go to Las Vegas for an experience in Venetian hotel....as it is almost duplicate of the one in Las vegas....everything was very good....buffet was great with so much choices that even if you stayed for four nights the choices were good....service likewise wonderful...free wifi anywhere....shops within are reasonable price that you do not have to go out...shuttles buses towards major area available after a line which did not take too long to cue...even the taxi stands... Gondola ride was great....i specially like the wide range of food choices in the food court and prices very reasonable....even the expensive cuisine restaurants were great...its my second stay there and I would not mind going back again...highly recommended even if newer hotels were put up…,50
"Hiccups at the start - check in line was long and the process very slow....took us over 45 minutes to reach the counter. But that's the only negative we had. We had booked a suite and it was absolutely stunning. The bathroom was extremely luxurious - spacious, bath tub for two, his and her basins and a big mirror at the dressing table. The Gondola ride was absolutely fantastic, with the antics of our gondolier. As part of their Christmas/New Yr celebrations, there was a special attraction 'Ice World at Cotai strip' where huge ice sculptures of Dreamworks movies (Shrek, Madagascar, Kung Fu panda etc) were displayed. The hotel has huge lobbies and walkways. The casino is full, no matter what time it is. Free shuttle buses to and from the jetty terminal, like all other hotels and…",40
If you like things big this is the place for you. Everything is big. The rooms of the resort are big and fantastic. The shopping and canals on level three are massive and have every expensive shop under the sun. The casino is large and smokey. I was there for a conference and didn't see the outside for three days. All in all a Chinese carbon copy of the same in Vegas,40
"The Venetian in Macau is by far one of the best hotels I have witnessed in India and overseas. The size, the shops and the entire Venice like atmosphere is just mind-blowing. It is also now one of the most popular hotels in Macau and more of a landmark of sorts. The rooms are palatial and the bathroom alone could be considered the size of a usual hotel room. It is luxury all the way with a very Europen feel to it. The only downside is that it does not give you a very personalized getaway sort of feeling due to the insane crowds in the lobby area and the casinos which are mostly jam packed in the ground foor.",40
"Venetian Macau was the best experience i've ever had in my life...there are four casinos in the resort and was so good to see people who are playing different games.! Also there are two wings in the hotel...North building and south building...the resort is so large and you have to explore it with map with you...without map you will be lost in resort.! Also they have best amenities ever i enjoyed.!! Shopping area on 3rd floor of the hotel was the best part ever.! Plus that gondola ride and the feel of Venice was the superb feeling ever i had.! Love this place and wanna go there again if i get chance.! Do play in casino for the people who is going to visit in casino for the first time...its different feeling you ever had,.!",50
"I stayed at this hotel for the second time.The suites are quite big and spacious.The Food at Cafe Deco and Golden peacock is great.Gandola ride was fascinating and so was the Grand Canyon.The Staff was too helpful and the Casino was enthralling,probably the largest and biggest in the world.Food was good at Napels meeting room and Fogo Samba too. I would certainly recommend this Hotel.",40
"My friends and I visited macau for holiday. We choose to stay in The Venetian Resort. This is one of the best hotel in Macau.  We started our journey from Hongkong. Since we arrived in HK very early in the morning we decided to transfer to Macau from Macau Ferry Terminal (In Sheung Wan MTR Station). It Takes an hour from HK to Macau.  After arrived in Macau, we can directly go to this resort by Shuttle provided by the hotel. The hotel was very huge. There were huge casino, grand canal shopping mall, foodcourt, cafe, cinema and etc.   There are many types of suites offered by the hotel. We choose bella suites for our stay there. The suites complete with 2 queen bed, 1 living room and 1 huge bathroom. The facility offered by the hotel also complete. There are swimming pool with…",50
"I am travelling with a friend, and most activities located within the Macau City, Hotel is not really suitable if you are traveling with friends (boys)  It is perfect for family destination as it has one stop solution for shopping, spas, casinos and theme park for children.  The Free shuttle bus is non-stop taking you anywhere too. taxis are always available.  This is a very good all suites hotel.",50
"The building is located in Taipa island, southern part of old city Macau. It was famous with its huge area for casino, and Cotai Arena (usually for music concert, sports, and other entertainment shows). Although it was well maintained, the shopping area lacked of direction maps. Very difficult to knew what was where, and easy to get confuse between shops and stairs. However, directions to exit, rest rooms, emergency doors, and taxi stand were easy to see.  Inside the building, on 2nd or 3rd floor I forgot, you could ride gondola. The gondola is a traditional, flat-bottomed Venetian rowing boat, well suited to the conditions of the Venetian lagoon. No, they didn’t cruise on rivers or lagoons. They were indoors, with ceilings painted with the colour of the sky. And also bright…",50

"We spent two nights in one of the cotai view suites on the 34th floor. Having recently stayed at the same hotel in Las Vegas we couldn't help but make comparisons and I can honestly say this hotel is superior to the one in Vegas.  Check in was exceptional given the amount of guests who stay we arrived via CotaiJet and took the free hotel shuttle (which even included free wifi), this was quicker than waiting for a taxi. Within 15 minutes we were at the hotel, luggage porters were very helpful and took charge of our luggage and check in was a dream with all prior requests honoured (non smoking high floor). Tip: the venetian staff are excellent at replying to emails quickly and accurately, much easier than phoning before arrival to make requests.  Our room was stunning, exactly the…",50
"The place is massive! I guess most hotels in Macau are probably this size considering Macau is the Eastern Las Vegas equivalent. The place is lovely, however everything in the Venetian is EXPENSIVE. If you like shopping and spending money then great, this is the place for you.  The room was rather lovely, however a bit annoyed by the stench in the bathroom and it was really warm and rather quite gross. Stench is probably from poor drainage/sewer system over the hundreds of rooms available across all the floors. Room service is very expensive and also we made the mistake of using the phone to dial internationally which cost us £50 for an hour phone call - oops.",50
"I had the chance to visit Macau last December and decided to try the Venetian although I have been in the place many times since 2010 but it was the first time for me to book a room. I was fascinated by the room we booked (Royal Suite) because of its elegance and it was spacious (more or less 70+ m2).  It has it's own living room, 2 tv sets, king-size bed (very comfortable), mini-bar (items are not free unlike other hotels)and spacious bathroom. One thing I think they need to improve providing free wifi to hotel guests which I think is necessary.If you are the type who just like to stay in the room I really recommend this hotel. It was a rainy day when we visited Macau so we just stay in our room (no regrets). The hotel lobby is as always very beautiful and I always make it a…",50
"My husband and I loved this Resort Hotel (Casino) . This place is huge. Even to reception is a fair walk to check in. There was a great selection of restaurants. Great Irish Bar to get a drink & meet people. The room we stayed in was like a suite. It had a large Bedroom & Bathroom with separate toilet, as well as a sunken lounge. This casino has an 18 hole putting golf course on one of the floors as well as a Venice inspired canal with gondolas. Lots of shops which were mostly highend which was a little disappointing. I would definitely stay here again.",50
The hotel was very grand and spacious. Quality & services were very good. The shopping mall is very big & convenient. The place where they need to improve is sometimes the time between Shuttles. Rest everything is perfect,50
"The size of the hotel is superlative. Got my room upgraded to a larger one but that was not really needed as all the rooms are large.  The key reason for the trip was the casino. There are enough positions in available to enjoy various games.  The issue with such large properties is that walking is a bit of a pain. The food court is to be avoided at all costs.  Stick to the restaurants. The Brazilian one was one of the better choices.   Shopping is largely the named brands. Prices are similar to high street prices.  Did take tour packages from the concierge desk which was conducted well.  All in all, great experience.",40
"Loved the Venetian.  It was everything I expected.  The rooms are fantastic.  Big and beautiful.  However, if you don't like large hotels, then this is not for you.  3,000 rooms.  Got a lot of exercise walking around.  Attended the UFC event at the Cotai Arena and that was brilliant. It was great to be staying in the same hotel as the event.  Can thoroughly recommend the Venetian.",50

Only negative side is that it is too crowded outside and inside the hotels and sometime one has to wait for going out and…",50
The hotel was huge and it was a long walk along the corridors leading to our room. Felt contented upon entering the room as it was huge and cozy with a living area in the room separated by a railing and on a split floor.  There was an incident when I forgot my room key card and had to wait for my roommate to return.  I just sat at the corner of the corridor near my room waiting as I couldn’t contact my roommate and moreover didn’t want to take the long walk to the reception as it was close to midnight. Then along came a hotel staff (just by using sign language) I explained my problem and he assisted me in opening my door after getting clarification on my identity from the reception using his hp. It was really a blessing in disguise as I didn’t have any means to call for help at…,50
Very grand decoration & spacious. Quality & services are good. The shopping mall is very big & convenient. You can spend a whole day to shop & dine there. Only think I have to compliant is that we have to wait long for the shuttle bus connecting to other places.,50

But our stress just disappeared when we saw our suite, its very huge bigger than we expected. the living room, bed room and the bathroom were just amazing with heavenly like Interiors , fittings and amenities! We enjoyed the view from our room while relaxing at our suite. Also a paradise for shoppers! Casino is the biggest draw at venetian. Truly an amazing Hospitality property.

We went during the recent Chinese New Year I found it surprising that the price of The Venetian was more reasonable that other hotels with lower classes. We were billeted in a Suite; it was spacious and complete with amenities I felt like I was rich!  The hotel has plenty of stores and restaurants you need not go out at least for a day.  The receptionists were good in English and we're very accommodating.,50
"Anything written or said about this place is never enough. You gotta be there to believe, experience and fall in love!  We had booked the Ice World Package over the internet. This particular package was available during Dec 2013 through February 2014, I guess. The package included free entry to the Ice World Expo that was going on at the time when we visited, plus it included one-way ferry tickets from Macau to Hong Kong by Cotai Jet, a free buffet lunch at the Bambu (oh what a sumptuous spread it was!), It also included many other offers like complimentary drinks etc. Since we made our booking in advance, we availed huge huge discount. The hotel wants u to be there and they can go the extra mile just to make sure u had a memorable stay there. That's what make Venetian Macau so…",50

"I chose to celebrate my Mum's 83rd birthday by treating her to a trip in Macau. Booked a Bella suite at the Venetian Macau for 3 of us via the hotel website. As we were arriving around 10:15am at Macau airport but hotel check in time was supposed to be at 3pm, I requested to exchange our late check out entitlement to an early check in on the booking form. My request was passed on to the Guest relations team.   Response from guest relations team was swift. In reply, Nicole invited us to check in at the VIP lounge and offered to arrange a complimentary longevity bao to be delivered to our suite to celebrate my Mum's birthday.

"We were upgraded from a Royal suite to a royal view suite and was it Royal, the rooms are immaculate, large , clean and well serviced. The WiFi did crash late in our stay but not a problem, we asked for a late checkout, that's even latter than the standard 11 am and was given without a problem, however all good things do have a down side and the 3 pm check in was a pain, but the express checkout was a breeze",50
"Standard Bella room excellent size and furnishings. Very clean and comfortable. Stayed in several hotels on this trip with friends these rooms were the best of the whole trip. The buffet breakfast was below average, the food was cold and quality of western ingredients passable only just. The biggest negative was the smoking of other patrons it could be smelt throughout the whole complex, the non smoking sections on the casino was pointless as there was no protection or additional extraction fans to filter the smoke away and there were no non smoking bars that we could find. The hotel and casino staff were unable to give directions to specific locations. Excellent price for the rooms.",40
"We stayed here a fortnight ago for our third anniversary, as well as to attend a concert.  So what follows is a 24 hour (one night) experience.  Keep in mind that this is a review of the hotel facilities as a whole, and not just the accomodation aspect.  Strap yourselves in...  The hotel is located in the Cotai Strip, in the Taipa area of Macau (South).  As we didn't venture outside of the complex, I can't comment as to transport links or nearby attractions.  Words simply do not do justice to the sheer scale of this place.  We entered on one lobby (yes, there are more lobbies), and we were greeted by an absolute hoarde of travellers.  We arrived via the lobby that's closest to the bus/taxi transport (facing the Galaxy).  Things were quite chaotic, but we were able to get our…",40
We only stayed one night in Macao because we wanted to see the watershow. I have been working in Hong Kong for 6 month and my colleagues recommended the show. They were right it was an amazing performance with outstanding artists. The Venetian is a huge hotel close to the famous shows with a lovely shopping mall and an indoor copy of the canals in Venetia. The outside pool area is a bit hard to find. Once you are there you will enjoy it. Breakfast is and there is something to choose from for everyone. Look out for special offers and ask for room upgrade. We got both and were suprised by the good Price value. ,50

Arrangements for the guests are systematic free outings pickups / drop from Airport.",50
"We're back in Venetian once again... And for me, it's still the best in Macau. Check in was fast and the room was great as usual! We're very thankful for the handwritten card by the manager to greet us on our anniversary! The cupcakes and room decor is awesome. It made our anniversary and Valentine's celebration more special. :)  Having stayed at the hotel a lot of times since it opened and had tried other hotels in Macau as well. The cleanliness seems not like before. I personally don't like the smell of the towels and the bath room is not as ""new' as before.  I do a lot of shopping, so if you are a shopper as well, Venetian is still the best place to stay in. :)",50

"As everyone probably knows already, the hotel is huge! You can spend a week in the hotel area without going outside, as you can get anything in the hotel and the mall connected to it. Somehow, the hotel felt soulless to me, and service is not up to the standard. Check in took 1 hour, and we seldom see smiling staffs. Rooms are absolutely fantastic and spacious, amenities are good. Essentially, the hotel seems to have all the right hardware, but lacks in the service part.  It does get a bit tiring walking from one room to another (I was in a group of 10 rooms, and they couldn't put us on the same floor). Also, the location being on the cotai strip means a 70 MOP cab ride to the downtown area. All in all, it's a great hotel, but not one I would actually look forward to staying…",40
Absolutely lovely room with huge space and comfy bed. Victorian setting and well equipped and clean bath/powder room.   Friendly staff and restsurants are located at almost every corner. Would be best with a convenience store. Other than that value for money and an absolute a must visit when in macau!,50
"My wife and i checked into this property for a night whirlwind 16 hour stay.  I have noted some of the highlights below:   - Airport shuttle bus is pretty neat but that goes for all big hotel properties in Macau.  - Check-in was swift considering there were quite a few people moving in and out. (They have an dropbox option for express checkout wherein your credit card is charged with final amount) - Hotel interiors, inspired for medieval Italy is jaw dropping to say the least. One million square feet of class! - We were upgraded to a Cotai Strip view room on a high floor facing the sea. We had views of golf course (within  venetian), city of dreams // hrc , sheraton, conrard.  - Room sizes was pretty large in sharp contrast to our room in HongKong - Dining / night club…",40

We checked in with ease (although I did see when there were about 20 Reception staff checking in queues of people), and after being given directions, we found our way to our room.  We were stunned by the size of the bathroom, huge bath, shower, double sinks and a vanity table as well.  Then you walk toward the bedroom and it again is wow!!!  There is a canopied king size bed with a ton of pillows!  Lots of cupboard and wardrobe space. Keep walking past the bed and there are a couple of steps down into the lounge area - with sofa, chair and a dining table with three chairs and of course a unit with a TV (this one was an old one, but it still worked).  The suite is impeccably clean and should you require anything, all you…",50

We passed through the Macau Tower- the highest bungee jumping able Tower, over the Brown River and landed at the West Lobby of the Hotel. Rain was drizzling so it was a nice weather but sunny weather would have been more better for the photographs. Many doors were leading into the West Lobby. The reception of the hotel was 'tres grande'. The floors were carpeted and everything was glistening and shining. We went into our rooms and believe me they were super luxurious. The windows gave way out to Galaxy Hotel shining at a little distance away. The room had a cabinet, two televisions, a larder full of eatables (of course you have…",50

it was such a nice place i love being there very much . the shopping places is supper cool & we found halal food in the food court was amazing really & i enjoy to the max in the ice world trip i think it called cottai trip or something u can ask about it .. and also there u can have a romance ride in the fake river with a nice man singing for u ( venation style ) awesome place   ❤️❤️,50
"The room is faultless, extremely spacious and had all the amenities we need and more. I booked the room via the hotel's official website and enjoyed the complimentary wifi and late check out at 2pm. We were also offered the Key Express service, where we fill up a form and email to them before our trip, and the key cards will be ready for collection upon our arrival skipping the usual check in processes. We only spent a mere 5mins at the check in counter and we're done! The service at the reception and the concierge was good, for Asian standard...no complains during our stay.  Navigating this massive hotel proved to be overwhelming for us first timers. To get to the room lobbies, we gotta walk through the casino aisle (a strategy by the hotel owner to tempt the inner gambler in…",50
"We recently stayed at the Venetian Macao for 2 nights and had booked the normal Suite for one couple and the Rialto Suite for the other couple. Arrival to the Venetian is very simple, as busses run for free from the ferry terminal. Unfortunately the check-in area is not very welcoming for a 5-star hotel. A long counter with little to no privacy, no seating area for the accompanying family members and long queues, thats it! The staff at the check-in also seem to have his trouble arranging the limousine transfer, which was included in our package. It took him quite a few phone calls to arrange everything, which at the end worked out great.  Rooms: The rooms of the venetian are generally very spacious, if you like a more cozy styled room you can stick to the standard rooms as they…",40
"when i came to macau with my husband, we try to 2 different  hotel. the galaxy hotel and venetian .I was a little disappointed because when im  check in, I have to wait until 6 pm because my room was not ready. the hotel too big and too crowded a lot of people in lobby reception. I think the employees are not very friendly and can not speak English. nuanced romantic rooms, a large bathroom, a soft mattress but very dusty headboard.",40
"I know the Venetian is a celebrated place in Macao, that's why we spent our first year anniversary there. Got the room over on Agoda at only 30% of published rate, without breakfast, really fantastic deal.   Shuttle bus from the ferry was so convenient. Staff very helpful (it helped that they were fellow Filipinos!). Got to the hotel early, and were immediately attended to (fellow Filipino once again!) by a concierge who advised us right away that we're too early but instead of waiting till 3 pm to check in we could be accommodated by 12:30. Went off to lunch first.   Room was amazing of course. Just got the royale suite, we didn't need the bigger suites since there was just 2 of us.   The only thing that I loved yet didn't like at the same time was the size of the Venetian.…",40
"HUGE property with enough food and shopping outlets, kids play area, large gaming floor and enough amenities to keep every gender and age group happy.  Stayed in Aug 2013. Was a but over priced, but definitely the best property to stay in when in Macao. It is the center of attraction.",50
"The beds are very comfortable, and the bathroom is huge compared to other hotels. The hotel itself is more than enough for a short trip with plenty of shops and facilities. There's a shuttle bus to and from the airport, so transportation isn't a big problem.  There are many shuttle busses at different hotels, so it's pretty easy getting around the city if you are in no hurry. Only downside was there seemed to be some prostitutes lurking around the casino area in the evening, so you may want to stay clear of the place if you're traveling with kids.",50
"Venetian Macau has 3000 suites...yes...all the rooms are suites...well appointed with king size comfortable beds,carpets,sofa sets,wardrobe,2 TVs-one facing the bed,ironing facility,safe locker,minibar,fax facility,wifi,and a spacious bathroom which is the size of an average hotel room in HK.The hotel is so huge that walking from the lift to the room gives you your dose of morning exercise.The checkin may take an hour or more as it is too much crowded...the roof top shopping area is awesome...designed like venice...complete with a small river and boating facility ! Dont miss out the regular shows there including some nice magic shows.",40
"Had so much fun in venetian resort macau.. We take ice world package, we got royal suite room with welcome cupcakes n swan with flower in bed, so sweet.. We got 2 tickets ice world in packages..met kungfu panda, trying ice sliding n very cold inside..new experience for us :).  We also got 2 tickets cotai jet ferry to hkg, buffet bfast for two, and wifi in our room..  Eventhough we stayed only 1 night venetian give good services for honeymooners like us..  Thx venetian macao.. :))",50
"I had planned for a weekend jaunt of gambling and casino hopping. My cousin booked the best hotel known. We came back with a lot more (memories) than we had bargained for. Once inside The Venetian Macau, I completely lost track of time. I was told by  friends to expect long queues for check in etc etc. 10 minutes is all it took for us to get in. Check out was equally incredible. Since we had booked online, we were given a late check out of 2 pm. All counters were busy at the time of our check out, so we were re-directed to to the priority counter. Again a pleasant surprise. I am now a proud member of the sands privilege club. I will always stay at The Venetian when ever I visit Macau. I would suggest to anyone travelling there, to book the room online directly through the hotel…",50
"my family and I stayed in the venetian macau for 2 nights, on december 29-31 and It was awesome ! We stayed in the bella suite, which is very spacious..they have 2 queen beds, living room, and a big bathroom (with separate bathtub and shower box, separate closet). everything was spotless clean, and the interior is nice and classy with victorian style. I love it ! Like marina bay sands, the hotel has a high-end mal and casino at the down level, with many restaurants and one foodcourt, so we can grab food easily. I love the ceiling with clouds painting on it and as everyone known  they have a replica of the grand canal in venice, where tourist can take a gondola ride for approx. 10 mins. don't worry for getting bored 'cause the gondola drivers are fun, they like to sing. During…",40
"I went to Venetian Macao for Christmas and took their Ice World package as my niece was traveling with us.  We took the Bella Suite and must say the room was big, spacious and offered an amazing view of the Cotai Strip. We were in the main lobby and Check In was very smooth, even though we arrived much before the Check In time. There was no queue and we were the first ones to be entertained.  The place can be defined as a city rather than a hotel, and it just happens to also have some beautiful rooms. I had visited Marina Bay Sands, few years back, and that hotel offered more privacy and peace, especially with their pool on the 57th Floor.  Here,  at Venetian, the moment you get down from the rooms, you are part of huge crowds and that is a bit disturbing. I enjoyed my time at…",40
"Was there for business trip. out of 100 experience that we have 80% i could say that it was a pleasant ones.   Greeted by very helpful and friendly staff as we came down from the shuttle bus. anyway they provide shuttle busses from the airport and pier. We had about 180 kgs of event equipments, we just dropped it off at the lobby and the concierge took it to our room. The receptionist are decent, they work pretty fast.  The room is HUGE! the bed, pillow, whatever you find in the room.. you can tell that its the best quality (other than the kinda old TV inside the cupboard). Too bad the toilet bowl is not working properly, the water wudnt go down.. oh well i don't wanna describe it into detail :) so i asked to change room.  They only told us the new room number, helped us with…",40
"This was our  3rd visit to this beautiful hotel and like previous times we were extremely satisfied with our stay.  great rooms and the best bathroom i have ever seen in my life.  The grand canal shopping area on the 3rd floor is very nice and so huge you can easily get lost in that, so keeping a map with you is very handy.  lots of places to eat in the hotel, you literally don't need to step out of this hotel for anything, everything is available with in the Hotel.  every thing about this hotel from lobby area to the swimming pools is beautiful.  only thing is that because this hotel is very popular so there is always a large queue at the check in/out and that takes a lot of time. Apart from that this hotel is perfect.  would definitely stay there if i am back in Macau.",50
"This is a copy of the one in Vegas. Same great rooms with the Grand Canal Shops etc, so there are hundreds of shops all under one roof. It connects to the properties over the road such as the Conrad, Sheraton and Holiday Inn which was handy too (as I stayed at the Conrad as well). It's massive and the casino is three times a big as their Vegas property so pick up one of the maps at check in!!",40
"I had seen Venetian casino in Las vegas in 2004/5 with my wife but did not stay but had thought of staying Venetian someday and it happened few months back when I went to Hongkong/ Macau for week and stayed for 2 nights at this great hotel, this was one the best 5 star room/suite I had ever stayed in. Bathroom was really royal. This hotel is like a mini city in itself, the shows, eateries, decor  and shops everything was grand and this hotel was bigger and better than Las Vegas one, I was really lucky to have such a hotel close to my home country India. I would highly recommend to everyone who goes to Macau.",50
"We have stayed at Venetian Macau for 3 nights (21-24 January 2014) as we were part of a professional expo.We came from Hong Kong with a quite fast ferry boat .A shuttle bus is waiting for Venetian Host. Check In took half hour (fair enough because the long waiting queue),but was efficient. The standard rooms are all huge suites very well equipped. We were laughing saying that you need a GPS device in order to find yourself within this monster.But frankly,it is quite easy to move from one part to another.Stuff around is around everywhere ready to help. We didn't need to go out for one minute as you got here anything you needs: Shows,Bars,Restaurants,Clubs and of course High standard shops,gondolas etc... You cannot miss the casino as you have to go trough it when you move around…",50
Everything was amazing. The hotel is so huge you don't need to get out of the place. Lot of activities within the hotel itself. Casinos are massive. Plenty of restaurants with a wide variety of international cuisines. Shopping and entertainments are really good. Overall amazing experience. Would definitely go back.,50
"Venetian Resort Macau is luxurious hotel that you can enjoy in every corner. Luxurious, stylish and entertaining. You can enjoy many free attraction here such as : violin mini concert and harp's performance. I booked Bella suites for my stay at Venetian without breakfast, and the deposit is MOP1000 per room. The room is very spacious with two queen bed size, sofa, tv, water heater, fax machine. Bath room also spacious and luxurious. I think the room can fit for 6 people (^_^))). They give us hotel map when check-in due to the huge of this hotel (*_*). The most convenience is you don't need to queued for check-out. Just drop your key card in the express check-out box that available near elevator in first floor. They also have luggage storage for fee. No complaining for this…",40
"From the time we queued up for check-in, the magnitude of this property blew us away. The room we stayed in (Royal Suite) lived up to its name - with gilded furnishings, a huge bathtub, two TVs, plush sofas and plenty of space. The casino is the main attraction and is full of people and energy, but there are many other things to do here. The Venetian is a mini town in itself - with malls, restaurants, and a food court too. We also visited an exquisite ice sculpture exhibition of Dreamworks' characters, which is on till March.",50
"Huge Huge Huge !!! Built in style like a palace. You really need a map to go around the hotel and they provide one at the checkin as well. Excellent suits, huge suit rooms, cleanest, excellent service and many more. Feel like and treated like royally. Food at the indian restaurent Golden Peacock was awesome. The grand canal shoppes, casino and all the other facilities. Ahhhh live there if you get a weeks time. in peace",50
"The Venetian Macao, is one amazing place to stay. The place is HUGE. There is so much to do. The casino, the restaurants, the shopping arcade...so much to do and see. The suite we stayed in was great. The service was really nice. Awesome experience.",50
"If you have been to the Venetian in Las Vegas then you will feel right at home at the sister property in Macau.  All your favorite landmarks – The Campanile, Gondola Rides, St. Mark’s Square, the Bridge of Sighs, and the Rialto are all there. The biggest difference is in the size with the Macau Venetian being much bigger. In fact, it is one of the world’s largest buildings by floor area and the largest casino in the world.  Westerners will find all their favorite games along with some new challenging ones.  The Venetian Macau is the largest hotel by area in Asia. The accommodations are beautiful and even the most reasonable room present a luxurious ambiance with high-end amenities. Enjoy their several pools, and unlike the Venetian in Las Vegas, they have a dedicated…",50
"the best hotel to stay with your family.excellent rooms,food,etc.when u go to see the hotel u will not no whether its day time or night time as the roof has clouds painted on it.good place to stay with your family.",50
"I had the chance to stay in The Venetian Macao Resort Hotel late 2013. One word to describe it- BIG! From the lobby to the function rooms to their suites, everything is big. Running from one end to the other end to catch up with friends and meeting prospective suppliers, you better have comfortable shoes. Tried a couple of their outlets and I felt it was good value considering it was a 5 Star Hotel. Staff was pretty helpful and courteous. One thing I found strange was you had to cut through the casino area in order to get to the elevators to get to your rooms. Also, if your room card key malfunctions, it's quite a walk to get to the counter to have them fix it. Worth visiting another time.",40
"This hotel met with my expectation once I have checked in. Spacious and beautiful room. Entertainment area is just around the corner within walking distance. And if you wish to visit any historical place in Macao, no need to worry about commuting since The Venetian has shuttle service and also the concierge will direct you on how to reach the places. In my case, I just had to walk to City of Dream in order to catch a free shuttle to Sintra Hotel. Start from Sintra Hotel, everything is just walking distance, Lisboa Casino, MGM, Wynn, Senado Square, St. Paul Church Ruin, Museom of Macao and etc. It's been a great stay and wish to comeback again.",50
"The fake canals are spectacular - pay the money to take a boat ride - Most amazing singers I have ever heard. I don't get all emotional over singing (but I was about to marry this dude - just so he could sing for me - FOREVER)  shopping is pretty good too. As for the hotel, what is there to complain about - princess bed - check, princess bathroom - check, phone in toilet (for more paper or for calling mum) - check.  I went near Chinese new year and the light show across the hotel was AMAZING! My only negative experience is smoking in the casino - get a higher floor or smoke free floor or you can still smell it.  Sit down have a peach Bellini, gamble and marry a fake venetian = great holiday destination.",40
"I love this place got the reservation 1 month a head and avail 15% discount and have extra accommodation, the room is huge its like you have house inside the room...cool and great..you can accept visitor and stay as they like, while some frnds love the casino.  Luxury  and so amazing. you cant ask and find more because everything is in their...except money changer...if you arrived late...not all currency is accepted....Before year 2008.. but recently year 2013 nob...no peso exchange..you can wait the 8am to exchange your peso in the bank.",50
"This is a real 5-star, incredibly extravagant piece of work. I still can't even figure out how they managed to build such a massive monstrosity of metal, cement, and art that covers every inch of this place. I had the opportunity to come here for a couple days, and it was just amazing. That being said, the casino only has one craps table, and I couldn't really find any blackjack tables either. This casino is catered to the Asian crowd 100% with games like Sic Bo, and some other table games I have never seen before. I still don't understand what was going on. Also, I have a feeling these games are a lot more skewed for a house advantage compared to western games, but who knows. This is my first time.  Also, table minimums were like 300+hkd or $45 US MINIMUM. That's the lowest I…",50
All the rooms in this hotel are suites. All are spacious and have 2 tv's and a huge sofa. All have great views also. Their pools are great and you have alot of dining choices. They also have a shuttle service to the airport and to the downtown.,40
"Well its an experience not to be missed. A place I would stay again if I go to Macau again. Grand luxurious rooms with great view, huge Venice themed shopping mall, good service, lots to do including a huge casino. The food is good, specially if u are an Indian. There is an Indian restaurant, just ensure that you reach early as there is a huge queue of Indian tourists. They do include a lot of freebies in the package which are all worth, specially the shopping vouchers and they bring down the cost of stay. I would highly recommend it as the place to stay when in Macau. ",50
"Well, I had seen the photo's of this Resort Hotel before and was determined to stay there. I stayed here during 31st Dec 13 to 3rd Jan 14 while I was on my Honeymoon Tour. My first reaction when I entered the Hotel was WOW..  I stayed here for 3 nights and every day (and night :)) was worth living. Shopping, Gondola ride, Indian Vegetarian food and non stop gambling...  Gondola ride experience was really good..All international brands are available for shopping.  Initially I thought that we may not get good Indian Vegetarian food but was pleasantly surprised to find the same in the Venetian itself...  Though couldn't make fortune in gambling we really enjoyed the same ..wish there could have been tables with lower minimum bet amounts which could have enabled us to play Black…",40
"The Venetian hotel is the BEST hotel on the strip. It is an epitome of luxury from its exteriors, hallways, to its huge rooms ; you will feel like you are in a grandiose palace waiting to be treated like royalty. Not to forget the Venice style shopping plaza, the food court with great food and the Gondola ride. So classy, so romantic!",50
Venetian Macau is every Indians dream visit as it is so popular here specially with all the bollywood movies shot there and awards taken place...So wehn we decided to go macau Venetian was the most natural choice...The hotel was really a dream come true...When the venetian bus was approaching the hotel all of us just jumped off our seats in awe as we could see our dream come true... The first look of the property is Grand.....the check in was smooth but was surprised at the long que for the check in but it was smooth...We took an upgrade to the verona suites....On reaching the room we were shocked....What a room...Wowwwwwwwwwwwwww huge room with a balcony and huge beds and seperate living area and two bathrooms....our dream trip had just started... After checkin we left to see…,50
"'Joy' at reception was so kind to organize me a birthday cake upon arrive, what a treat, thank you.  Our suite was 29100, it was almost perfect except ever times we come back to our room wanting to relax and catching some news, we had to call for technician to reset the circuit in the suite.  We had it after 2 times of ringings. Great bars, restaurants and food court.",40
"We stayed in this hotel for short vacation over the weekend.  It is too big , where many times one felt bit  lost.  Too much crowd every where .  Very nicely designed hotel,  with most rooms having good view, spacious rooms .  Waiting in the line was bit too long to check in and check out",40
"Huge,amazing ,marvelous hotel , lifetime experience,only trouble is long que to check in is quite frustrating , while taking gondola ride ...choose a person who is Italian & sings exceptionally good , he made our visit to Venetian ,difficult to see all outlets in a single day",40
VENETIAN MACAU is a excellent and mind blowing hotel from all aspect . It is a memorable stay in my life.Fantastic architecture with  the mind blowing  human made SKY . There is ample scope to spend time inside the hotel. Boat riding over channel inside the hotel was also an Awesome Experience. Rooms are also very large. Wide range of foods  to select . top of all it is Superb.,50
"Hi, We along with Several Company Officials were there for the Annual meet at the VENETIAN MACAU.... It was an Awesome Experience.... the Peacock restaurant serves awesome indian food. The Casino is good but a little too expensive!!!",50
This is a huge hotel. Very nice architecture. Rooms are very large and can accommodate atleast 6 people. But as it's too huge it's too much to walk and little poor in service. Best casino. It also has good kids activities and many pools also. I think 3. The bus service is helpful too. ,40
excellent rooms excellent food excellent excellent what else to say its casino is awesome if you are planing to go please stay here or at least visit it you will find it very beautiful and the shopping arcade in it what to say its great.,50
"Room size is excellent and it's very spacious. Apart from king size bed, you have plenty of room to receive your guest in a separated hall with water view. Moreover, room service was very quick which we thoroughly enjoyed along with the family in Macau.",50
Venetian was our first choice when we decided to visit Macau. It has an amazing check-in system and shuttles to and from the Macau ferry pier. The hotel is huge and the rooms are beautiful. It provides guest wifi at HKD160 per night. The casino is wonderful and one can play as long as he/she wants without getting bored. The shopping area is amazing and the restaurants are top class. It's a wonderful stay. An amazing new year eve celebration was the icing on the cake.,50
Staying here is a tourist attraction in itself. as a builder I always notice minute details in construction work and this place was so well detailed it was magnificent. the room we got was huge and the staff very helpful and friendly. Would definitely stay here again.,50
"the package of winter tour was excellent, every 30min had performance in front of the lobby and 3D projector on the wall is amazing. also the package included a voucher of ice sculpture, it was unexpected good and fun.",50
"Staying  at the Venetian is an experience of a life time.The splendor and opulence that spill out the moment you reach the lobby can be experienced at every step,with beautiful suites with a living area plush with a tv,a bar and even a fax machine.The single rooms are the same with twin queen size beds.The dominance of the casino in the hotel centre draws you and is the main attraction here.Lots of walking here esp if below 21yrs.,as you cannot take a shortcut thru the casino.Language(Chinese)may prove a hindrance .All top brands have their outlets here,so no need to look elsewhere if your pocket permits",40
"Arrival saw us dropped in a vast bus-park, left to get our luggage and then spend the next quarter of an hour trying to workout where check-in was. This was not a good start to a much raved hotel. It did get better.  The Venetian is everything it is claimed to be and more. The sheer size of the complex is amazing and the attention to detail is exceptional in some areas. Unfortunately, it is very easy to get lost in and this can be very frustrating. When I asked the Concierge for information about old Macau and how to get there, I thought I'd grown an extra head - I wanted to leave the resort?!? He was very helpful once he grasped this.  Associated with the problem of getting lost is the need to manoeuvre through the casino. Despite there being non-smoking areas, these are next…",40
It is one of the  best hotel in macau .what an ambience and what an lovley rooms . Specially the bathroom were too good.services werw too gud.food court was awesome wid variety of multi cuisine. Offcourse the casinos the best part of this hotel.,40
"We stayed at the Venetian Macau for a night just before NYE 2013-2014 and absolutely loved every minute in the hotel. There was so much to do and see in the hotel that we didn't know how time flew by. The rooms are just fantastic and by far the biggest and most opulent that one has seen. We were lucky to have rooms on the 33rd floor which meant we enjoyed the most spectacular view of the mini gold course and the Macao skyline at night. We travelled with friends and one was celebrating his birthday. The hotel sent us a fantastic cake which was very thoughtful and showed us that inspite of easily being THE resort to stay at, they yet cared for every guest.   Even though this hotel is expensive, it is worth spending a night here for the experience. Absolutely fantastic in every…",50
Once you enter this hotel.... It will give you a feeling of 'Alice in Wonderland'! This hotel leaves you speechless! Its massiveness can make you feel lost! So carry a GPS with you in case you get lost!!!  Highly recommended for all family visits as well as honeymooners as well as for friends!,50
"Our entire stay was awesome. The room is splendid and view is spectacular. The checkin was smooth, but there is lot of walking to be done because its a huge place. The food is very good and we had Indian options too. The Golden Peacock - the Indian restaurant is by far the best you can get in China. It has free Wifi too. :). We stayed for 2 nights and we just couldn't leave the place when the 2 days was done. The suggestions are: 1. There should be some transportation from the ferry terminal to the hotel cos we cant carry the luggage till the common bus - this is not fair for a hotel at this range. 2. Free Wifi can be included as this is a huge requirement for travellers. At this price point - we should have the best of everything. Other then this, i dont have any suggestions. i…",50
"Had to write this review after so long and had to do the hotel justice, else not being truthful. First off, most 5-star hotel in Macau had internal bus shutter service, so going to hotel from airport was a brezze, arrival can be a little daunting as alot of traffic at main entrance but the decor will wow you, checkin was pretty simple, the usual 5-8min and we were up to the room. as we have kids, we cannot cut through the casino, so we had to climb stairs, take lifts, navigate the shopping malls, and finally to our North side? or is it south? lol the interior is pretty much same as US, just not as grandiur, lots of local food and others within reach. but i would give a miss as the foodcourt not to my taste bud. if willing, go to Taipa village opposite and walk, explore the local…",50
"Awesome experience: Fabulous suits that nothing to complaint with..comfy bed and cozy living room with big and fantasy bathroom. Luxuries shopping environment with Venice canals. If you come on Christmas time, there are more interesting event waiting for you. Will definitely come back again!",50
"We stayed here for 2 nights with 2 small kids and there is nothing I can fault about this hotel.  After the torturous ferry ride from HK arriving here was like arriving in a fantasy land. The hotel itself is mammoth, our room was spacious and beautifully appointed, and the pool area was just beautiful. The hotel has a kids play centre that is huge and was relatively empty when we were there. I have the fondest memories of Macau and especially the Venetian. ",50
"The Venetian from its entrance exudes European specifically Venetian luxury and opulence - from the decor, fittings, the drawing on the ceilings and even the transplanted canal with its famous gondolas. The room speaks of luxurious furnishing and is very spacious in split levels. Very comfortable!",40
A smart hotel! The rooms are big and comfortable with luxury interior.  A walking distance to the old village of Tai Pa where you have choice of eateries (we found the hotel eateries are expensive.).  We enjoyed our morning swim in one of the heated outdoor swimming pools.  The shuttle buses run between the ferry terminal are good.  The down side is there are far too many non hotel residents inside and outside the hotel (when we arrived at the hotel we have to fight our way into the hotel lobby.),40
"Everything is Grandiose! as soon as you enter the Main Lobby, the architectural designs, paintings on walls and ceilings are impressive.The sky at the gondola areas is realistic, romantically perfect while streaming down on a gondola being serenaded by the gondolier. Moreso, there was also events being held that really captured our sensations- The Winter at Cotai Strip, the lights and sounds, first time to witness video mapping.  However, we found the resort hotel, too costly but its all worth it,anyway.",50
"Was so touched by the hotel's special arrangement for our 20th wedding anniversary - they decorated our bed and sent us special cup cakes. The room is so huge and I am awed by the decoration especially the bathroom with two sinks, separate bath and shower areas as well as a separate room for the toilet. Room service was fast within 20 mins. The Gondola private charter was a special memorable moment for us and I was surprised they could provide so many souvenirs with our photo within 12 mins!",50
"After a long tiring flight and ferry ride, we were shocked to see a long line at the huge check-in counter. Only one person was allowed to stand there even though we had booked two Cotai strip facing suites.  ""Did we just buy our ticket to disaster?"" I thought, as the lady attendant watched every guest in that line closely.  But once we checked in, the fun began. It's a beautiful hotel. A tiny city with its own shopping mall, food court (which I found was the best in Macao) The rooms are safe, well planned and luxuriously comfortable, except for the fact that they have nothing we can put our used teabags near the kettle. Barring that, I loved everything about The Venetian, breakfast included.",40
"If u want to see what is maximum of everything,i would say it is"" VENETIAN"".The hotel is beautiful and big,the rooms are large and value for every penny, u should opt for the river view though. The casino is very big and lots of multi -cuisine  restaurants offering the best of everywhere is available in the resort. All the big brands hav there stores under one roof,so can shop till u fall flat!!!!!. The artificial sky created is truly amazing and u forget how much time has passed by  till suddenly u realize that it is past midnight.Although we stayed for one day,i feel, to enjoy entire hotel u need at least two -three days. We got vouchers from the hotel but to claim the vouchers we had to walk from one end to other which was very tiring with a small child in arms,though its a…",50
"I stayed here for my first visit to macau,  We took a shuttle from ferry terminal to venetian which isn't that great and looks kinda down market for a hotel of venetian standards.  Didn't imagine what I was about to witness, this place has 4 lobbies and we entered from west lobby from where all the shuttles enter and it was like and ocean of people and architecture, simply huge.  Check in process was okay and we were handed a map to travel in hotel.  Room we stayed was a royal suite in north wing, which was truly royal and elegantly done but was kind of surprised with no door bell and any body who comes would need to bang on your door- strange. Also one negative point was the room service, room when asked to be cleaned is not done to five star standards and looks kind of…",40
I visited.its brilliant.very nice and big room.lot of branded show room.where we can do shopping as u like.large casino is there.aboveall  interior is very rich.lot of entertainment for every ages.and breakfast was delicious and lot of variety.bed was royal type.and bathroom was well lighted.overall the hotel was appreciate able ..,40
"We stayed one night on 2nd December and had to say that we should have stayed longer.  I was told by friends that the rooms were big and nice.   So went there with an expectation and it was truly beyond our expectation.  Our room, with a complementary upgrade to a two bedder and thanks to the front desk manager, was awesome.  One big sleeping room and one big living room, not to mention about the nice bathroom with separate show and bath.  It was definitely value for money unlike our the hotel we stayed in Zhuhai.",50
"Hotel is by far the largest I have stayed in. Everything was huge including the casino which is why I choose this hotel  The rooms were huge but were slightly let down by furnishing. Hotel has everything including a shopping mall, casino, replica venetian canal just to name a few..   However I wouldn't stay here again as it felt mass production assembly line",40
"Nice, Big hotel, very cozy living room, at the taipa island, so if you want to go to old macau you have go to other side the big bridge at taipa. I like this hotel very much, because security is very good and the breakfast is good even  i am not china",50
"In spite of lots of new and old hotels in Macau, you can not beat The Venetian. It has it's own charm and magnetism. The canal and the artificial sky just take you breath away. Imagine over 3000 suites, yes The Venetian has no ""rooms"". Once in your suite, it would be difficult to drag yourself away. Very ornate and rich decor. You could spend the entire day just exploring the hotel. Don't miss the gondola ride there.",40
"I stayed for one night only(because we didn't have much time) with my BF and we really enjoyed staying here. When the time we arrived at Macau it was really cold so we preferred to walk inside the hotel. It was so huge and very elegant even we didn't go out, we were fully satisfied inside and it was a really nice experience to check in here.",50
"Checked in a Bella suite 30th floor. Suite is big with 2 queen size beds and enough pillow to sleep on (about 4 pillows and a bolster on each bed), small living room is sufficient for 8 people or so to chit chat comfortably. Baggage service is a mess, probably due to the hotel is hosting the APFF, lobby is being cordoned off. Check in time changes from 1pm to 1.30pm, but multiple counters help to solve that issue of long waiting time. Some staff can be quite rude.",50
"The hotel is massive, so large it's easy to get lost in and it is a long walk from place to place. The rooms are similarly large, almost comically so. But that is typical for Macau, and it is a pleasant stay, if the Macau/gaming experience is what you are looking for. The attached mall is extensive with many shops and restaurants. There isn't much to do in the Cotai strip where the hotel is located besides gambling, so a short taxi ride over to the other side is needed for local shops and so on.",40
"Thoroughly enjoyed the experience in Venetian. The was anniversary trip and mentioned this while booking ,Venetian surprised us with with a high floor and beautiful complementary cake accompanying an already well maintained room.Stayed in the room category termed as  Royal Suite. Quite spacious( esply after small sized rooms in HK !!). Very comfortable bed and duvets.   The resort hotel is an entertainment venue by itself, much like most other resorts in Macao. The highlights were Shoppes & Gondola Rides ( Obviously),  Enjoyed the winter and Cotai strip (What a show !!!) and the Ice World !!!",50
I think this review would be worth writing coz I won some money in the casino of this hotel!  Amazingly scenic food court and shopping arcade next to the beautiful gondola ride. Didn't like the 'false sky' thing though just coz it tends to play with your mind if you go at night!  Apart from this its a beautiful property. Located off the city but easily accessible by the bus service offered by the Sands as well as Venetian which are completely free of cost and frequent as well.,50
"I went there with my family and total 6, had two rooms. We wanted to have two interconnecting rooms but this was not available to provide by the staff.  I must say interior of this hotel is just lice a palace. We went to casino as well but don’t know how to play, tried to take pictures, but was not allowed by the staff.  The nice thing to have Starbucks within the property to manage breakfast and mils requirement for Kids.  They got one restaurant and t serve complete Indian food and this was awesome, we enjoyed lunch there both the days. We had Gandola ride and bought the pictures taken by them and they also made photo key chain, photo mug and photo paper wet also. This was costly but still good for memories  Staff was nice and co-operative but the only problem is to get the…",50
"Considering how busy and how big this hotel is you would think there would be lots of delay, issues, problems, etc.  This is my second time visiting the hotel and its amazing that everythings runs well and we had a pleasant stay each time.  Obviously they have some of the best management in the world and that is why the hotels runs so smoothly.  There are a lot of hotels that could learn a thing or two from the Venetian (I am talking to you IHG Hua Hin and Lowes Santa Monica!).   Its tacky, its smoky, some of the other customers are total brutes knocking people down and spitting left and right, but the hotel goes on running smooth...  Lots of restaurants, tons of choices for eating with something for everyone.  Casino is huge and VERY smoky.  Each night we needed a long shower…",40
"The lights sounds granduer and scale of this place is to be experienced at least once in your life. DragonAir from Bangalore has an odd time at 2:40am but by the time you get here check in is at 3pm - youre just in time . You forget your jetlag !. From the cavernous glittering casino, to the 330+ retail shops, venetian gondoliers and waterways on the 1st floor ! its grand ! and completely interconnected to 4 more properties on the other side of the road - Sheraton, Holiday Inn and Conrad - all with their own large shopping mall and a grand casino ! and some great restaurants . Try Golden Peacock for the best Indian food there is - ask for Chef Justin Paul ! . What can you do ? Well gamble , shop , eat , do a spa day , night life clubs - name it ! Best done with a group of…",40
"I heard that Macau trip is not complete without visiting Venetian, and I agree to the fact. Hotel runs free shuttle from various entry points like airport and ferry. Right from entrance you start getting sense of luxury and mastic. We had a short one night day in Macau. This hotel does not have concept of any standard rooms, all rooms are suits. All across the hotel lobby, rooms and even on sanitation fixtures you will find gold plating.    Artificial sky and Venetian atmosphere and gondolas inside the shopping and food arena, will knock you off.  Casio was very large and you can see lot of serious and professional gamblers here.   View of this hotel from outside is equally majestic with elegant lighting and large fountains.  Highly recommended- A must visit.",50
"A wonderful 2-night stay at the hotel. Though requested for early check in but not given. Booked the Bella Suite. Large and adequate enough for a family of 4 adults with 2 young children as there are 2 huge double beds. Has a nice separate living room area with sofa. 2 TVs (though one of them still the super dated CRT type!) one in living area and one in front of the beds. There are facilities for those not there for the casino. Hotel has a large indoor mini golf course with 36 holes (quite challenging) at only 50 MOP per hour per person. Enjoyable for kids and adults alike. There are also indoor (payable) and outdoor playground for the children, and the hotel is near the shopping mall where you can have their signature Gondola rides whilst being serenaded by your boat captain.…",40
"We stayed here for 2 nights for the ""casino experience.""  The room allocated to us was excellent (upgraded to a good city view).  This shopping area of this Venetian did not seem as good to us as Las Vegas - too few restaurants and very expensive even with the strength of the $A.  Good base for casinos, but nothing else to do.  Glad we spent 3 additional nights on Macao island.",50
"A mammoth structure built beautifully, the Venetian Macau is one of the best hotels I've stayed in. If it being the world's largest casino is not enough for you, you will surely be lured by the vast number of shopping areas, food places and of course, a replica of Venetian canals and street built inside the hotel. The breakfast buffet is almost a mile long and you will definitely burn off half the calories while going to load more food ;-)  The most convenient thing about the hotel is that they arrange for a free shuttle service to the Macau airport and the Pier. We stayed in one of the top floors and had beautiful views of the city. The reception area had a huge rush when we were checking in (in the middle of the afternoon), but the staff was very attentive. In fact, we were…",50
Again i traveled to Hong Kong and Macau again I visited Venetian Macau as I was thinking that i have not visited Venetian last time properly. This time its was with all new look and feel Interior was so so beautiful like a wonder land my kids were amazed to see the beauty of Venetian Macau and they were thoroughly excited they have visited this great paradise. I want to say all of you once in life time do must visit Venetian its a great great fun.,50
"This resort has everything. It houses a huge casino. The shopping mall is big as well. It is situated right in the center of cotai, where other hotels like Galaxy, Sheraton, Hard Rock, etc are surrounding it. The suite we stayed had two queen beds and a living room comes standard. Even this hotel is not new, almost all deco still looks great. There is a travel agency at ground floor which provides Macau City half day tour at reasonable price. However, due to its popularity, the hotel can get crowded!",50
"This hotel is vast and is inspired by the palaces of Venice.  Like Las Vegas hotels it has casino areas within it.  At any time there seem to be a few thousand people at the gambling tables.  Within the same building area there is a huge shopping mall together with a wide selection of restaurants and also a food court.  If you want to gamble or shop 'til you drop then this place offers plenty of scope.  The decor is incredible in terms of scale and the effort and expense put into it but the result is something which is amazing rather than tasteful.  The suites are huge, with a spacious bathroom and a sitting area on a separate level from the bed.  I was delighted with my dim sum room service breakfast - it came right on the dot at 7am, which impressed me particularly as that…",40
"3000 rooms, 600 brands and all possible cuisines available either fine dine or at the food court. Super luxurious rooms. We opted for Royal suite in the South wing of the hotel; which was overlooking a gorgeous golf course.  This hotel is a destination in itself ;)... Which is also a drawback, you cant get to enjoy the hotel enough as it is Huge!! Love the casino. I think their casino is the best in Macau, which outcasts the ones at MGM Grand or at Wynn or Galaxy as a matter of fact.  I would personally go back to enjoy more of it and for sure the luxury and the casinos! ",40
Because the size of this hotel you do get a feeling of being a number. But the great thing with this hotel are the rooms. 70 sqm with a great bathroom. The beds are very comfortable. good to see there was an iron and ironing board too. Strange that one of the 2 tv's were a crt. Will stay again.,40
"After a few days in Hong Kong, my husband and I decided to go to Macau for the night.  We took a ferry, which took only an hour. We got first class seats for the ferry, which was a little more pricey but worth it. You're first to get on and off the boat and the seats are nice and comfortable. When you arrive to the port in Macau, there's a free shuttle bus to the Venetian.  The Venetian was a beautiful hotel. The rooms are huge-  the bed is very comfortable and the bathroom is perfect, esp for ladies. There's a vanity, large tub, shower, double sinks and a closing door toilet.    City of Dreams, Hard Rock, Galaxy are all close by, however, the Ruins was about a 15 mins cab ride to the other island.   We went to Ferenado's for lunch, highly recommend it if you are visiting Macau,…",40
"We arrived at Macao via the Cotai Water Jet Ferry from Hong Kong Island around 4pm. Passing through Macao customs did not take long and the best part was a Venetian shuttle bus was already staged upon our exist from the ferry terminal. Once we arrived at the hotel we were greeted by the front door staff.  Check-in was a breeze, no line at all. The hotel is very large and the headache was walking through a hall of stores, the casino area and then finally seeing signs pointing toward the direction of our tower just to get to the elevator to our room. Tuck your camera away or snap the cap on the lens. Security personnel standing at the entrance to the casino will remind you of the rules. The Venetian is located on the Cotai Strip and transportation is needed to get to the old…",40
"stayed here for the pacman v  rios bout recently,must say enjoyed the stay.Very friendly staff and will return if another major bout takes place there. Only downside,on  checking out,i seemed to have been charged twice for my stay and person on reception was unsure,(what to do)but thinks it will go back on my card with-in thirty days.  All in all and decent stay",40
Our huge family and relatives of 13 were glad to have stayed here from Oct. 30-Nov. 3. We booked 2 connecting rooms and we had a handful of good experiences in the hotel alone. There's plenty of things to see inside and around the vicinity of the hotel and if you like walking a lot then there's nothing much to complain about. Inside the hotel are incredible architectural designs and shopping stores that you can choose from. There's not much food at the food court and they were quite expensive. But this was expected and we had no choice. Free bus rides are provided just outside the hotel that go some places and back to the hotel. Just make sure that you don't miss the last ride back to the hotel as it ends quite early. Overall it was a good and fun experience. If given the chance…,50
"We actually stayed here September 2012, but that was no longer in the date drop down options, so I just selected December 2012.  Anyway!  We had a great stay - we had 2 suites (adjoining) for 5 people, and they were massive!  The hotel itself was also MASSIVE - it would take time to get from one side of the hotel to the other.  We loved the indoor sky, and also the gondola ride was fun.  We chose to stay here since we figured our hotel in itself was an attraction - and we were right!  There were attractions like the gondola ride; there was a food court; there was shopping. I loved the souvenir shops! We actually spent a lot of time in the souvenir shops.   If at all, the crowds in the main areas could get a bit disconcerting at times - but we felt like it was part of the…",50
"I went to Macau with 2 friends and stayed 4nights at the Venetian Hotel.We went there to watch the fight of our boxing champ, Manny Pacquiao.As expected, the room is huge and luxurious with a sala where you can watch tv or entertain visitors or just stay there to relax.There is also a Tv screen in front of the two queen beds.Room service is fast, and you can ask complimentary water as frequent as you want.The only drawback is ,there is no complimentary wi fii  in the room.They charge HK$ 160 /24 hrs.If you dont want to spend more, you may go to Cafe Deco at the ground floor, just buy some drinks/coffee to get a password of their wi fii. Or just sit infront of a restaurant(forgot the name) near the front desk of the West side lobby and get a free wi fii without a password! I cant…",40
"We spent three nights in Macau.  All previous reviews were spot on on the size of the suites - they  are huge... which is great when you have kids and need space. We opted for two queen sized beds which was very comfortable for the four of us. The bathroom was also as huge with good range of toiletries and standard amenities such as hairdryer, vanity mirror etc. The whole room was well appointed (see the pictures on the web). In fact the room is exactly the same as the ones in Vegas (if you have been)  We arranged for the hotel to pick us up at the Airport as we arrived at 10pm, the service cost HK$450 for the 5-8min drive. Not exactly value for money but the service was good. I believe there is a shuttle service to and from the airport. When we arrived at the hotel, the kids…",40
"Beautiful lobby, elegant Suite with a huge bathroom, prompt service, helpful friendly staff. Lots of shuttle buses to take you around Macao and to the other resorts. Choice of a couple of Indian restaurants and cafe serving a hearty veg breakfast with a good-sized area to roam about. The mall area was huge and gave a Venice-like feel but the hotel doesnt give enough of it to justify the name 'Venetian'. Also, the pool area was disappointing to say the least.",40
"This is the second time that w have stayed in the Venetian.  The first time when we were in venetian last July, a typhoon had just passed and it was raining everyday.  As such, we were simply too lazy to take an umbrella to explore Macau.  Instead, we spent 4 days just exploring the venetian and relax in the hotel.  It has a indoor playground and my children were there for 2 hours everyday,  they enjoyed the slides and playground very much.  There were also many restaurants in Venetian.  The food court prices are not cheap, as such,it seems to make more sense to just dine in the restaurants as they provide more value for money.  There are events and concerts to also keep one occupied without leaving the Venetian.  Even the famous Lord Stow egg tarts and Ko Kei almond cookies…",50
"The hotel is so big, it can be a little daunting. On check-in you are provided a map, and vague directions to the lifts. The signage throughout the resort can be a little confusing, and the lifts are quite a long way from the check-in desk. Rooms are enormous and plushly decorated. It was fantastic to have two televisions, one in the living room, so I could sit and watch, and another near the bed. My package (paid by work, so not sure what the cost was) included Internet and breakfast. Had a small problem with the plumbing in my room. It was fixed in less than an hour while I popped down to the shopping mall on level 3. The only down side to such a large hotel is that everything feels a little impersonal. That's not a criticism of the hotel, but if it is something you crave -…",40
Was invited to attend a conference here and stayed here for 2 nights. The hotel is really beautiful and large. It has a large shopping complex as part of the hotel and has some wonderful restaurants to chose from (both fast food as well as more formal sit down restaurants).  The conference facilities are top notch and are run extremely professionally.   Getting to and back to the ferry was extremely easy as they have many regular free bus shuttles taking you there.  All in all a wonderful stay and would highly recommend it to people planning to stay in Macau.,50
Grand place. Gr8 Shopping mall. Not close to actual Venice but still should go one time. Neither as beautiful as Venice. But grand. Qube is very good time pass for children. Casino is ok not like las Vegas. Very nice restaurants. Good food court.,50
"My wife and I have just returned from our second trip to Hong Kong but this time we included our first visit to Macao, and we were delighted with our choice.  Where do we start with the superlatives? The ferry trip from Hong Kong (or Kowloon) is a magnificent experience, we arrived during the peak of Grand Prix activities but were courtesy coached to the Venetian with an absolute minimum of fuss. Check in was fast and pleasant. The Royal Suite we were assigned was so over the top luxurious we couldn't stop smiling at each other!  We have stayed at hotels around the world which offer half the luxury at twice the price but none come close to the oppulence of the Venetian.  Magnificent! WiFi was free as we had booked over the Net. House of Dancing Water show is an absolute MUST DO,…",50
"Huge place - took 15 minutes to walk between our room and our friends, very easy to get lost, lack of daylight and lots of shops all built around the casino hall just as in Vegas. Over the top decor and very large rooms but nothing included: no wifi etc - basically nothing to keep you in the room so you are out in the hotel spending money! Expensive even with the many deals available.  Great location for all the casinos and for the House of Dancing Water. Free transport links are excellent",40
Can't describe in world. It's a paradise in there. It has the world in it. It would take about a week to even completely to through all the places inside the hotel. The shopping centres are expensive but worth the visit. Wifi is not free at the hotel & is charged $ 165. Otherwise the hotel is AWESOME & MIST VISIT. Had a 2 night stay. Awesome casinos as well. :-),50
"My wife and I spent two nights at the Venetian Macao which was absolutely memorable. The moment we stepped in, the character of the hotel stood out. We headed straight to the Key Express counter who handled our check-in very efficiently. Our suite was on the 23rd floor which gave us a beautiful view. The suite was indeed luxurious with all amenities. The free wifi was pretty fast too. The beds were comfortable and air conditioning was efficient. Toilet design was top class and maintanance was clearly visible. The sheer size of the hotel complex  resulted in us losing our way on more than one occasion. It is a shoppers' paradise too. In the middle of the shopping centre were 3 large canals on which Gondolas went up and down.. the ride was fun. Many restaurants are available to…",50
"Let me just start by saying that this hotel is HUGE. You could fit ten football courts on the first floor itself. The hotel has some brilliant interiors. Not to forget the venice theme shopping plaza and Gandola ride, they are beautiful. Could walk on and on for hours to see no end. The Casino is largest in the world and is a gambler's dream. The Room is luxurious in every sense. Haven't come across any room as spacious as this. Service is little slow but that's okay. The hotel is way too crowded right now due to Cotai exhibition and you'll be frustrated by the sea of asian people that swarm the main lobby. Another dissapointment was that the wifi is not free and the prices are outrageous. Kind of expected it from such a reputed hotel. There is a food court in Shopping plaza and…",50
"We choose to stay only 1 night in Macau as we preferred to spend more time in Hong Kong.  We opted for the Bella Suite with Cotai View, which comes with 2 queen sized bed. Room was huge and very nicely/luxuriously decorated. In fact, not only the rooms but the whole hotel was nicely designed/built. The huge suite comes with 2 TVs, 1 is situated in the bedroom while the other is located in the living room (with sofa and a work desk equipped). Beds were very comfortable and nicely designed. Toilets are huge too, with individual shower and bathtubs equipped. Rooms also comes with free wifi .  Have no regrets paying more for Cotai View, as you can get great views when lights come out during night time.   As The Venetian is a popular hotel among tourists, the hotel offered us express…",50
"Me and my friend stayed in this hotel for 1 night for our only day at Macau.   As the resort hotel is too big, hence, thats takes some times for us to travel when we touch down from Macau Custom. The travel times by taking a cab to the hotel make us more tired but we do feel refresh when we seen our room (i.e. Bella Suite).  The room is just simply amazing and big, we assumed a room like that can fit of up to a family we suppose, but in actual thats only occupied by me and my friend, simply big and good!  Another point of stayed in The Venetian Macao is their hotel connected to a big shopping mall, of which its really drove us crazy, shop likes crazy.  Overall, if it is affordable, this is a place of must try too in Macao!",50
"Stayed in this hotel for 2 nights with wife and two kids, words cannot describe my experience, the hotel has huge rooms with 7 star like facilities. gondola ride was awesome. it has many restaurant which served lovely food. I do not gamble but was fun to try my hand at it in their huge casino. The shows that we saw there were amazing. overall a must for every person.",50
"Stayed for 3 nights with husband and two adult children in a VERY large suite. In fact everything about this hotel is gigantic.  Check in was surprisingly quick as a bus load of us arrived from Hong Kong as the same time. We had a package that included all sorts of extras- breakfast, a couple of dinners etc. Also a gondala ride. This place is an experience!",40
"My family , myself .my husband ,& two grown up children stayed in another hotel but went to venetian hotel. The hotel has everything for every age. there is casino ( not a new thing ) where they don't allow people of age  less than 21 . shopping is bit expensive as they are only world class branded shops , starbucks coffeee shop.. live opera  every half an hour,,, ( you have to spend some time there as  any window opens & in regal paraphernalia  .performers appear,,,)for small children. there are boat rides  the food court is very vast  with  beautiful background,,, we spent the whole day there... must visit,,,",50
Where do i begin! A massive property. Me and a friend of mine visited Macao for its casinos stayed at the Venetian for 3 nights. Upon arrival it took us about half an hour to just find where the reception was. upon arriving at the reception there was a huge queue awaiting us. it took us another 30 mins there. after which it took us about 20 mins to reach our room. We stayed at the Bella suite. It was opulent!  Bella Suites have two comfortable Queen-sized bed complete with pillow top mattresses fluffy duvets perfect for a relaxing and refreshing night's sleep. Since we were just two men. it was kinda wierd! anyways the room had a neat living space with very few English channels all the others were pay per view. The bathroom had no locks or something that will keep the doors shut…,50
"My eyes could not believe the sight of the extravagant and amazingly beautiful Hotel-The Venetian. We had gone for a family trip to Macau and had stayed 2 nights in the hotel. The hotel has a large number of shops for buying the best of fashion in Macau.The casino is huge space and with numerous games.There are also various Indian restaurants for Veg food. So there is no need for Indians to worry!! The gondola Ride takes u all along the hotel with a beautiful song sung by the sailor. If you visit Macau , staying at VENETIAN cannot be missed. Without staying a night at venetian ,trip to Macau is imcomplete. The rooms are also spacecious and different suites are available according to your needs with amazing views.",50
"It was a great experience staying at the Venetian... I stayed in a Bella Suite which was very spacious, had a great view. It was like a small house with everything you need, it had plush interiors and especially the pillows and the bed were amazing. the toilet and the bath were very big. The room had a nice view of the macao airfield over the sea and hard rock hotel. I have to mention the room and the toilets were spick and span and the room call service was excellent. Now coming to the hotel..it was like a small city yet magnificent...the shopping area was fantastic with almost all the international brands....the walkways the venice like market were all niceo!!The restaurants were awesome; The casino was also very big and luxurious.......now there are many things left but The…",50
"Our room was lovely, very spacious and comfortable bathroom. We had two double beds in our room as well as a living room area.  The beds were very comfortable - no trouble sleeping at all.  The view from the room was towards other hotels - it was quite nice at night time, but not much during the day time.  The area is still under development (more casinos).  You could in theory spend all your time at the Venetian, but there are free shuttles to other casinos and Macau itself.  I found all the staff to be pleasant and professional and they could all speak English, some fluently.  Word of warning - under 21s cannot get into the casino area - you need to bear this in mind if you are looking after kids.  There are swimming pools and a kid's play zone.   A couple of minor grumbles.…",40
"A night in Venetian is a dream come true! It's a palace in itself. Even though the hotel is so big, the check in was hassle free. We booked a royal suite on 12th floor and man! Was that a suite. It's just so perfect. It's got great staff, brilliant casino as all know. Also the shuttle service is great and for free. You can take one of the shuttle's to city as well for city tour for free. Overall a lifetime experience everyone should taste. There is a decent Indian restaurant in food court. If u r looking at fine dine, go to golden peacock for some exclusive Indian Cuisine. ",50
"Venetian experience was a really a good fun. Casino and Shopping area are too good. Almost all luxury brands are available there.  Rooms are very luxurious and spacious.   However, nearby hotels such as Galaxy, Dreams of World etc. have better shows for family.  Staff is very courteous and helpful.  Bathrooms are very large and well styled.",50
"If you r fond of gambling and going with wife, this is the place to stay. Once in the hotel and in shopping areas, you can slip down to casinos and she wont be bothering you for hours... Good brands to shop for. Unfortunately, we went in october and winter had set in for this part of the world and coming from india, Boss lady couldnt shop much as its anyway hot in india generally.. But this was second trip for me to Venetian Macau and its worth it...",50
"My friends and I went for a bachelors party in Macau and we decided to book the bella suite, so that we 4 could stay together.   The rooms were fantastic, but the view wasnt that great... (all we saw from the windows was the crown hotel)  We enjoyed the casino, but the location of the hotel is ok, in order to go anywhere we had to take cabs and travel at least 20 to 30 minutes.  We stayed there for 3 nights and all in all it was a great trip, but I wouldn't call it value for money",40
"We stayed in Venetian in December. Ambience was awesome. Due to Christmas ahead it was beautifully decorated. We stayed in bella suite. It   was very spacious. Canal with gondola ride and shops around was superb. Artificial sky looked natural.Food court was good. Authentic Indian food was available. Architecture of the buildings gave feeling of Venice. Light show was very good.Casino was grand.we got complimentary breakfast , one way ticket between Hongkong-Macau. overall it was a lifetime experience.",50
I visited macau on my business visit back from China to India. My main purpose was to play in the casino as otherwise there is not much to do in Macau. The hotel as any venetian property is majestic. It speaks luxury inside-out. The rooms were huge with all amenities one can ask for. I gambled in the casino all night.   Did not get a chance to take breakfast as I was playing till the wee hours in the morning.,50
"I stayed in this hotel in Dec 12'. And trust me, this is one of the best hotels in the world. Service, food, amenities, accommodation, pubs, discos, shops, spa; all were brilliant. This must be one of the best hotels in the world to stay. I strongly recommend a stay here, as a stay here is eternal bliss.",50
"Hi Friends,  I have stayed at this hotel a couple of times in the last few years. Venetian Macau is sightseeing in itself. Its what Macau has been known for, for a long time. However things are changing as many new brands have opened up recently and are giving tough competition to this hotel. I have to say that you HAVE TO STAY HERE ATLEAST ONCE. My second stay at the hotel was not so great. The pros and cons below :  Pros 1) The best base category room (suite) in Macau. Hands down. They actually don't give you a room but an apartment. Its that huge. The layout is brilliantly done. The view is mind blowing (try to get high floor) and the washrooms are also spacious and grandly done up. Despite the emergence on many new hotels my research says it still has the best room quality…",40

On entering the Western Lobby, the ceiling to ground chandeliers, the wall to wall carpets and nose to nose fragrance flabbergasted me with a disbelief that I am still on mother earth !   Luggage service attendants took our bags, Lobby girls gave the room key and Escalators put us on to our suite on 29th floor.

I enjoyed my flight from Mumbai to Hongkong in Jet. Superb!!!!  About the Hotel 1st thing I liked about the hotel was as soon I entered my South facing room. Amazing... I was just looking out from my 21st floor room for almost 15 mins. It was evening time and all hotel's glowing with light. Superb view.  2nd floor is a different world altogether. Too much true to feel you are in Venice. They have taken too much of care to make you feel the ancient city. I was walking on 2nd floor at 12 mid night. Had a feeling like it was a bright day time. The Casino is big enough to keep you busy playing for hours. Play till you get totally tired. Fun filled Casino. Over All best place to stay,50
"We stayed overnight at the Venetian during our trip to Hong Kong. Ferry ride was lack lustre, we could not see out of the windows due to either salt build up or old age. comfortable all the same and a little time to catch some needed sleep. Went through the usual customs procedures with immigration officials with the personality of a lump of coal. We visited St Paul's and the Portuguese Fort and museum on the way. All three are spectacular.  The Venetian is amazing. If you like mega structures than this is one of the biggest. The service was top class, the room was much more than adequate. I was in awe of the fit and finish of the hotel. The polished stone floors, the attention to all of the details in this building are just incredible. The third floor shopping precinct with its…",50
"Stayed at The Venetian Macao for 3 nights. It's a nice hotel, the room is big and spacious. It's conveniently located at the casino and malls. Overall I have a pretty good stay there. However, they seems to be upgrading their system now which resulted in a lot of delays. Our 'express' checkin turn out to be slower than the normal checking when the could not locate one of our bookings. I also saw a few angry people trying to checkout but apparently there is a delay caused by the system. One of the rooms my relative stayed in also has very strong smoking smell, even though the room is non smoking. The changed room , but it's still no improvement. Mine was great. Guess the hotel didn't really ensure non smoking remains strictly non smoking. So it's down to luck on who is your…",40
"Extremely huge complex and probably one of the largest Casino's in Macao. Nice and spacious suite! A lot of entertainment facilities within the complex. For all golfers: a nice mini golf course on the roof, built like greens on an authentic golf course.",40
"We've stayed for a week at the Venetian with our 6 year old daughter. And again we were blown away by their Service. Everything was over the top: the very generous room size, the amenities, the facilities (especially the pool Level) and of course the treats for our daughter.  Food and Service outstanding. Don' miss the lunch buffet - the room is quite small but very comfortable and relaxed seating. Lunch selection is very nice. We'll be back!",50
"Loved our suite!  I think it's the smallest or least grand, but wow! The hotel itself is so huge, I get tired of walking!  You need a map to navigate the hotel and the shopping area;).  They have a really big food court on the 3rd floor. The casino reeks of smoke, and you can smell it in the lobby.  Service is ok.  And we were there on a Chinese Holiday (independence day, I think), so one room cost us an arm and a leg- over twice their usual rate had we gone on a regular weekday.",40
"My family and I loved our stay at this hotel.  The service was excellent, the rooms was spacious and opulent and the casino was great fun.  As well, there was a plethora of shops and restaurants – it was impossible to get around the whole place in the two days we had here.  If you are taking the ferry from Hong Kong, get the Cotai Jet to the Taipa Ferry Terminal and there are continuous free buses to the hotel from there (literally, one would drive out and another would drive in).  Also, if you are leaving from Hong Kong Airport (or arriving from) you can get a ferry directly from the skypier without having to complete immigration formalities for Hong Kong.  One of the nicest hotels I have ever seen/stayed in and definitely recommended!",50
"I have been staying in so many hotels in the world.  In fact I have worked in a 5-6 stars hotel as an Executive Secretary for few years in my working career but staying at The Venetians was a real treat.  Hearing so much from my friends about The Venetians, I decided to take my family there to have a taste of The real Venetians.    We spent 2 nights/3 days in this huge and grand hotel.  You can easily get lost due to the crowd.  It has 3000 rooms, North wings, south wings & west wings.  Every bedroom is a suite, huge, almost 700 sq. feet like a medium size apartment in Hong Kong and Tokyo.  Food court has great variety of different restaurants catered for different nationality, it's a bit pricey, but you can find everything under one roof.  After all it's a resort...  Everything…",50
"GRAND. KINGSIZE. ROYAL. PERECT. These expressions apply to every corner, every facility and each thing related to Venetian. Stayed there for 2 nights ( my bad luck as i wasted 3 in hongkong) and the experience is deeply embedded in my memories forever. Things and processes are so perfect that i just cannot detail the how deeply they must have thought of the guest mentality before designing this place. I stayed in the royal suite and this was a suite in the true form.Huge bath area with big bedroom and large sitting area. Felt like a king when i entered at first. Every amenity i needed was there in my room and didnt feel the need to call any hotel services for anything in my 2 day visit. Services are so automated and timely that it is hard to believe how do they manage this big a…",50
"When two of us  (I along with one of my friends) entered the place, we expected the spectacular as we have heard all the years. We were in no way disappointed. We spent the first few hours in understanding the MAP of the hotel and how to navigate through it. It took a while but then we were ready to plunge into trying our Luck at Casinos............We realized soon that betting minimum of 300 HKDs on various Tales of Balckjack, Sicbo, Baccarat (heard for the first time), Roulette is going to be no mean task for feeble hearted like we were. So We spent the Time at Bellini Lonunge - WHAT A LOVELY PLACE IT IS - with live band and huge HD screen as its back drop. The hotel is a great vacation spot for everybody",50
"On the way to Australia we decided to stop over in Macau for a few days and we chose to stay at the Venetian based on our previous experience in Las Vegas. Almost a ""cut and paste"" from Vegas. We enjoyed our stay very much. The room we received was huge and the facilities in the hotel are of excellent quality. They provide transportation service all over Macau.Two issues that we came across: The level of English of many of the staff is not satisfactory to provide an adequate response to your needs. Secondly, during certain parts of the day the hotel is overcrowded.",50
"At Venetian everything you look at is grand.. be it the central hall.. be it entrance hall.. be it the room.. be it the casino.. Vast shopping area.. Every kind of food from western to asian.. everything contributed well for the perfect staying experience.  Rume is huge.. same is the bed and TV area, even a first timer like me was completely occupied at the Casino.  Worth in every sense staying at this place.",50
"One of the best hotel we have ever stayed. Somehow got upgraded to Presidential Suits. Vow six TVs, best of furnishing and furniture, three huge rooms poster bed and what have you. Even bath room had Jacuzzi and automatic WC. Hotel is a real resort. Developed around Venice theme, it has three canals, with gondola floating around. There are more than 600 shops around canals and nice restaurants. Hotel has large number of well appointed restaurants and bars. Breakfast was indeed great. Staff was very friendly and service prompt. We strongly recommend this property. Even casinos are thriving with players and catering to all and sundry.",50
"Tourists whom we met at Hong Kong during our site seeing recommended this Hotel and back at our Hotel a review on the trip advisor was more positive, in addition the tour itineraries at Macau included this Hotel as one of the site seeing places. Therefore, we decided to stay here. Tariff was over budget, but after walking into the Hotel, every step into the Hotel justified the cost. Checking was fast, transfer of luggage to the room was also fast. The suite was very nice, well planned, the interior was mild and peaceful, and on the whole the room was in its totality. After getting freshed up, we wanted to have some bite before strolling around the Hotel. As usual being vegetarian, our search for the food does take long, it was short lived as there was Peacock Indian restaurant…",50
"Rooms were a little tired. but we were upgraded to a huge suite, had a view of a construction site but no big issue, the shopping is fantastic and the various performers about the place add to the experience. customer service in the food court is absolutely shocking.",40
"The Venetian Hotel situated at the Cotai strip in Macau is certainly one of the crown jewels in the ever growing grandeur of the vibrant and luxurious country that is Macau. It is a huge building towering above the rest, reflecting luxury and richness from the very moment one puts ones eyes on it. more than a hotel it a a holiday on its own. as it claims, it is the largest hotel in Asia and claims to have the largest casino in the world. the building comes with its very own high end shopping mall with venice-like canals with gondolas. there are arrays of restaurants covering every cuisine known to man. things are to be seen to be believed. however, once you reach your room reality check begins. each room in a suit with a bedroom and a sitting area. however, the rooms are not as…",40
"Stayed 1 night at this hotel and it was at least the 4th or 5th time staying here. Their free shuttle service was efficient and we didn't have to wait for long. The hotel was still very busy with all areas well kept and maintained. Although there was a queue at check-in counter, we waited for just about 20 minutes and managed to get a room at 1 p.m. on a Monday. The all-suite room was very spacious, comfortable and clean. Pity WiFi had to be paid for (unless you book directly through the hotel's website), unlike Galaxy where you could enjoy at least 20 minutes of free WiFi. The TV had one of the widest selection of international channels which include AXN, BBC, CNN, CCTV, Fox, Phoenix, NHK, DW-TV, ESPN, TV5 Monde, Australian, Aljazeera, Korean, Indian, Italian, Spanish,…",40
Venetian was a lifetime experience.. it is like a mini city with everything under one roof. Staff was extremely polite and helpful. Wide variety of food and entertainment options including Casino.. well connected with all properties/ spots in Macau with free shuttle service. Stay here and you will not regret it.,50
"It would be difficult to describe this property is few words. It is massive,impressive,larger than life, beautiful,artistic,luxurious. The entire property can be looked as a self sustaining and ever growing city. It houses Hotel, Mall with super rich brands,international restaurants, entertainment and over and above worlds biggest casino. The Mall area has an internal canal and you like you can have a gondola ride in this canal in a la-venice style.   The hotel has suites which are very spacious and appointed with all luxuries. The Bath area in the suite is royal!!  By the way , if you have been to Dubai Mall and Madinat Jumeriah in Dubai or the Vilaggio in Doha you may not be surprised with what you see.",50
"We booked early and had a 30% off. However, my advice is to wait for the specials that come out every quarter - which will include jetfoil etc. Anyway, we have stayed at the Las Vegas Venetian and knew what to expect. It is huge and impersonal. I have stayed in suites of 5 star hotel before and the service would have been fabulous. Here in Venetian, it was so so service. I think because of its large size, there have not been able to make it a personal experience. We went there to celebrate our anniversary but there was nothing to celebrate by the hotel. We did enjoy the Nepresso machine everyday - lovely coffee to start the day. Although a one way limosine was provided for booking this suite, it was not communicated to us clearly and we used it when we leave. We took the…",40
"It's not a hotel.. It's a city!! From the grand entrance and spectacular ceiling in the lobby, one cant but be impressed. You can walk for hours in the hotel surrounded by shops that will tempt $$ from your wallet and food to satisfy your every taste. There is a waterway in the hotel where you can have gondola rides, just like Venice! The hotel room was the size of a small apartment with a separate split level lounge area. The writing desk even had a printer/fax m/c and free wi-fi. Hotel buses will transport you to/from ferry terminal at no cost. My wife & I had a most enjoyable stay there.",50
"Stayed 1 night w/ friends at Bella Suite room.  The hotel is so huge that one has to remember the landmarks so you'll know your way back to your room.  We took the B&B and chose Fogo Samba instead at Café Deco for the buffet breakfast.  We tried both restos and I'd say, I like Café Deco much better.  They have good pizza and back ribs. I enjoyed the shopping while there, its duty free, you know.  I wish I still have the budget, I like to go back in time for the Pacquiao-Rios duel and see how Pacquiao floors Rios nyaahahaha.",50
the first thing u say as u enter the hotel is WOW. its huge and what a lovely decoration and presentation. actually its one of the best hotels in the world. the rooms are huge and the toilets are even bigger. huge shopping mall with good food court which has lot of varieties. if u r staying here u should actually eat in its food court. they have created a small venice inside the hotel and one must take the gondola ride as its gr8 fun. they have 4 different pools according to your need. so make sure u stay in venetian to have the best experience,50
"I did not stay at The Venetian,Macau.The only reason being that my wife and I had already booked in to a hotel in Hong Kong.But we definitely wanted to visit this 'exotic' place.We took the jetfoil to Macau and went to The Venetian.It was much bigger than I had imagined.From the time we entered the reception area,to the shopping arcade and the casino the experience was breath-taking.Our first priority was the casino so we did not spend much time in the arcade.I got lucky on the slot machines and made a few bucks.But then I am not really a gambler.We then decided to explore.Actually words cannot do justice to the description.The shops were of course rather high end and beyond my budget but window shopping was fun.The artificially created sky visual was very interesting and looked…",50
"First time i was here was with family and the hotel was just newly opened then. It was so awesome that i keep coming back. And everytime is just like the first time. I'm still amazed with the hotel suites, service, facilities, shopping and a whole lot more! It's been years but it still looks new. So many hotels has been opened but Venetian Macau is still my favorite.",50
"If you are not into gambling like me, you will still enjoy this place. It offers numerous of shops if you like shopping or window shopping. The hotel lobby is pretty nice. Its Venetian inspired thats why it's called Venusian hotel. You can also enjoy the gondola while a crew will sing love songs. Walking around the hotel will take more than an hour. If ever you get hungry, there is a good Court as well around the canal. There are also different varieties of restaurants. No need to Stay in this hotel if you think its pricey. You can enjoy the place even if you're not a guest. ",40
"Amazing hotel, amazing location, amazing building, amazing shopping, amazing dining. You literally do not have to leave the hotel to have a good time in Macao. If you are male be careful of the prostitute touts, they hang about the front doors, and can be very aggressive in following you even into the hotel lobby - the staff don't seem to do anything about it. There is a shuttle to parts of Macau, and the staff are very helpful.",50
"Nearer place to have a Vegas-like experience. This place is really huge and well lit/decorated. Aside from the casino, there are lots of shoppes here. Try to enjoy the night by riding free shuttle services around the casino areas to hop in other places around.",50
"Its truly amazing Property, Its not a hotel, its a city. You name it they have it... Plenty of shops down in the Hotel, Mini Golf and other amenities, Including children play area. Huge Casino is highlight of this Hotel. We got lost many times in the Hotel due to its enormous size. Neighbor Hotels give beauty to this hotel, like City of Dreams, What a view you will have from east entrance. You can click many pics there, We saw many newly wedded couple making photo shoot there for there wedding collection. They got free shuttle bus service all over macau which is amazing thing and never seen anywhere I visited so far, this service can be availed by anyone who intends to visit the hotel. Minimum two to three nights required to enjoy this property. Go for Royal Suite and Plus...you…",50
"-very convenient as shopping is just below. -very big rooms with big beds. Has a dining table, a sofa, 2 beds and a very big bathroom -checking in took too long -loved the express checkout though -free shuttle to and from the ferry terminal",50
"The Venetian is very huge with the in-house casino and shopping areas. Room (north wing suites) is really spacious with two double beds, living room area and big bathroom. The room is also very clean and the decor is very homely & nice.  However, it would be troublesome for people under age 21 to get around the hotel without taking the short cut through the casino area.  There are alot of eating options at the Venetian too, with a food court and multiple restaurants.  to get to the Venetian, there is the complimentary bus service from the ferry terminal or Macau airport. The frequency of the service is fast so waiting time is short, no worries.  However, it was hard to get directions for the complimentary bus to the senado square area. The conceirge lady directed me to the wrong…",40
"Better than the west, sorry americans, i love the venetian hotel macau, you can stay in this hotel all you want, you will never ever get tired, the crowd is awesome, the food is great, and most of all, the chinese are gamblers, all walks of life, this is filled with gamblers, the best part is, they are gamblers with happy faces, makes your stay in this hotel all the more worth it.",50
"I stayed 1 night here. I like it so much, the room was big enough and the bed was very comfy. I stayed at the bella suite. But i don't like the access where we had to enter the casino to enter the lift, because my brother was not 21 yet, and we had to circle the venetian mall to enter the lift access. The pool was very nice, it had 4 kinds of pool. The beste xperience on a casino hotel, and i love that it was in the cotai strip, so if you want to buy anything, just down at the mall. Overall best hotel! ",50
"We stayed at the Venetian Macau with family beginning of October.  This was the perfect spot for entertaining visitors who have never been to Macau and will probably never be there again.  This hotel is HUGE!  Over the top!  And very very Macau.  I wouldn't stay for a romantic getaway but to give a visitor a glimpse of the real Macau, this is the best spot to splurge.",50
"I had stayed at the Venetian alongwith a group last year. Though i must admit that the Hotel is amazing with it's grand Lobby, Casino & Spacious rooms, the downside was that the check-in process needs to be more streamlined and decent. First of all there is a huge crowd waiting for their Keys at both Lobbies and it gets very tough to have a smooth check-in. The Hotel can arrange for more staff to man their Counters and also work on a larger area to accommmdate all the waiting guests. The staff at the Counters are over worked and at times are unable to give you the correct information for your queries. Apart from the check-in, the other aspects of this Hotel are great and unforgettable like the Room Quality and Dining. We had a lavish Breakfast spread for our Group and we…",40
I loved the Venetian in Macao... If you are going Macao to gamble thn this is the hotel for you...They have the largest and nicest casino there... Extremely crowded...rooms and bathrooms were really nice and well maintained ....Location was good but didn't matter much as they had a big mall connected to it and had everything and they have a bridge that connects you to few other hotels and malls.... Overall I had a gr8 stay..would definitely go back there...,50
"Stayed here for 4 nights with my husband and 3-year-old son. Checking in and out was a breeze. Customer service was top-notch (free buses from ferry terminal, airport, free 24-hour baggage service etc) but that's because they want to get you in to the casino of course. Everything in the hotel, from house-keeping to reception to concierge to bus services, ran like clockwork, which was amazing considering how HUGE the hotel was and how many guests they would have to service each day.   Our room in the South wing (facing golf course and airport) was clean, well-maintained, large and luxurious as mentioned in other reviews. Sleep quality was excellent as the room was very quiet and had blackout curtains. However the air-conditioning unit did get noisy at times, and the pillows were…",50
"this hotel is being built similar to the one in Vegas, but even bigger, the Casinois huge and full of strange gambling games, rooms are huge and clean but not expensive at all, maybe the casino sponsors it a bit shops and restaurant could be seen all around, actually you don't need to leave the hotel for a whole week and will not be boring, recommend it!",50
I stayed here with my husband. The hotel is huge!!! The rooms were huge!!! Everything is on a huge scale!!! The room was very nice and well maintained and clean. The pool was very nice too. Because the hotel was so big it almost felt like we were in an airport at times. The casino had a very serious vibe. We enjoyed our stay but don't think we'd go back.,40
"This place spares no expense.   Have it all....all inside the Venetian.   Upon arrival at Macao airport, we had a Bus Limo waiting for us outside.  In we went, off to the VIP check in.     The room was Massive by anyone's standards.  I had a full 2000 square foot palace.    Live plants in the room, dining table and room for 6 people, Bed fit for a Royal Court and a Bathroom people only see in those Hollywood home TV shows.   Everything I touched seemed to be gold plated.    The Casino is really nice and a bit more secure than the ones in Las Vegas.  No Cameras, Phones, Etc allowed.    Just have to watch your chips when walking through or playing.  The layout is great.  Casino inst as big as I would think but its certainly magnificent. Restaurant, Shows, entertainment all first…",50
"This is amongst the top few 5 star luxury hotels here in Macao and justifies every reason why it deserves to be 5 star. Great location and well placed amongst other hotels. The rooms were very spacious and comfortable. We were staying in the South section of the hotel ( they have south and north hotel suites ) and there was not much of a view, but with so many things to do inside the hotel, we didnt really get much chance to peep outside the window. Definitely worth the stay here.  ",50
"This hotel is amazing, I read other reviews after I booked and had second thoughts but once I got there it was fantastic. We arrived about lunchtime, straight to check in which was all done within 15 mins. They gave us a map which was very helpful, like probably 90% of other people we went through the casino but honestly you didn't have to. Room was stunning apart from one small issue, when you went to the toilet it smelt like cigarettes, guess this was coming through the vent as we had a non smoking room.  You could spend days in there just looking at the shops and eating, which of course isn't a bad thing... I can highly recommend this hotel",50
"We booked this hotel from the website and managed to get low rates for this suite. Plus, we got an invitation of Key Express (Express check in / early check in). Luckily we came to the Venetian at 11 in the morning and straight away checked into the hotel. We received complimentary vouchers from the hotel such as free welcome photo, free welcome drinks & a few discount vouchers. It was really fun. The hotel room was perfect. Spacious, clean and the view was magnificent (Royale Suite with Cotai Strip View). We spent our weekend shopping in The Venetian Grand Canal Shoppes, which is the largest duty free shopping range in Macau. They even have free shuttle from the hotel to Taipa Ferry Terminal. Will definitely stay here again.",50
"We booked a 3 night stay. Arrived at 9pm the checkin was easy trying to find the room was hopeless you had to walk through the casino and all the smoke. We decided to take our bags with us as we knew we would not see them for hours. Booked a smoke free room the room we got was full of ashtrays and stank ok smoke. They did upgrade and move us to a suite. The room was huge as was the bathroom if a little tired. We ordered ice it took 1/2 hour to get here. We thought we would enjoy staying in a large hotel, forgetting that with so many guests and visitors the service would be poor. The shopping and the canals are awesome and well worth a visit. It's just  a very busy place. I am glad we stayed but we won't be back.",50
"The best venue for big conferences, it has a huge casino floor with people pouring in 24/7,has all variety of restaurants including an Indian one. On the 3rd floor, they have created venice with canals and small boats, has around 600 shopping outlets surrounding them. The rooms are quite large and comfortable, overall its a great experience.",50
The hotel and room obviously is like a palace. The room I stayed was a Suite type. The bathroom size was huge though the toilet is tucked away in a small enclosure. We had to actually toil to reach our rooms after every outing as you have to walk a lot with a map in hand to find your room. It's specially difficult if you have kids as you cannot cut across through the casino. So we got lost and walked a lot and got frustrated to the level of asking the concierge to give us 4 wheel chairs and help us back to rooms. They provided a guide. The artificial sky is nice and the Gondola ride is also nice. We were staying on a all meal plan and the food at the buffets were mind-blowing. The rooms had great view of Galaxy. The shuttle was enough to go around Macau though we did take a open…,40
A giant hotel. Great to stay. A beautiful market with wonderful man made sceneries. Had a great time in casino. A person can really enjoy a night stay and he dont need to go out to see anything beyond Venetian Hotel. Great service too. Had a great stay.,50
"This is was my second stay in Venetian. Again the management, cleanliness, facilities and casino are awesome. But it has now become crowded and centre of tourist walks. you would always feel like you are staying in some carnival if you step down in the loby from your room. this time around there were many options which are equally better and even better than the venetian. Galaxy and city of dreams were amazing hotels, even wynn and MGM grand are also good value for money and equally good. the buffet breakfast was a bit let down this time with lil options for every category and almost the same menu everyday.the restaurant fogo sama is still the best in shopping area on first floor.",40
I was a bit pessimistic about staying here. I was expecting crowds and a non-relaxed atmosphere. However I was pleasantly surprised.  Check-in can be a bit overwhelming given the scale of the hotel. It is confusing and can be frustrating just to find your room. The rooms are pretty nice. Nothing super great buy everything we needed traveling with our 2 and 6 year old boys. Did I mention a typhoon hit on day two of our four day stay. Days two and three the pool was closed and some activities cancelled. Staff was great about it. We did go to the pool the first day and it was a blast. My six year old was entertained for hours by the slide. Indoor kidz land is awesome but best to go when it opens. It did not get crowded until one. Even with the typhoon we had a fun time. All of the…,50
"Simply big premises.The hotel seemed to be full of Indians. There is some connection I guess because of Bollywood award nights happening here. Rooms were pretty big. The room facilities were awesome.  However, it is too big that possible that you forget which way to go. The Expo center is too big and you end up walking half a kilometer to reach one side to another.   The venice like tunnels are very nice to see and all the shops around are also nice though expansive. I have been to venice but Ventian has good feel of actual Macau.  Nice hotel to stay for a night or two if good deal available.",40
very beautiful property. very large scale. 600 plus shops and canal is awesome and casino is mind blowing. very nice decorative rooms. very very beautiful experience with nice food and service. courties staff..,50
"The  hotel experience was overall wonderful. its located in the heart of the city, very very GOOD to the main shopping centre. very close to the harbour. The haorbour view rooms were excellent. the best part about the hotel is the roof top swimming pool and gymnasium. Great harbour view, one of the best breakfast experiences in any intercontinental and clean rooms with fast internet. they also have a good business center and great work station in your room. Royal and beautiful rooms",50
"The casino and the resort was amazing but the most amazing thing was the transport system I actually left my passport on the bus to the Venetian and didn't notice for bout 2 hours, I was a bit drunk, and went straight to the concierge who was ringing people all the time just trying to find my passport the transport service was tracking every bus down until eventually they found my passport they was a dream I would have been screwed",50
"I stayed at the hotel for 3 nights and there was little if anything to complain of. Having previously visited Las Vegas, I didn't really expect much to be the same, except the name, but it really was almost identical. The staff were excellent across the board and the rooms were simply straight from LV, large and comfortable. The bathrooms were luxuriously fitted out and stocked with quality toiletries. Room Service menu was very reasonably priced as was the mini bar. and our order was delivered well within the time that was quoted. The only thing I would say that sometimes caused problems getting around the hotel, is that they appear to run some sort of walk around tour. Very often we came across groups of 20 or more Chinese people being led around by guides carrying flags.. It…",50

"Everything you read about the size of this hotel is totally true and you won't totally understand it until you see it with your own eyes!  I'm going to write a few things down that might be helpful to other families travelling there.  We are a family of 4, (2 adults and 2 teens).  Being an Asian country we thought the food/clothes etc would be quite cheap once we got there, but we were very wrong about this.  We did realise we were staying in a 5 star casino so we were totally oblivious to the fact that things would be more expensive than usual, but we found everything here expensive really.  So here's a tip, if you don't want to spend a fortune on breakfast for the family then pack some boxes of cereal in your suitcase, we did this mainly because that's what we like having for…",50
"Taking the complimentary shuttle to the property was a breeze and it was quite a sight to witness the vast space they have dedicated for the main porte cochere. Check in counter was easy to locate and the agents worked extremely quick to ensure that no time was wasted to get you allocated to your room. Unlike typical hotels, this property housed thousands of rooms, hence your key packet and room number would display 5 digits instead of your usual 4.  The room was nothing short of marvelous and well designed to make you feel a little like royalty. The design concept was a contrast to its now popular sister property MBS. Macau is a small place so getting around is not an issue for any. Just seek out the Concierge for assistance to get around town. The shopping centre linked to the…",40
"the hotel is a city in itself. bustling with crowds day n night. stunning cotai strip view. casinos, restaurants, bars all absolutely superb. paradise for shopaholics. suited for all family/honeymoon/grp of friends. lunch at golden peacock restaurant was nice as well. i would recommend one n all.",50
"A short distance from the airport... when you are approaching the resort,the first thing that hits you is the sheer size of this place. The interiors are breathtakingly grand... ""Gilded Grand"". Check in is lightening fast and when you reach your suite... you can't but compare it with your modest (in my case) 2 room apartment on both size and luxury. The casino has a palpable buzz at all hours of the day and offers gamblers of all levels something to indulge in. Free wifi keeps you well connected back home and the many restaurants and large food court gives you all the options you would want. The downside hits you the second day when you are hungrily waiting for room service to appear and then taking a full day to clear the dishes. While housekeeping takes 10mins to respond,any…",40
Stayed at this hotel again in a matter of 5 months. This place is huge and the casino is buzzing at all times. I decided to take my morning walk in the shopping area and I literally got lost. The casino tables are crowded at all times of the day. I played black jack at 8 am on a week day and the tables were quite busy. This place will never cease to amaze.,50
"a fantastic hotel with a large casino and multiple eateries, it is perfect for a family vacation.  best part of the hotel is the shopping/food court floor which also has a lake that allows gondola ride. breakfast at cafe deco was a delight!",40
"We had the privilege to spend 2 nights at The Venetian in Macau and it was such a memorable experience. The rooms are really big and elegant... with your own living room, 2 TVs, huge bathrooms and all that. In fact, we felt that the rooms were too big! We particularly love their comfortable bed and we had such a nice slumber.  Some nitpicking though -- no free internet! For the price of their rooms, one would expect free internet right?   I hope to be able to stay in this hotel again.",50
"Stayed 2 nights at this beautiful hotel suite. Its a huge hotel and you can easily loose your way even if you can read the signs.  Would be good to take note of ""landmarks"" when you move around.  The hotel provides shuttles to most places around Macau which is so cool. You can also purchase a half day tour package of Macau or a trip to Hong Kong at a travel office near the convention rooms. You can walk across the road to City of Dreams and you can take a beautiful photo of Venetian esp. at night. Enjoyed my stay and visit to Macau.",40
"Absolutely fantastic hotel. You can easily get lost in the hotel... its huge huge hotel....it has its own fleet of buses which take you around Macau city, to other hotels on the Cotai strip, to the China border, ferry terminal  for FREE. Very very efficient service in the hotel. Big lavish rooms with great decor and views. We got a complimentary  lunch at the Indian restaurant Golden Peacock...very good food. And the casinos are buzzing with people 24/7.",50
"Just have one day trip in Macau.  Free port pick up as same as other resorts.  As we were invited for the new key express check in, the whole process of check in and check out is so fast.  Actually we were shocked when we entered the hobby -- it's just so amazing. Everyone probably has seen those on the pictures but the real ones are more incredible.   Drawback -- the resort is huge and we have to walk a long way, passing through the gambling area to lift to our room.   The room is large and luxury -- even the cutlery with our honey moon cakes is in luxury brand. The bed is so comfortable and separate showerbox and bath is convenient.  Drawback -- there is no direct free bus from the resort to Ruins of St. Paul's so we have to go to City of Dreams to get the free bus.  The grand…",50
"Stayed 4 nights, this place is an exact copy of the Hotel in Vegas only it's 3 times bigger. As someone else said its a factory, all very efficient but a little impersonal. I lost £200 In the casino which shows its like all casinos , you lose. There are a number of different Chinese gambling games in addition to the casino classics like Roulette. One thing that really irritated me was we travelled as a Group and for a laugh went for a game of putting , 8 of us , I paid 50 dollars each £5 or so for an hour. We came off having completed 9 of 18 holes, 10 minutes over the hour, as a result I got charged an overtime charge of HK$400 , when I said you must be joking (we were the only people playing) the young Chinese lady impassively reiterated that it was overtime. This is afterall…",50
"Venetian is everything that a upper middle class holiday seeker would want in a hotel, maybe even more. It is definitely a hotel for someone who does like walking as the place is huge. All suite hotel with lavish rooms, great decor and good food court. The hotel looks like a city and all major brands are available. Gondola rides. spa, kids play areas, health club all are good. Casino off course is an attraction. However in case u are looking for a welcome, some warmth, some personalisation, some extra care etc associates with good five star hotels, u will be severely disappointed. It's like going in a factory where they just have rules and depending on where u want to go u just need to follow them. For them u are just one person in a huge line. Overall good for a two day vacation",40
"Reading through all the Venetian reviews, the check in time and size of hotel seems to be an issue, but it certainly wasn't for us. Our bags were whisked away from us as we got off the complimentary shuttle from the HK ferry, and then tags given to us. It took us 5 mins to check in (at 1.30pm even though we really shouldn't have been able to until 3pm) and we were told we didn't need to wait for our bags, but that they would be in the room in 30 mins. It was less than that in the end. The hotel also sent us some muffins and fruit as we were celebrating our anniversary which was a lovely touch.   As for people saying the hotel is too big, well don't stay in one of the world's biggest hotel's then! To us, it didn't feel bigger or harder to navigate than Vegas, and as we have been…",50
"I have stayed at venetian 2 times...but I alway forgot to share my review here at tripadvisor. '.' Now I start to share, the lobby was huge,but the check in time still took a long time even there are lots of  receptionist to serve for. We bring all of our stuffs by our self,because we don't want to queue the bell boy to deliver our stuff to our room. The room was soo big and cozy...clean and so comfortable...the bath room also big, with separated bath tub and shower. There are lots of shops and restaurant inside the venetian macao. Eating at macao more expensive than hong kong. At the back lobby,there are lots free shuttle bus provide by venetian macao . Overall I will come back to venetian macao when I go holiday to macao.",40
the hotel is huge one will take at lest 3 to 4 hrs to undestand every thing.the room was very nice and spacious.we enjoyed their gondola ride very much.the place where they have their market and food stall is worth millions. it appears on the top that their is actual sky but it is artificial .superb decoration.the buffett breakfast was also very good with limited choice for veggies.the the casino was very big with lot of different games,50
"A Chinese ""copy"" of the original Venice, Only more sanitized and more polish!! Booked through the hotel website and got a good deal with a MOP 200 voucher per day thrown in.  Top Marks to the hotel for  1) The largest rooms I have ever seen 2) The largest bathrooms ever, almost the size of a small hotel room.  3) Incredibly good housekeeping. Well maintained common areas and rooms 4) Top quality dining in Portofino and Golden Peacock! The food at Golden Peacock is truly fine Indian dining, and surpasses the best found in India. Chef Justin Paul is an artist, who explores more than the run of the mill north Indian flavours. Star of the show in his menu was the Green Mango Soup from Maharashtra, and Marwari Ghevar with spiced cherries. The waitstaff compete to offer gracious…",40
"The Venetian is such a huge place and we were pleasantly comfortable with the accommodations. The food that went with the package was extremely delicious especially with so much restaurant choices. They even have a fast food area in the complex. Whether alone, a couple, a family, or a couple of friends, no doubt you will enjoy the stay...and so man freebies!!!",50
"I recently stayed with a small group of girls to celebrate a birthday. It's so easy to get to the hotel from the ferry terminal with their shuttle service running from 9.30 am to midnight. We were given an upgrade to a suite which was very generous.   The room was very comfortable, with 2 queen beds and a living area. As soon as we arrived into our room, room service were behind us with additional robes, slippers and amenities. Very 5 star. However, when we phoned room service a few times, they were very slow (perhaps due to the enormous size of the hotel) and they did not understand our requests. I asked for 4 champagne glasses, 1 turned up 34 minutes after ordering. And I asked for an audio cord to connect my phone to the t.v; two men turned up with a tool box to fix the tv!…",40
the hotel is centrally located in Taipa island ... i dont think i can express my stay at this massive hotel (u need to see to believe) which needs around two days to see the whole of Venetian... we had stayed in royale suite which was the basic room as per their criteria but can only say that this basic category is far and much better than the 5 star category hotels basic rooms... anyone visiting Macao should book a stay for atleast one night to experience this property.....getting to the hotel from ferry terminal is not at all  a prob as they have free shuttle...100% recommended,50
"The Venetian Macao is a luxury hotel and casino resort in Macau. It is  1 hour ferry ride from Hongkong. The hotel is approx 40 storey & the rooms are very good & spacious. It has the largest casino in the world, and the largest single structure hotel building in Asia. There are many restaurants which have all types of foods. The famous artificial Sky ceiling in The Venetian Macau Resort & Hotel, looks like sky and will change through time. It is so amazing that you will not feel to leave the place.",50
"i arrived at this hotel with my boyfriend and i am super amazed and super stunned with the hotel interiors. i am very excited to roam around the hotel that i can't wait for tomorrow!! i mean OHMYGOD! This whole property is sooooooo huge, the experience is priceless and the rooms are  very comfy. Would definitely stay here again..",50
"A 5-10mins drive from the Macao Intl Airport, located in the most luxurious venue ""The Las Vegas of Asia"". The hotel is magnificent! Esplendido! It's like bringing Venice closer to home (Asia). All are suites & massively huge. I had the great view of Galaxy Hotel from my window.  If your looking for luxury vacation you have to stay here everything packed in one. Shopping, casino, leisure, cuisine or just lazing out for a sip of coffee you will experience the Venetian style whilst gazing the stars from above...a venetian designed ceilings that will amaze everyone's heart.   A ride to the gondola whilst they sing enchantingly.   Reserve a lot of energy because the hotel is massively huge so long walking is advised.",40
"""Oh My God!!!"" was my reaction when we entered the hotel. This hotel is so huge that we need the hotel map to roam around otherwise one can get lost. Our room was huge and superb & also had the garden. The third level of the hotel was filled with number of branded shops & restaurants. The best part was the GONDOLA ride. That was an amazing experience. This is the best hotel in Macau.",50
"There isn't much to do in Macau if you don't love hotels, and this one beats the rest. The property, to start off, is absolutely huge and it takes ages to get from one part of the hotel to another. Once you get used to it, though, it can be oddly homely too. The casino is fantastic and the restaurants serve the finest cuisine and the best wines. The top floors are shoppers' paradise. The typically venetian gondola rides inside the hotel and the sky painted on the ceilings are breath-taking and super fun.  All the rooms are really big and spacious too!  The only problem with the hotel is that the staff isn't very well versed with English.",40
"The hotel is huge, massive casino, Large  rooms Grandeur beyond imagination  Lot of options from entertainment huge shopping mall, sports, children activities.  We stated here for two nights . The hotel is very large so you have to plan everything , distances from places is a lot. So go only if you want to see Venice in Macau at a scale bigger than the real Venice.",40
It is nice property with easy access to shops. Beautifully decorated specially the lobby. We stayed for three nights and we really enjoyed it. The kids liked the kids clubs and the private garden. The hotel is so big that moving from one place to another place can be tiring specillay with kids and luggages.,40
"Travelling with a small group of colleagues for a quick getaway to Macau & Hongkong, we reached Macau by ferry from the Hongkong International Airport. The Venetian impressed us immediately with its opulence and size. Though we stayed there only for a day, we really didn't have to step out of the resort. The shopping, food and the activities were superb and the casino really magnificent. Would love to go back there as soon as possible with my wife.",50
"The hotel, casino, rooms are grand. Lot of options from entertainment, sports, children activities etc. stated here for two nights and realised they are less. the resort offers variety of finning options aswell. will go back and stay for long. ",50
It is amazing place to stay but its huge . the best in macau. The casino is the best. The childrwn activities is best. In short the complete resort with many swiming pools. Rooms are like palacian room. Very specious. Bathroom are amazing.  If u go to macau and not stay at venetian yout trip is incomplete.,50
"Excellent property and one of the tallest hotel I ever stayed (38 floors). Very well managed and maintained, true value for money, highly recommended, would like to repeat stay if ever visit Macau again.",50
Excellent property.  Very well managed check in and check out services.  Room service prompt. Casino facilities - the best.  Rooms - amazing.  Bathrooms - out of the world.  All in all a wonderful experience and one which I would love to repeat.,50
"Thinking of Macau, the one hotel that comes to my mind is The Venetian Macau, simply for its grand name and services, and it was the way i ever thought about it. The rooms were big enough with all modern amenities and comfort and the resort was having all luxury comforts that one can think of including a shopping mall, and a huge casino. The rooms are quite far from the reception though but thats ok.",40
"It was ab absolute pleasure to enjoy the sevices of Venetian @ Macau during my stay there. I was visiting Macau to attend a business event, and the entire event was also planned in the galal ball room of venetian. The rooms, service, staff every one was fantastic and the hotel is a small town itself.   I would say it is must for anyone to visit Venetian, if they visit Macau.",50
"The venetian resort hotel macao is the best hotel ever in town, with high class standart, classic yet elegance we will never regret a moment when we choose this hotel.  I will surely come again next time .... Unforgettable moment staying here.",50
"u can enjoy all the luxurious things in here! branded stores, famous restaurants, casino, bars are all just right in front your eyes waiting for you to  give a try! get prepared to be amazed with the whole decorations, great entertainment shows, marvelous view all in this venetian hotel. hope holiday will never ends by the time you get here",50
"Its a hotel which keeps on receiving guests i.e. check-in & check-out is on 24hours.The casino area is mindblowing & it offers a complimentary pick-up and drop-off service which is very helpful over & above all this,room service is the best part of this hotel. Full 5 Star",50
Here is the world class hotel in Macau. I visited this hotel in month of July 2013. I visited this hotel with my brother from Hong kong. Actually there was a great Indian Bollywood function knows as IIFA- International Indian Film Awards. I visited macau via ferry. It was the first time I was came to Macau. My ferry reached at night around 11.30pm. I was worried that how would i reach to Venetian from terminal. The people over there does not speak and understand english. But thanks to Venetian hotel and its services. I got a Venetian Shuttle from the Terminal direct to the hotel was Free for all. The interior of shuttle was also well maintained and was having a  good interior. I finally reached Venetian. The staff over there was so outstanding in serving their customers by…,50
Had a great time at Venetian Macau. The theme is superb.Amazing concept and a wonderful experience. The rooms were very grand and its perfect value for money. The casino is wonderful. Liked the snow world and very excited gandola ride.,50
"The Venetian is luxury personified which gives its guests a royal treat, taking care of young and old alike. A city within a city, where night also seems like day! With restaurants serving delectable world cuisines, friendly staff and impeccable security, what more can one ask for on a holiday? An amazing experience which makes one never want to leave. Why doesn't time freeze at The Venetian?",50
"If you like to gamble or love check out one of the biggest casino in the world then this is place you should go. I am not a gamble person but I enjoyed the time I spent at the casino floor and lose $50 :) It is very easy to get to resort from Macau ferry station or from resort to Macau's downtown (Senado Square) and vice verse, resort's bus is depart/arrive very 10-20 minutes. My wife loves the bed and the bathroom. The mall is huge but not thing special if come from U.S.",50
Venetian Macau is the best place to stay in Macau . Venetian Macau I have stayed there twice lovely experience . Rooms were big . The view frm the room was nt tht great but the room itself was so good tht didn't get tym to look outside view . Had stayed in suite room in Venetian Macau.,50
The venetian is one of the first hotels here in macau and lives up to its status of a luxury hotel. It's huge! With many shops and restaurants. We had the Verona suite which is 170 sq m and was very comfortable. Good beds and clean big bathrooms.  Only a bit disappointed with the food options in the package - not something to remember or revisit.,40
Definitely a must go to hotel when you visit the country. It may be too big for some.  There are maps provided and a great food choices area for lunch and dinner. Its is also easier to go to nearby Hotel-Casinos because of the free shuttle provided. Some are also walking-distance.,40
"This stunning hotel is overwhelming in luxury, size and facilities. If not to stay here overnight, it's more than worthwhile to visit the casinos and the shopping facilities in Venice 24/7. Don't forget to visit the Bellini Lounge.",50
"Spacious n well furnished ROOMS. Excellent wash room dressing room. Huge LOBBY. Copy of Venice ,Italy Huge shopping area Big casino- 24 hrs Land scaping etc  are extra-ordinary features that make this hotel very special. I will like to come again.",50
"Me, my husband and our friend stayed here for 3d/2n to celebrate my birthday. All I can say is WOW! What an experience!! The staff were all friendly and their rooms are all amazing! We stayed at Bella suite and I felt I can still bring the rest of my family inside the room and we wouldn't even full the lack of space.   They also made my day extra special by sending a birthday cake when they learned that it was my birthday on the 1st night.   I would never hesitate going back to this place someday =)",50
"Really well-oiled property on the Cotai strip . Carefully planned , with every group of guests anticipated and in-mind , the Centrally-located Venetian sets out to cater your every need and exceeds your expectations . Recommended dining spots at the Venetian - Breakfast , Lord Stow's Bakery & Cafe , Late Night Supper (after Gaming) Red Dragon Noodles , For Lunch or Dinner Bambu's buffet caters to fill a very empty stomach . The buffet is ok , but not great . Much more to explore & I will be going again in Jan 2014 . If you have a kid , they have a indoor playground Qube2 . For a fee , you could let them whilst their time away with video consoles and try the maze - hours of fun expected . Very good connection to rest of Macau with their regular bus service . Their table limits…",50
 Our family of 6 had a great time at this hotel. We were welcomed by a very accommodating and courteous front desk staff who upgraded us to a room with better view of the Cotai Strip. Our room was impeccably clean and comfy. It was cleaned when we got back from lunch. The free shuttles to the different Cotai resorts were so convenient. Just stay away from the casino area if you are allergic to cigarette smoke. ,40
This totally out of the world location is a reward to yourself when you stay there and do the gondola ride and indulge in the casinos.  the golden place is amazing as it is the sixth largest building in the world. go around the place as many times as you will and you will love it each time more.  walk along the canal road and take those stunning pictures with the knights...,50
"I had the opportunity to stay here in Jun this year, this place was absolutely amazing, built on a grand scale, we were only in Macau for the one night but wish I could have stayed longer. The rooms were enormous and finished to a very high standard. Would definitely recommend to make a visit and only one word to say huge..........everything is huge.",50
"I chose the Venetian to celebrate our 25th Wedding anniversary. Having spent 10 days in Hong Kong I though something completely different would be great. Boy!!!!! did the Venetian deliver on that. Spectacular in everyway.... from check in to check out... from my online reservation to the survey they just sent me. Brilliant.  Fisrtly. This is one big hotel. You will definately use the hotel map they give you. We were still finding new places days after arriving. The grand canal and the shops are fascinating to say the least. Be prepared to spend your money on some great shops. (we dont gamble - so we shopped).  Our room lived upto the expactation that was set by the images we saw on the net. Brillinatly decorated room befitting of the Venetian theme. Spacious, clean and well…",50
"Stayed for three nights at the Venetian in Macau as part of the crew for a conference.  What a very large hotel.  The suites are magnificent and if you are a gambler, then this place is for you.  However, I am not. The shops were hideously expensive, the restaurants very mediocre and no nightclub or bar except for the Irish pub. So I was a little bored.  The place is set up to gamble, spend all your money in the hotel and when you get bored, then you cross over to another casino to gamble again. You can spend an entire day just exploring the place and the sheer enormity of the place is quite breath taking at first.  I was rather disappointed at the choice of restaurants.  Do not go to the Chinese Imperial Tea House in the Southern wing as the food comes out cold and the servings…",40
"I had the opportunity to stay here in March this year, this place was absolutely amazing, built on a grand scale, we were only in Macau for the one night but wish I could have stayed longer.

"we were booked at the venetian during typhoon utor when storm signal no. 8 was hoisted in both hongkong and macau last aug. 14. the ferry operations from hongkong to macau resumed only in the afternoon and we we able to get the 9:30 pm departure and reached the venetian at midnight. i would like to make mention how reservations at the venetian answered my emails to them regarding my booking and they even called me to give me an update on the ferry operations. upon check-in, i was informed that our royale suite didnot have a bath tub and it was fine with me because all we wanted to do was sleep! the room was huge and all the furnishings emanated luxury. however, when i wanted to put on make up, there was no dresser. the only mirror i can use was the bathroom mirror with the…",40
"Family and I traveled here for leisure. Had a disabled in a wheelchair with us, and it was not much of an issue. The place is really huge. You can spend almost a day just exploring the place. It had shops and a food court. It also has its own bus stops. It had elevator access for the disabled, and can go almost anywhere.  The hotel itself reeks of tobacco which might be the cause of second hand smoke. But the hotel is making amends to its no smoking policy. Hopefully the smell dissipates but its highly unlikely unless they do something drastic.  The room we got had a balcony, cannot remember what but it was probably on the 6th floor if I am not mistaken. The balcony was not really a balcony but was like a small garden and the room itself is very spacious it can fit 4-5 SUVs if I…",50
On my family vacation during Christmas we happened to stay in The Grand Venetial Macao Resort Hotel . It is worth every buck we spend on the stay. Royal bed rooms. The cheapest of the rooms are so huge that you can almost get lost in it. The Beds are king sized. The room is fully equipped with all the basic amenities. The hotel is having the best restaurants and affordable price. Its a city in itself. So many malls etc.   The place is so huge you are bound to get lost without a map. The pool is okay. Quite small compared to the hotel size. There are a lot of shows which happen in the Grand Venetian. These are worth a watch. Gondola ride in the mall is superb. Very awesome experience.   I would give a 7-star rating to the Grand Venetian.   There was no first aid in the Hotel…,50
"I travelled alone with my 17 year old daugther and we stayed 2 days at this hotel. Everything was fine and I really have no negative remarks to make. However, as many wrote, the place is gigantic and I had this feeling that I was on the World's largest cruise line. To get out of the hotel I had nearly to ""travel"" thourgh the shopping mall. To remember where is the entrance of my ""tower"" was another challenge. After 2 days I was glad I was leaving the place. Too big for my taste, but worth for the experience..",40
"I stayed in Venetian for 2N/3D with family and friends ... Excellent property. Large well decorated rooms and wash rooms. property itself is a small city having Nice restaurants, Casino, Shows, Ice Structures, Gondola Ride, Market Place ...... everything inside the resort. Awesome experience.  Must experience ! Outstanding. ",50
"i was stay at Venetian Macao on January 7-9, 2012..i have travelled with my cousin and booked the Royal Suites room  for who like a nightscape photography, venetian is very famous spot in macao.. for the room is superb, cozy, feel like home..IMHO the food court was very crowded, too small for big hotel the food are good with average prices the check in service is very slow, i took more than 1 hour for check in only (i think it because the holiday season) exiting place to stay,, with italian taste... the building is very very big, you need 10-15 minutes to reach the lobby from the room...  overall i wish i will be back there",40
"We went here with my wife and friends just for leisure. We never imagined this high class hotel has a food court where you can choose variety of foods starting at 68 Patacas--not cheap for us but quite decent in a way so we maximized our meal and took both lunch and dinner. Branded shops are everywhere--around 300 shops according to my friend. I really want to go back and eat more. Oh, the Gondola boat ride was great and gave us an Italian-Venice feel. This is a gambling place but I didn't enjoy, sorry. I'm not a fan so I just roamed around and took photos. If I am to go back, you know where I'm going--- the food court!",50
"We travelled with our two children to the Venetian Macau in June for our summer vacations. I am glad we choose the hotel as the whole experience was just awesome. We were upgraded to a Cotai suite which was just superb. The children were highly excited to be in the room. The view was just amazing and overlooked the Macau International Airport and we could see planes land and takeoff at a frequent interval which excited the children further. The room was very comfortable and as per our liking. We could not have asked for more. The only one drawback of the hotel is that the rooms section is far from the lobby and requires a good walk of 10 to 15 minutes which sometimes gets tiring. The hotel has excellent shopping, restaurants and a unique canal experience to enjoy the Gondola…",50
"What an experience! It's the Venetian in Vegas times 10 - brash, beautiful and totally confusing! We went for a suite, only to be convinced to go for a bigger suite upon check-in for a minimal nightly increase.  It really wasn't worth the extra money, as the room was so ridiculously large with 2 massive bathrooms, a kitchen but then just an ocean of space between the bed and the sofa/lounge area.  We did have an incredible outdoor patio space but essentially, it all felt very cavernous and overly large for just 3 of us.  Yes, it is cheap for what it is but definitely don't  go for the upgrades to suites without seeing them first. The hotel is humungous and can be tiring to get around but it's bright, luxurious and has an amazing energy.  It is a sight to behold, very impressive…",40
"we visited for the day only from Hong Kong. Got the ferry over and then the free shuttle bus. The place was just gorgeous. Beautiful scenery and I thought we had walked outside again because of the to buildings and blue sky.....but no, it was the roof and we were still inside. A beautiful lake inside and we enjoyed a gondola ride. Made a few purcahses from the shops and enjoyed a meal in the food court. My husband and older daughter went inside the casino but I had to wait outside with our 18 year old daughter who was quite upset that the age here is 21. In Australia it is 18. My husband and older daughter were very pleased to get out though because even though there are signs at the ferry saying no smoking inside casinos from Jan 13.....it was allowed and it made them very…",50
"Extravagant hotel with amazing rooms but gets tiring after staying a night. Getting in and out of the hotel is absolutely a mess, it's not only confusing but also filled with unflattering mainlanders. Besides being very crowed, the service is great and the rooms are extremely large and beautiful.  Conclusion: Party, shopping and gambling with friends - Venetian  Relaxed romantic get-away - go somewhere less popular",40
"Just returned from a 2 night stay at the Venetian Macau from the 17th until the 19th of August. It is my second time to stay at this destination. I say destination because this marvel of a hotel is indeed one. It has this welcoming vibe despite the luxurious environment. The service is excellent and the dining and shopping experience is superb so non gamblers shouldn't worry. The only downside are the huge foot traffic from tourists which makes some areas quite crowded. But the complex is so huge there are many areas you can chill out in peace.   I get to discover something new with each visit. Just a suggestion, I hope they can extend the free shuttle service from the airport till the late evening flights. Taxis are kinda rare if you arrive late in the evening and taxi drivers…",50
"This place is huge so if you do not mind being surrounded by loads of people and 24 hr action this is the place to be. It is clean and full of glitz. Loads of places to shop, eat and drink and of course gamble. The interior décor is lovely and the staff are friendly. Lots going on. There is even a river inside the hotel where you can actually ride on a gondola, for a price of course. you can get a taxi into Macau old city for around 60HKD. We preferred the old city to  this rather glitzy hotel.",50
"My room was great, large, luxurious, clean. One complaint is the access to hotel room from lobby was not friendly for me who brought children because we had to somewhat had a detour from the shortest route to our room. I also love the shuttle buses which has many routes and many buses for each route. Oh yes one more, for such a luxurious hotel I think Internet access should be free for each room without terms and conditions.",40
"We recently stayed at Venentian Macau. To get a better understanding of this hotel, you must imagine a Disney Land for adults. You can get lost here for days on end as it is so large and caters to pretty much every need. I was here with my parents and they had a lovely time too (they don't gamble). If you like Indian food, then you must visit the Indian restaurant. We took the package deal ""Cotai Package"" and received a lot of freebies: free gondola ride, csi game, free shopping coupons etc. The Italian restaurant at the Shoppes is also excellent. Overall, it's a great experience and a must for anyone going to Macau. We stayed for 2 nights 3 days; which was fairly good.  On a side note, be sure to visit the House of Dancing Waters show; it's truly top notch.",50
"We had not stayed @ the Venetian  resort.but we had stayed @hotel  holiday inn. I  m not a gambler, but just visit the casino and had spend one night only. But property is very good.on 9th or 10th floor,its a total Venetian effect environment.also on the same floor, we can enjoy multicusine food at food court.we enjoy indian vegetarian food.we had a chance to watch the  live belle dance ,which was really very good.i have also been to Las Vegas & Atlantic city casino, so if we compare Venetian , macau with Las Vegas & Atlantic city, I can say ,it is equally the best.",50
"Only one name comes to mind when you plan a trip to Macau. Stay at Venitian or you havent visited the gambling capital. But what about those who dont gamble and looking for a quiet and romantic holiday. Well it is a beautiful hotel/shopping mall/casino and activity centre all rolled into one place. Way too crowded and lost place. after paying a big price for Bella suite in Venitian we expected some special welcome before entering the hotel but enter the IN gate and you are welcome in the sea of mankind, all running and chasing and there is a huge que for check in line...wait and after checking in take your own bags and start finding your room in the maze of lifts and elevators and take one wrong step and you are lost. Rooms are neat and clean and pacify you. The venitian canal…",40
"Its huge, a little too huge, it takes a while to walk from one end to another; but its good service, great room and cleaning services, friendly staff (most of them). Shopping is convenient too and they tried to make it as similar as the Venetian in Las Vegas, USA. Definitely worth staying overnight or two in Venetian when you take a trip to Macau.",50
"My wife and I went to Macau and stayed in this hotel . The place is so huge but organized . The room we stayed in was very wonderful , comfortable , cozy . It was just like spending an exquisite honeymoon . Around the place were malls , with the theme of sunset and night time sky on the wall that looks real . The staff are friendly and accommodating . Though we stayed for just a couple of days , we had a great experience that made us wish to stay more . Food at the Bamboo restaurant ( buffet) offers a varied selection to choose from , so better start dinner or lunch early so you will savor the dining experience without rushing . Breakfast buffet is likewise wonderful .",50
"I arrived there late in the afternoon, there were a music festival in Macau and all the near buy hotels were fully booked so i went to the Venetian,  there were many people waiting at the counter, i thought i will not get the chance to get a room there, suddenly one receptionist called us and directed us to another counter with 5 desks opened to service .   i got one suite(that what was available only) at 3027 HK$/night. when i arrived to the suite I said:""it worth each and every penny i paid for"". a very clean, no smell, large bed with very comfortable mattress, the hall is excellent. all accommodation was Excellent, the towels and the bath amenities are great too.  house keeping is great too, even at 1am i called and ordered some water, i got it very fast.  it is a amazing to…",50
"Nice hotel, central location, BIG, many attractions within the building itself.  Rooms are comfortable and clean, large with a lounge area.  Pretty huge this hotel so be prepared to walk and walk.  Plenty of food and shopping all over.",40
Stayed at Belle Suite for 2 nights. Room is awesome with comfy beds but there is some annoying smell on the bed linen and carpet.   Service is excellent and the free shuttle bus is very convenient.   Ordered black forest cake for birthday surprise in room and it tasted so delicious. ,50
"The hotel was luxurious, very big, beds were very comfortable. The bathroom was huge with a huge bathtub and 2 sinks. It was really convenient too, with the shoppes on the canal attached to the hotel. There was also the casino at the ground floor. Only downside is that there is no complimentary wifi.",50
"a lovely hotel with a lot to do for every age . A family oriented hotel where they have play zones  for kids, shopping and shows for the family and ofcourse more affordable casinos . A very good weekend getaway for the Hong Kong crowd looking for a change",40
"My second time to stay here, the bella suite still awesome.. Still looks like when my first visit few years ago. Great bed and bathroom.. The bed is so comfy.. Really enjoy my stay here. Sure will back again when next time i visit Macau",50
Lovely hotel....Awesome ambience......pizza and the Tiramisu at the Vergnano Italian Restaurant just tantalizing and  the best I ve ever tasted..... Atmosphere so alive ......a Must do if in Macau.....,50
"The Venetian Macao Hotel is the perfect place to stay. I love to join Venetian Hotel's ""Sensational Summer package. It was worth to join and had fun. They have some plans, I just chose to join this one, including a luxurious suite, I also chose buffet lunch at Bambu restaurant and got a complimentary Diosaurs Live at Venetian Exhibition entries with 3 D movie, and the last choice was Cotai class ticket from Macao to Hong Kong.  This hotel check in process was excellent concierge services. The staff could attend to guest's needs very promptly, properly, and helpful.  The suite and facilities in hotel were fantastic. The room was remarkably huge spacious, clean, and comfortable with a great view across the city.  They used design in Europeon classic  with homy comfort for relax. …",50
"I visited the Venetian Macau in June 2013 and still get a nostalgia thinking about it. Palatial room, terrific view (my room was on the 33rd Floor, whoa!) delicious food (don't miss out the breakfast loaded with multi-cuisine dishes), never-ending, beautiful shopping boulevard with the world's heaviest brands, gandola rides, multiple food joints and Casino! If i missed something then probably, I couldn't catch it during my 2 day stay here. Despite of its magnanimity, Venetian Staff (almost countless, tirelessly smiling at guests throughout the day) was courteous and helpful and the warmth in the air doubled up my fun. Free shuttles every 15 mins from the hotel are very comforting and let's you explore the city anytime as per your suitability.  A must visit / stay when in Macau!",40
Nice experience of staying at the VENETIAN. Rooms are good and the service is nice. Its a huge hotel with lots of choices for eating...The casino is huge and the Venetian is a complete entertainment destination.....,40
"This hotel is massive by any standards and for a first timer it is quite an experience. One does not need to go out at all as everything is within the premises- including a large mall, fine dining and the food court. There is enough entertainment even if one is not too much into Casinos. However the downside is the chaos at time of checking and the crowds! Fortunately the rooms are quiet and being an all suites hotel fairly spacious and well equipped. We did not have much of a view being on the South side but it was okay as one could see the Galaxy hotel and easy access to the gym, which is what I required. The breakfast is average, It would also be nice if there were some more shows within the premises as apart from the City of Dreams outside the Venetian there was not much in…",40
we went there for my birthday for a day. They had a special birthday cake complementary. The hotel is awesome. Its an experience by itself. my 2 yr old was not allowed to the casino. We had to take turns to have a look. Their shopping floor is a must go place. It s on the 3rd floor(not sure..) Gandola ride is so romantic. Its a place to go as a couple but not with kids.,50
"As a hotelier, my opinions and comments might be different from other traveller (family and friends) so let me give a review base on my parents, siblings and some nephews and friends experiences.   We all stay in The Venetian Macao last 25th of july till 30th of that month.  Two Bella Suites in 34th floor.  They all love the spacious rooms, soft bed's, huge comfort rooms, view from the windows and some petty things that can be found inside those suites.  The priority service (operator) is their bestfriend while their in the the hotel.  As per them, they are all polite and listening carefully to that they are asking or requesting.  They also loved the comp shuttle bus with diffrent routes around macau.  All in all, they are pretty much sure that they want to comeback again in…",40
"If you only have limited time to spend in Macau, I strongly suggest that you stay at this hotel. This has it all - wonderful and spacious suite rooms, endless shopping and gaming, and loads of attractions.  Any of the suite rooms are big enough to ensure a wonderful and pleasant stay at this hotel. Plus the welcome drinks are great with lots of choices available in one of the bars in the Venetian complex. The breakfast buffet is also very good, but a bit crowded.  And one thing I love about this hotel is the regular and continuous free bus rides available at the West lobby.",50
"Very impress me about a complimentary private limousine pick up service at the Taipa Ferry terminal as i was travelling alone which really convenient and safety.. This was my second time stay in Venetian Macao. The room's quite big for me to stay alone. there are Living and dining area separate from the bedroom. All staff were excellent!! everyone fulfil all your request. i enjoy staying here because there are lots of things to do, such as shopping, gambling, dining, etc. no need to go anywhere just spend all time access to all hotel facilities plus new wing, a huge shopping and dining area. will stay here again and again :)",50
"Our family stayed at the Venetian recently.  We had two suites.  Our son's family stayed in a room suitable for a family with young children.  It was adorable.  There were animals made of folded towels, children's bathroom toiletries, a set of bunk beds and a baby cot.  We were across the hall in a lovely suite.  I don't think I have ever stayed in such a large room.  The shopping area of the Venetian is designed to look like Venice, Italy.  We thought it was very charming.  We didn't take any time to shop, but we walked through it just to see what it was like.  There are lots of food options and lots of fun things to do.  We swam at the pool, played mini golf and visited ""Dinosaurs Live"".  We used the very convenient complimentary buses for our transportation between the hotel…",50
"If it's your first time stay in Venetian Macao, it will be a extravaganza experience. But if it's your revisit stays, you might get a bit annoy with the crowded public area, not recommended for people who like to enjoy quiet and private atmosphere.  Pros: Superb services, they fulfill almost all your request. Nice rooms, happening and you never get bored in this hotel. As they have variety of hotel facilities and huge shopping area.  Cons: You need to walk very far to access to the leisure facilities (swimming pool, golf or gym area). No local restaurant within walking distance.",40
"My wife and I stayed in this hotel for a couple nights on the weekend. It was not our first time to stay here but were on a junket so had no choice of place to stay in Macau.  The hotel is huge, almost like a Zoo and that is where it's strength and weakness lie. The property is very very big, lots of things to see and do. Over and above the casino, the venice mall with canals, and characters is the biggest attraction. It's lively with lots of choices for food and shopping from reasonably priced to very expensive. This extends to the whole complex not only on the Mall area. Annexed next to this is another mall just as nice but not as themed. First time visitors will find it amusing as the shops and sky look sort of like Venice. Of course it's all fake but it's lots of fun and…",40
Venetian Macao gives the whole package experience of a casino resort.. this makes it ideal for people who havent visited Vegas or Macau earlier.. There is something for the whole family.. pool. mini golf and play gym for kids..several nice restaurants and a vast shopping complex that can be quite dazzling.. the suites are nicely done but furniture and carpet has started to look a bit old.. venetian offers great packages that allow you to experience the hotel amenities and restaurants at significantly discounted rates.. i would avoid the gondola ride as it can be quite artificial in the motor driven boat and Chinese gondoliers.   The Indian restaurant is great but always crowded.. i hope they would offer another good vegetarian alternative as part of their meal vouchers.. Apart…,40
"This property is Really great to see but not to Stay. We had bought two night package from Agoda which includes two breakfast or lunch and half day city tour and some other perks.We had taken this deal because as per our friend, staying in Venetian is like dream comes true but He was wrong. We had booked one night in Crown tower in city of Dreams which was just in front of this property ahead of this two night stay and that stay was much better than this. Reason behind this was since this is a very Big property and every visitor is allowed to enter the whole premises even they are not staying in this, has made it like a Public park.Our check in and check out time was more than one hour. While checking out we had missed our Ferry because no body was listening to bring our luggage…",40
Everything was just so luxurious...stunning ..such that word cant describe it...Royal suite was room was too good....and it was Huge....with all latest amenities....inspite of hotel has too long history....  Venetian itself has all international brands and as we are in July month...Sales add more value to our stay....Take Venetian Pass if you want to enjoy Major activities in Venetian.. You will be having best time in your life if you have any plan to stay in this beautiful resort.....Spectacular cotai view....Spending Money in this big casino is always turn ON....They have given complimentary Choclate Box and extended Check Out...which is very good....felt pampered...  Tips: Make use of free shuttle of venetian. Always take south side room with high as possible to have great…,50
For starters I booked this after reading many reviews here that the hotel is super crowded and better avoid it. I totally disagree It's true the hotel is a bit crowded but what can you expect with such a huge hotel. It took us nearly 30 min for the check in procedure and later as we open the doors of the room I was literally spellbound by the size of room it was so exquisite. I cant find anything to complain. Now comes my favourite part food the breakfast buffet was so lavish and there was a indian section. The hotel offers i think around 30 restaurants and one of them is a indian restaurant by the name The Golden Peacock the food here was simply superb.I describe this is hotel in one phrase home away from home. The only minus of the hotel is it's a bit faraway from all the…,50
"We were impressed by everything The Venetian had to offer! Shopping, entertainment, sites, games ~ you name it, they've got it! If you decide to hotel-hop, they had buses to take you to other hotels in Macau. I did not have to spend for anything to go around the city's sites - we just hopped from one hotel bus to another and walked from there =)  Oh, another nice thing - I decided to head back to HongKong the night before my flight back home. They let me leave my luggage in the hotel and claim it the day after in time for my ride back to Macau Airport (via the hotel bus, of course) =)",50
"The rooms are just like the Vegas rooms, lots of space and great views. Rooms were very clean and we had a nice welcome gift waiting for us upon arrival. We enjoyed our stay.  The pool was nice, but about 25% of the pool area was under construction which was a little bit of an eye sore. The layout of the hotel is very confusing, likely just because of the size, but it made walking around frustrating.  Be aware of the table minimums for games like craps and blackjack are very high compared to what we are used to in Vegas. The lowest table for blackjack was $30/hand minimum and most were $50/hand.",40
"The Venetian Hotel is regarded one of the best hotels of Macao. I was extremely excited to go there and the grandeur of the hotel didnt let me down. However, as the doors opened there was a herd of people waiting for check-in. It took us nearly an hour just to check-in. After the check-in we went to our room and it was one of the largest rooms I had ever stayed in (and its their regular room), huge bathrooms, extremely clean, great view of the airport runway, the mini golf course and the ocean. They also have a variety of restaurants with different cuisines which are excellent (the food court is a mess though). We decided to hit the casino then which was massive and had possibly all the games you could ask for. Being a smoker I decided to go into the smoking section, however,…",40
"I stayed there fr 7/11 to 7/12. My son was sick that time when we travelled fr Hkg. We were thinking to see the doctor aft check in, but everythig there. A clinic avail in 5th fl of the mall w/ english speaking doctors. We met dr Daniel, who very nice and helpfull. Did his best to calm down us, who very panics that time. Thanks to him. The room is unbelieveable big and clean. Kids were so happy w/ the room. the only things was the hotel is soooo big. It's difficult to find the cafe for breakfast, it took abt 800m to get to the pool. Other than that everything was ok, we all happy.  ",50
"Venetian Macau is all about Royalness and luxury. It small city under one roof. The hotel is so huge that it was pain for us to and come again from our rooms. Like the hotel, rooms were also BIG and Super Royal. Even for kids there were so many activities.",50
"Writing review for first time though it was my second visit after 2 years, and its as good as it was but improved a lot in terms of service and overall things, booked for 3 nights and it was great stay, overall most of things induced like breakfast and lunch along with gondola ride and half day city tour of Macau, Food court was best with variety of food options, I find it overall much cheaper than hongkong in terms of food and other stuff, Casio was at it best and its fun to be there and enjoy, Room was gr8 big and good for sleep without any kind of disturbance and house cleaning service and overall room service was gr8, its all best and will choose it for my next visit whenever in future.",50
"Stayed last July 18 for 2 rooms with my family, and had a wonderful stay. The rooms are huge and clean. Need shopping? No need to go out for shopping, All in one building, A lot of food choices from food court to 5 star resto. Definitely I will recommend to all my friend.  Felipe Reyta",50
If u like to pamper yourself in luxury this is the place to be. This place is really hep and happening. With casino and shopping arcade and the foodcourts the time in hand won't be enough. If am going to Macau again I ll definitely stay here again ,50
The hotel is huge. We reached the day IIFA Awards were happening. The hotel was crowded but it was still managed well. The rooms are very spacious. The room service generally takes more time than what it usually should take but the food was amazing. I would definitelty recommend this hotel to anyone going to Macau and more certainly for someone who enjoys gambling.,40
"I was appalled by the sheer size of the hotel entrance and staricase leading to the hotel.very close to the airpot,is this beautiful place which was the venue of the IIFA(Bollywood awards). the food court was just amazing.I actually ate Indian food out there. relaxing atmosphere with a false sky canopy overhead,the place was just  magical. Yes They have Recreated the Naples and the Venice there.the rooms are also named after the important cities of Rome. I am still in a state of awe. the photograph is that of me admiring the ceiling of the dome.It has all beautiful pics painted on the ceiling. must spend days and days to really  visit each and every part of the  HOTEL VENETION at Macau.the casinos are to die for.tatally a different ambience and the greatest gambling joints in…",50
WE love the stay in the hotel given us the complementary upgrade to suit as i was travelling with kids fabulous view  enjoyed a lot. every thing from free discount coupons to the hotel and casinos we enjoyed a lots kids loved the pool although it was too far from the room we need to walk a lot but kids love the pool so it was fun time with family the mall area and gondola ride we enjoyed every thing. love to come back again. INTERNET WI-FI SHOULD BE FREE.,50
"My my my! What a hotel! Huge, palacial, prolific, great service, amazingly managed. Massive casino. Massive rooms. Food also brilliant. So much to do and such little time I tell you. Had a great time with friends and family. Anything and everything you need is just pretty much there. Don't even bother stepping out, and use their pools.",50
Good casinos ! Breakfast was superb #cafedeco . A good gondola ride . Indians don't worry there's a superb place to eat food inside the hotel itself #goldenpeacock and stop reading reviews and go for this hotel !!!!!!!!!!!!!,50
"We walk to Macao always having Las Vegas in mind ... which one is actually better. It is not fair, however, to compare the American city of sins with a long history and built up community and fans with the Macao Strip which is not even in its teenage years yet.  At the end of its total Cotai Strip development, Macao may have bigger and better accomodations and entertainment to offer compared to those in Vegas, but at this moment, Vegas is still the ultimate place.  So as for The Venetian Macao, it deserves all appreciation we can give. Big hotel, big mall, a lot of things to do. Spacious suites, just all we need in a gaming city where we donot spend too much time in the room anyway.  Its location as the central point in Cotai Strip makes us easy to go just anywhere, even on…",40
"I stayed here for five-days as part of a conference which was held in the hotel itself. For a five-star hotel it pretty much does everything right and it's hard to imagine anybody not being comfortable in the hotel's fairly enormous rooms with huge beds and bathrooms. If walking is not your thing though the corridors and distances inside the hotel can be a bit off-putting. The Venetian is not strictly a hotel in the sense that the hotel is also a shopping mall, a casino and an entertainment venue. I care very little for casinos but did visit the area as well as a number of other ones in Macau. Compared to the one in next-door hotel Galaxy the Venetian's casino is fairly smoky and dark. It's open twenty four hours and almost always crowded. The hotel's decor/theme 'Venice' may…",40
"The size of the hotel and overall appearance is overwhelming. Despite the number of guests and tour groups, the staff were able to manage be friendly, courteous, and helpful.  Rooms were exquisitely done! Buffet breakfast was tasteful! Thank you for a wonderful experience.",50
"check in was easy,they gave you express key form  so you dont have to queue at loby just grab your key at express counter key and off you go..room was big with comfy bed and family room. bathroom is spacious with full amenities like bathrobe etc. they even put iron and iron board inside closet.fax machine and so on and on..realy realy nice room.and they have many world class restaurant inside the hotel..you can found casino at main lobby and entertaiment at grand canal, countless shop selling branded stuff..so dont miss it when you in macao just stay in this hotel. .",40
Stayed in October 2012 - perfect time to visit Macau - not too hot.  The reception area of this hotel is very busy and seems hectic - it's a beautiful area so lots of people are taking photos - once past this you will feel better!  We had an amazing room - really big with seperate lounge area - lovely view too.  Service is good and there is a lot to do without going out of the resort.  Highly recommended.,50
"From entering the front main entrance to arriving at our suite was mind-blowing.  What an incredible entry. Having been to Venice a number of times, and been to the Venetian in Las Vegas, I must say, this trumps them all for sheer opulence and extravagance, (although I do admit an enduring soft spot for the real Venice that nothing can take away)  Our room has the most incredible view and is a two level suite, as I believe most are.   Level three has an unending amazing walk of canals, plazas and shops with a changing sky overhead, that has to be seen to be believed.  There are a continuous bus service free from the ferry terminal to the hotel, as all the Casinos have. It means that you can travel almost anywhere for free just by interchanging at the ferry terminal.  What an…",50
"When we arrived, the clerk offers us to keep our luggage because we arrived early than check in time. After that he suggests us to walk around the shopping mall. The shopping mall is superb. Decorated like Venetian city in Italy, you can find a river with gondola in the middle of it. And they also sing for you as your request. Wow... Their voice is amazing. There are a lot of brands and lot of restaurant selection in the food court. Try the pork chop bun, the famous one in Macau. They open their branch in the food court. So you don't need to go to Taipa village, the original place. This hotel also near to the City of Dreams, and Taipa Village. To go to other place, they provide shuttle bus including to ferry terminal and airport. Back to the hotel, we were surprised by the…",50
"Macau is a beautiful city. All the Luxury Hotels are situated at Cotai area and Venetian Hotel is one of them. Its a huge Hotel with Shopping arcade, Casinos , Theaters and restaurants inside the Hotel. Venetian Hotel is famous amongst Indian due to Indian Restaurant inside.  Almost all the 5* Hotels in Macau are amazingly decorated. You stay in Venetian or Galaxy or somewhere in City of Dreams , you will be amazed to see the interior and setup of the Hotel. Venetian Hotel is truly one of the best hotels in Macau.",50
"been there 3 times already, like to bring familly from Europe because this is not a normal place! first you got a map to find your lift to room as the place is HUGE. second every room is at least 78 squ/m. so you got a real suite for a not-that-expensive price. don't miss the bath, never saw that fast water filling before, it's full within 5 minutes! fitness is pretty nice but swimming pools are so-so. Would like to see more service however, looks like they don't have enought employees, so not a  5 stars experience. Breakfast is not really in the hotel part, it's more in the shopping mall part so a bit far and difficult to find, was always crowded, service was not that good as well but food was nice at the buffet. Will come back!",50
"The Venetian is such a big hotel that even 2 days were short for us. We stayed in Bella suite, which has 2 King size beds. The receptionist upgraded our Royal suite to Bella as we had a child with us. It was so luxurious that we just couldnot get out out of our room. Big rooms, big lounge, very big bathrooms and beautiful interiors with marvellous views. We cannot even image anything more than that. The artificial canal with Gandola ride is a must. The architecture is total Venice style. It is really a mini Venice. Casino is very big and good with Cube Area for children. There are 4 swimming pools and a Sauna. Quite many Indian food options are available. breakfast was very good with even Upma, Puri , Paratha and lots more for Indians. The only negative was the long check in…",50
"Similar in design and concept of it's sister property in Las Vegas with the only difference is the market segment that it attracts. With Las Vegas, it has the pomp and well-behaved (mostly) crowd of families, couples and a gathering of friends while the Venetian Macau attracts hordes of group tours from mainland China. If you are not into group tours crowd and loud vocal noises, Venetian Macau is not a place for you. Better off to stay at the other niche hotels within the Cotai Strip. The Cotai Strip is still in the making, so expect loads of construction works in progress.  Our journey to Macau was smooth. We had an option to immediately embark on the ferry without going through Immigration & Customs at the Hong Kong International Airport. It's like connecting a flight.…",40
"Looks good outside and cost isn't too bad. Nice suite in hotel room, good finishing touches. Mini bar is expensive. Good value overall. The furniture is nice. Its a large and high end hotel. The location is fine for all casinos but Venetian will keep you entertained on its own. Lots of expensive shops if that's your thing.",40
"This hotel is a city in itself... If you think this is a place not for kids and one should go only with friends or spouse... then you are highly mistaken... it is a place for all... although kids won't be allowed in the Casino... however, they have a place called Cube where one can leave the kids and enjoy in the Casino, while the kids enjoy in Cube... Besides, the Casino.. a brilliant shopping arcade which makes one go bonkers with shopping... Gondola ride is a wonderful experience... And Ice World is never to be missed... Remember it is ice cold freezing, so better to wear shoes and  avoid shorts while going there...",50
"Got to knew that they have good deal at 50% off hence book a bella suite for my 1st Macau trip.  Fell in love with the room when I step in as its really huge with great scenery and facility.   The room even have a dining table which is convenient for me and my friends if we want to dine in. The hotel staffs are very friendly and kind to assist whenever we have any queries or request.  As the hotel is huge hence need to take sometime to get back to our room when back from sightseeing.  Love the breakfast buffet spread as it serves many varieties of dishes for all nationality.    The attached shopping mall consists of all the high end brands, its a good place to shop as the high ceiling is of beautiful sky and Victorian architectural which you cant tell the weather outside and  is…",40
"Returned to Venetian after 4 years - though there are shinier properties - the Venetian overall experience is still unbeatable.   We booked Cotai Experience package - which was fantastic and included breakfast, lunch and dinner (using the MOP200 we got!)  Loads of Indian food including at the breakfast, reasonable casino - great suites (though a lil tired).",50
"Travel with a group of friends and stay in this famous hotel. All of us are impress with the luxury, comforts, and quality of services and hospitality. We stayed in south wing suite. Super big room with work desk, living room, and full bathroom. (With powder desk) Work desk came with all in one printer. Wifi access (24 hours) for 160 MOP, for 3 devices.  Room came with breakfast and lunch for 2. Variety of choices.  Casino, Shopping.....etc... Just a step away. Security guards are everywhere make you feel safe.  As overall, if you visit to Macao, just stay at this place. early bird who books 30 days before you stay, 30% discount. Check their web.",50
"This veteran hotel is okey, cleanliness are standard and it is close to the road which you can take taxi or bus for 10yuan so very cheap, i choose this because of the location not noisy and quite, staff are attentive and giving effort to understand since I didn't speak chinese. Thanks to cebuexclusiveholiday all info was correct. Bathroom are clean, it has a cigarette smells but still ok i can carry on and the breakfast was free because it was month of May off season. Try it",40
"2nd time to Macau but the 2nd one was way more fancy trip than first one. I stayed at The Venetian, no need to stood in line to get the room because my travel agent already took care of it months before.  As a low budget traveler, Bella Suites room seems soooo fancy and wowwwww-ing. We got 2 beautiful queen bad, a decent living room, nice bathroom, I was amazed because that was my very first time staying at suite room in a luxury hotel. I asked the price of the hotel to our tour guide, and surprisingly it was just USD 150 - 250, I would say that is pretty cheap for a very nice suite room in Venetian.  For dining, I would pick Bamboo as my best cuisine in Macau, the seafood was very fresh! the sushi were delicous, as well as their other food. Very recommended.",50
"We stayed in the Bella suite , as we got a good rate from online. Beautiful room, with spectacular views. In fact we ordered in dinner to enjoy the view. The hotel itself is huge and you can get  very easily lost, if you do not concentrate . The food court is worth a visit, with the beautiful ceilings throughout.  Pools are great and there is a kids play area, although we did not use it. You can use the bus  from the City of dreams hotel to get you into town to explore the world heritage sites and Macao itself. If you catch a ferry over to Macau from Hong Kong you can get a free bus from the ferry terminal to the hotel. The only tip I would give is when you go outside the terminal look for the lifts that you can take down to the underground walk way , as it is hard moving your…",40
"The Venetian is huge. After you check-in ypu are given two maps, one for the shopping arcade and the other for the hotel. It has a man made river inside the hotel itself. It is so huge that it takes approximately 10 min to reach the South lobby from the North lobby. It has a great shopping arcade with possibly all the best brands. Every room is a suite. It was a royal stay. Loved every part of it.  Though while entering the hotel through the West Lobby, my first impression of the hotel was more of a fair than a hotel, because of the large number of noisy people entering the hotel. However, the rooms are peaceful. The staff is very helpful, with every request taken care of. A great experience and would love to come back soon.",50
Totally enjoyed my stay here.. felt pampered in the luxurious suites with a beautiful view of the Galaxy.. watched the laser show at the Galaxy from the room window itself ..amazing! lots of shopping! cotai discovery package ..real value for money ..lots of freebies..staff took care of very need and request..couldn't be more happy..felt well treated and well looked after..,50
"I had the opportunity to stay at both the Venetian Macao and Venetian Las Vegas properties in 1H'13.  They are both outstanding.  In terms of look and feel they are extremely similar. Suites look very similar though  the standard rooms at Venetian LV seemed slightly larger, albeit with same floor plan.  Gaming experience is very different between the two properties (LV has many blackjack tables while there are very few of these in Macau). Standard mix of slot machines at both properties.  The biggest difference in gaming were the table limits. The lowest limit I found was $300HKD (~$40USD) in Macau and these were few and far between.  Shopping area attached and across the street from Venetian was significantly larger in Macau (I would guess 3-5x the size of LV).  Both properties…",50

Ultimate luxury. Awesome environment. Lovely shopping. Outstanding food. Greatest luxury ever offered to any guests by any hotel in the world. Mind boggling and everlasting memory of the feel. Treat yourself like an Emperor by becoming a guest.,50
"Welcome to Venice in Macau!...this property provides you with an experience of a lifetime...you cannot believe what all a hotel can offer until you have stayed here!  The property boasts of large luxurious rooms, great food, premium shopping centers along with the signature casinos of Macau!  This is just the start - dont miss the Gondola ride under the starry sky-like ceiling created to give you the pure venetian experience! Besides - the property is located in the midst of the other huge properties housing grand casinos - you can easily walk down the street to see 'House of dancing waters' in a nearby property, and also some of the small art galleries of Macau.  Overall - a must visit - a no miss property if you wish to experience the 'Las vegas of the East' in its entirety! …",50
"If you are in Macau and have enough budget do make it a point to stay in Venetian. If you don't have the budget, make sure to visit it for sure. Picturesque galleries, a canal inside (and you can take a gondola ride too), plethora of shops, lot of photo shooting spots, Cirque de Soleil shows, House of Dancing Water show (in nearby City of Dreams).   This is a 'must stay' place.  Hotel also has airport pick up and drop - by bus. So it makes your travel easier.",50
This was the second time I stayed at Venetian Macau and it was sheer pleasure. Prompt 24x7 room service and they have really improved the in-room dining Indian Food taste.  The architectural beauty of the place is really appreciable. The only issue is long taxi and bus queue. ,50
"The Venetian Macau is by all means the true meaning of Luxury and Royalty. It is definitely the Mecca of Luxury and Entertainment. The hotel has around 3000 suites, 3 huge malls, Shoppes Grand Canal, Shoppes at Four Seasons and Shoppes Cotai Central and a huge food court with cuisines from all around the world. It also houses the world's biggest casino, where one can try his luck over a wide range of electronic and card games but the smoking in the casino was a turn-off. We stayed in The Bella Suite, which was a real huge room with 2 queen size beds and a small living area. It makes you feel just like you are in Vegas. The room also had a beautiful large bathroom with beautiful decorative. The hotel staff is very friendly and truly professional. The check-in and check-out…",50
"this hotel is the only good thing about Macau as the city is the most boring place in the world.i could keep myself occupied and had loads of fun here. This huge hotel boasts a shopping center with  a skylike roof,restaurants,cube game area for kids,a casino and lots more to have fun and well it is the place to plan your next holiday if you don't bother about your pockets that much.",50
"If you dont link to move around then this is the hotel to stay. It is huge and has scores of shops, restaurant, entertainment. Rooms are lare approx 750 sq ft, bathroom is huge. We had a great time just moving around the hotel. It can get very busy on the weekends. Book on their website directly and there is a great rate for 30 day advance booking which can make a large difference. Room service was good. Only problem I faced was my visit to the swimming pool, firstly there is a loooooong walk to the pool (we stayed in north tower) and then the pool was not as impressive as one would expect from such as hotel. Restaurants were nice and there is a huge food court in the hotel itself. However in Macau there are many more options and I may try other large hotels such as Galaxy but…",40
"The Venetian is huge..... literally got lost everytime I went to my room. Room was nice, shame wifi was not free. Pool is lovely. Lots of shops and nice restaurants. Its full of main land chinese guests, which could get annoying witht he culture differences. But you are inChina!!!! If this would bother you go to the hard rock. Have fun!!!",50
"Certainly the Venetian is huge but we found it easy to get around, for Check in we use Express pass ( the hotel had emailed us ahead of time) & this worked very well , south or North suites are well signposted, elevators plentiful,food options are extensive including food court & 4star cuisine, we especially liked Lord Stowe custard tarts by the canal, quite a few decent bars & all the service was friendly & prompt, easy to walk across to City of Dreams , Hard Rock etc.... & of course massive shopping potential , only thing we didn't like was China to Macau border crossing 3 free shuttle buses but Ticket fraudsters everywhere & just an overall lousy system, but this of course is not the fault of The Venetian ",40
"This is a massive hotel complex with shopping/restaurants/casino etc, you need a map to find your way around. There are literally thousands of people visiting the Venetian at any time, it can get a little overwhelming.  Having said that the room was very spacious and quiet and totally relaxing.  Great bed and pillows.  We stayed with a group of friends and all paid very different amounts for the same rooms, so shop around for the best price as it can differ greatly.  Staff were always helpful, however in such a huge place there is no real personal service.",40
The best hotel I have ever been to. It's like heaven. You can explore the hotel for an entire day and still be left with 60% unexplored. The golf course is fun (a tad expensive). A must do is the gondola ride is side the hotel.,50
"The hotel was very good to give us room on such short notice. We took the blue ferry as the red me was full. The bus was packed, and I can bet 60% of the people on the thing weren't even staying at the hotel. Check in at the lobby was quick and easy, and our room was nice. We got tons of vouchers to spend at the restaurants, so we just ate each of our meals at: the Italian place at the end of the river (yes, there is a canal in it) , some bamboo place, and good ol' Starbucks for Brekkie.  The service was overall very nice, and the kids adored the qube. This is more of a family stay, so I would bring the kids if able.",50
"Ok, so the rooms are the exact same as what you would get in Las Vegas and the size of this place is ridiculous. However don't go expecting that this place will be the same as Las Vegas because it isn't. The service is excellent and can't fault this, the reception staff, pool staff and restaurant staff were all very attentive and could not do more for you. We had to change rooms as checking in as someone had been smoking in the room before us (none smoking room), this was handled very well and we were moved within 20 mins. We also had a meal at the steakhouse in the hotel (mortons) which was lovely and again the service was excellent. The pools are on the small size, I would have expected larger given the sheer size of the pace, the gym is also on the small size with no proper…",40
"What I love about Venetian Macau is that they bother to suggest what to do while waiting for check in time. Front office suggested we freshen up at their huge and elegant comfort rooms and leave our luggages at the concierge as we stroll around the city on board of the resorts Bus. We were given Maps with english translations by the Filipina cust service staff who was very friendly and speaks very good english as expected:) We were able to explore the city and other hotels absolutely FREE. The Fishermans Warf which was just across one of the hotels we visited was a good spot to wonder around to enjoy the cold weather. A good spot for picture taking.  If you're on a budget..you can try the food court inside Venetian. Italian, Japanese and western food are available. There's a lot…",40
"Normally before booking a hotel I do some research on TA and LP, however as I had been to the Venetian in Vegas and the offer of 2 nights for the price of one deal on their website was too good an offer I decided to go with it. Following the online booking, I rang the hotel to confirm that all online bookings included free wifi and also that I was unable to insert 2 onto the room drop down menu. All my queries were dealt with professionally and I also requested that they should amend the number of occupants to 2, although I was assured that the booking was for the room, I wanted everything to be in order.  It was great that the hotel runs a frequent shuttle bus from the ferry port. Checking in was smooth and swift. The walk from the bus drop off point to check in desk is a bit…",40
Our family had a great time at the resort for 2 days. Both our rooms on the  33rd floor was too good.The lady at the Check in counter was very nice.If Venetian could have organised our Indian Dinner instead of the Lunch that we missed at the Peacock restaurant could have been complimenting(it is little out of the way to ck in before 2 if you arrive on CX  from Bangalore and use the lunch coupon before 3 on the 1st day).Over all we loved it.Break fast at Fogo Samba was good.Thank you.,50
"Venetian macao is a fantastic hotel with excellent rooms!!! but i most important think which i experienced in my life @ a quality hotel .... very bad welcome to customer ....it's just like bus stop (west end lobby ) ...lot & lot people... no welcome .... it's just like bhindi bazzar ( weekly market) ....no body to look after...for check in ...long ""Q"" of around 20/30 mins... it's just irritating (spl.  as we r traveliing with kids) ....people sitting on floor ...here & there ....i haven't seen this scene !!! be aware if you r going to venetian ,macao ...you r going to get this type of welcome !!  after check in...everything goes smooth...  it's a fanstastic hotel ... very good indian food @ golden peacock ...   don't try food @ rice empire .... casino is supereb .... gondola…",50
"Well complete that's the one word to describe this resort.There is nothing that this place doesn't offer you name it they have it , activities for kids , shopping tell you drop dead , casino of-course if you feeling lucky there is no limit here , food all the cuisines under one roof well let me catch my breath. The Venetian is a world by itself you really need in my opinion 3 days just cover the hotel properly better get some comfortable footwear , the avid variety what this place has to offer in shopping , dinning , entertainment etc is absolutely stunning . As for in my trip I had booked the suite in advance online and got a pretty good deal , contrary to the belief that this place pocket pincher. As the place is huge let me summarize the hotel in points 1> go to Mcsorleys you…",50
I have never even imagined such beautiful and large hotel exists in the world. The service at the reception and restarunts was excellent. Free pick up and drop to Ferry Station is available. We have stayed only one day. I plan to go there again next year for a week. You need atleast three days to fully enjoy all the facilities in the hotel. The room was very big. The toilets etc were very clean. I addition to free breakfast they give you lunch also as complimentary. The only issue is they charge for wifi and internet facility.,50
"If by any means if you are in Venetian , do remember to carry a map or you have very high chances of investing time looking for things. The location is brilliant, the rooms are lavish something which u don't find in regular 5 stars. Room service is pathetic and do remember to collect all your stuff before checkout as you may not get things back. Overall very excellent and different something which u should definetely see in life.",50
"went for a family holiday in last week of may. booked 4 rooms for 2 nights and 3 days.  went directly to macau from hong kong airport via ferry. there is a separate terminal at the HK airport for passengers going to macau via ferry (check in baggage goes automatically). At the macau ferry terminal, there are venetian shuttles to take u to the hotel.  what strikes u when u enter the hotel is how huge it is, grandeur and the number of guests it can accommodate.  luggage check in was smooth. At the check in counter, we were given a Venetian passport which had a list of freebees that were available to us.  rooms were very good. service was impeccable (inspite of the huge no. of guests it caters to) buffet breakfast at deco was good and there was a lot of variety.   food court was…",50
"Stayed here for a Wedding Anniversary treat and received a nice box of Chocolates, which my wife was very pleased with. The room itself was very comfortable and had everything you require for your stay. The towels and bath robes where on the cheap side and made for very small people, with the sleeves half way up my arms and I am only 10 stone wringing wet. This was only a minor blip as the Hotel or should I say complex has everything and you need and do not even have to venture out. We did however have a couple of run outs, one to see “House of Dancing Water” at City Of Dreams complex, which is only minutes away and very much worth a visit to see, it was very good. The other trip out was a walk down to Taipa old town, which is only a 10 to 15 minute walk, which is mostly under…",40

Overall the hotel have everything your need for your great trip to macau..!",50
"I was rather impressed with beauty of the Venetian hotel when I went to Las Vegas. Hence, I have decided to stay at the Venetian when I visited Macau. The room itself is great! It's really huge and pretty. The design is that of Victorian style. We had 2 double beds for 2 and this is rather unusual for Asian hotels. The bathroom itself is also huge and equipped with all the toiletries that I need. I love the suite. It's really comfortable. The hotel has also set aside area for keeping the bags before the check-in. The check in timing is pretty strict though. I was a bit upset when the hotel staff directed me to the sign with the check in timing instead of replying me verbally when I asked about early check in.The hotel interior is modelled after Venice. It's rather pretty with…",40
"I had stayed  in one of The Venetian's Bella Suites on a recent visit to Macau and cannot think of any complains. Everything from the entrance lobby to the room decor, world class casino, the shopping plaza with the Gondola rides was awesome. The moment we checked in , we were given a Venetian passport which had a list of freebees that were available to us during our stay. The hotel also operates free shuttles to the major other casinos, so we enjoyed casino hopping !! The food court has many cheaper options of food along with some pricey restaurants and bars in the hotel. Cafe Deco had one of the most lavish spread of buffet breakfasts I have seen. The resort reflected its detailed work involved in the making of it.   Con : For the kind of 5 star resort , WiFi was chargeable . …",50
"Stayed at Venetian Macau for two nights in a family suite which accommodates four with two queen size beds. We got a golf course view which was very pleasant. Luckily the room was just a minute walk from the elevator. The rooms are nicely done & so are the bathrooms, very modern & comfortable. The breakfast is good, too much to select from the large spread! We had lunch at Golden Peacock which serves great Indian food on the ground floor. For dinners I would recommend the Cafe Deco, nice continental & Indian cuisines. This place is too crowded because of the very large number of in house guests, casino visitors & curious visitors from surrounding hotels who wish to see the Venetian.",40
"The Venetian Hotel was palatial and my room was divine – all 72 sq metres! The windows were enormous with beautiful views, the bed was comfortable bed, and the furniture luxurious. The bathroom was as big as a single bedroom with a separate toilet which is a nice touch. As a treat it was wonderful, whether it was worth the cost and effort of getting to Macau I am not sure, I am not a gambler but Macua and its history and the cultural parts wee fascinating.",40
"I had stayed in The Venetian at Las Vegas earlier and opted to stay here due to excellent experience at Las Vegas. But, somehow the hotel in Macau, was rather a little disappointing due to the following factors:  The entrance lobby was overly crowded when we got down from the airport transfer shuttle. Once, we got inside the lobby, it looked like we are in somekind of a train station or something due to too much crowd.  The check-in counters were quite far away with a long queue. Worse, there are no arrangements for the standing people (not in queue) to sit or rest till the time check-in is through. It affected me as, I went with my family (2 small children).  The rooms alotted to us had a construction site view which again was very annoying.  The electric kettle in the room was…",40
"Stayed there during our spring holiday on March'13 for 2 nights before we go to HK. Had a wonderful stay at their rialto suite. From the hotel pick up until reception and to their suite the service is impeccable. The resort itself are huge and wonderful, staff are friendly and helpfull.  The room are huge. The bed itself are comfortable, very nice bed and linen. Will definitely come back again to this hotel if visiting macao again",50
"We stayed 3 nights (for hubby's birthday) at The Venetian Macao Resort Hotel which apparently is ""the place"" to stay and we weren't disappointed!  The grandeur was so overwhelming!  We travelled by CotaiJet from Hong Kong to the Taipa Ferry Terminal (Macau) and then hopped on the complimentary shuttle bus to the resort.  THE RESORT They sure went to a lot of trouble when building the resort - very detailed - this includes the canals and bridges - almost a replica of Venice (but not grubby as the real city!)  The main building is around 40 storeys high and inside the corridor ceilings, pillars and flooring were all so exquisite and grand!  Ground level has the largest casino in the world with about 800 gaming tables and 3400 pokie machines (some which were lucky for us) while the…",50

The moment you step into venetian one thing that crosses your mind is luxury.The interior and the architecture is so beautiful that your eyes will remain glued to it.We stayed there for 1 night.The room was huge and the decor was very elegant.Just to move around the resort you would require a full day as it offers you so much to look out for.The casio is very well maintained.You will find variety of cuisines all under the same roof.There are different types of performances and shows going on every time  to provide you with more entertainment.You can move around other hotels nearby just to have a feel of macau.On a whole venetian an experience to cherish and remember.,50
"I stayed there with my family for 02 nights. It was awesome. I would say it is not just a hotel but an experience. And I would say if you are in Macau you should have this experience. The check in was easy. The person who attended us in the main lobby David was very good and helpful. Rooms were excellent and the service was great. On staying two nights you get lots of freebees like city tour, MOP 100, one lunch, gondola ride. The over all experience was great. Shalainder Kaushik",50
"As a tourist from Hong Kong, the 750 sqrt suite is very spacious (all the rooms are suite type) with castle style decoration. Its shopping center is huge and filled with many interesting shops and delicious restaurants. It is walking distance to city of dreams and galaxy. Often there are activities around so it's still attractive to non-gamblers. The flaws: in-room facilities are average, shower in bathroom is not so good, TV is small. Swimming pools are small though there are more than one of them.",40
Stayed here again and it's a convenient place to stay when having a conference at the be Venetian.  Location is ok but no way you will experience the Macau feeling ( does that exist ?) waking up could be the same all over the world   Rooms are spacious a still good maintained. But for me there is no cosy atmosphere.  Negative was the too long wait for check in.  Took longer than the ferry ride.  Bars and restaurants in the complex are good and many of them.  So if you want to stay inside this is the choice.  For more exploring stays there are many alternatives.  ,40
"We stayed in Macau for 2 nights, was a little bit worried at first since we were travelling with my 2-yr old daughter and thought there's nothing much to do in Macau but to gamble. I booked 3 rooms  under the Cotai Discovery Package. Upon arriving, we were welcomed by Filipino employees who were really amazing. The rooms were just superb. They were huge and classy, plenty of space to move around - which my daughter loved so much. The view from our hotel room was even more fantastic at night. Room Service & House Cleaning Staff were very attentive, all our supplies were sufficiently replenished. Buffet services is another plus! Great selection of restaurants to choose from.   We love the fact that it is connected to the mall, that being the case, we never ran out of things to do.…",50
If you want a taste of feeling like a Royal.....this is a wonderful place.....the rooms are absolutely beautiful.....comfortable so nice you just don't want to leave.....you can shop till either your hearts desire or your credit cards all all maxed out.....I look forward to my next trip...Enjoyed it very much.,50
"I will start by the service - from reservation to check-out, everything spotless. Everyone we met was always eager to help and had a smile. The room was a WOW kind of room - we felt like Royalty! Especially because they put us in a very high floor, overlooking Macau. Yes, the place is SUPER HUGE, and you will most certainly get lost, as we did, but this is just part of the experience. Yes, it is packed with day only tourists and gamblers, again expected at a casino! We had a great deal - The Cotai Pass - which included, apart from the Suite, breakfast, lunch, gondola ride and money to spend in the BEAUTIFUL mall! The buses to EVERYWHERE in Macau were also very handy! Enjoy Macau!",50
"The Venetian Macao Resort Hotel is such a huge hotel that it may be called a city literally. I stayed there in May-2013 with my family and was spellbound by it's sheer size.  It supposedly has 3000 rooms , all of which are suites.  The Hotel is so big that it would take one full day to visit every nook and corner of it . It houses the world's largest casino.                       A well spread veg./ non-veg. buffet breakfast was lavishly laid for all in the Cafe Deco.  Although the check- in was pretty delayed due to long queues nonetheless the beauty of the hotel compensated for it.

The beds are cosy and luxurious.            …",50
"First time in Hong Kong, first time in Macau. The Venetian wasn't the most impressive hotel from the outside, but it was impressive on the inside. The gold fountain in the main reception set the tone for the hotel. We were processed quickly by the reception on arrival, our baggage was brought up for to our rooms for us and we were very happy with the suite that we had. The bathroom was huge, the bed was huge and the living area was more than big enough for two people. Having two tv's gave us the nice option of watching tv in bed if we wanted. The small things made us feel welcome - complimentary  soap, shampoo, shower gel, hair conditioner, sewing kit, comb, nail care items, lotion, toothpaste, cocktail stirrers, tea & coffee, security safe, shoe horn, slippers, robes, extra…",50
Hotel is really well designed with the taste of Venetian City. Suite rooms were well equipped and the facilities in the hotel were adequate. Was there on transit for a night and i really enjoyed the hotel without even going out of the area. Recommend for those who want to enjoy quality resting time.,50
"I stayed at the Venetian during my visit to Asia last year. Having stayed at the Banyan Tree for my  many previous visits, I decided to give the Venetian a shot. The room was clean and very spacious - it was worth the premium price that it cost. However, I did not like how we came across long check-in and check-out lines everytime we walk by the main lobby (the one closest to the shuttle buses, taxis). Like seriously, there's always a gigantic line if you walk by there during the day! I know there are other check-in/out counters scattered around the shopping area, but they should place more staff for the counter closest to the transport hub. Otherwise, our stay has been pleasant. We loved our room and will definitely be back during my visit this summer.",40
"All rooms here are suites. A good 5 star hotel and kids will love the room because it's big. The problem here is the carpet, though it looks clean it is actually not. It triggered my son's asthma so I know it hasn't been cleaned for some time.  Service staff try their best to give you the best service but due to the volume of people waiting will be the norm. Moving around the resort is not easy, too many people and when you travel with kids you have to go to the 3rd floor to go to the main lobby (children are not allowed in the casino and there is no access in the ground except through that.)  Next time I'm here I prefer to stay in a different hotel that's not too crowded.",40
"This hotel is so enormous it almost beggars belief. With a Ventian passport thrown in with the room rate, we got lunch, breakfast and a gondola ride (for 4 of us) thrown in! A Bella suite is big enough for a family with 2 double beds and a sofa bed (and 2 tvs!). We spent most of the weekend here with more than enough to keep the kids amused. The only slight disappointment is that despite being one of the biggest hotels in the world, the swimming pool is nothing to write home about. If you haven't been before I suggest you use one of the complementary maps to help you find the quickest way to your room- it can be a long schlep if you go the wrong way. Staff helpful, rooms clean and easy to get about in Macau- shuttle buses take you most places! A good place for a family weekend",40
"After reading quite some reviews, we opted for Venetian. Most of the hotels in macau offers free shuttles to different hotels which is worthwhile. The hotel as such is huge. It takes 15 mins to walk from one end to another. You can get easily lost on the way but the map helps you get to your room wing. We had opted for the Bella Suite. It is pretty decent and we loved the layout of the room. It was pretty spacious and had a good view. Being vegetarians, food wasnt an issue. There were plenty of food joints that offered North indian cuisine. It will be good if you googled the nearby Indian restaurants especially in hotels close to Venetian. I would recommend one to try the Galaxy hotel as it seems more exciting and interesting. The lobby/reception is very warm and has people to…",40
"We booked the low season discovery package for 3 nights which includes a generous selection of buffet breakfast and lunches at 4 different restaurants. We ate at all four included buffets and very happy to report they are all really excellent. Especially the Bambu Cantonese restaurant, we are genuinely surprised at how great the food is, on the last day at the bambu we stuffed to our neck with the awesome dessert and congee. Also sampled portofino the classy Italian joint where things are a bit pricey but worthy of the fee. I can't imagine how any hotel/resort could do restaurant better than the Venetian. Package also includes a sprinkle of activities to do such as the worthwhile half day macau historic site tour and vouchers for shopping and gondola rides. The Brazilian girls…",40
"The Venetian was a gorgeous hotel and found it to be everything that they advertise to be, lots of grandeur and very mystical. The only hindrance for me was that it seemed to be little suffocating because everything is indoors, they give you the illusion that you are outdoors but after spending a full day inside I was dying for some fresh air. The rooms at the hotel are huge and very comfortable. the swimming pools were lovely, and our kids enjoyed playing at the kids area which is in the shopping mall (you need to pay a fee though) The only thing is the concierge was a little clueless, first of all they couldn't understand what we were asking even though we were speaking in English and they were really struggling to give us information.",40
"don't hesitate to stay here. The rooms were amazing. Some reviewers have written that their rooms seemed past their prime- we don't agree. Our room was perfect. It looked brand new. With the new smoking laws in Macau, we had no problem staying in the half of the casino that was non-smoking. We never smelled cigarette smoke unless we ventured into the smoking side of the casino. For us the best part was the swimming area. There was a heated pool outdoor for cooler months. We never saw more than a few people in the huge swimming area, I guess most guests prefer to gamble. It's the nicest outdoor area I've seen in Asia, potted palms, Greek statues, plenty of lounge chairs. The staff were outstanding. Many spoke flawless English and were very enthusiastic to help. The breakfast…",50
"I loved staying at this hotel. The rooms, amenities, customer service, location, stores, restaurants, and entertainment are just awesome. I had a great stay here. As expected, the whole hotel looks luxurious and opulent. The customer service is five stars.  My favorite room in my suite was the bathroom. I could not resist a bath in it. I loved shopping in the stores, the Gondola ride, and eating egg tarts at the Lord Stow café all in the hotel. Then I also ate at a Portuguese restaurant near the hotel.  The food was great.  The hotel provides shuttle buses to/fro the ferry and airport which are a bonus. They are convenient and make getting in and out of town very easy. I will recommend it to my friends and I intend to stay here again.",50
"We were blown away by this hotel. The sheer size of it alone was amazing. We were offered an upgrade as soon as we arrived to a suite, and as we were there for work, and had problems late night with the internet, they sent someone up straight away to fix it. Shopping was fantastic in the hotel with a variety of shops, and the Ice World awesome. Loved it.",50
"Visited Red Dragon twice this trip and were equally impressed both times.   Tried to find it on Tripadvisor for a proper review, but could not and do not know the exact address info to submit a request to add it.  Great pricing, excellent favors, nice sized portions, great wait staff team effort, nice casual dining on the casino floor of Venetian hotel.   Will make flights in advance next time to save money there, so I can afford the extra money for Venetian hotel -- what an impressive hotel and casino floor! Had luck in the casino 2 nights, and enjoyed the restaurant and carious cocktail servers very much.   Great job, Venetian- your reputation is stellar and I see why.",50
"What can I say. We got ourselves a 2 night hotel package which included accomodation, meals, gondola ride, shopping dollars, half day Macau discovery tour - it was the best value for money and the experience - AMAZING! It was our first time to Macau and we definitely enjoyed ourselves! My husband didn't want to leave the hotel because there was so much to do! We came here for our honeymoon and the hotel was so lovely to upgrade our room to have the best view, we had towel swans with rose petals and they gave us this massive chocolate heart with chocolates inside. The King Size bed is so comfortable and the bathroom is very spacious - in fact the whole hotel room was very spacious, you could fit a whole family in there! If you ever want to stay in Macau, definitely come to the…",50

"Great hotel to stay at for a taste of what Macau us all about! Excellent shopping options and really good service for the size of the place. Would recommend to stay here. I only visited for business and was at the hotel for less than 18 hours. The room, however, was outstanding.",40
"The place is great to have picture takings as it boasts the interior designs and great Italian-inspired furnitures. Having worked in hospitality industry, this place does not top the service compared to other hotels that I have stayed or worked. Staff were quite too busy to give a smile to guests passing by them. The room is fantastic, really made us feel at home that it would make me think to just stay in th room and sleep the whole day. Bathrobes looked old and were torn but did not bother to ask another one. Overall, it was a pleasurable stay with my family but I just need to point out some areas to improve.",40
"This is a fantastic hotel/resort/mall. No negatives. Fabulously large rooms, great staff and service. I stayed there with family of 4, for 3 days in May 2013. I did not gamble!  We used the food court/McDonalds for food which were good. We also played mini-golf which was superb - probably the largest mini-golf area you would every see. The kids loved the play area Cube (though I got a little bored). The swimming pool was the highlight - 32degrees water temperature with around 22degrees air temperature.   Tips: 1.) They e-mailed me an express check-in form which I filled and e-mailed back. So, my check-in literally took 3 mins. when there was a line of 20 people. 2.) One of the hotel buses takes you to 10mins walking distance from Senado square so free transport back and forth to…",50
"Wow this place is huge ! We stayed on the 17th floor in a smoking room. The room was clean with a old fashion sort of feel to it. The room was big with plenty of space with a step down to the lounge and tv. The shower was hit and had great pressure unlike some hotels were all you want is a good shower and can't seem to have one. There was also a tv opposite the bed. The bed was soft as and very comfy with feather pillows. If your like me tho and like firm there is a firm pillow in the cupboard.  The casino is full of plenty of games no matter what your into. Some of the pokies chairs move witch was pretty awesome . Big wheel and sick Bo were personally my favorites ,on all the machines you can change the language to English as well do even if your not sure how to play you can…",50
"I booked Venetian through my travel partner since I'm in the travel business and could get cheaper deals through direct partners. I initially booked 2 Royale Suites for 6 adults and was upgraded to Bella Suite which was really amazing. It is very spacious and cozy. Unfortunately, I find it a bit weird that big hotels like the Venetian imposes internet charges (160HKD for an hour). Oh well, if you like a free internet, there are benches near the Golden Peacock Restaurant and their strong wifi signal is so cool, and of course it's free. Macau is really a casino destination. Koi kei Bakery is popular for their egg tarts and other Macau delicacies. I personally love their chewy peanut candy. There's not much to see but maybe because we only spent 2 days there. If you like bungee…",50
only can say its not convinence to go main entrance to take free photo w baby，need to go upstairs to pass through casino then go downstair again. Others really good and the package promotion is attractive.,40
"Stayed here in Bella suite , it was huge n very well designed. Washroom too is huge , as big as a regular hotel room. Venetian is so big that you won't be able to see the whole property . Shopping , shows , casino , all in one place . In fact I could not see Macau local sights as I was busy seeing this huge place for 3 days. Going there again in July . Best place to stay.",50
"The Venetian Macau is one place where everything is under one roof.  Besides being a hotel, it is also a huge casino, a shopping mall, variety of restaurants, a miniature Venice with gondolas and a tourist attraction.  Amazingly fantastic....",50
"The rooms at this hotel are huge and very comfortable and walking into the Casino and being swarmed by what seems like 50,000 Mainland Chinese punters at the same time is a unique feeling.  Obviously the hotel caters to its main moneymakers, the Chinese, but there is plenty to do for everyone.  A trip in a gondola is cheesy but fun, the restuarants are average but also fun places to poeple watch.  There is no party scene in Macau comparable to Vegas so don't expect that, but all in all its a fun place for those looking to escape somewhere different for a weekend.",40
"We stayed at the Venetian Macau last week and the experience was simply amazing....!!! It is a fantastic property with every luxury that one can imagine, massive rooms, wonderful interiors, great hospitality and so much to do. There was a carnival running at the time that we stayed there and  it was so much fun. We didn’t know what to see and what to miss. Wish I had more time to spend there. But we will go again soon. We would highly recommend the Venetian to anyone going to Macau.",50
"I chanced upon the Venetian 5-day room while looking for a hotel in Macau. 2 nights for the price of one? Who could resist that? Even if it is still a few dollars more than a non casino hotel per night, the experience is worth it.  It is really great that hotels in Macau provide their own shuttles. In Venetian's case, there's always one every 15 mins that takes you to the ferry, airport or even the other casinos. What I like about Macau is that you can practically hop in and out of different hotel shuttles to get to your destination for free. Example, to get to Senado Square from Venetian take the bus to the Macau ferry and from there hop on the Grand Lisboa shuttle. It is only a 5 min walk from Lisboa plus you get to exercise and save money.  The hotel is quite opulent. I've…",50
"the worst internet connect on the planet, downloads are slow, no access in public areas and very expensive. So if you don't want to use internet while you are here the resort is fine. Breakfast prices are very very expensive when compared to US or other local places",40
"What a gorgeous hotel! Like a palace! The room is very clean and beautiful, very comfortable furniture! The small river in the hotel is beautiful with the small boat sailling on. Lot of shop and resturant along the river. Everyone should choose this hotel in Macau if they visit this city.",50
We stayed with 3 other couples in the Venetian Macau for 2 nights and had a lot of fun. The rooms are amazing and very large and comfortable. The views out of the rooms are fantastic particularly at night ! The food quality and selection throughout the complex was outstanding. You must go to the English pub for one of their themed nights- excellent value $188HKD++ for all you can eat Mexican and all you can drink Margaritas and Coronas ! We also has a great buffet at the Café Deco which offers discounts to in house guests of 25%. We left very full ! The shopping is the best in Macau. We visited all the other hotels/casinos in Taipa and the Venetian was the best from our point of view. Our other friends also agreed. The Bollini Bar was also good for some late night partying.,50
"Well hands down the best hotel I have ever stayed in. Well to start with the hotel is big and by big I mean the biggest big possible.so never forget its map and have it 24x7 in your pocket. The rooms are good, well built, good amenities the electical part could a bit trouble some woth no central switch bedside. They have variety of restaurants for all types of cuisines. Staying with cotai discovery package is highly recommended as it gives you a venetian passport with lots of goodies and freebies. You get free lunch buffet , a 100 mop coupon redeemable at most restaurants. The canal streets are awesome at anytime of the day . You must try the gandola ride . The food courts are also good. And if you are a gamer dont forget the casino. Largest in the world . Overall a very nice…",50
"Stayed here for 3 days and we were put in the Verona Suite, the room was massive! Extremely comfortable, luxurious and opulent! Paid about $400 a night and it was a bargain for that size of room. Property is huge and has everything in it, obviously we spent most of the time in the Casino. Its only 5 mins from the airport and its connected to the Plaza and to other casinos via a sky bridge. It was a brilliant experience and the casino were huge huge! Loads of people during the weekend as this is obviously the place to be for families and other tourists. Overall a goods stay, but i wouldnt stay here in future not becase the hotel isnt great, but becasue it has just too many people and the crowds can get to you at times.",50
"This hotel was recommended to us by one of our friends who had visited this hotel. So, we decided to give it a try... the experience was awesome.  First of all, the rooms are all suites... so the moment you enter the room, it an ""awe"". The entire bedroom, living room and bathroom was beautifully done and give a luxury factor.  The casino is big and there are enough options to eat, shop, click pictures and explore inside the hotel. In fact, one would need at least an entire day to explore the place completely.  The only problem is that the place is too big and one tends to get lost... so remember the way to your room very well.",50
"We've stayed here many times and always had the best experience. However, mistakes do happen and one of their staff messed up the in-room dining order.  Upon checkout, I complained to the duty manager she apologized on behalf of the hotel and offered that on my next trip I let her know.  Six months later, I contacted the hotel but I lost the duty manager's details -- they were able to trace the record. When I arrived they gave me a free upgrade to the deluxe suite for the whole week. That's 3 times the cost of my regular room --- wow, the room was massive --- totally impressed by their service.   The only let down is the music in the gym, it lacks atmosphere --- don't forget ur iPod.",50
Stayed at The Venetian Macao for 3 nights in April 2013 with my significant other. This is my third time in Macau and second time at the Venetian. I booked this hotel due to the fantastic experience I had two years ago when I had an overnight trip from Hong Kong. This is an extensive review for tourists seriously considering the Venetian.  Location (5/5): There are typically two areas that tourists will consider staying in when visiting Macau. The first is the Macau Peninsula and the other being Taipa island. There is a third Coloane island but it is frequently left out of the conversation of most tourists. The Macau Peninsula has the main tourist draw of Senado Square and the Ruins of St.Paul. Taipa houses the Cotai Strip which is where the new large casino-resort complexes are…,40
"Was here for a short stay, but it is one of  the most wonderful and distinctive places to be at. The Royal suite was perfect, even the management of amenities and service was superior. Food at Cafe Deco and the Golden Peacock were sublime! The Gondola ride really gives you the feeling of venice and the entire ambience is romantic. A great place to shop too..",50
"I suggest you to take the complimentary shuttle bus the Venetian provides. You can ask people/staff of the Venetian (who will welcome you outside the terminal) how to get there. Just few minutes walk for absolutely free ride =)   The first time I went here was with my hubby. This time I took my family here and my mom and brother was really impressed with the hotel. The room is consistent, very clean and in order with the excellent view. The service are still superb!   There are just some parts of the casino that are in the works of construction. But it didn't bother us.   The tokens for Sands Membership are more fab and classy. Better. Just go to the Rewards counter to sign up for membership.  I just noticed this time that they don't have those acts or performances along the…",50
"I knew beforehand that the Venetian Macau was huge, yet it still surprised/amazed me to see with my own eyes how HUGE the hotel really was.  Despite its size, there were so many personnel who willingly assisted us during our stay.   Positives:   1) They gave us maps of Macau, and wrote notes which we can give to taxi drivers in case we got lost.   2) We  did not need to buy mineral water as there was plenty in the hotel - free of charge.   3) The room was great: the beds were perfect, there were two TVs, and the bathroom was immaculate.  In addition, the view of the Cotai Strip was interesting.  I can't stop but wonder how Macau would be like in five years.     4) There were lots of food choices - and there were actually inexpensive/reasonable eats in the food court.   5) Lots…",50
"This is one of the best hotels I ever stayed: Huge suites , lush and with great style, amazing breakfast buffet, countless options of restaurants and shopping and excellent service. It is huge so prepare to walk a lot... but then again it is a whole city....",50
"This place is absolutely magnificent! And as the title says, even better than the Vegas version. We stayed here in 2008 (Sorry for the inaccurate travel date, Tripadvisor only allows me to choose one eyar back from review date). We stayed at a Bella Suite which had 2 queen sized beds and a very large and lovely bathroom with a separate shower and bath. The whole room measured around 80sqm. The hotel in itself is amazingly beautiful. Although very similar to the Vegas version, The Venetian Macao is about four times bigger. The mall area is also very large with a lot of choices. However, there are still few dining choices, either you go to the high end restos or the food court which mainly serves Chinese fare. The casino is just amazing. You can stay there for hours and not get…",50
"I am not a gambler, don't even understand a poker game, however there is so much to do in the hotel. The suites (we 2 adults, and 2 kids stayed at Bella Suite) are amazing, well laid out and spacious. Don't even need a cab, there are enough shuttles to take you to nearby places and hotels. Choice of restaurants is very good, the food excellent and service very prompt and courteous. Worth a stay, the only fault I can find is you need to pay for the WiFi, well if you are paying upwards of $250 a night, why can't they throw in this for free? ",50
"The Venetian in Macao is simply wonderful.  We had a suite and the bed was simply wonderfully soft and firm giving us a good night's sleep.  The toilet and bath is big and well equipped.  The 4 pools gives you choices of cool, warm and hot water.  The Mall houses almost all named brand and some.  One draw back is the  HUGE NUMBER of mainland tourist that visit.",50
"Our initial impression on check in was OMG !! The reception check in area reminded us of a train station as it was packed with people, noisy groups etc. Once we went to the rooms though we were quite impressed , the rooms were nice and big  and spotlessly clean. there are a lot of restaurants to choose from , there is also a food court where you can catch a meal. A special mention to the room service which was impeccable, the breakfast we ordered every morning was fantastically presented and served. overall a good experience specially if you like Gambling, but  too big a hotel specially if you are travelling with family, and you want a bit of the sun !!",40
"This hotel is truly a 5* hotel, there are no deluxe rooms you get only suites. The rooms are quite big and the bathrooms it self can have a room in it. The hotel is amazingly built. The canal runs through the hotel, and offers a true venice experience. Don't give it a second thought, If you are in Macau you have to stay at the Venetian.",50
"Our stay at Venetian hotel was wonderful one and we had enjoyed thoroughly our stay there. The huge and fancy room, great shopping mall,  staff, facilities, food and service was awesome. From gamble, you can do everything there.  A free shuttle bus service takes you to all the places of interest in Macau. The one thing inconvenient was that room key doesn't work properly, so I had to go reception for two times. The hotel is worth visiting again.",40
The Venetian is definatly the place to stay in Macau. I stayed here at macau 5 years ago at a different location just before the opening of the Venetian. Wow what a change to the Cotai strip in just 5 years.      Very large resort and facilities almost too large you just get lost its so big.  Rresort pools very hard to get too long walks.  Variety of restuarants good and price ok . I am not a gambler so not much too in Macau unless you into gambling. But it is an experience. I travelled with 2 other work colleagues so probably didnt get the most of the stay. It would be okay for family travelling with children as I normally am. The kids Club looked amazing but again a long walk. Staff very helpfull and friendly. You dont need to leave the resort its just enourmous. Bars and…,40
"Excellent Hotel..Great Rooms, Great Service..No Complaints..Thats all I can really say. A place to stay over and enjoy Macau.Shopping Arcade is feather in the cap with Venice style of water feature and the Gondolas. The only thing I found a bit odd for such a large property that for our check-in we have to be in que for 30 minutes despite 5-6 guests were checking-in in front of us. How do they manage the large Group Check-ins..??",50
"One stop entertainment, shopping, dining and casino in one spacious & luxury hotel. The room was so comfy and awesome with 2 large television. The bathroom is big & clean. If you stay here, no need to go outside. There're so many restaurants in the food court, selling all you need. The canal and shops are very impressive. Check in was reasonably quick although there're so many tourists.",50
"The whole trip to macao was quite and comfortable, especially when the whole place was set for entertainment (casino, shows, food, shopping).  We booked to stay in The Venetian and the room was huge! The service was excellent and Venetian simply wows the people with the size, variety and location.  The shopping mall was big and you could get lost in there easily, while killing time and take a leasure walk around the block. The whole shopping area were connected like a big city down under.  Tips: The foodcourt was big but also try the foodcourt at Galaxy hotel next door (take a shuttle) to find other variety.  Don't order their internet, the service provider was really bad that we cancelled the order since the speed was lagging so bad.  To go to St Paul's Ruin, take the shuttle…",50
"We Stayed at the Venetian Macau for 5 nights from 16th April - 21st April  - 20th being our 20th Wedding anniversary.    At the start, I would like to thank Nicole Ning, Supervisor Guest Relations for making my stay at the Hotel Pleasant and memorable.   She promptly replied to my many emails, upgraded my room to Cotai View, got my room decorated on the 16th and even left a box of chocolates  ( sadly, on my anniversary day, I got nothing  - not even a cake !), ensured Checkin was easy by asking me to check in at the ""Invited Desk"", gave me a late checkout at 3pm, and assisted in refunding my security Deposit !

"We were recommended by our uncle who had stayed there before. We had a very good deal - 30% off the published price. We also enjoyed key express service where we filled up a form prior to arrival and we skipped the check in queue. The best part is early check in at 11am, late check out at 2pm and complimentary wi-fi. The hotel is so big and it is quite a distance to walk from one end to another. It is a very interesting hotel with 2 canals inside the hotel. The gondola men sing very well. So many shops to shop till you drop. Casino is assessible from all directions. So spacious and grand.  The interior and exterior parts of the hotel look exactly like Venice. So cute. We were very happy with this hotel. We would recommend this hotel to our friends.",50
"We first saw The Venetian Macao in National Geographic's Megastructures documentary that's why when we had the chance to go to Macao to celebrate our anniversary, we decided to stay here even just for a night. We got a good deal through their advanced purchase 30% discount. I also called up their reservation desk to request for any complements for our anniversary. Few days before our trip, I got an email from the hotel for an invitation to an Express service that allows us to simply pick up our room key without signature, and without waiting in a long queue. I was very pleased with this since I know the hotel is huge and I expect lots of guests. We arrived in the hotel before the check in time. Used my key express and true enough check-in was a breeze. We left our luggage with…",40
I stayed for 3 day there. Very nice hotel and very big casino. Breakfast also very excellent and lot of food choices. too crowded in the morning though. maybe next time I can stay little bit longer with my family,40
"Having heard so much about the Venetian , I was very excited to see the suite.The Royal Suite where I was put up facing the Sheraton was really beautiful and Luxurious to say the least Apart from the Casino , Venetian has a long chain of shops by the canal built like Venice which also has Gondola rides and all Gondola Boatmen / Boatwomen are blessed with a booming voice and sing really well They have a kids room as well to keep the little ones occupied Breakfast at Venetian is no big deal as they have out sourced it to someone who is not as passionate about food ! Same insipid menu everyday...But the Golden Peacock restaurant which has opened recently which is managed by Venetian is really very good  All in all a good hotel !",40
"We stayed for 2 nights Feb 2013.  I had intended to stay 5 - but was deterred by other reviewers saying ""too big"", ""too smoky"", etc.  Very disappointed that I did not stay 5 nights.  Sure the place is BIG.  And smoking laws in Macau are not like in Australia.  And you do have to walk through the gaming floor to reach the elevators to the wing of your suite.  And you get lost many times - because the place is just massive.  But if on holiday - who cares - it is an adventure.  You just never know what you will find.  But we absolutely LOVED it!!  There is ABSOLUTELY everything that you need without walking out the front foor.  Many QUALITY restaurants;  bars;  cafes;  food court if that excites you;  SHOPS;  entertainment around every corner.  Cafe Deco - where we had breakfast…",50
"I went with my colleagues to the Venetian Macao Hotel for sightseeing tour and to experience the ""all day feeling"". We only stayed for a day but it was worth the side-trip from Kowloon, HK. It was a sight to remember! The hotel's main attractions are the casino and the promenade avenue with the ceiling designed and illuminated to make one feel that the day never ends. Appreciated the shops and interior designs. It was indeed a worthwhile trip.",40
"The city Macao might not be a great travel destination unless u are into casinos but this hotel is a city in itself. U'll need around 3 to 4 days to tour the hotel itself luxuriously big rooms, the art work all around the hotel, everything was beautiful. we got lost in the hotel twice it is uncomfortably huge hotel at times.",50
"I come from the States originally and have stayed at the Venetian in a suite there. The Macau version was identical. It was almost as if they picked up the Vegas version and plopped it in another country. I think they've done a fantastic job on this one and it's my favorite casino to visit when I come over from Hong Kong. The canals and ceiling are just like the ones I saw so much Stateside. There are great restaurants, including a Brazilian churrascaria and an ale house named McSorleys (also in HK), among other great food spots. The shopping is well rounded so if you are on the lookout for clothes, accessories, etc, you'll surely find something to suit your needs. The spa was quite good as well although expensive. If you're looking to treat yourself, definitely consider…",50
"Stayed here for 4 days and 3 nights. Room price is not an issue as we managed to get a special rate from a mate. Suite room is excellent! Big bathroom, sulken living room, comfy bed. Housekeeping keep it tidy, no molds in the bathroom which most of the hotels missed out. What we love best is the Room Service breakfast. Ordering is pretty easy and service is very efficient. Servers set up everything on the table. It's nice to start the day with nice breakfast. Staff are very well mannered. We have been in the shops and casino so we pretty much know the place. It's more of the service that the hotels provides that we like to commend. Check in check out very fast. No hassle at all. Will definitely stay here again.",50
"I'm a frequent vistor of Venetian Macao Resort. Among those many hotels in Macau, Venetian has its good kind of uniqueness that will good suit my family. It's the biggest luxury room of size 700 sq ft that is pricing at the standard room charge - luxury furnished and 2 x TV each. It tool me 60 mins cotai ferry from HK port.  'Cube' club is my kid favorite. It's such a huge indoor playground, slides that can share with a hundred of kids, and it's most popular kind of video games Wii, PS3 where my son spent 2 hours everyday. Mini-golf is another great outdoor game you can't miss. It's a challenge of abt 20 holes on an open roof. If you'd like go shopping, the area of shopping mall will spend you half a day to walk through. Along the walk, you'll experience the venetian singers who…",40
"Very big hotel composed of 3000 suites (70sqm/80 sqft minimum).  My pros :  - The huge and beautiful mall inside the hotel. More than 300 shops and restaurants (Zara, Mango, Mc Donalds, Mortons, etc). They all accept $HKG - Very big rooms - Very confortable bed  My cons :  - Not enough non smoking area in the casino - 90% of the card games are Baccarat. Not enough Black jack for my taste. Note all the casino games accept $HKG - in room Wifi is super expensive : 160 $HK for 24 hours (around USD19 or €16). Note that 3 devices can use the wifi access - Minibar and room service is also too expensive. Count 160 $HK for a continental breakfast. - The lack of good manners of some chinese guests from mainland (wich is the vast majority of the hotel guests). Spitting, burping, yelling in…",40
"We recently stayed at the Venetian, Macau. We'd stayed at the Venetian in Vegas and so had a reasonable idea what to expect.  The suite was similar to that in Vegas with an enormous bathroom with his and hers sinks, separate bath and shower. A bed area with TV in cupboard and a couple of steps down to the lounge area with another TV! Very comfortable room with lots of amenities in the bathroom.  I think the casino area is bigger than that in Vegas. It was enormous, the only thing was there were few tables other than baccarat. The shopping mall was just as big if not bigger and full of expensive designer shops where you can't afford anything. Make sure you take the shopping mall map with you when you go shopping.  Although we were in Macau we were hoping for some food other than…",40
"Venetian is amazing ! awesome ! It's so big that we always get lost when going back to our room. I'm amazed on the golf course in the hotel. There are many pools, too.  Everything in this hotel is excellent !!! What more can I ask for?!  The group of hotels are connected, too.  Don't forget to watch in the evening the 3D show on the wall of the hotel.  You also have a free album size photo at the lobby of the hotel.  If you want to get 2 blow-up pictures (in their very beautiful folder frame) and a snow globe, you'll pay a big amount (forgot the price).  By the way, most people can't understand English, that's why we had a hard time communicating.",50
"Stayed 2 nights/3 days in Macao and booked with the Venetian on the Cotai strip.  The Venetian is huge, much like the Venetian in Vegas, with a sprawling maze like feel to the endless rows of shops and venues, though surprisingly not nearly as crowded as the one in Vegas.  The shops (filled with overpriced designer gear) were much like that of Vegas, though filled with bored cocky chinese people instead of bored cocky caucasians.  The many sit down restaurants were what you'd expect of a high end resort hotel, expensive but well worth the price you pay.  On the more budget minded end, if you can find it through the maze of canals and shops, is the giant food court with the cafeterial like atmosphere.  anything you want is available to you.  I was craving pho one night and my…",40
"This hotel is as grand as it gets, superb & large rooms, massive shopping mall, a number of resturarants and of course the vast gambling floor. The scale of the hotel does not cease to amaze and you could spend days just wandering about. The service is patchy and depends on who you interact with - there are some employees who are just outstanding but equally others who are very indifferent. It is not uncommon to pass hotel employees who woud not wish or even smile at you, a bit disconcerting for a five star hotel. Communication is a problem if you are non Chinese. An example was when we booked tickets at the hotels inhouse travel agency for ferry tickets from Macau to HK airport. We were not aware that there are two ferry terminals and were not specifically told which one to go…",40
"We stayed at Venetian on a family Holiday and the experience is unbeleivable and magical. We booked online through the official venetian webpage and was a little dissappointed that we could not get a stay with free breakfast. Well , our apprehensions were wrong. The foodcourt inside the hotel is just wonderful and you have so much variety here that do not require to go to their restaurants for the buffet breakfast.   Right from the time, we boarded the luxurious bus of Venetian from the cotai ferry terminal ( free shuttle with a beautiful blue decor), we knew it is going to be something special. For a hotel of such a big size, the check-in was smooth and by the time we could manage to navigate through the enormous casino at ground floor to our suite, the luggage was already…",50

Due to the casino, you can smell the smoke everywhere!  Prostitute start walking inside hotel, near casino at night, you can find them disturbing when they wave you!  Inside the room, as everyone said, it is huge.",40
Having been to both Venetians this one is much bigger and doesn't disappoint.Rooms are fabulous with standard rooms as suites .Its expensive on friday and saturday nights and the casino is extrmely busy all day sunday.There are packages available which throw in some meals and other benefits.There are plenty of choice within these for breakfast and lunch.If you aren't chinese and want to gamble other than poker machines this could be difficult.The Titanic exhibition was on and was fascinating and memorable.There are shuttles outside that take you nearly everywhere at no cost. This is really not a non asian family experience and really a curiosity for westerners go to Las Vegas first!,50
It one of the best and the one of the largest hotel i have seen till date. The rooms make you feel like a king staying in his palace. The interiors and are so damn awesome. The casinos add to the glamour and the hotel is so huge that I nearly could not find my room for the first 2 days.,50
Brillant hotel...I stayed here for 3 Days. I requested for the higher floor room and i was been given top floor suite. Very polite staff. Temperature controlled pools. The best shopping area. Gr8 casino but tables are high priced. Would definitely come back and would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Macau.,50
"We spent one night in the Venetian Macao and there was no slightest reason to regret about our choice.The hotel amazes from the very first step in - luxurious, colorful, great, live, friendly... I could continue adding epithets endlessly! Entering the hotel one gets himself into the amosphere of Venice - colorful wall and ceiling paintings, rich decorations, indoor channels with floating gondolas, venetian style streets and sqaures. The hotel is really big with a number of shops, food courts and, of course, a casino. The staff is very friendly and helpful.The rooms are spacious and well maintained in a perfect order. Every guest is presented with a hotel map at check-in and the map turned out to be very-very helpful to us. There are also a number of stands with interactive hotel…",50
"This is an Excellent Resort, i have ever seen in my life. I have no words to express my feelings but i recommend that those who are visiting Macau must stay st least 1 night to Experience it. I like their Casino's and The Gondola ride.. The Mall inside the resort is very Hi FI.. and yes the Food, there are so many restaurants and specially the food court, which i liked most. The rooms are giving the feeling of living in a palace.  I enjoyed every moment of my 3 night stay in ""The Venetian Resort""...I just loved it.",50
"My husband and I stayed in the Venetian for 3 glorious nights. The rooms were spacious and luxurious and the king bed was very comfortable. The staff were very polite and courteous and were quick to answer any queries we had. The pools were magnificent! The only downfall was the smoking sections of the hotel; although our room was non smoking, the smell of smoke could be smelled as soon as we walked out of our room. A difficult problem to overcome. We would definitely recommend the hotel to anyone visiting Macau.",50

The Hotel rooms Bella Suites we stayed in were excellent, we had interlocking suites as there were 4 Ladies , I could not fault the staff , service , housekeeping all excellent, we got a limousine from the ferry & back at a very small charge well worth it. It was my birthday , they surprised me with a birthday cake to my room. They never missed a detail , from checking in to checking out , wonderful. The cost including all our meals and a spa was much cheaper than we expected. Would recommend highly !!!",50
I travelled with family.We had an excelllent stay at the venetian. the rooms are large and very spacious. the venetian hotel is very large and has a lot of activties to cover and the best part was the shuttle services provided easy access to the major hotspots of the city. The hotel has a foodcourt which is very useful to have all kinds of means,50
"Is this a clone of Bellagio in las Vegas? There were so many similarities. Room and view were wonderful 10/10. However, if you have difficulty walking long distances, this could be a problem. The hotel is that massive. Attached is the casino and the Grand Canal complex, with indoor canal and singing gondoliers. The shops are very exclusive and for China are very pricey. Ate at McSorleys and they did a very nice pint of bitter and chicken wings. Service throughout was top rate. Highly recommend this hotel but take into account the long walk and the fact that it is not really in a pedestrian area of town.",50
"Just wowwwww... nothing can beat the venetian experience. Amazing rooms, amazing room service, amazing view from the rooms. Visiting Macau means Venetian. If going to Macau and not staying in Venetian, then there is no use of going to Macau. Venetian, as a city in itself, is just one stop shop... amazing casino arena, huge one... and the best part, Macau is no smoking city, even in indoors. We also get good and a lot of Indian Cuisines and also good variety of Vegetarian food. If you are not addicted to only Indian Food, then Chinese food in vegetarian is also having good variety, just that, you need to have patience in looking for it and also choosing it in the buffet.  Venetian, beautiful hotel/city resort experience... Must visit...",50

We arrived on a late flight on our first day.  No lines in the airport and we quickly boarded the Venetian complimentary shuttle to the hotel.  We were dropped off at the main lobby.  There was no line in the check in counter so check in was really quick.  We booked the Bella suite and were assigned a room in the North suites.  They will hand you a map of the hotel.  Be sure to carry the map with you at all times.  We had children with us so we had to use the lift to the 3rd level and navigate our way to the room from there since children were not allowed to pass into the casino area on the ground level.    The Bella suite was huge.  We requested a non-smoking room.  We did not pick up any cigarette scent in our room (a frequent complaint in the reviews).    The room has 2 queen…,50
"Arrived at the airport having stupidly forgot to book a shuttle or transport to the hotel but as we exited the gate we saw a well groomed man standing there with a Venetian umiform where he directed us to the shuttle . once arriving , hello nightmare! so many people leaving, coming, etc. but its to be expected. but our bags were immediately taken and pointed to check in! check in was smooth. unfortunately the lady clearly didnt know much about checking someone in , as we only had HKD1500 on us she didnt even ask for our credit card for a deposit rather said do not use the room services. anyway, the room was fantastic. big comfy bed, a bathroom a girl can dream of lol . it had its wear and tear ofcourse, broken door, the bathroom mat was actually brown dirty , the floor had…",50
"Very lux hotel,classic style. Room is very comfort and big.price too but worthy.big mall , casino (if you like gambling and it's have no smoking area) ,kids club,gondola ride.HK dollar is acceptable,you don't need to change MOP.buy ticket ferry in cotai travel in hotel and you'll get discount 15% if you stay in hotel",50
Stayed there in march 2013 with family. Excellent hotel. tough bit crowded. Swimming pool is excellent. Check in was smooth. One of the best property in macau. Rooms sizes are great. They also have 3 big casinos.,40
"To be fair, even the opening of this hotel was a mess, however, the management did show their coping of adversities in an impressive and generous ways.  I have stayed in this hotel for several times, each time no complain.  The quality of service does not falter even after so many years of operation.  I carelessly left my new T-shirt in my room and checked out on 11.3.2013.  I sent an email to Mr. Mark McWhinnie, Senior Vice President of Operations, at midnight.  Amazingly, he replied my email at 8:10 a.m. on 12.3.2013 to reassure me that he would look into the issue and asked his staff to call me later that they had found the clothing! I really owed him such a great favour.  When I checked in again days later, they sent my clothing to my room before I asked for it.   The staff…",50
"took advantage of a great room promotion recently and stayed 3 nights in March 2013. Paid US150 per night which was a steal for the suite. Spacious,  clean, large king size bed n huge bathroom, with separate wc. Free transfers from airport n ferry terminal. Self contained entertainment complex.  Great value stay.",50
"I stayed at The Venetian with my wife and kid for 1 night in May 2012. The Hotel is Huge, rooms are very nice. Lots of things to do and shop. Had a wonderful stay at The Venetian. Since there was nothing much for entertainment then, we stayed at Venetian for 1 Night.",40
"The hotel is at great location as it's connected to a big shopping mall, it's very convenient as u can find everything u need in the shopping mall. All standard twin room is actually a small suite, very spacious, large bed, the sofa is big enough to sleep 1 person! Excellent if u come with kids and family, the hotel has a indoor playground although I havent been visit. The bad things is the checkin/out queue is always long and the lobby is far away from the hotel room lift lobby, need to walk a few mins. The room is 5 star not the atmosphere is 3 star because it's crowded and too many noisy tourist.",40
"Recently had a couple of nights a the Venetian, the room was great and very comfortable, few minor issues, the place is so big that it is more like a theme park then a hotel, tour groups getting about etc.  That said, it,s still an experience to stay in an iconic hotel, but really I believe the old MAcau has more appeal then the coati strip.",40
"If you want to feel pampered and would want to escape the hustle and bustle of life, and just get the royal treatment, this is the place to go. Rooms are huge, with king sized four poster beds, separate living room areas and  (gasps) lovely powder room area. We stayed here for 5 nights and knew it was worth the splurge, as it is pretty much conveniently located, with shuttles taking you to different areas in Macau. Alongside that, it had restaurants and designer stores scattered all over. And don't ever forget to take the gondola ride, and feel like a maiden being serenaded.",50
"The Venetian Macao's rooms are very nice, comfortable, and also well decorated. It's Casino is the biggest in the world, but take note that families with children below 21 years old are not allowed to pass through. The building has everything you need. You can shop there, and there is a wide variety of restaurants to eat in. They have their own free shuttle service to get around. The Venetian is definitely a place to relax.",50
"Traveled in Sep 2010, the hotel is huge stayed for 02 nights but dont think would have explored even 50% of the property. Staff is nice and the entire hotel has the grandeur feel in it.  Book it online and in advance you will get very good deals on it.",50
"I stayed in Bella room with two queen bed. Good things: Bed is very big, i like it.                      the staff who check me in was very welcome                      very close by the market (the street with many local restaurant) Bad things: the cup is very dusty                    I got a late check out at 12:30, however, when i opened the door at 12:25, the staff was going to lock my door, it was embarrass.",50
"The Venetian Macao is your destination vacation spot in Macao. Like it's ""Sister Ship"" Property in Las Vegas (Where I lived for 9 Months) You will find the FINEST in FOOD & GAMING at The Venetian. Well maintained, clean, and even the slots are ""Loose"". Try the Venetian Macao, the rooms are huge!",50
"Very Spacious and well decorated. Well equip with a living room, huge toilet and bathtub, and a huge bed!! Comfortable and located in the Venetian Casino where shopping and food is within easy reach. It's location is on Taipa Island - hence do take note when taking a ferry there!  Personally find the location better than the main island which is far too congested :)",50
"It is hard to explain in words who BIG this hotel is!!! From the shuttle bus pick up from the Ferry at Taipa to the check out service everything was great. We stayed in a Rialto Suite and it was very impressive,we were thrilled with the size and ho well appointed the room was, and loved the nighlty turndown service with the extra touches, slippers, robes ect!!! The concierge were very help full with imformation about getting into the main township to do some sightseeing which is very easy to do and well worthwile. We ate in the Hotel area at McSoorleys and the Food court area which had so many places to choose from. The pool area was lolvely but getting there the first time was a bit hard to find. We visited the Titanic exhibition which was really fun and interesting, very well…",50
"Since I am not a gambler, Macao definitely is not more than a few hours of a day trip for me. I had heard a lot about the Venetian at Macao. And it delivered. I wasnt blown away by the opulence or size, primarily because I was expecting it. I liked the massive shopping area within the hotels. The Gondola ride was the highlight. The food court was functional and had a lot of variety, including an Indian outlet.",40
"Had stayed there for 2 nights for a family vacation.  Pros -  1/ Is Lavish and grand by all means - is a city of its own 2/ Is a all suites hotel and the rooms a big and comfortable 3/ Is very well maintained, despite the number of visitors it has 4/ Service Staff (Reception, Restaurants, Security Staff) - polite and patient (despite the crowd they maintained a smile and a friendly attitude) 5/ Can spend hours in the Grand canal area without getting bored - several shopping. entertainment and dining options 6/ Several complimentary add-ons provided on check-in 7/ Service is prompt (had some electrical issue in our room and the electrician was there with us in 10 mins flat) 8/ Has a food court of its own - offering every time of cuisine options from across the globe  Cons  1/…",50
"Your Macao trip will not be complete if you don't stay here, especially for first time visit in Macao.  The Venetian is an icon for this booming casino area.  The hotel itself is huge and grand, from the lobby to the room.  They are very well decorated.  Room size is very big compare to other hotel room.  I stay at Bella room and it has 2 double bed, so it is good for family of four. Connected to huge shopping complex and casino, so you have plenty things to do, even if you just stay at the hotel.",50
"The Venetian is not only about its casino. I stayed here for a night with my husband and son. From the point we got off the ferry at Taipa, we were ushered seamlessly to our room.  The Cotai Discovery package included a MOP100 voucher for use at many outlets in the resort. There was even a 10% discount off the ferry ticket back to HK. We were able to utilize the discount ans offset the discounted ticket price with the voucher too!  Everyone at the Venetian was all smiley, accomodating and extremely helpful and approachable. As the size of the resort is huge, all you have to do is look a little lost and a staff wandering nearby would take the initiative to approach you and request to help you.  There is just so much to do here, with the 300+ shopping outlets and dining outlets,…",50
"Yup, this hotel is Awesome. It has a very big Room, and very Modern indeed!  It has a very Good Interrior. Not Good, but Great architecture and interrior design. I watch Circus in this hotel, walk around at Shopping Malls, and also Casino, and can ride a Boat in a Hotel! Yup, it is a very HUGE hotel. Worth to stay here!",50
"One of the biggest things we have seen. So much to do and see in just the one hotel/casino complex. Our room was huge - bedroom plus lounge/sitting plus huge ensuite. Wi-fi very slow, and $160MOP per day! Better to go to restaurants or cafes- free and quicker. TVs need upgrading - still CRT! Overall from the point of view of a hotel guest we felt the experience was a little impersonal.",40
"Stayed here on a few occasions, most recently in March 2013, and very very pleasantly surprised. Impeccably clean and surprisingly well maintained (considering the sheer number of tourists that go there). Lots of freebies (beer, etc) to keep you happy. Decor obviously a little cheesy, but you're expecting that if you're staying here. The mall (""grande canal shoppes"") is my favorite in Macau, as it has stores that you would buy from (not just LV and Gucci like the other malls) and it even has (a) a Fatburger and (b) Morton's steakhouse. Can't really ask for much more. It's little far from the downtown historical area, but Macau is so tiny that we are talking about a 50 MOP taxi ride so not really an issue. Overall, great fun and good value. ",50
"Stayed a few nights in a Royale Suite, which was comfortable, spotless and very big. Service both at the reception and at the concierge desk was very friendly and efficient. Breakfast at Cafe Deco was fresh and of a good east/west variety. Recommended.",50
"We stay on bella suite, its a huge room with two-queen beds and great view to the city landmark. We amazed with the 3D performance on the wall of the hotel, it feels like a festive year eventhough it was March. Every part of the hotel is the best spot for some pictures. The service in reception was excellent. That time we spent on the hotel was one of the best experience.",50
"Stayed in a Royale Suite, very spacious and spotlessly clean. Reception staff went above and beyond coming with me to the concierge to make sure they got the details of a new package they were offering correct. Very very big complex so be prepared to walk. Really enjoyed dinner at Portofinos fantastic meal and great service. Shuttle bus service worked really well and the hotel must have taken previous feedback on board as there was a porter at the bus to look after our bags if we wanted to. I would certainly stay here again, we were celebrating our 30th Anniversary and it was recognized beautifully which was a lovely surprise. We had afternoon tea Cafe Florian in the middle of the Casino it was a buffet and the food on offer was presented beautifully and tasted divine. We walked…",50
"Beautiful hotel with great suite rooms and amenities, although the toiletries provided were a little disappointing for a 5 star hotel. Lots of food choices from the food court to restaurants.   Place is huge as we seems to be still exploring new areas in the hotel, even after the 2nd day.  Casino area (even non smoking area) do getting smokey especially at night.  Fortunately, there are signed walkways to the rooms lobby without going through the casino.",50
The hotel was huge enough. Got a big room with a extra bunker bed for children that was as big for adults. There is kids play room in the hotel which takes care of children and provides you with cellphones as to call when your children are done with playing. Good shopping area.,40
"We had a stay in Venetian Macao in May 2011. Its an understatement to say that the rooms are huge, with a huge bath area, changing room, sitting room and the likes. Overall, the resort is like a city in itself and since we only had 2 days in Macao, we didnt even find the need to venture out of the hotel as there was so much to do inside.   There is a Venice styled Gondola boat ride experience which was mindblowing with the boat riders even singing songs to add to the Venetian flavour. It has several places to eat, shop and keep one entertained. We even saw the famous ""Cirque de Soleil"" show in an auditorium there. And I must mention, that the buffet breakfast spead was easily one of the best I've ever been to. Overall, a fabulous experience.",50
"TRAVELLING FROM HONG KONG I took the Cotai Ferry from Hong Kong Macau Ferry Terminal to Macau Taipa Ferry Terminal which took about 50 – 60 mins, a comfortable ride to arrive in Macau.  Once I passed through the border, across the road was the free shuttle to Venetian and it took me less than 10 mins to arrive. HOTEL What can I say! This hotel is luxurious in every way. However, extremely busy! CHECK IN I just followed the signage to Reception check in counter and the check-in was very quick and efficient. ACCOMMODATION Since I wanted to spoil myself with my partner I wanted to book the best room which was a 70-square meter room Royal Suite. The bed was canopy draped a king size bed with a sunken living room and the bathroom was marble tiles with luxury amenities. The room was…",50
"My family had 2 rooms in Dec 2012. The room are huge. The kids will love it. In fact the rooms were very comfortable and welcoming such I could left the younger one in the room to play and watch TV when we go down to the Casino for a game of two.  The hotel have a kids play room within the shopping area. The kids will love to hang around the play area when the lades go shopping peacefully.  Don't miss the food court in the hotel too. The food is relatively cheaper then other eatery within the hotel. For those that I tried, the quality of food is good.  You have to try the roasted meat store in the food court. The roasted goose is better then most places I tried.  The whole family have something to enjoy at the hotel.",50
"My second stay at venetian.  Room : 14018 &14020(south wing,cotai view), 10/3/13 ~ 13/3/13  Same room type, bella suite. Nice and comfy enough to house 5-6 people comfortably. 2 double beds + sofa bed.  Staff encountered are still as nice, but .. when i compared to my stay at Sheraton( which is opp at Sands cotai) , the staff there are much much more in numbers to help you. Here, i realized, number of staff have diminished, and sometimes you can't find a person to ask for directions, which is a a little fraustrating.  The room that we stayed in this time, i suspect is the smoking floor, because the smoke smell along the corridor is very strong. But our room is ok, clean and fresh smelling.. it's just the corridors. Maybe the hotel can consider installing some air freshner or…",40
"This hotel us simply humongous!  One could get lost walking in the shopping arcade.  Fortunately signages are pretty good.  I like the shuttle buses run by the hotel - well organized and give comfortable rides.  The food court offers a variety of food, much lower-priced than those offered in the numerous restaurants.  The concierge desk is well manned and offers good service.",40
"The hotel was great , specially the shopping center underneath was amazing. Only thing i didn't like was hotel lobby. It was really confusing as there was so many desks also getting to the pool area was a long walk. But rooms wise it was very clean and comfortable.",40
From the moment we checked in to the moment we checked out all the staff are so kind and very hospitable especially the Filipino staffs! They are very helpful and attentive to all our queries.  The room are so clean and well arranged. Stunning decor and the view is superb! I would love to come back again but next time with the whole family!!,50
"I have heard so much good things about this hotel, and finally got a chance to try it myself. Like many of my friends has said, it was magnificient. The room is classy and comfortable, although look standard without surprise. The washroom is impressive, roomy. Long walking distance to restaurants and all other shopping places. A lot of shops but not quite practical.",40
"The resort hotel was just great, it has almost everything from great large suite rooms, shops, restaurants/ food courts, entertainment, casino, etc... The room was very large, it can accommodate the four of us ( 2 adults and 2 teenage ), not to mention the large toilet/ washroom, and the area for family gathering ( sofa + table ). The room was just great, with great amenities.....The set up of the rooms were classic and stylish... Breakfast was great, but the location is rather far from the hotel room... Our kids enjoyed the stay in the venetian resort hotel...  Above all, this is really a resort for the young and families, where fun, noise, distance is not a problem... For some, this hotel will be too noisy, to far, and rather far from other places.....",40
"Best place in Macau better than galaxy........I stayed at both the places...Venetian weaves magic at a different level ..highly recommend this p,ace over galaxy....just like a home Away from home with fantastic concierge services.....I checked in within ten minutes unlike what the other people say.....even my luggage arrived on time and the shuttle services are really good ....an experience of a lifetime :)))))",50
"Wow .. By far the best ever hotel stay that I have had till now .. Opulence and the grandeur with which it is presented .. we stayed here for 2 nights and wished that we could spend more nights & money at the casino .. !!  Amazing service (room service, f&b's) and a great place to do some sightseeing as well. For us, Macao started with Venetian and ended here .. so much so that we did not want to go for a sightseeing tour of the macao tower :) .. !!  Get a room as high as possible for a magnificent view of the city .. !!",50
"Its the Venetian.  We live in Las Vegas, so we know what to expect.  They matched and exceeded our expectations.  We also had a mix up on reserving a room at the Las Vegas location that they helped us clear us immediately.  Service was spectacular.  The breakfast buffet at Cafe Deco was WONDERFUL.  I would recommend this place to everyone :-).",50
"Went to Macau in the middle of a Hong Kong trip and stayed here for a night. Got a deal from agoda.com so the price we paid was significantly lower than it should have been. Since we took the ferry from HK in the morning, we went around sightseeing for a while before heading to the hotel for the check-in in the afternoon.   However, there was a hiccup at the check-in counter when the staff told us that agoda.com sent the booking with the wrong dates. Luckily, they managed to sort this out so thankfully, we still got our room in the end. Another good thing was that, given the price we paid, it was a pleasant surprise to see a suite rather than a normal hotel room so that explains why this hotel is huge. In fact, too huge to navigate around because we got lost while trying to find…",40
"I should be fair and start by stating from the outset that my stay at The Ventian was for a 3 day conference.  Check in, given the large number of people was very quick and smooth, quite impressed. I don't know the name of the room but it was their standard room.  The room was very spacious, split level with a king bed.  The bathroom was full marble with a separate shower and bath, very nicley appointed.  Toilet was seperate. Room had a tv in the bedroom and one in the lounge.  I would have liked a sound dock for my iPod but not a big issue.  Bed was very comfortable, and plenty of pillows to choose from.  The hotel is made of of course of the casino, then there are lots of shops, very much like an up market shopping centre.  As well appointed as the rooms were, this hotel was…",40
"This hotel resort is only 5 min. from the airport. The decoration is simply marvelous. Every room is least a suite. The property has over 600 shops for those that like to buy stuffs. The casino has everything that Las Vegas has. The staffs is courteous and always smiling. Lots of tourist from Mainland China & other countries. There is food courts & many restaurants inside. There is also a golf course, swimming pool and various recreational facilities to fill your needs. The hotel has free shuttle bus service from and to the airport.",40
Was amazed with the royal and luxurious suites - truly felt so pampered !! We stayed for three nights and enjoyed every moment of our stay. Hotel is so huge you tend to get lost amidst the various shops - guess the shopping arcade has all the leading brands. The hotel is done up just like Venice in Italy and has gondola rides inside the hotel premises. Do not miss the gondola ride (though it is not as exciting as compared with the one in Venice but still worth an experience). There's an amazing golf course on the 7th floor and swimming pools on the 3rd floor. Have no words to describe the huge casino. Will definitely visit again !!,50
"The pulse of Macau, this massive resort sits on the Cotai Strip and is truly an icon.  There are hundreds of shops before you reach the main lobby, and the hotel is adequately staffed. Lighting is warm throughout and the hotel is littered with fresh flowers and interesting statues.  Also features their world-renowned casino where millions of tourists have flocked to.  Everything is grand and classy at this hotel, I cannot pinpoint any faults.  You will be spoilt with entertainment choices as well, with world-class acts that they bring in and endless dining options.  Suites are huge, huge, huge, with lovely gold hardware from doorknobs to bathroom fixtures.  Beds are fit for kings and corridors are well-carpeted.  Probably the pride of Macau, every tourist should stay in this…",50
"Overall stay is good. Second stay after 5 years, furnishing is wear out.  Shower pressure is low, dislike!!  Beware the package，we unable to take our lunch package at fogo sambal, they told us the lunch packAge is not available but while booking n written on our hotel passport it is listed.",40
"This is so far the best hotel we had stayed in. We got a promotional Titanic Package for 2 nites stay in early January2013 and we truly enjoyed our stay. The hotel and the mall was huge. There were people everywhere. The staff and receptionist were very well trained and we were able to check in within half an hour. That was really really great. The suite was really awesome and very spacious! The bathroom was excellent! We fell in love with this suite immediately.  The mall has more than 600 shop lots.. we had great time shopping and dine-in, we also visited the casino ...  We have free breakfast for 2 but no wifi, Everything here was just prefect. There is also free shuttle bus to the ferry and other hotels..",50
What a hotel :) It is a dream hotel in which everyone would like to stay once . It is one of the biggest casino hotel in Macau . It has a flavour of Italy and Venice in its kind . It has a great shopping arcade with amazing gondola rides inside the hotel premises . The rooms are very huge and amazing with excellent interior and state of the art washrooms . I would really like to come back for more fun and leisure and experience .,50
"Check-in was warm & welcoming . We were traveling with hand carried luggages & decided to make our own way to the room. Staying in the South wing of the building, we had to cut through the casino. The room was stunningly beautiful & I felt like royalty. (Similar to SG's Marina Bay Sands, but of a different concept) 1 night stay wasn't enough! The design of the entire area was eye-catching & unforgettable. Will definitely be back for a longer stay in the near future.",50
"I stayed at The Venetian Macau, got an early bird promo which was very worth it. Took free shuttle from ferry terminal to the hotel, welcomed by helpful staffs and so amazed when entering the luxury main lobby.  The room was beautiful with victorian style. I really love it! The room that i took was Bella Suite, twin bed fit for 4 people and overlooking the Galaxy Hotel. You can use the living room for extra bed. I was surprised because there are 2 televisions, one in the living room and another one in front of the bed. Wow.  The bathroom was so nice and beautiful as well. Perfect.  Unfortunately, they don't have free wifi and breakfast. They are extra charged. The hotel has a big casino, shopping center, food court and free shuttle bus from/to ferry terminal and another places.…",50
"We stayed at the Venetian Hotel Bella Suite last Feb 2012. It was awesome that we went back this February and it just got better! The hotel was so grand and the housekeeping staff (hi Paul and Jonathan!) were very hospitable and friendly. They answered our inquiries on how to get around the place. Very punctual also just as what the reception area has promised to provide extra bedding, toiletries etc. We really miss the instrumental music that plays whenever we open the telly - it will always remind us of our wonderful stay. Very nostalgic for us. The canals,gondolas and shops are marvelous. A variety of good dishes at the food court. Plus the outdoor ambiance. The main lobby is so grand. Ah! just wanna go there again and check out what's new!",50
"Just stayed there for a weekend.  Very enjoyable trip.  Pros  Everything under one roof.  A very wide range of shops, restaurants, pools, attractions, games room for kids - you can easily spend the whole day in the hotel (which was good as the weather was crap on Saturday).  Plus gambling, of course - other than a quick go on the Megabucks slot machine we did not gamble as we had a kid with us.  Rooms were great - very big, comfortable beds, separate sitting room and excellent bathroom.  Very good for families in particular.  The service - for a massive hotel I had expected the service to be weak. However, this was not the case - there are lots of helpful staff members all over the hotel and room service was also very quick.  There are sometimes lines at the concierge but…",40
"The Venetian Macau, GRAND GRAND GRAND!!!   This hotel is huge and how! I visited the property earlier in 2011 and visited again in Feb 13. It is a very well maintained property, the staff is always eager to help and courteous from the concierge to the reception.   The rooms are a duplicate of the Venetian in Las Vegas. Huge, spacious, well layed out, and very well maintained. The Bathroom is equally superior! See the pictures. The only disappointment is that it’s a long walk from the reception lobby to the north or south zone of the hotel and then a further walk from the Elevator. So it’s a good exercise overall LOL   You will be amazed by the sheer grandness of this place and apart from the casino there is a huge shopping area near Gondola ride. Also next to it is a very well…",50
"We stayed at The Venetian late last year and we were blown away by the beautiful decor and the size of the room. I thought for the quality of the rooms the price was very reasonable. We got a package deal on their own website that included a half day tour of Macau as well. We loved walking around the shops along the canals, not quite Venice but an excellent replica. Even though the gondoliers are all asian they still belt out the Italian songs as they float past. My only complaint was if anything the hotel is just too big! It can take ages to get from your room to another location within the hotel.",40
"Amazing hotel, huge lobby, luxurious suites , excellent location , superb service the SPA in the hotel is very nice , excellent service you can find all kind of facilities from the SPA to the professional massage service I enjoyed my stay there , the lobby is huge , the check in and the check out is well organised, the shopping mall is huge and has all branded names  I really liked the hotel.",50
"The Venetian is a magnificent resort. Huge-if you want to describe this hotel. Everything Right from the entrance,lobby,way to rooms,room itself everything is huge.There wasnt a thing I could say which was small.Even the bathroom was like a bedroom.You have everything you'd need (Casino included) within the resort. The rooms are luxurious and very well appointed. There is usually at least one good show that one can attend when one is in the resort.Free shuttle between hotel and ferry pier. Inside artificial river and clouds also really fabulous.  Good location to watch shows and shopping mall was good.Besides that everything is just perfect. Will definedly be back.",50
"We stayed here in October last year and I must say that it was an experience that we will most definately return to.  The size of the hotel is quite daunting but once you are in your room and get your bearings it is quite easy to find your way around the Resort. We stayed in a Royal Suite which was huge, nicely decorated, very clean and had all the amenities one would need.  We ate in the food court and also expereined some of the many restaurants and cafes around the complex. The only problem we encountered was with breakfast which was complimentary but front desk didn't issue us with a voucher which caused problems on arrival at breakfast....a quick call to front desk and we thought the problem was fixed but the breakfast staff still came to us with a bill at the end of…",50
"If you want to describe the stars i guess every one will say something but difficult to describe them, this is the same when you want to describe the stay in the Venetian full of enjoyment for all family members without doubts make sure to book for three night if you want to enjoy fully in this royal property and which surronded as well by alot of nice resorts as well such as Galaxy, four seasons, city of dreams don't miss it's the show.....etc",50
"u need one whole day just to get to know the hotel... Sooo big... The biggest attractions r gondola ride... N when ur wandering in the hotel, u cant know what time is it... U get to choose the restaurant for the buffet breakfast... 3-4 options... Rooms r huge... Pool is good... Truly the best place to stay when in macau",50
"The hotel is humongous! One could get lost between the check-in area and their room. There's a lot of activity everywhere, there's the mall, a foodcourt and of course the casino within the complex. There's simply not enough time to experience them all. I was amazed though, at how quiet and elegant things are when you reach your floor and then your room. We got a Bella Suite, and man oh man, it lived up to the expectation. We got two TVs, a nice view of the Cotai Strip, and a spacious and very clean toilet and bath.   There are free shuttles to and from the airport and ferry terminals, any hotel worth its salt in Macau have this, so transportation isn't really a problem. One special touch is that everytime I dial room service, they make an effort to mention my name, felt nice. …",40
"First i arrive in macau from hong kong the bus was there and it was full but atleast i have a seat with my family. After minutes we arrived at the hotel i was fascinated by the size of the hotel and i could say this is the biggest hotel ever. Everything you need is in a one place like resto's , bars , malls , gym , pool and mostly casino. The room is nice the pillows were fluffy and the rooms design is very nice it focuses venetian style and i felt like gold was around us. The facilities around the hotel is nice. But it ends there , what i don't like about this hotel it is crowded when you arrive dozens of people lining up in the check in area the feeling of the 5-7 star hotel i guess wasn't in there. And whenever you go you smell cigarette smoke everywhere (to non-smokers you…",40
On our first visit to Macau everyone of my friends who had been there earlier recommended to stay at the Venetian. So thats what I did. I transferred by ferry and the hotel bus is always available outside which takes you straight to The Venetian at no extra cost and no prior booking is required for it too. At the reception there were around 7 receptionists helping guests check in such was the rush. We traveled close to the Chinese New Year. Had to wait for around 10 minutes to check in which was quite disappointing. Wanted to get some currency converted so asked the reception lady and she happily told me that I may get a better rate at the bank that was situated inside the hotel than with her. I was very pleased with that and did so. Most of the hotels will never recommend such…,40
"Had gone here for a company meet. Felt like I was in a palace of sorts! The plush interiors- with all their majestic glory- the luxurious carpets, the tapestry, the exquisite chandeliers...the passageways to the rooms lit up with little lamps along the way, the dining areas, the pool area...everything! The shopping complex was an experience in itself! The best of International brands were present here...for those who just wanted to window shop, the gondolas and various photo points kept them well engaged. There are also lot of dedicated areas for conferences, meeting as well as hosting events. There's a lot to explore in the casino too! We didn't get time to explore Macau city because The Venetian kept us happily engaged for 3 whole days! Overall, an experience of a lifetime! Go…",50
"Pros: Very big hotel Check in was fast Good location Mall is just below the hotel Large rooms Cleaning staff were friendly Shopping&Dining options Casino  Cons: Very crowded on the mall area Some travel desk can't understand english No free wifi  Overall it was a good hotel, they even didn't charge us for consuming the beverages and chips on the room, or maybe they forgot. Our room overlooks the Galaxy Hotel. Checking out took us roughly 15mins. Too bad we didn't experience going to the casino though.",40
"Like Vegas, very large Hotels with lots of walking and getting lost.  Like Vegas good to say you've done it.  The suites are very very nice it has to be said. The concierge staff are very good very helpful but you still feel anonymous. Lots of Chinese Korean and Japanese visitors of course and the lack of queuing and lift entry / exit etiquette takes some getting used to. As I always saw, queing is something we do very well, it became very popular here during the war apparently.  In the end you just have to push and barge as they do or you never get anywhere. Vibe La Difference they say.  The breakfast is an unpleasant experience, watch how the kitchen staff use their tea towels, sneezing into them, wiping their hands and noses, puts you off.  Easy to get lost in the shopping…",40
"This hotel is 9/10. Food, casino, shopping, everything is very very good.  It's a little bit easy to get lost for a few minutes but that's common in mega resorts.  The Venetian in Vegas is MUCH nicer. If you compare this hotel to the one in Vegas there's no comparison. Vegas Venetian is absolutely better.  The hallways and rooms in Vegas are beautiful where as the hallways in the Macau location look like they were done on a budget. Also the tv in te Macau location is an old tube style. Very strange. But as far as Macau hotels go, Venetian is very good.  I would however recommend the hard rock hotel more.  Nicer casino, higher quality rooms and hallways and elevators. A more 5 star feel. And awesome awesome swimming pool at hard rock.  Venetian has giant rooms. Around 700 sq…",50
GOODS  room was large with a great bathroom  doorman was very friendly and welcomed guests  decor of room was great especially the bathroom   BADS check in was slow and reception staff need to be more customer serviced focused,40
the venetian is surely the best place to stay when you are in sin city macau. It has the biggest casino in the world. The rooms are great and most of them offer you a great view. The rooms are very well done up and the service is great. The highlite is also the shops at the grand canal with tastefully done up interiors ...it almost make you feel like you are in Venice. I would rate this hotel as an attraction that is a must see rather than a hotel where you must stay!!!!!!!!,50
This is by far the best hotel I have been to. Rooms are so huge and spacious can fit up to 4 to 5 persons. Bathroom is so gorgeous. Famous and expensive brands are all accessible. Wide array of Fast Food inside the hotel are available for the convenience of the guest. Promo buffet breakfast or lunch are also available upon request. For those adults who wants to try their luck can drop by at the casino. Very Festive mood during Chinese New Year!,50
"This place is good for those who dont want o leave their hotel. You have the mall, good food places, live music, like a million pools, night club and of course the casino. The room was lux and lavish with all the trimmings. However, to get from our room to the pool area took not kidding - 45mins walking!  So if you just wanna hang here or go across to the COD, stay here its a good spot for shopping, gambling, partying etc. If you want to see more of the old Macao, then take a taxi over to the old town and eat at one of the traditional chinese restaurants.  The one problem is if you leave a cash deposit and use it up, they will lock you out of your room (one of our friends)...so not fun late at night going all the way upstairs to the north wing.. and coming all the way back down…",40
"There are some fantastic weekday deals in Macau as the hotels and casinos continue to thrive and the Venetian has one of the best. We went for a quick overnight trip to check out the titantic exhibit and were not disappointed.   For about $1600 HKD, we were provided with a suite for 2, tickets to the titantic exhibit and either breakfast or lunch from one of the hotels many restaurants. In addition the package also came with a host of other freebies - welcome drinks at mcsorley, ice skating, a gondola ride or one way ticket back to HK and a photo in their lobby.  The room was well appointed - it had a sunken living room area, huge bathroom with separate shower and bath and king sized bed. The Venetian itself had one of the better hotel shopping areas and loads of choice for food…",50
"Its by far the best property i have ever been to. The room size, the luxury, the casino, the food, the restaurants, the city inside, gondola rides, swim pool, spa, golf, cinema, Acrobatic Circus the list isssss endless. Could not anything else from the Hotel.  Its just next to the airport, and now they have even started to checkin the luggage for the flight right inside the hotel itself.  This is a must stay property if you visiting cotai strip, and it is a replica of the one at Las Vegas  Pros: Its a city inside the hotel. It hosts about 4 gold course( not sure, min 4 i came to know), 6 swim pools and what not. the rooms are too big (as all are suites), the rooms give a luxury feeling  Cons: The hotel is tooo huge, it takes time to check in and check out, the service also…",50
"I have stayed in Venetian Resort last year with my parents and we had a great time. The room is great size and services was great.   The room has separate into two compartment with a bedding area and living area. However I think the TV is quite small, because we have a twin room, I love the single bed curtain which provide some privacy :)   Not to mention, the location is super convenient with a lot of shuttle bus outside that basically takes you anywhere. Venetian Resort also has the biggest shopping mall with all kinds of brand and shops, you won't choose wrong if you are a shopaholic!",40
"I love The Venetian. Rooms are large and stunning. Beds and pillows are so comfortable! May I ask if it's the memory type pillow? Shopping area is huge (man, I loved shopping there!). Slot machines are plenty!   The Venetian is like a small city! It has everything. It offers a lot to its guests and visitors. I've recommended this to my friends, and will definitely recommend this to everyone who will be traveling to Macau.",50
"Me and my family visited this hotel during Jan 2013. I booked a room that can fit to 4 person. No doubt, the room is big! 2 Big beds and a small living room and with the ensuite bathroom room. Nice! The hotel is still well maintained. The room is not hard to find, the map from the key card is clear.Check in was fine too and the hotel is able to find us a clean room upon check in. The hotel service was efficiency too. The only thing that the hotel can consider maybe to have wireless wifi in all area. Also, the TV in the room can also change to flat screen and the pillow is a bit too soft for me, Overall i still consider the hotel still have some room for improvement and hope to have a well maintained luxury five star hotel in Macau.",40
i stay in hotel for 2 days  but i suggest to all please stay min 3 days bcoz  this hotel is very big & lots of thing to see in this hotel. what to tell about room its amazing  every thing is perfect . i love to stay one more time  . best thing is casino  its very lively.  in hotel  shopping arcade is very huge you will  lost in hotel while shopping. hotel give some free activities  like some show & give some mop for spend in restaurant .,50
"The Rooms are big and well appointed. So if you're into space then this is for you. The facilities and surrounding shopping are first class and if you're into gaming then I'm sure they have what you need. Great choice of onsite restaurants and shopping. Amazing Venice architecture complete with condolas and artifical sky.We had a wonderful time at the Venetian... The front desk personel were extremely courteous and very helpful...  Finally, Macau is very expensive and the Venetian is no exception.",50
"My family and I stayed in the spacious Bella Suites and it made for a great weekend! We primarily picked the hotel because we were going to The House of Dancing Water show and didn't want to have to trek too far. The bathrooms were gorgeous and the living room had everything I needed to get my work done. For a short weekend in Macau, the Venetian was perfect. I'd definitely stay here again!",50
"This resort is amazing, beautiful and huge. You will never run out of things to do.  Feeling lucky - gamble at the downstairs casino. Need some retail therapy - many luxury brands are just a step out of your room. Peckish - there's a giant food court offering a variety of delish dishes. Lastly sick of the resort, then take the bridge to one of the other casinos surrounding the area.  Service was great, rooms comfortable and I left my phone behind after check out, the staff were very helpful in aiding me to get it back.   Would definitely return",40
"We checked in under group arrival. The resort is huge and lot of people which made it look crowded and quite inconvenient in the lobby area. It could be understood but there is way to be resolved and improved.  We booked 3 rooms and all are spacious. Amenities was complete, bathroom, bedroom and living room were cleaned. The furniture may looks quite old, positively it all are still in good condition though. The room was really convenient to sleep.  Breakfast was crowded and packed of people. We managed to get seat after few minutes queuing. Breakfast served variation of food. But it seem like they had sort of waiter/waitress.  We asked for coffee and tea for few times, and they didn't serve us till we done for b/fast.  We can have a shopping anytime we want during operation…",50
the venetian macao is the best hotel experience i have had in my life..  A warm pool and a jacuzzi... 5.5 lakh square feet of casino... The best shopping brands available in the world and the rooms with facilitoes to satisfy a king... It certainly is worth the money u pay for the place,40
The Venetian resort in Macau is one of the best structures built by human beings. Infact I would rate it as one of the most beautiful things to see after natural beauty. The resort has around 3500 suites and the casinos inside the hotel are worth spending time and money at. The whole experience is out of the world.,50
"Enjoy my stay at the Venetian. Great location and facilities. Connected to Cotai Central via bridge or free shuttle services. No need to go anywhere else. From family fun, explore, restaurants and everything over there. Would recommend this Hotel to all travelers around the world . A must visit venue....",50
"Hi All,  We stayed in Ventian Macao for a night and we really loved the experience. Property was really nice with lot of things to do inside the hotel such as Casion, Gandola rides, Shopping mall etc. Rooms was amazing with very good service.",40
"First time staying overnight in Macau with kids, we took them to see a show.  The hotel is everything you expect, huge, glitzy but having been forearmed about service it was much better than expectations.  All the staff were really happy and attentive so we will be sure to head back. ",40
I stayed in Venetian Macau for 1 night and took the Bella Suite.. The room was very huge to accomodate 2 persons.. The experience is unforgettable.. Macau is so beautiful with lots of beautiful hotels.. ,50
"We were group of three friends travelling from Hong Kong , we  enjoyed our stay in Venetian Macau. We had booked the titanic package which had free tickets to shows, free lunch or breakfast, free  ferry transfer  to Hong Kong.   Venetian is an enormous hotel, you don't even have to leave the hotel, its got everything under one roof.300 rooms ,  The room we got was on the South Lobby which was a suite with view of the Cotai Strip, size was enormous, well decorated and comfortable. Two Televisions with all basic amenities. House Keeping was excellent and so was room service. There is so much to do and see in the Venetian , Shopping, shows, casino , gym, pool , concierge service was excellent.   This hotel definitely exceeded our expectation & was one of the best luxury hotels we…",40
"The resort was enormous and that is just an understatement.  I think the Casino management wants you to remain on their property so that you don't venture anywhere else.  If not for the casino shuttle bus it was difficult to get around and venture to Macau.  After one outing, we struggled to make our way back to the Venetian.  There were no taxis willing to stop and pick us up from Macau back to The Venetian.  It took us over one hour to try to get back and we were late for a dinner engagement. After spending 3 nights at the Venetian....really was more than enough. If you want to explore other parts of Macau and engage in the local culture perhaps choose another location.",40
I enjoyed my stay in Venetian Macau due to big room and spectacular view. Great casino and close to the hip hop of Macau don't missed waterworld show! The service is great and overall stay is enjoyable!,40
"There Was free luxury bus from airport to hotel every 20-30 min. check in was bit hectic, there was a long Que. at  check in counter.  And check in staff looked very much under stress. Room was very beautiful and comfortable. the interior were amazing and very impressive. Attention was paid to every small detail in the room. Room service staff was also very attentive and friendly. The food we ordered looked very good and tasted even better. The best part of the hotel was the 24 hour casino. And a huge shopping mall with restaurant from all over the world.  This hotel definitely exceeded our expectation & was one of the best luxury hotels we have ever stayed in.",50
"We stayed at the Venetian last December 2012 and it was an interesting experience...from the casino floor to the opulent rooms.  The split-level suite was convenient as we were able to watch the 2 TV sets simultaneously without disrupting the other side of the room.  The LARGE bathroom was lovely, although the bathroom could have used some updating as the gold taps have lost their color.  Smoke from the non-smoking casino permeated throughout the space - even into the hotel room.  Once we got used to the smell and accepted it as a fact of life, our party of non-smokers didn't mind it as much as the initial whiff that bombarded us when we got in.  I appreciated the efficient and speedy service, especially with check-in and check-out at the main lobby considering the large room…",40
"Venetian Macao is a feast for the eyes. Really over the top, but in a good way, as that's what we want in a surreal place like Macao. First off, the Bella Suite (and no doubt all suites) are massive by Hong Kong/Macao standards, over 700 sq.ft. In fact, our room was nearly twice the size of my Hong Kong flat! Probably the largest and most gorgeous bathroom we've ever seen in a hotel, and everything spotless and well supplied. Huge tub, huge shower, separate WC, dressing table, marble and glass and simply beautiful.   Our room had two huge double beds and a sitting room area down a step or two, with a sofa, table and chairs, desk and another television (as if you have time for telly in Macao!). Large windows with views out to the Cotai Strip. Everything was spotless, which we…",40
"Venetian Resort provides full entertainment for a family as Venice type, and for feeling and for adults in one of the largest Casino’s. The hospitality is appreciable, the resort provides comfortable and hassle free pick and drop from ferry/airport. Suites are very cozy and comfortable to provide best in luxury. The Food Court inside almost provides most of international cuisines",50
"Spacious rooms, 24 hour casino, over 20 different restaurants, shopping malls, entertainment- the venetian provides all for a family holiday. However, if you are looking for a quite place- this is not the place to be.",40
"We only stayed one night , we arrived at 1100 which was too early to check in , some chap met us when we emerged from the taxi and said he would look after the bags until check in . We checked in at 2pm , My husband gave the baggage label to the receptionist , she was very cool calm and collected but her face showed panic .She explained this was not the hotels label and straight away I thought , bags have been stolen . Cut a long story short a chap from behind the desk called Dennis took over to deal with the problem .I have to say he was very efficient and very calming .As we were walking to the room , I asked my husband to recheck his wallet and there was the proper label . Dennis went off to sort out the bags and rung the room twice to see if they had arrived. Very impressed…",50
"The Venetian reminded me a lot of the one in Vegas.  There were moments where I thought that I was there.  The hotel was nice.  We only stayed one night and checked in close to midnight, so we didn't really have enough time to enjoy it.  We did ask for late check out when we arrived, and at first she said that she would give us until noon since checkout is 11.  When we asked for 1, she hesitated but gave it to us.  The room was great, again, reminded me of Vegas.  The only complaint, and I should have called to complain was the room next to us.  Not sure how many men were staying in there, but we had fallen asleep around 4-5 am, and these boisterous men started up at 6am!!  The place was really busy, even on a Monday.  Loved the free shuttle.  The oat ride back to Hong Kong is…",40
The architecture of the hotel is awesome. The whole structure is so beautifully built that one does not like to leave the hotel. The staff and the service adds a philip to the greatness of the hotel. Every thing in the hotel is so great that it cannot be described in few words or paragraphs.,50
The Venetian is a great place by day and even better place by night.  I rue the fact that we went there as part of a busines strip and had no choice to stay longer.  The hotel has so much to offer - from shopping to casino to a gondola ride and an Italian feel on that floor with the restaurants that the rooms seem to be just there by chance. The whole place can take up to 3 days for one to do justice to leave alone try and be familiar with.  The place is well lit by night and a sight to watch from close and from far.  The shops are nice - you have from cosmetics to Chinese oils and medicines to latest gadgets - you name it its there.  Casino is real good and a good alternative to Vegas closer home for Asian travellers. All in all a must watch.,50
It's a ultimate luxury on this continent. Staff is very co-operative. Systems are perfect. Nothing is to write except excellence. Only one suggestion that lot of visitors are coming from various part of the developing countries and they are not well acquaited with the systems. So those visitors should be provided staff personally who can guide the visitors intially to understand the systems.,50
"The whole experience waz mesmerizing and the rooms were too good and the whole hotel was like paradise, and the casino waz awsum u can spend ur whole life... Shopping in venetian is marvelous as u'll get almost all the brands out over there and its so large that its less to see the whole of it in 5 days also.....",50
"I stayed at the realtor suite and the suite is huge and luxurious with a big living room. Checking in to the hotel was a nightmare though as there are too many people in line and so had to carry my own luggage! However that apart generally the experience was great as there is so much to do around the hotel- Casino, Shopping, did the Titanic tour, HUman body tour, live dances around the casino going on etc. Lot of variety of food is available - the Indian food is quite good here and even late into the night after gambling you can get kaali daal veg korma etc yummy food for people coming from India who miss their late night dhaba food haha. Really recommend staying here rather than hard rock ( located just opposite Venetian) which is nothing spectacular in comparison.",50
"We Went There With my friends  , its not a hotel it is a town like venetia  ,great experience of shopping ,food ,fun ,gambling, theatre , gaming etc in hotel  it is a world best hotel i cant write about it ,it is  like paradise in earth.",50

External & internal decor is beautiful with variety of shopping area, huge gambling area with well protection to keep out minor, every day having good shows & program, excellent swimming pool & golf ground. A little expensive but worth spent amount. My self, wife & son enjoyed & felt as if we are VIP.",50

"Went there with family and I must say its a really big hotel, I stayed there for 3 nights still couldn't see the whole hotel. The Venice canal and the architecture is as beautiful and authentic as life. Its a all suite hotel with big bathrooms. Staff is helpful and quick (keeping in mind the size of hotel). Do not forget the casino, one of the best casino's I have ever seen (won a huge booty). If you are in Macau its a must stay.",50
"The Venetian Macau is by all means the true meaning of Luxury and Royalty. It is definitely the Mecca of Luxury and Entertainment. The hotel has around 3000 suites, 3 huge malls, Shoppes Grand Canal, Shoppes at Four Seasons and Shoppes Cotai Central and a huge food court with cuisines from all around the world. It also houses the world's biggest casino, where one can try his luck over a wide range of electronic and card games but the smoking in the casino was a turn-off. We stayed in The Bella Suite, which was a real huge room with 2 queen size beds and a small living area. It makes you feel just like you are in Vegas. The room also had a beautiful large bathroom with beautiful decorative. The hotel staff is very friendly and truly professional. The check-in and check-out…",50

"The first impression when you get into the hotel is the immensity, and the worry to get lost. But then after getting the resort map and possibly walking around a little, you will be more at ease. I stayed in a suite at the South wing, with comfortable bed and spacious living area. The bath room is big with all amenities. The hotel is considerate enough to provide adaptor, very useful if you don't have English standard devices. Have tried a bar and several restaurants at the south wing, which are all very good and fairly priced. There should be 4 or 5 swimming pools outside. One of these are heated, so you can swim even during winter times. Mind the long distance to the pools however, depending where you stay, which could take you easily 5 minutes or more. There is children play…",40
I stayed in this hotel for two nights in Jan 2013.  It is one of the largest hotels in the world with 3000 rod and the worlds largest casino.  Rooms were quite spacious and clean. One problem which was faced by us was the sheer size of hotel. It was very difficult at times to find our way around. Many times we kept walking in circles to reach the room.  The best thing I liked during the stay was the Titanic exhibition. You can almost feel like onboard the ship. A must visit by everyone.  Though large but the checkin and checkout process was very efficient.  I would strongly recommend people visiting Macau to stay at this property. A unique experience.,40
"If management are reading his I would like to mention the top class service we had from your check in desk - an Indian Lady called Susan, very very professional and efficient.   I had made a mistake with my booking and she sorted everything out in no time at all.  I booked Las Vegas instead of Macau!   The hotel was perfect from start to finish.  All staff were excellent even opening and closing doors for you.  Shuttle bus staff very organised.  Concierge brilliant.  Wouldn't hesitate in booking this hotel, rooms lovely, views amazing.   Went to see the Panda's - 5 mins in taxi which cost about £2 and an entrance fee of 90p !   Couldn't believe it was so cheap, there was a bit of a zoo there too with other animals to see.  House of dancing water show was excellent.  Couple of…",50

"This was my second stay at the Venetian in Macau; Both times we have stayed in the Cielo Suite. Both time’s we have been impressed. The rooms are always spotless and beautiful, the beds are comfortable and the bath rooms are stunning. Once you are in your room you could easily feel like you were staying in one of Italy’s top hotels.  However all of this pales in comparison to the amazing lobby and shops. The attention to detail is fantastic. You really do feel like you are in Italy. The only let down is because of the size of the hotel and the amount of people walking through the hotel to shop and gamble you don’t really feel like a guest, more of a number. Check in took well over 40 minutes both times and check out was not much shorter. The first time we were offered mineral…",40
"Venetian Macau is all about Royalness and luxury in a big package. The hotel is so huge that it was pain for us to and come again from our rooms. Like the hotel, rooms were also BIG and Super Royal. This is the best stay I had in my life. Ultimate luxury. Each and everything in the room was just perfect. Very impressed.  After some rest, we planned to explore Macau and started with Venetian itself. But this hotel is so big and has so many thing to offer you that one might spend all the time there itself as we did. They have created an entire city inside this hotel which is a complete tourist destination in itself. Mall, restaurants, entertainment center, casino, gondola ride in canal and what not is there. This resort itself is perfect for a full day visit. We did go outside but…",50
"When deciding which hotel to stay in Macau, my wife and I went through the various pictures and reviews. The pictures of The Venetian did not look that great, but I realized why now that I've been there... and it is because they used yellow in their decor, and warm lighting, and that makes everything look yellow... so, don't let the pictures discourage you from staying here. The rooms are great! Big! There is a huge bathroom with a room for the toilet bowl itself. The full range of amenities are provided. There is the bedroom area, and then a whole living room. There is one TV in the bedroom, and one more in the living room. There is also a multi-function printer/fax/copy machine in the room.  In terms of the sleep quality, I found the pillows way to soft for me, but other than…",40
"We selected Venetian where we can go for shooping and with the gondola ride, so that my two grandchildren can be always entertaint, if the wheater become real cold. The hotel is as good and people say that the gambling and hotel revenue is even better than The Venetian in LV.   I think so too, because the food and room rates are higher than the one in LV. The gambling events is only in Chinese, so non-chinese speaking guests could not participate. Although no commision, the options and table rules give less chance to win.  We miss the $ 5, lobster tail and steak, the super deal on buffet offered by hotels in LV. Anyway The Venetian require to give further trainings to the (ground) staff. Especially for the English language and the true meaning of hospitality. Front Office staff,…",50
"I had 3 nights there. 2days of normal and 1day of upgraded room. Upgraded rooms are perfect, so big and with lot of extras. Normal rooms are avg., bit poor comparing to upgraded. The mall and hotel is huge, hard to find places you want. In the middle, there is the casino. That's cool, but my GF is 18yo, and can't go trough. Thats why, going to our suite was hard and loong... This is not really good...",40
"Everything about the Venetian Hotel and Casino is on a grand scale. This is the largest inhabited building in the world and it is easy to get lost when wandering around in it.  Our hotel room was palatial and exceptionally comfortable. The bathroom was probably the best I have seen in any hotel anywhere in the world with marble everywhere and luxury fixtures. In spite of the luxury the price was not over the top. They obviously want to attract you to stay there to lose your shirt in the casino.  The view from our high level room down the Cotai strip was stunning, particularly at night with the nearby Galaxy Casino lit up like a Christmas tree.   The whole Venetian theme was spectacular with indoor Venetian canals and gondolas propelled by opera singing Chinese gondoliers. A bit…",50
"We loved the room.  A split level room with a great view of the Cotai area.  The bed was very comfortable.  The sofa bed was OK for 2 kids.  Would be better if there was a curtain to separate the 2 areas, but this is not a big deal. The bathroom was great. The downside to this hotel is the amount of walking and the confusing layout.  We still got lost on our 3rd day trying to find the lobby!    If you have children you are not allowed to walk through the casino, so it is a long confusing walk to the hotel lifts from the lobby areas.   Lunch at Bamboo was great, but breakfast at Cafe Deco was below average.  We only dined there because it was part of our package.",50
"Stayed at Bella Suite with 3 childrens and it was great experience. Good transports, huge room, great location. Didn't try the breakfast and pool. Room was huge and clean with great shopping arcade and food court. The Titanic exhibition was a big plus. Just fell the room need more lights.",50
"Awesome! We spent lots of days with full of energy staying in one beautiful room. This huge and lovely hotel was basically one of our destination in Asia. Hotel rooms are quite fabulous with nice spectacular views of Cotai Strip and other hotels in a row. Bathroom is big and clean. Breakfast quite reasonable and foods are quite delicious. Very good service was rendered. Spending much time to the cozy restaurants and amazing numbers of shoppes where you don't need to travel and find outlets of signature brands, from shoes to comfort bags and clothing. All in one roof! Crowded with lots of visitors coming all around the area. Just know where the entrance and exit from south to north suite. Must bring along with you the hotel map it helps otherwise you will be lost in space. Visit…",50
"My wife, son and I stayed in one of the suites just after Christmas at the Venetian.  Picked this hotel because it has much bigger rooms than other hotels in Macau and there is more to do with the large shopping arcade and lots of things going on.  It is also right next to City of Dreams so a 5 minute walk to see the best show in Macau (House of Dancing Water).  Typical Casino Hotel service - effective, but not spectacular.  The only downside was that they don't have any of the suites that are on non-smoking floors and so the room had that horrible stale cigarette smell.  Only because of this I would rate the Venetian at the bottom of the top 5 in Macau (Grand Hyatt, Four Seasons, Hotel Okura and Mandarin being the other 4), because otherwise I like the larger rooms.",40
"We spent three days at the venetian ,had trouble at check-in was charged $1394 AUD along with my security fee immediately on arrival  for the room( $1715 AUD in total )even though I had paid in full prior to my arrival getting the the money back was very very difficult even though they rang my agent and confirmed room paid was told it would take at least 3 days  for my money to be returned to my account poor customer service at check in ,offered very little compensation for their mix-up they gave us 2 free breakfasts for family of 4 WOW in the end they gave us back the money in cash after very much persuasionThey also tried to tell me a had paid for 3 people instead of 4 which was also incorrect  Apart from that the hotel is very nice,clean and good location I think they should…",40
"Lovely huge luxurious rooms, 4 sided lobby with the biggest casino that I have seen in a ground floor of any hotel. A huge mall on the second floor, we basically didnt need to go anywhere else in macau.amazing choices of restaurants. very friendly staff and a festive atmosphere all around. Must visit!",50
"The place is themed so its a great place to stay and the rooms was phenomenal. This is meant to be a prelude of my Vegas Trip in May so its quite a nice sneak peek. The rooms was huge and big and luxurious. There is nothing to complain about just that it might have aged a little. The beds were great and check in experience was good, they gave a coupon for a free photo shoot at the their front lobby with the huge centerpiece. We asked for like 4 extra pillows and they accommodated. Great stay!",50
"The Venetian Macao Resort is a grand experience to enjoy and cherish, my husband and I had the most wonderful time ever. Love the shuttle system making it convenient to move around to other hotels and resorts. The good court offers Halal Indian food and the Cafe Deco has a whole range of vegetarian food among the lavish buffet spread. The shopping inside the resort is excellent with variety of stores like Coach, Burberry,Dior and many many more..",50
"I have visited Las Vegas, but Macau is not the same, yes the hotels are the exact architecture.  Macau are not the same city layout like the straight Las Vegas Strip, Each hotel is fare away from the other so you need Taxi.  You need to know what shows are showing and make sure you don’t travel on vacation days because there won’t be a show at that time so not worth to go to Macau at that time.  And make sure you know if there is any typhoon coming or you will get stuck there and the hotel might say we are already booked and you cannot book another night this what happened to me but thanks god there was rooms because some guests didn’t show up.   The hotel rooms are very nice and very big you have separate sitting area within the room with 2 TV’s in each room.  The security is…",50
"Lovely ,huge luxurious rooms with enormous bathrooms. You really do not need to leave the hotel to enjoy yourself- lots to do, lots to see. Swimming pools were great with slides when we were there. We missed breakfast but had the buffet lunch at the brazilian place- it was excellent. Large numbers checking in but staff dealt with numbers professionally and well. Wifi was expensive and not very strong- should be free in all hotels.",50
"Took the high speed ferry from HKIA to Macao. Was efficiently picked up by the hotel coach (free shuttle service). Was transported to the hotel's West Lobby which resembled a busy station with hordes of people walking in and out with their bags.It's a busy hotel with a very large casino.   Baggage check was efficient and with the ticket in my hand - marched to the check in area. Efficient staff checked me in and was off to my Suite (it's an all suite hotel). Brilliant! is what I said when I walked in. My kids loved the super large four fixture bathroom.   It's a compact self contained destination by itself with a very large casino, a super large retail area that connects to retail zones of the Four Seasons and Sands next door. Plenty of restaurants and bars, mini golf, pool, ice…",40
"We have been to Macau several times, staying in many hotels... this hotel.... Opulence surrounds you as you walk in and the feel is certainly 'grand' from the moment we entered our room we couldn't help but compare to the far superior hotels. Our room was huge, nice and continued the feel of quality and comfortable bed. The range of shops is good, as long as they have plenty of restaurants and brands.  Service was great. Restaurants were very good - we loved the thai restaurant - you should try this. The bars were chic and stylish and the gaming floor, spacious, feels good.",50
"Stayed at The Venetian for 2 nights with family. The most amazing experience in terms of the hotel rooms, food, shopping and out if the world attractions. Best part is that if you at a guest at The Venetian, you can dine n wine at any if their restaurants and the bill will be added to your room. Needless to say, it's a gamblers' haven with the ""world's largest casino"" open 24x7.",50
"Our family was mesmetized by the hotel during the NewYear 2013.  It was so lovely.  They have key express service which they emailed me way ahead of my arrival to facilitate check in and in anticipation of the big crowd for the holidays.  Everything is just perfect, worth the price.",50
"All things about the hotel were amazing. To name a few, size, Cleanliness, Casinos and their bus pickup and drop service. Beautiful hotel. If in Hongkong its only 1 hour journey do go here here. The rooms with Cotai Strip view are good.",50
"we were a couple of frnds and we booked the Verona suite, which was some 1500 sqft..... and it was GRAND.... the casino too was grand.... thou if u are wanna play, be aware u can play only big hands, hardly any small bet tables.... the common area of the hotel is like a fish market but guess everyone wants to see this beauty... the hotel has buses connected to where ever u wanna go.... it is a must stay, must visit kinda place....",50
"We were slightly nervous having read some of the other reviews about the Venetian - however I struggle to agree with people who have booked to stay in a casino hotel and then found it not suitable for families etc.  My husband and I traveled to Macau to meet friends who had been before, the intention was for two days of fun and some very amateur gambling and we found it to hit the spot perfectly!  Upon arrival we were upgraded to the Cotai view rooms, not something I would have paid any extra for, but nice all the same.  No - we weren't shown to our rooms and the size does make the hotel a challenge to navigate, which I agree is disappointing for a 5* hotel.  The rooms are extremely large, we had a large living room, bedroom with one of the most comfortable beds I've slept in…",40
"We stayed 4 nights in a normal room. The room was huge and we really enjoyed the space. The hotel lobby, shopping and casino area was massive but it had an unfriendly and busy feeling about it. Casino min bets on most tables were about AUD$35 which is too much. I did find a Craps table with a AUD$10 min bet which was ok. Queues on the gondola rides were about 45 mins so that was not worth the wait. Dancing Water show and a nearby casino was the highlight. All in all it was ok but we probably would not bother with Macau again. ",40
"We stayed here for the last leg of our vacation. Coming from the tiny rooms of HK, the suite we were able to get was just huge. I mean the size of the  bathroom is already a hotel room in HK!   We had a very comfortable king size bed, a roomy seating area and the large windows also gave way to an awesome view. We requested for a non-smoking room, and we were lucky that they still have one available. There's still some tobacco smell in the room though, not sure if it's because of the vents or it used to be a smoking room in the past. If this is a deal breaker for you, make sure to advise the front desk so they can assist you or probably transfer you to a different room.   We availed the Titanic Package through Agoda.com and we were able to make the most out of it since the…",40
The pool area is big. Not as flashy and new as galaxy.   Lots of great shopping there but lots of walking too!   Rooms are very nice and have separate lounge area which is nice.   Overall good place to stay! ,50
Short holiday in Macau at Venetian. Too big a hotel. Very functional and clean. Stayed in a Bella suite and liked it very much. I always look for a comfortable bed and clean bathroom. Should have stayed for longer. Tried food at Imperial House Dimsum and it was good. Mc Sorely's Ale House is good too. Mostly I had food in the food court otherwise.,40
"Despite the grandeur and popularity of of the Venetian I was somewhat disappointed by the service. There were 3 of us staying in the Bella Suites (two queen beds). At check in we were asked if we wanted a room with a bathtub (yes please!) or a shower. However, if we wanted the room with the tub we would have had to wait for a an extra hour (no thank you). This was an annoying start. Then, when we arrived in our room we called to have an extra bath towel and see if they could fix the bathroom door that wouldn't close. Although the person brought more toiletries they didn't bring towels and no one ever came back to fix the bathroom door.  I was also disappointed that the Venetian charges $160MOP/HK for 24hours of internet access. I think complimentary Wifi should be a standard in…",40
"The hotel design is impressive, and the rooms are huge and really feel luxurious. We got a Bella suite and it has two queen beds, enough for a whole family. The only downside is that there is no free wifi. The daily charge is also quite expensive. There is also a food court where you can have your breakfast at reasonable prices. Since the casino, the mall, the theaters, etc. are all in the same location, it feels very busy and crowded though. There are also free shuttle buses that take you to the ferry, city center, and other resorts.",40
"Although rich people find it ordinary, but it's classy and grandness, you can enjoy like you are in a nother place. One thing the kids & my family enjoy is the Gondola ride though it's only a shortwhile. But the crews are best entertainers, the rest is a replica of venice. But for shopping & food it's really expensive but the majestic is great.",50
"The hotel room was really big. The hotel itself is big in size. The casino is just right down there so it's convenient for those who wants to try their luck. There's a shopping area inside. Nice to take picture everywhere. You could basically find everything without going out.  Though the place is big, its still crowded. Full of tourists everywhere, specially the lobby and the casino. There are a lot of people who just went there as a ""day tour"". One thing I appreciated is the security of the hotel for those staying . There's always a security guard checking room keys before you could take the elevator for the access to the rooms. This is very necessary since there are a lot of people in the hotel all the times.",40
"I have stayed in this hotel for a week and I had a very good time. The best attraction is the shopping area with a look alike Venice architecture, the gondolas, the artificial sky and the typical italian architecture of the past. The casino of this hotel is very huge and I had a great time playing the wheel of fortune and I did gain some money too. It is like an addiction when you start playing in the casino. The restaurant offers several cuisines and the I got to taste the Indian one, but it was not so good. The hotel's architecture looks amazing in the night from outside and as I stayed in the 26th floor, I could get a very good view of the city.",50
"Amazing, awesome & splendid. Cannot describe in words. There is so much under one roof. Hotel, Casino, Restaurants, Street food, food stalls, shopping, boating, entertainment, films,....its countless. The lobbies, the porch are fantastic. Lavish breakfast, variety of restaurants. You don't need to anywhere else in Macau if you stay at the Venetian.",50
"The Venetian Macau is an essential experience when you visit the Cotai Strip…as it is the Cotai Strip. The free shuttle bus was a good feature straight from the ferry, and we soon arrived at The Venetian. The building and complex is spectacular and like nothing else in the world. Check in was easy to find, but with that done you are pretty much on your own. The huge size of the resort and high number of rooms means that getting personalised service is out of the question, so be ready for an ‘independent’ trip.  I had a Rialto Suite which was very impressive and offered great value. It was huge in size and offered two bathrooms, a nice lounge, wide hallway, business facilities and a spacious bedroom. The in-room Nespresso was a nice touch. I liked the old-world style decoration…",40
"At Macau Venetian, the transport service is best. Shuttle buses and coaches can bring you directly to the hotel lobby from all points of entry. eg: airport, ferry terminal or even cross borders from Zhuhai.  Rooms are huge and spacious. Toilets are luxurious. Bella Suites are best suited for big family. 2 queen sized beds plus a queen sized sofa pull out bed. Lots of cushions scattered around.  Location is fantastic. Lots of shopping, gaming, eating choices in itself. Across the road, you have City of Dreams , Sands Coitai . The water show at City of Dreams is great !!!!!",50
"The room we got was a suite that had 2 queen size bed, and the sofa turned into an extra sofa bed. So it could comfortably fit 5 persons. It was at least 4-5 times the size of our hotel in Hong Kong, at the same price!  The room is nicely decorated, and well equipped (2 TVs!).  On the 3rd floor are lots of shops (mostly luxury shops) and a food court.  In addition, there is a children's playground called Qube where one can leave their children for a couple of hours while the parents indulge in some sinful gambling. :-)",40
As in other reviews the delay of check in was not at all the issue with me. We checked in smoothly and stayed in the lavish royal suite on 23 rd floor.  The food court was good . High end boutiques were lovely. In all it was a very good stay for me and my family.the breakfast at cafe deco was simply superb. Gondola rides were my favourite.it was really a royal holiday experience .,50
"Stayed at the PAIZA club. The welcome at the Ferry was professional and courteous. The PAIZA guests have a seperate reception and you get greeted at the drop off point by two courteous staff and they whisk you away to your suite. My suite was on the 37th floor, 37021 - If I say SPACIOUS, that would be an understatement. The room was colossal with a Grand entrance, A Good sized living room and dining area, Spacious Bed room, Walk in closet, Bathroom - probably as large as the Bedroom ! The icing on the cake was that, the the room also featured a Movie room with a great TV screen with amazing sound system. The Butlers are just ready to help you with anything. Very very prompt service. Our whole week stay was more than amazing. Kids enjoyed the play area- CUBE. The shopping area…",50
"We stayed 2 nights at Venetian Macao.  Venetian is an all-suite hotel and this is why we only need 1 room for our family of 5.  Each room has its own living area with small dining table and an office desk, and 2 TVs.  We chose a room with 2 true queen-sized beds. However, there is no TV inside the bathroom which the Venetian/Palazzo Las Vegas has.  But sill, everything else is still luxurious.  Food court offers a lot of choices that you may not have to go outside for food.  High-end shops are also in the hotel.  Since this is in Macao, there are times when you cannot fully understand the Chinese staff who speak very little English.  Good thing that there are so many Filipinos in this town including those in the Venetian.",40
"As almost all the reviews have mentioned, the space here in the Venetian Macau is amazing. The room was huge, with two queen sized beds and as there were three of us, we asked for an extra bed which was made up from the sofa in the living space. Despite that, there was still plenty of room to move around and the two TVs meant that we could watch separate programmes from where we were. Housekeeping was careful and thoughtful, providing extra toiletries without reminders when they realised that three women shared a room. The bathroom too was big. The only possible complaint was that it was so big that we got tired walking round and round the room!   The pool was a delight too and it was nicely heated to a very pleasant temperature which made swimming a real pleasure in winter. The…",50
"Once you get the lay of the land of this hotel, and know your way around quickly without getting lost, this hotel starts to amaze you. The sheer number of people in this hotel strikes you and gives one the feeling the service will be below par, but it was not! Room service was amazing and the food was usually there in 15-20 minutes. The rooms were amazing and big! Living area was probably double the size of the bedrooms.  The hotel amenities are very nice as well.. The mini golf course is a lot of fun. Only problem is just getting around this hotel leaves one very tired and one has to pass through the casino to get wherever you want.",50
"Its big, grand and luxurious! The suites are big and elaborately furnished with all modern amenities. The casino is forever crowded with all sorts of people, so you can just sit at a slot machine and do people watching if you like doing it. Some part of it smells of cigar or tea i couldn't say but it was very addictive :P   There are lots of shop and you will end up shopping even if you didn't intend to initially. If you are looking for a quieter place then maybe you will have to just stick to your suite or find another hotel but then i don't think anybody would go to a casino looking for tranquility.",40
"I am in love with the hotel. The room was superb( very very spacious) with huge bathroom including shower room, tub and dressing table. The royal suite which is the basic room has all amenities from needle to bathroom gown. it has two television, ironing board , iron, mini fridge, fax machine and a very comfortable bed. the match box was super cute. I was under Titanic package which included titanic and human body exhibition ticket, a free picture, MOP 300 against shopping n dinning at selected outlets, free breakfast or lunch buffet and ice skating for 20 mins. The staff is very very helpful, polite and courteous ( best staff I have ever come across). The breakfast buffet at Cafe Deco had varied Indian dishes too. We even liked the midnight menu at cafe Deco. The hotel is huge…",50
"my review will not be very helpful as i was only here for one night but oh my gosh its an amazing place !!! this hotel is MASSIVE so get prepared to get lost.   the rooms are classy and all the bus boys insist on a tip so make sure you have enough small money. the gambling hall below is full of prostitutes which is ok i guess, this is the sin city of the east after all !   complimentary bus from the boat terminal to the hotel, as with the other big hotels in macau.  no breakfast included and the fact that you pay about 200rmb per person is a bit of a rip off considering macau makes more turnover than las vegas (FACT) they could surely provide free grub.",50
"We stayed at venetian for 3 days/2 nights in April 2010 and it was a wonderful experience. From Hong-kong to macao you have to reach by ferry and then venetian's bus will be there to pickup at the ferry terminal. At the entrance only you can feel that you are entering a royal beautiful property. Rooms speak of its class. Then there is a world of entertainment starting from casinos,luxury designer boutiques, so many shopping options, different cuisines dining options,theatre,lounge,live music to whatever you can thinkof ! Its a beautiful world in itself!",50
For all travellers to hongkong and macau your visit is incomplete if you have not stayed at venetian . Majestic interiors courteous staff honest deals  and world cuisine await you.Even if you stay completely in the hotel you may not be able to completely get to know venetian so vast is the place and so much to enjoy zaia show is amust see. Take a sea facing room and watch sunset.best casino . A wonderful experience take it,50
"You can't rave enough about this hotel.  The suites are big with everything you need for a lovely relaxing holiday.  Each suite had 2 queen size beds & tv, a huge luxury bathroom, then step down into a living area with lounge, tv, desk, table & chairs, coffee table, mini bar fridge & tea & coffee making facilities.  We took the cheaper option of not having a view over The Cotai Strip (facing all the other glitzy casinos) - instead we looked over a lagoon that had traditional Portugese homes built around it.   With Christmas approaching the whole of Macau is decorated spectacularly and the Venetian is simply stunning.  We were awestruck by the amount of effort put into entertaining the guests with amazing light shows at the front of the hotel each evening, snow falling, ice…",50
"stayed only for 2 nights in this hotel with my family. booked through agoda . there were no free shuttle service or airport transfer ( as claimed by past reviews ). in fact we were notified by e-mail regarding our upcoming stay and we were offered a car/van service at a fee . since the airport is quite near to our hotel we decided to take a taxi cab instead (it was much cheaper ).  When we arrived a bell personnel would help us with our luggage , and we were told that check in would be by 2pm (it was around 11 am by then ) , and he even reassured us that no suite would be available by that time . But i decided to give it a try since there was no line at the front desk . And to my surprise , a suite which was specific for what i booked , was available . The bad thing was that the…",40
"My friends and I stayed there for one day before going back to the Philippines. The hotel offers free shuttle transfer from and to the airport, ferry terminal, and other popular hotels/casino in Macau. That was definitely great especially if you want to save money for souvenirs or shopping. Venetian reflects life of luxury, fun, and relaxation. I did not research anymore about the hotel so when we were there, I was surprised that the gondola ride and the whole Venice experience was actually indoors and on the second floor. The sky was painted on the ceiling but nevertheless equally breathtaking. The casino was also huge and yes, tempting. The food are a little expensive but you can have a lot of choices from their food court. They have a huge variety of stores ranging from the…",40

"My 3rd time to stay in this hotel and each time I stayed overnight. The hotel itself is the biggest amongst all the hotels in Macao. The minute you walk in to the property you will feel the buzz and excitement of being in an entertainment casino and if you have ever been to the Venetian in Las Vegas, it will bring back all the memories. Stayed in a Royal Suite room and this is very spacious, clean and comfortable. The check in service has improved throughout the years from having to line up and wait to having express check-ins in different sections of the property. We requested for a late check out and this was not a problem. The restaurants are excellent and don't forget to have a drink the the Bellini Lounge. You'll enjoy the breakfast at Cafe Deco for it's variety! Make sure…",50
"This is a perfect hotel for family stay in Macao.  Standard room comes with a mini living room.  Spaces bathroom and two televisions in the room.  It's exactly the same as the one in Vegas.  Everything you need are within the resort.  Casino, kids play room, plenty chooses of restaurants.  The biggest shopping mall in Macao.  Easy to get lost in the resort but  staffs are so helpful and nice. Make sure to choose the non smoking floor cause those Chinese smokers love smoking cigarettes anywhere anytime.  Bad for kids.  Overall, this is a nice six stars resort to stay for traveling Macao.",40

The hotel is excellent in every respect .. Its  Huge Royal  comfortable having fun filled for kids  only thing you have to walk too much (walker /cart can be arranged at few places) Casino is beautiful and huge but was not so happening i must say .. mgmt should introduce some additional features like dancing etc. to make it happening  overall all it was worth going and value for money.,50
"Upon check-in, we already asked for the SANDS REWARD CARD (you can avail this along the Casino reception. With this, you can really avail discounts on food and shops while you are staying here. They also gave us free key chains).  The resort is truly great! we like the drama at the food court that you are like eating at the open place with the view of the beautiful sky with the Venice (Mediterranean exterior design) We also love the canal shoppes where you will feel as if you are at Venice wherein there are slopes and stairs. In the mids of the stairs are the canal with people riding on the Gondola. If you walk along the canal, you will also see the shoppes (boutiques of different high-end brands with grand with different mediterranean exterior). Along the casino are the…",50
"Went with a big bunch of friends for 2 nights at the Venetian for the clubbing, local sight seeing, as well as a bit of gambling.  All in all, it was a great stay, and the hotel definitely made that happen.  The room we got was the Bella suites.  That room was enormous, and can definitely sleep 6 people very very comfortably!  The washroom was one of the nicest washrooms I've ever seen, I almost felt like royalty for a second when I walked in.  The beds and the deco were just as amazing as well.  Every single detail was taken care of in the room, and we definitely appreciated that a lot.  The customer service was very quick and very prompt with our requests (ie: extra bedding, pillows, blankets, etc...).  Checking in was pretty quick as well, no problems there.  There is always…",40

"The thing that floors you once you enter the Venetian, Macau is its grandeur. It is just too big for somebody like me from India - the sheer magnificence is breathtaking. The variety of shopping and the kids entertainment that is available out there is way too good - I don't gamble, so the casino was of little interest to me.  On the rooms, the suite they put us up in was the biggest in our HKM tour. The kids had a whale of a time with the two TV's on offer and they just could not get enough of walking around or splashing in the pools. Simply superb experience in Venetian !!  Food was a little fight - we went to the Indian restaurant available there - the queues early in the morning were a dampener. The Chinese food for dinner was not to our taste - clearly !! The hotel could…",50

"We spent a couple of nights at the Venetian in Sept 2012.  We had a twin room for our family.  Even though the twin beds were the largest we had on our whole trip, they still set up a settee bed for one of our children.  Our room was very grand, and the hotel was just lovely to walk through, even when we had to go the long way due to having children!  The free shuttle buses were very convenient to and from the ferry.  We caught a taxi into town and came back on the free shuttle bus.  The pools were just beautiful, though it was a bit of a hike from our room to the pools!  Plently of places to eat.",50

Love stay here, don't forget to ridw the gondola, i think it's better than in Venice, clean and clear water, the singer( i forgot what they usually called) have beautiful voices, my singer been to Indonesia, so we talk a lot. Have fun there :)",50
"We went to Macau last March of  2012.  I enjoyed my stay because there were so many restaurants and shops all over the area.   Rooms: we stayed at south wing Venetian, we booked the Cotai View King Bed ( non-smoking)room. The room was very clean and very spacious. I would say it was very impressive on how little details were very meticulously in place and very neat. The only thing I had a problem was their TV.  It was not a flat screen TV. It looked very old, but aside from that. EVERYTHING WAS NICE.  Restaurants:  There were variety of restaurants around the area and they even have a food court for budget travelers. Its really nice to check those restaurants out because they serve very good food.   Casino: Of course Macau is known as Vegas of Asia so expect a casino.  …",40
"After a disastrous beginning to our 6 night stay in this hotel (which I've decided not to mention), our first impression was transformed into one of delight by the hotel's front office manager, Jacob. Upgraded to a sensational Paiza Suite we can now unwind in peace and luxury and focus on the positive attributes of this iconic hotel. Excellent access to the Cotai Strip and adjoining hotels, gaudy architecture that grows on you strangely enough, superb floral displays, mostly service with a smile. We did not come here to gamble so keep this in mind when selecting your room option. The Piaza Suites have an entirely different access and make you feel you are in a private luxurious retreat far removed from the casino's chaotic buzz. Have decided not to post photos of our Florence…",40
"Amazing architecture, great concept, perfect location, widest variety of F&B(Portofino's, Fogosamba and Cafe Siam being our favorites) and shopping outlets, The Venetian Macau is the ultimate destination one could ever ask for.  This was true until other big hotels started popping out the Cotai strip, The Venetian seemed to outdate itself against the others. One example would be the lack of a free wifi access to in-house guests. Since there are other 5-star hotels which are quite as similar as the Venetian in terms of the hotel size, type of room, facilities, service and price, I think people would choose for the better package even for the simple details.  On the other hand, I liked the room a lot because it's spacious and the view of the Crown and City of Dreams hotels were…",40
what a hotel...friendly reception staff ..everthing about this hotel is awesome...kids play area...CUBE..casinos....food court...shopping...ambience...services...just amazing palce for vacation..4 swimming pools with separate for couples...good jacuzzi...all the comforts of the guest are taken care off.,50
"I stayed overnight with friends and we got a Bella Suite smack in the middle of the hotel.  It had a fantastic view of Cotai Strip.  I must have spent a good two hours sitting in front of the window, watching the lights go on and off at the Crown, City of Dreams and Hard Rock Hotel.  It was the middle of the Grand Prix season, and we were lucky to get a room with such a nice view.  I loved the beds and personally wanted to take home the duvet.  It was that pretty.  The bathroom was also beautiful.  I loved the bath so much, I stayed up late just to soak.  The hotel offers both LAN and wi-fi access.  Everything, really, within your reach.  They also have the most seamless check-in and check-out process I have ever encountered.  Staff is nice and polite.   When you get in the…",50
"We stayed 2 nites in Venetian in mid Nov & took 3 rooms for 6+1(kid) family members.   Besides the majestic palace-style lobby and the beautiful indoor gondola rides, the room is the wow-factor of the hotel. All rooms in Venetian are in fact ""suites"" which are huge with separate bedroom and living area.  The twin-bedded rooms come with 2 queen-sized beds which can accomodate 4 persons.   Being the second largest hotel in the world (3,000+suites), one can expect loads of tourists flooding the hotel.   As we went there during weekdays and non-seasonal holiday, the crowds were still bearable.  With this kind of mega hotel with huge crowds, we were prepared to meet with underated service. But to our surprise, their service is good and impeccable.  Our luggages were swiftly taken…",40
"I stayed for two nights at the Venetian.  The check in process was quick but trying to find your way to your hotel room through the  casino was a little bit of an adventure. The suite room was well spacious and decorated and the amenities were quite good. There is a large and cheap food court and some fine restaurants as well and a large and relatively expensive shopping mall.  The Casino is HUGE relative to many casinos I have been to in Vegas.  So if shopping and gambling are your goals, as was mine,  then no many reasons are there to leave the hotel before checkout.",40
"from the time we got off the ferry at Macau and got on the courtesy bus to the hotel we had nothing but five star service , the check in process was smooth and was immediately enhanced when an upgrade was offered. The staff were helpful if taxis were required and wrote in Chinese the address on a return card a very nice touch.The hotel is enormous and in the two and a half days we were there we only I think saw 70% of the hotel .The rooms are spacious and all the furniture and beds are comfortable to relax in , the highlight of the hotel though is when you pass through both the gaming floors and the shopping malls you are just amazed by the size and beauty of the hotel, we will be staying again for sure",50
"The suites at the Venetian are a bargain when compared to it's namesake in Vegas. The rooms and public areas are extremely similar to the original. They even have the indoor gondola rides and opera singers.  The room is very large with ample space to kick back and relax away from the bed. Being such a large resort it is hard to comment on the service as you do have minimal interaction with staff once you have checked in. No free wifi is a bummer but then you have to pay for the same in Vegas as well.  The Venetian is located on the Cotai strip which is away from the centre of Macau city. If you venture out, you need to get back before too late on the free shuttle buses or have to brave a taxi.  The food court at the Venetian has a large variety of decent quality fare at a decent…",40
Excellent well appointed rooms/suites. The hotel sent a birthday cake up to celebrate my wife's birthday. Lots of great restaurants nearby. Only dissapointment was being charged MOP/HK$160 for internet access which is a rip off.,50
"This was our second time back at the Venetian. It was more amazing than the last time. It is a huge hotel, so of course there can be long lines and a bit of a wait sometimes, but they really do everything to make your stay the best possible experience ever.   We arrived at the Taipa Ferry terminal which is closer to the hotel than the Macau ferry terminal. The shuttle busses leave very regularly and staff are so friendly and helpful. On arrival at the hotel at approximately 11am (which is 4 hours earlier than official check in time) we were met by a friendly lady who told us that we could store our bags and return at 1pm for early check in. We did exactly that and only had a 10 minute wait to check into the hotel at 1pm. Not bad for UFC weekend.   We went to the baggage services…",50
This is a very good hotel but is like a world unto itself in Macau.  Its not cheap but is worth a visit (as is Macau in general).  It has a whole shopping centre and massive casino and there is now a massive strip of hotel casinos appearing to make it rival the Las Vegas strip.,40
"We stayed for one night in this hotel in October 2012. We got upgraded to a larger room, at no expense, to be on the same floor as friends. This is an all suite hotel, our suite was about 80sqm. It was split level with two queen size beds and a massive bathroom. Very opulent but well worth the stay. It was fairly inexpensive and I would recommend it. This was the largest hotel room I have ever stayed in>",40
"It's an experience by itself to stay at The Venentian. It's got all of it name it and it's there. The casino's, the shopping avenues and the Food court. It's a massive hotel and you require two days to roam through the hotel. The Belle Suite's are an icing to the cake!!!! Have to stay to feel  the experience",50
I stayed here for over a week and this place is amazing.  I'm accustomed to 5 star and visit Vegas multiple times a year but this place is without a doubt top quality compared to anywhere. The all suite rooms and shopping complex with huge food court make the stay here even more fun because you can eat at so many places under one roof.  Beautiful in every aspect and has a HUGE casino as well.  I would recommend this to everyone I know without hesitation and know it will surpass their expectations.,50
"I traveled to the Venetian Macao just before this past Chinese New Year as a quick escape before meeting up with the rest of the family.  The Venetian Macao Hotel and Casino is easy to get to. From the ferry terminal, there are busses there ready to pick up everyone and whisk them away to the hotel which is only a short drive away.  The check in process was relatively quick and painless, trying to find your way to your hotel room through the massive expanse of the casino was a little bit of an adventure. For those traveling with younger kids, the walk can be quite long as we took a shortcut through the casino floor.   Rooms were spacious and the amenities were quite good. In addition to the casino floor, there is also a theater showing a Cirque Du Soleil show and a massive…",40
"Perfect holidays!  Beautiful and luxury suites, ""Roman"" building designs and wall/ceiling paintings, Venice-alike gondola rides, mini golf course, kids’ playground, big shopping malls, wide variety of food and of course the entertainment part – casino and Titanic exhibits. Only regret was that there were so many things to do that we could not spend more time in enjoying the luxury suites room.  Services were 1st class – from arrival at Macau Ferry Terminal to departure, every logistic was taken care of with high efficiency.  For me, the only letdown is that The Venetian's very 1st group of hotel guests were Manchester United Football Club and there is also a huge Manchester United shop in the shopping mall. Regrettably, the hotel do not have TV network to broadcast EPL live…",50
MAGNIFICENT would be an understatement! Grandeur of Grandness ! An endless resort to explore. Hours of walking and you still wont finish seeing the entire place. Casino and umpteen number of restaurants inside the Venetian. Royally furnished & well appointed. No rooms. Only Suites. A must go 5 star property!,50
"We depart from China Ferry Terminal (Tsim Sha Tsui) to Macau Ferry Terminal. After exit the terminal in macau, across the street there's a shuttle bus name venetian hotel for free Love being outside and inside this resort. In the middle there is casino.The room is large and luxury and also clean. One thing for sure, the staff very friendly and handy. I will comeback",40
I have stayed in many hotel rooms but this place is out of this world - beautiful and huge - has everything you could want - even down to mouth.  All the soft furnishings are at a high standard - they even have a turn down service every night with complementary slippers placed beside the bed - with a forecast of the next days weather - a glass and a bottle of water beside your bed.  We got upgraded for a minimal amount to a 177sq meter suite - it even had a dressing and make p room - besides the two toilets and two sinks - one for her and him - the bathroom itself was huge with a bathtub and huge shower - count in the dining area and lounge area plus add on the kitchenette - then add on the coffee espresso machine.    The hotel is so huge we had to take a map with us every day -…,50
"Humongous hotel. Humongous is very small in front of the hugeness of this hotel. Truly huge well maintained. Every room is too good and the casino is at its best. The hotel is hardly 1/2 n hour drive from airport and is located in the heart of the place. Visible from a distance and surely one to stay once in the life time.  The bus has continues shuttles running through out the City, Ferry Terminal and Airport to pickup and drop passengers.",50
"Stayed here for 2nights with my fiancée and we were very impressed! I have been to many 5star resorts and this one certainly gives the others a run for their money! No detail has been spared! Elegant, classy hallways and magnificent rooms that are huge with sunken living room. Amazing views of Macau, beautiful bathroom, great amenities, big shower, big comfy bed, clean etc. huge casino!abundance of pools that are never full. Negatives are the size of the hotel as it is very easy to get lost and the fact that the casino allows smoking, yuk! The gondolas and lagoon through the hotel are amazing! My fiancee proposed to me on a private gondola which was out of this world! The roof honestly looks just like the sky! So many shops, restaurants and things to do. I highly recommend this…",50
"Really can't say enough about this hotel. Stayed here for 2 nights. The room first off, was wonderfully HUGE. Beautiful ""loft-like"" suite with the sitting area a few steps below the bed area. Plenty of space for 2. The bed was super comfy and felt clean. The cleaning staff does a good job remaking the bed everyday. The washroom is exquisite!!! You really feel like a Queen with this washroom. Bigger than my own washroom for sure. It sparkles like no other. I like how the toilet is in a room in itself, no bacteria from flushing flies out (or minimal at least). I happily applied my makeup at the makeup table in the beautiful washroom.   The hotel itself is amazing. Went for an enjoyable indoor gondola ride. The indoor ride seems more popular than the outdoor one. But it was also…",50
"The Venetian Macao is larger than life. You truly have to be there to appreciate the attention to detail and determined effort to make the interior & exterior facades & frescoes varied. It makes for lots of great photo ops and creates a luxuriant atmosphere. The huge mall and extensive dining options offer a wide range in tastes as well as price bands - and the perfect place to get pleasantly lost in. As a result it attracts the right crowd - families, couples, recreational gamblers - which helps to keep a fun & carefree feel.   The rooms are all suites with huge bathrooms, acres of space, comfortable beds that lull you to sleep the moment your head hits the pillow - all-in-all well-appointed, well-kept and has not lost its shine. Corridors and elevator lobbies are well-lit.…",50
"Lovely decoration and chocolates in the room for our anniversary! Loved the stay , although too much crowd! But nice suite, view And room made up for it. Def worth a visit, and worth the gondola ride for the sheer happiness of it. Although I would prefer the ride outside , but anyhow nice charm. Ad the hotels are all interconnected, so can visit so many and see their themes.",40
"Its the Venetian, lives up to its name and delivers ONLY in grand style. It seemed like entering a massive fairytale land with the beautiful wall murals, paintings and all things in gold. The hotel glittlers. Our suite was great with an amazing sea side view, the bed was very comfy.Clean and decorated in a grand style.  The food was good, enjoyed the Titanic exhibition and an auto show.Tee hotel has everything, a shopping mall, food court, gondola rides, and of course the casino.  We spent one whole day in the hotel. Only downside I would say is, since it's such a huge hotel, personal care lacks from the staff. And you have to walk a lot, and I mean ALOT.",50
Your hotel is the best and the paintings are amazing and there are lots of filipinos that i realy like the food is also realy great and i also liked the titanic exibition and the human bodies thank you very much Venitian for making my stay a wonderful and most memorable one keep up the good work.

"The suit room is big the bathroom is very big too !!! We did not go out to city of macau cos the hotel itself is big enough to shop and eat the whole day !!! We very happy with everything the food the entertainment in the hotel !!! The only thing we don't like is the hotel lobby , we have to Q for very long for check in ..... I can not believe it a five star hotel ...... And we have to Q for more then 1 hr for check in ........ Other then that everything is fine",40
"Last June, me and my wife and my uncle booked two rooms, both rooms are big. The hotel is very busy and will lost your way if not consult hotel map. It is great hotel, you find almost everything under one roof.  If given a chance to visit Macau again, I will still stay in Venetian compare to other also big hotels. It is near airport.",40
"In the Cotai strip of Macau, just a wee bit away from the city centre (but free numerous shuttles to make up for it!) lies the magnificent reincarnation of the Italian canal city. The outside looks like the Piazza San Marco, replete with the bell tower, columns of the piazetta and the bridge of sighs. If its too hot - you get an airconditioned Venice indoors on the first floor, ABOVE the GIANT casino!! complete with artificial sky clouds, canals, gondola rides, bridges and authentic street facades, without the surly Italian gondoliers! Some even have lovely voices!  The Suites (The smallest available unit!!) are absolutely magnificent with luxury spelt in capital! The bathroom is also composed of a large area with bathtub, dressing space, etc separated from the toilet! Felt like…",50
"Stayed only for a single night here during a business trip:  The good: 1) Free public transportation - there is a shuttle bus from the airport, and also from all the strategic places around Macau. It also links up with other resorts to basically just cover the whole Macau in free shuttle transport! 2) It's 5 minutes from the airport! 3) Two shuttles gets you to town - just take the shuttle to the neighbouring Galaxy Resort, and then take the shuttle from there to San Ma Lo! 4) Check in is amazingly effortless - Especially for such a large resort. I was allowed to check in at 11, when normal check in is 3pm, and the check in lady gave me lots of tips and advise! 5) Very large, integrated resort with casino, shopping, convention center, and plenty of eating options too. 6) Room is…",40

"The suites are huge, the casino is huge, the shopping is huge, everything is huge. This place is a monolith and a map is needed to navigate around the place. We stayed here two days, one night.  It is worth it just to experience the hotel.  Indoor water canals complete with fake sky, an eternal twilight zone. I'm not a gambler however, when in The Venetian what else are you going to do? Spent an hour or so in the casino and probably lost about AU $200 playing a poker machine. Never mind, it was fun just to be in the surroundings. Interestingly, you can still smoke in the casino, but it wasn't smoky in there - must have excellent extraction fans. Overall I would say that if you are in Macau, you need to visit this place just to be overwhelmed. However, once is enough for me and I…",40
"No doubt its amazing , its grand, but its not d place if you are looking to stay close to nature!! Otherwise the service is class! And u have loads of in house entertainment venues!! Do not Miss the House of Dancing Water show which is opposite to the hotel in CITY OF DREAMS. Do book it early to avoid non availability",40

Casino is magnificent, although did not win anything.. but that's another subject. ;)  The Malo spa is an excellent experience, and worth the visit. Hot stones therapy was just perfect.  Shopping area has all the brands and is possibly one of the biggest in Macau, with water channels alongside the shops, painted ""Venice"" style. Great food court and restaurant as well.

I stayed here for 3 nights as I was attending a business conference. This hotel is big and the rooms are big and spacious with great European decor.. Price is expensive though reasonae for a MICE hotels.   I didn't have much time to walk around the shoppes. The pool looks beautiful with about 3-4 pools if I can remember.,40

Every level is scenic But it commands hefty price,.. More so if you are on weekends,,  One can splurge as much as they want,,, must watch the numerous shows the hotel hosts..  Reach the place in time as its takes some time to understand the vast hotel, which is no less than a small city in itself...  Remember that its very high priced,, Though its worth the price paid,, As its an all Suite Hotel .. Rooms are really good and palatial,,,",50

They have a pool, gym, spa, kid's play zone. We rode the Gandola, Great experience for the family. :) very entertaining rowers. Room service was slow, it took them 20 mins to serve our requests. Actually, everything was great! Everything was huge, from rooms to ceilings, walkways. Their wall paintings at the Main lobby and the Grand canal area makes you feel you're in Venice. a lot of things to do inside so was not actually boring since they also had the titanic exhibition and human bodies exhibition.  The Bad side: people can smoke on the rooms. I believe that the lines are new however the smell of cigars has somehow…",40

"Like the title says - Macau is not a city for quiet, romantic breaks.  It's a place to eat, drink, gamble and generally entertain yourself. Oh, and shopping.. lots and lots of shopping.  We picked the The Venetian because we recognized the brand from Las Vegas. The shuttle took us from the ferry terminal to the hotel. It was impressive as expected, looking exactly like the American hotel it took its name from. The walk from the curb to the reception desk was epic. The complex is absolutely gigantic, stuffed full of people, gambling 24/7.  Since we didn't advance-book, they forced us to take the presidential suite. I was initially annoyed about the poor availability, but it was a fair price (3,700 HKD) for the size and quality. The suite had Nespresso, multiple flat screens, two…",50
"Rooms are really great at the Venetian, they are huge and very cozy at the same time. The hotel itself is quite spectacular especially the outside architecture and the canal shoppes. Other than the rooms and the impressive design of the hotel we didn't spend too much time there. The casino is full of mainland Chinese groups of men smoking, drinking and gambling. Prices at the casino and the restaurants are very high. Shuttle buses are quite useful if you have the time, otherwise there are plenty of taxis but make sure to get the concierge to write down the destination in Chinese as most cabbies don't understand English and neither do most of the bellboys at the taxi queues. Even though we had the address and name of a (famous) restaurant in Macau the bellboy had no idea where it…",40
"Recently visited the Venetian to check out the new Titanic Exhibition and was very impressed by what the Venetian and National Geographic had put together.  This event is to be held from now until 24 February in Hall F of the Venetian and is worth your time if you are seeking interesting activities to see or do during your upcoming visit to Macau.   There was much to like about the Titantic Exhibition.  Much of the exhibition area has been transformed into various parts of the actual Titantic ship and you walk through well- presented stages of boarding the ship, being on the ship during its sailing and learning about the actual sinking of the Titanic and aftermath.  During your experience you are able to see and feel what it was like to walk down a first-class and second-class…",40
"Stayed in venetian 2 times already, and the last time I stayed there, managed to actually enjoy the whole hotel.  This hotel is too huge, service was so so since the hotel is usually very crowded, but the facilities they have is very nice. Room is exceptionally nice, large and very very very comfortable bed.  Everything else is quite normal, in fact I find that internet is very scarce there since you have to pay for the internet in your room, the only free wifi is @ cafe deco where you need to purchase a drink there. But walking around there's also free wifi in an italian restaurant inside venetian.  I suggest you stay in Venetian when you do honeymoon or you're there to enjoy taipa island & venetian.

"I stayed in Venetian with my friends for a night. The services were good, no doubt. We could find a lot of things to buy if we brought cash there. The canal shoppe really amazed me. Except the mall, the architecture of the building was great. The sky looked like it's never been a night. Even when it was 6 pm, but it felt like just 2 pm. Ti's also near with Hard Rock Hotel, City of dream... I has a great vacation there. ^^",50
it is no doubt a symbol of macaus prosperity that this hotel stnads in its magnificient avtar. The balace is big (really big!). You couls get actually lost and the place would have done with better signboards. The shopping area was awesome. really awesome. Suggest to do only window shopping as the prices are exorbitant and crazy. Shopping is only recomended if you have one big money at the casino.,40

Unfortunately our room was not ready for check in at 2pm and we had to wait till 4pm.. No coffee or food voucher we were simply told to go to the casino and wait... Not very good customer service. Also we were meeting friends for tapas/dinner at 5pm so it didn't give us long to get ready.  The rooms are enormous and lavishly decorated. It is a shame though that even all of the non smoking rooms reek for cigarettes.   The main reason we stayed at the Venetian for for the shopping and the entertainment and we were not let down. The shopping is great and most things are on sale... So if you want a…",40
Stayed here for 2 nights. Amazing rooms that are bigger then my entire house. 600 shops in the place if you have the cash. The food court is good for a wide selection of all types of food. Mortons of Chicago is expensive(€60 for a steak) but worth it and really tasty. Not much in the area except the Galaxy hotel but really no need to leave the Venetian for days as it has everything. 4 pools outside. Golf course of level 5. Breakfast finished quite early(10.30am) considering you may not leave casino until 5am or later. I'd definitely stay here again,50

The rest top notch. A lot of plug in the room and the table for working really great. But will be best if they can give free wifi.",50

On arrival at the Macau ferry terminal, cross the road (use the underpass) to take the free shuttle to the Venetian (there is one every 2 minutes).  Upon arrival at the Venetian, we checked in at the West Lobby and to check in 6 of us, in to 4 rooms, took no more than 10 minutes - which compared to Vegas is excellent!! The rooms are large, and we has a view over the mini golf course, Hard Rock, City of Dreams and in the far distance, Macau Airport.  The rooms are exactly like those at their Vegas counterpart, with huge bathrooms and seperate shower and toilet.  They give you a map at check in and believe me you'll need it!

The toilet  had it's own room within the bathroom for added privacy.   We were in a no smoking floor, but the first room they showed us obviously had previous occupants that smoked as the smell had clung to the carpet. Our request to be moved to another room was accommodated immediately and without fuss.   The room was clean, all the furniture was well appointed as were the bed and bath…",40
"I just love their huge hotel room.  2 queen beds, 1 sofa bed and a huge toilet and bathroom with bathtub.    The hotel is enormous and it's almost normal for guests to keep on getting lost inside but it's somehow a welcome experience as you get to see different parts of the hotel as well.  Just remember which side of the hotel you're staying (east, west, north, south) and you'll be fine.  The shops inside their mall are upscale, of course, so those who want to spend won't be disappointed. They do have a food court that offers various cuisine so do check out each food stall.    We didn't play in the casino because it's a no-no for us but we still enjoyed our stay here for our convention.  If you can afford it, this is the place to stay in Macau.",50
"Room is big! shuttle bus is frequent. Services is good with clean bathroom. After checked out, my BF left his mobile in the room. Initially there was an issue related to security clearance  seeking verification and other crap etc.... In short, the security refused to co-operative even we told them that we were hurry up for ferry. The staff tried to help but no luck. Later Elaine, the manger, who was proactive and kind enough to chase the security with her authorization. She personally collected the phone rather than us. Very good customer services indeed. I am not sure if other staff offered the same standard as hers. Once again good job Elaine!",40

The staff are very efficient and helpful,with a good knowledge of the resort.

There were a couple things I wasn't so impressed with,like the fact it took a couple of hours for our bags to be sent to our room.The baggage staff told me the bags would be taken to our room in about 20 minutes,but two hours later I had to ring and ask them to hurry up,as I had some medicine in my bag which I need to take.

"We took the ferry from HK to Macau in 1st class and it was worth the little extra as there is free drinks/noodles offered but more importantly you disembark first so you can get through immigration and on the free bus to the Venetian fairly quickly.  Check in was very smooth, no queues!  The rooms are very spacious, well-appointed and offer everything you need from minbar, TV, Iron, sofa, comfy bed etc.  Bathroom was massive with good power shower and toiletries however you need to be short if you want under it without bending!  Pools were good (4 of them) with a decent selection of poolside drinks/cocktails/snacks. One of the pools is for adults only which was a good touch if you just wanted to chill without screaming weans running around.  Breakfast – Café Deco was average,…",50
"I went to the Malo spa and clinic to get my hair cut. My stylist, Raymond, was very nice and considerate. I loved the result. What else do I need to say? If you need a salon in Macao and don't know where to go, ask for Raymond at the Venetian spa. You wont regret it.",50
"Have been to Venetian Macao quiet a few times and have spent lots of time there. Interacted with the hotel team in arranging a wedding. Very professionally managed hotel. Great amenities. Wonderfully large Suite Rooms. Great Casino, Swimming Pool.. I just love everything about the Venetian macau.",50
"Been there several times, and I can be surprised everytime when I am there. They offer not only the casino services, but also loads of entertainment facilities and shoppings. You can totally lose yourself there! The decoration of the hotel is also wonderful!  Running through the shopping area, there is a canal, it is where you can take a Gondora. Just imagine  yourself in Venice city! The feeling is brilliant!!!",50
"If you have ever stayed at the Venetian in Vegas then you will know what to expect. Top Notch all the way. The room was extremely large and beautiful. The beds were wonderful and everything was spotless. I can honestly say that the hotel staff, the rooms and the pool were 5 star.",50
What A place i think this is the biggest hotel i have ever stayed in! ok lets talk rooms i have a double room...i had loads of space was super clean bathroom and everything was just perfect! the hotel on itself with the mall the casino and what not...its all just bIG! the venice canal only is worth a visit...it felt very sureal with the whole fake painted sky! was kinda hard to feel time when you are inside! superb!  it all was just SUPERB! would love to go again!,50
"The most beautiful hotel of MACAO. Eccellent location, unbeliaveble suite and fantastic casino. You can enjoy all the day inside. Of course 1 or 2 nights are enought in MACAO but if you want to come here, please stay in The Venetian.",50
The Ventian Macau is an insanely big complex. We loved the style from the inside as well from the outside. As any hotel in this category don't expect a very personal approach. The service however was quite allright. We stayed 3 nights in a Bella suite. This suite is nicely furnished. Our room had a couple of great walldeco's. It's a big room with a sunken level. Looks very nice! Television wasn't a flatscreen but that's okay. One  drawback is that the wifi isn't free and isn't very fast. The bathroom is also nice and clean. The view from the room is great. The hotel also has a couple  of great pools. You can enjoy a peacefull sunbathing there in very nice surroundings. The gym is okay. Not that spectacular but it does the job. We loved the golfcourse (putting) on top of the…,40
"Stayed their with a group of friends. Huge will be small word for this property. Really amazing to maintain these kind of resorts. Inspite of so many rooms, check in was smooth. Rooms were very big with a separate living area. Breakfast spread was very goods with Indian & chinese dishes apart from Eurpoean.  We need to remember the directions ( north, south etc) to avoid getting lost. Casino is a the real highlight of this Hotel. Big shopping area and Gandola ride is a treat. Once in a life time experince",50
"Really enjoyed the stay there!! The room was huge and can comfortably sleep a couple with up to two kids without extra bed. It's attached to the shopping mall so easy for the ladies to spend money! But the pro is that the breakfast is not that good, average 4 star food. Anyway, recommended!!",50
"Check in was fast and efficient and our room was as expected, however WiFi was not free! This hotel is huge and getting lost is part of the norm just remembering if you are staying North and South is a battle, lots to see while you are finding your way around. The gondola ride was enjoyable with very friendly drivers! While our room was clean and service was great, the public areas (toilets) are dirty with bins overflowing and water on the floor. We experienced this on more than one occasion in different locations of the hotel. If you have the time book a massage at the   MALO CLINIC HEALTH AND WELLNESS this was one of the most amazing experiences I have had. The service and amenities were wonderful, the massage was bliss!!!!",40
Visiting Venetian Macau was on top of our Must See places in Macau. We ate at the Three Monkeys Restaurant just at one of the squares inside this huge hotel. We then browsed through all the shops and viewed the gondola area. You can spend almost the whole day touring this hotel.,40
"Our second stay here and if anything it felt even bigger and more impersonal than our last trip.  Admittedly, we stayed during Golden Week and the public holiday weekend in Hong Kong,  so the place was heaving.  It was expensive and overall we didn't feel we got the service we paid for. It certainly wasn't personal. Breakfast  was overpriced and when we got there, there was hardly anything left to eat. Elevators crowded to capacity so it took ages to get up and downstairs. Room was large but a little tired. Our suite looked out over the ugly air conditioning plant. It was awful.  The TV is small for a suite. No nice toiletries and shower head not working properly. Hair drier broken. Mini bar not replaced.  The highlight was the House of Dancing Water show which was brilliant and…",40
"This was my second time in venetian (Wynn was full), the charm of the hotel was not the same as the first time. The rooms are humongous and shouts luxury. The ice world is a nice attraction within the hotel. Shopping in venetian is at its best, you have The Canal shops for normal shopping and Shoppes at four season for luxury - high end shopping. Had a great time, but next will try some other hotel.",40
"This hotel is very huge and every room was huge (all suites) and as a result, 1. the room was not very clean. You could clearly see the top of TV cabinet or surface of desk being less than perfectly clean. 2. It's hard to find the right elevator in the ocean of game table.  However, the service was surprisingly fast. I ate in the room 3 times and each time the food arrived within 30 minutes. The food also tasted excellent.  What bugged me was that everything at Venetian was centered around gambling, so you really feel everything else took a backseat. The lounge, bar, nightclub were all void of festivity, a big contrast to the horde of Chinese surrounding Sic Bo tables. If you love gambling and go there for gambling, I highly recommend this place, as it is far cheaper than Wynn…",40
"The facade was a good replica of St Marco square & the painting on the ceiling at the Main Lobby & shopping area was really nice too.  The hotel is so sprawled, so make sure you wear comfortable shoes. No need to go to the shopping mall as you can find shops of mid to high end especially it is connected to Four Season.   I had a room on the 20th floor and it overlooked the City of Dreams, the putting green and the villas.  Eventhough we took the smallest room, it was still big and grand.   It is so convenient to move around the city with the complimentary bus service that shuttles you to all the other hotels within the Cotai area or even to the city from some hotel.  I really enjoyed my stay of 3 nights at the Venetian.  If you are airline staff, write in to check the rates as…",50
"The Venetian is a large very comfortable and nice hotel located in Macau.  Macau is located on mainland China, a short 1 hour ferry ride from Hong Kong.  Worth a visit if you like gambling, fine dinning, big time shows and shopping.  This hotel is very large so I recommend the express check-in before you arrive via the internet and you will avoid having to wait in a long line. Service is good the property is attached to two large shopping centers and is directly across the street from the City of Dreams  Casino, Shopping and Hotel Complex which is even nicer in my opinion (if that's possible) than the Beautiful Venetian. You will have to clear customs but it is quick. We returned directly to Hong Kong Airport via the ferry service instead of having to return to town to catch…",50
"What a hotel. You have to be there to experience. Some times you can get lost in it. The decor may be overdone for some but I liked it. A grand 5 star. The artificial Venice city created is mind boggling, just look at the sky, it is hard to believe that the sky is not real. The rooms are big and fantastic. Also the huge casino is a experience you must not miss even if you are not a great gambler. It is not cheap and not expected to be so. However not too much expensive either. One of Macao's best hotel.",50
"13 weeks in a palatial, 9th floor Venetian Hotel room was an experience of sublime comfort and excellence. The room I had was facing in the direction of Macao's airport and with the 3rd floor golf greens directly below. Enormous windows, enormous and supremely comfortable bed, lovely furniture, a bathroom nearly as large as the room I normally live in, in Australia..... The superlatives go on and on. Due to a work contract at The Venetian itself, my accommodation was part of the package, and as such I was not privy to the room cost and forgot to enquire, but suffice to say it would not be cheap, I believe something in the region of US $395 per night, maybe more. Very simply, though, one of the finest of hundreds of hotel rooms, I've ever stayed in.",40
"we booked the Royal suite (king bed) for two nights in September. The room is spacious and there is a sofa bed which staff has kindly opened and turned into a bed for us. check in/out is quick and service is good. Its a huge hotel, it took us an hour looking for the swimming pool which is in a different wing and requires several elevator rides and long corridor walks, but well worth the visit, the pools are fantastic and warm. the spa is quite small and could get crowded. food court so-so but the blue sky ceilings impressive. Gondola ride worth doing. one fantastic thing about Macau are the shuttle buses which takes you to the airport or another hotel or to the ferry. free transport! had a look at other hotel lobbies (Crown, Hard Rock Cafe, Galaxy) and I can say Im happy I chose…",40
"My 4th time in Macao and my third time to stay in Venetian. I could spend all day in the hotel, you'll find most of the things you need. From the reception desk all the way from the staff  (room service,Gym instructor, Pool attendant ) they were all very polite.",50
Having a Morton's Made my night.  Needed a slab of prime rib and lyonnaise potatoes.  Will be back.   Very helpful on getting to Hong Kong.  Casino just doesn't seem to have the excitement of Las Vegas though. ,50
I loved the in house dining and excellent service by the waiter. The rooms were gorgeous and really value for money if you are looking for comfort. One down side is the morning check out which can be quite slow as counter might only have 1 serving officer.,50
"room is spacious, although it is meant for 2 person, the hotel room is big enough for 4. Casino,podium is just located below the hotel, however, the things selling are quite expensive. They have free shuttle to the main places like airport, checkpoint to HK, transportation is the last thing to worry about.",50
"We booked their summer getaway package (which was, the best hotel deal throughout Macau at that time). In the package, they top in free buffet breakfast / lunch, ice world ticket, and cotaijet one way ticket, on top of your suite room. All for a price that usually only afford just the room.   GETTING IN THERE (TurboJet Ferry - Free Shuttle) Arriving at the Macau Ferry Terminal by TurboJet, we took the free shuttle to the hotel. The drive was about 15-20 minutes since Venetian Macau is located at Taipa Island (crossing a long bridge). The bus dropped us at West Lobby hotel which was.. annoyingly crowded with group of tourist from china mainland and other countries, couldn't walk without bumping to anyone.  CHECK-IN From the Shuttle drop-off, simply follow the headboard sign to…",40
"i love this amazing hotel. Its like you're in Macau (of course you are),Venice (gondola ride, grand canal shoppes), and Las Vegas (casino) all in just one place..Place was really huge and has lot to offer..Just really amazing..Everything you are looking for is already in here..Nice and polite staff (especially when I forgot its not allowed to take videos of the casino harharhar!),and free shuttle bus for everyone too..We would definitely go back!",50
"It was my first visit to macau on 8th sep,12.I had planed to visit a lots of places there.First i went to Venetian.But i couldnt leave from there till night(As my return ferry time was at 8.30).I was just lost with in that hotel.It was sooooooooooo big n beautyful.One cant describe that in words,u hv to feel it personally.Although i wasnt stayed there,but i visited the shops n casino over there.Another beautyful thing which i visited was the ICEWORLD.It was simply awasom.I want to visit there again n again.The thing which will pinch u over there is the cost of food.It is costly compared to others.But u wil get vast choice.Overall its an great experience",40
"My family and I travelled to Macao for a couple of days early September. If you are looking for a 5 star hotel then this is the place to choose. The Venetian is an enormous hotel with so much to do. You barely have to leave the hotel.   The service was fantastic with staff being very friendly and helpful. We were given a huge room with a view over parts of the city. The bathroom was also huge. We were overly pleased with our room.  The hotel had gondola rides which we absolutely loved. It really depicted a ride in Italy’s Venice. Our driver was extremely friendly and even sang a few song for us. It was so much fun.   The Venetian has a lot of shopping you can choose from. There are also many restaraunts, café’s and food courts. We particularly enjoyed an Italian restaurant…",50
"i visited twoice macau and both times i stayed in this hotel , it has i thinkk the biggest casino i see ever , this is hotel has shopping mall in km. it will take 2-3 days if u want to see it completely , everything is well managed , dozens of resturant for all kind of cusine , it s the best ............",50
"We stayed at the venetian for 1 night. We were meant to go to Macau for the day but we ended up staying here for the night. Stunning hotel. It is very big so you can definitely get lost. The room was massive, which was excellent. The bathroom was beautiful. Overall i do recommend this hotel it is just stunning. There are so many restaurants to eat and also the shopping centre attached to the hotel is great if you love shopping",50
Going across from Hong Kong by ferry to Macau is definately a part of the magic. Upon arrival at the port the endless line of busses waiting to take you to your choice hotel makes life easy. it is easier still when you see the busses that the Venetian provides which transport you comfortably to their hotel. Going through their turnstiles which seem to rotate endlessly with one bus arriving after another you enter another world. From the highly polishedstone floors to the plush carpeted and well lit areas in the casino areas to the amazing retail shops and of course the canal travel. Time stands still in the mezanine area as the sky (artificially) remains blue with beautifull pufs of cloud for realism. When I visited the hotel five years (nearly) ago it was at its teething stages…,50
"Very similar to the original one in Las Vegas . Comes with massive games tables adjoining the lobby area which is always crowded with people.Huge shopping complex with three levels of shops  may be good for people with children .Check-in good,don't have to wait too long but can be only after certain time,I think 1.30pm. Rooms are quite sizable and clean,check out is fast.There is hotel van service to and from airport only 10 minutes away..The drawback is having to access them through the huge gaming area which is full of cigarette smoke.Although there is the south side entrance. If you want quieter hotels there are plenty of options unless its a Chinese holiday season of high weekends then you are more likely to find room here at short notice.If your stay comes with…",40
"This is an extremely huge hotel. We are a family of  4 and my mother came and stayed with is in the room on the last night too. The double bed was sufficient to hold 1 Adult 1 Child and there was a double's sofa bed. The room is so spacious, you dont have the feeling its cramp. 2 tvs in the room  - one infront of the bed and one in front of the sofa bed in the living room.Housekeeping was kind to include more bottled water knowing we have more than 2 guests in the room.  Its a long walk to the room as we cant cut thru the casino with kids around.  Getting food is easy as the food court is located within. Set back is the dishes are not cleared promptly leaving dishes stacking during peak hours.  Shopping was fantastic. Its the summer sale and things are so cheap compared to…",40
"Stayed here on our second night in Macau. Night before, we stayed at the Holiday Inn Cotai Central so we just crossed the road to get here. Booked via their website at 30% off (advanced prepaid booking promo), and was given the Key Express Pass supposedly for faster check-in. However, ""express check-in"" took a while since the guests before us seemed to have a problem with their booking, and there was only one staff manning the counter. We would have finished faster if we just went through the regular queue. Anyway, it was not much of a hassle, it just did not meet my expectation for an ""express"" check-in.   Suite was really spacious, with spacious bathroom too. I also liked their bathroom amenities. There's a tv in the bedroom, and there's another one in the living area.…",40
"The WiFi is not free anywhere, but it costs 20 € per day, there is no bidet in the rooms!!! And this is not good for a hôtel so expensive... It's also difficult find in the room the phone.... If you book before the price is good....",40
"I stayed with my family in this hotel. Since it was crowded, they upgraded our rooms to Bella suites. The rooms were huge.. They had given us two queen sized beds, which was enough and more for our small family - Myself, my wife, and my two small children. There were two TVs in the room. Never saw any staff on our floor during our 2.5 day stay. I was always wondering how they got the rooms cleaned..The shopping area was huge and we really like the false sky inside. The breakfast buffet was really crowded on the days we had gone there and we had to wait in line for almost one hour to get a seat. Checkout was confusing for us and there was no one to help us out and there was a big queue at the reception counter.",40
"if u didnt go to venetian when you go macau you missed  the main attraction , as this is the place to be if you like to see architecture ,best attraction , good brands  and affordable  too , lavish spacious room , very nice experience , except that they dissappoint you on room service  that makes you feel too bad  , thats the worst part maybe hotel is  understaffed , really the room service is terrible  , rest all is  excellent , went with friends memorable experience",40
"this hotel is trully recommended, love to comeback here someday, the royale suite is outstanding and very huge..never had two different TV in one room before :LOL..and i feel like the price is still reasonable for a suite that big..",50
This was my second stay at this hotel and it was amazing again! the rooms and bathrooms are huge. The pools are also amazing. The shopping is great too. Close to other casinos and there is a bus that takes you the ferry terminal and to some if the other hotels. Shame there is no free wifi though. Otherwise best hotel by far in Macau. ,50
"Stayed here as part of a work conference and was blown away with this hotel and resort. We caught the turbo jet from Honk Kong Port (Kowloon) to Macau which only took about 60-75 minutes and the journey was very smooth. The cost ranges from HK$150 – $330 depending of which cabin class and the day of journey. From the moment you walk in you are amazed with the sheer size of the complex and the beauty of the Venetian theme. I stayed in a Royale Suite with a sunken living room. The rooms are so comfortable and spacious and the bathrooms are huge with marble features and ample shower space. Everything you need to have a fantastic time is located in the resort. A variety of casual and fine dining restaurants, there is some great shopping at the Grand Canal shops while watching…",50
"The hotel itself is so grand you would get lost if you don't read the signages or study the map. It's location is also great being just in front of the City of Dreams. CHeck-in was fast despite the number of guests in line as it is proportioned by the number of check-in counters serving. It also offers free shuttle service to almost all the destinations in Macau so you won't have to spend a single cent for transpo. The room is also huge you can even sleep in the bathroom :) If you checked out early and would want to stroll around macau, the concierge will gladly accept your luggages for storage for your convenience.",50
"We don't normally stay in a) very expensive hotels nor b) big hotel complexes but on this occasion we are glad we did.  If you are looking for: a luxury splurge, a break from Asia, a hotel experience unlike any other (unless you go to Las Vegas) then this is the place.  We booked a Cotai view suite on a special deal that included tickets to Ice World, Gondola ride and some other bits and pieces.  The suite was the best and largest we have ever stayed in. The view by night was fabulous. The bathroom suite was the size of our bedroom at home.  We had a great game of mini golf, we spend a few hours watching the gamers in the casino, we had a couple of hours by the pool, we visited ice world we had italien ice cream by a venetian canel followed by a gondola ride - faultless.  Not a…",50
"stay at venetian just for the experience. the rooms are pricey but huge, 4 of us stayed in a room so it wasnt that expensive.the rooms are beautiful, though a bit old. even budget travellers can try this hotel. there's a foodcourt with lots of food choices. also there's a starbucks if you need coffee for breakfast.if you dont like going to the casino, there are lots of other things to do within the complex,swimming, shopping, or watch some singing and dancing in the hallways, check the schedules",40
"The rooms are amazing, it's so luxurious. The hotel and casino has everything you need, you don't have to leave if you don't want to. Friendly staff, great atmosphere, great pools, buzzing casino, what more could you want?!",50
"I realize this hotel gives you great value for your money, having just come from HongKong, where we paid 3 times the price of the Bella suite, for a room that was 1/3 its size. There is a small passageway that leads from the lobby straight to the food court & the rooms, so our children didn't need to see & pass by the gaming tables. The 4 swimming pools were quite crowded, except for the 1 adults-only pool. The gym was quite busy; it should be bigger for a resort of this size. We enjoyed a delicious Peking duck dinner at the Chinese restaurant on St. Mark's square. Shopping is what we did the most of during our stay here; we were disappointed that some shops closed earlier than the designated 11 pm closing time. Service was good & efficient, throughout the resort. The bottomline…",40
"We spent 5 days in the Venitian Macau and after arriving at the hotel you are surprised by the size of the place - first thinking it cannot work . The check-in is well organized, even if you have to wait a little. The crew is helpful and give you most of the information you need to ""survive"" in this complex building.. The rooms are big, clean and you get all you need. After check-in you can discover the places such as the shopping area - casino - swimming pool and the multiple restaurants. Close to the Venitian you have a new hotels - so alternatives are given. The breakfast buffet gives you many choices of different food, try all. The service is very good even if there many people having breakfast at the same time.",50
"I went to Macau for my honeymoon to Macau and stayed in this hotel for 2 days. The first thing that strikes you once u enter the lobby is its opulence. The staff is very friendly and takes care of u from the word GO as soon as u enter the hotel. The lady at the counter handed over the keys and after describing the hugeness of the hotel, gave us a guided map and showed us where we are and where our suite was. Finally, as a gesture, she told us that as VENETIAN is a different world altogether, as a token, she gave us some Venetian dollars for our spend at the hotel, be it in food or shopping and also a free cotai jet pass back to Hong Kong. We walked and walked for the next 2 days and covered the length and breadth of the shopping areas and restaurants. For the complimentary…",50
"What do I say about this hotel its more like a city in itself, one of the most fulfilling experiences of my life, Best Casino hotel in Macua, Its HUGE and trust me its huge, Spent 2 days just exploring the hotel, just have great memories of this hotel didnt need to venture out, thought a bit crowded,, it still rocks and leaves an impression. The rooms are fabulous, food is great, its rightly said if its Macau it hsa to be Venetian! Keep 2 days for Macau when you plan your trip if you stay here! Happy gambling!",50
"As with the Las Vegas version, this is a great hotel and is value for money as long as you avoid the gambling. To access your hotel room though, you will need to go on a long walk through a casino full of elderly Chinese people gambling away their pensions. This is obviously intentional. Plenty of entertainment, a shopping mall and a fake indoor lake with a boat.",50
"The Venetian Macao Resort-Hotel is located quite close to the Airport and offers free coach transfers.  We checked into a Royale Suite, which was spacious and furnished with over-the-top furnishings befitting a Venetian Palazzo !  Dining options are aplenty with several speciality restaurants and also al fresco dining overlooking the water bodies on the spacious patio.  I guess, it's worth a visit even if one is not into the Casino scene as it successfully manages to live up to it's hype in more ways than one!",40
I have had the good fortune to travel to Vegas and i had seen the Venetian Resort during that trip.. This time i decided to stay in it during my 1st solo holiday abroad.. The resort is magnificent.. It has the largest casino in Macau if gambling is your thing.. They have replicated the level of entertainment one would find in Vegas.. They have a theatre where you can see Cirque du Soleil performing.. This one is not to be missed if you haven’t seen something like it before.. They even let you take pictures without flash VS no pics in Vegas.. There is a play boy themed bar where you will witness live performances and the waitresses dressed like playboy bunny.  There are dance and song gigs that you’ll see while just walking from the north to the south end of the hotel. There are…,50
"Venetian is a good enough place to stay in Asia - The massive kids slide park is a big hit with our boy so we went back. They had a ""family suite"" this time which was excellent - luxurious bunk beds & a play area with drawing books, etc. The pool area is great.  Just watch your bags when walking around the mall & near casino - we had a few things taken when backs were turned...",40
"We stayed in a Cotai View suite on the 16 floor. There are 3,000 rooms. Ours was very spacious with a good large bed & went down to a step down lounge with views of the growth of this area & the airport. While we were there there was a typhoon but apart from rain on the window you wouldn't know it. We also ate at a courtyard restaurant with fake sky so was amazed at the damage to trees & fences the next morning on an island tour. Although there are a lot of people in the hotel most the time with people on the casino floor it is not as crowded as it could be. Be prepared for a lot of walking as it is very large.",40
"The Venetian pretty offers everything under one roof.  It is very close from the airport as well as ferry terminal.  The Four Seasons is right next, and one of the biggest duty free mall is in between, all connected.  My family always stay here since its Bella Suite offers two queen beds and the suite is very spacious.    Take elevator to the 3rd floor to access shopping mall, gondola ride and food court.  All the way to the ground floor for casino and theatre as well as bus terminal.",50
"A jaw-dropping experience for me indeed, while I stayed for a night in this magnificent hotel. My friends and I were very lucky as we managed to book a suite in this hotel. I have to admit that we were living it up as royalties indeed.   What amazes me was the huge bathroom of the suite, with a separate area for the toilet bowl area. There was both a bathtub and shower area, so you could take your pick whether to laze about in the bathtub or to have a quick shower.   The room itself had even a living room area, equipped with two television sets (there's no need to fight for the channels!). Beds were very comfortable to sleep in, it was as like some bed out of a certain fairy tale story, complete with big fluffy pillows, nice comforters and pashmina throws.   The hotel itself has…",50
It was really quite a nice experience at the Venetian. The room (Cotai View Bella Suite) was spacious and well above average. The beds were big and soft. There was a living room area which I enjoyed. It is really quite a good deal for the price. Our room had a nice view as well although there was construction taking place in the surrounding area. TV channels were limited.,40
"This hotel is situated in Macau, which can be reached from Hong-kong.We went by ferry from Central near Wan-chai. It took us exactly one hour to reach Macau . From there  we first went to the Macau tower from where we got a panaromic view of whole of Macau , later went to the Venetian Hotel which is a world of its own. It is huge and simply gorgeous , having casinos, casinos and casinos everywhere where people of all hues and shades are in a constant state of anticipation for wind-falls , biting away at their nails for the elusive riches . There are food-courts serving food of all types , tasty but costly . You have made money in the casino then go up the elevators and buy clothes , watches, shoes. toys , etc. Then for fun you have the Gandolas , a boat taking you round the…",40
"I was amazed at the operation of this hotel 3000 bedrooms and 11000 staff. Hotel very busy at all times, Great shopping Food court an array of food but found very exepsive for the far east and for the quality and not done with a smile. Mind you I do feel sorry for them, they dont stop all day.  Rooms great very spacious suites and kept spotless.  The Casinon is the largest in the world and is amazing.  When we did encounter the hotel staff they were very good.  My only complaint is there are security staff on at the lifts who are supposed to ask for your room key, to make sure you are resident. At no time did we see this in action. The staff were too busy looking at what was going on. This in turn led my husband being asked twice in the lift if h needed company that night ( dont…",40
I have no idea how to frame this review as you cannot compare this place to anything else of it's type. Firstly it is HUGE but they seem to cope very well. The casino is the largest in the world and the rooms are very big. One thing you lose straight away is character - it's just not possible. The guests as you would expect are 98% Chinese with a smattering of other nationalities but it's a great atmosphere around the tables.,40
We stayed here for 2N and it was amazing. The Service was great the staff were amazing. I felt i was royality. The Room was a bit out dated and need a bit of touch up but room  was big ver big. The view was good and Breakfast was so varied and wonderfull. Could not help eating so much and then had to burn it off with long walks around the malls.,50
"If you check in in the morning, its like a fish market! but once you enter your room, its a different experience altogether. I stayed at the Bella suite, and some of our friends stayed at the Verona suite. Both the rooms were amazing, but if you can afford it, the Verona suite is awesome! it has its own espresso machine, and a bar like counter.  The food court has so many choices and the food was really good. the room service was great as well. The bathrooms are very well lit but the rooms are just ok. Also i found the shower head to be a very olden type...  Overall the experience was good.. I would definitely recommend it to first timers in Macau!",40
"The room is very large, but not that luxury.  They don't provide nice shampoo/lotion.   Convenient for shopping but not that convenient for family travellers.   As kids are not allowed to step in casino area, you have to detour a very far way in order to get to the room from lobby.  For the same price, family traveller might want to consider Four Season instead of Venetian.",40
"The twin bed room was large. So was the toilet & sitting room. Room service was prompt & curteous. The hotel's interior is vast & can take a full day to leisurely go around. Be sure to collect a pamphlet from the reception regarding the hotel to identify & visit the interesting locations. Within the hotel runs a canal in which Gondola rides are available We got 500 HK Dollars each as complimentery. These were valid at the Casinos, restaurants & several shops within the hotel. The casinos are large & are available on several floors. Free & frequent coach service is available to the jetty etc. We also took the standard half day tour of Macau. This tour is a sham & completely avoidable. A hotel to experience.",50
"Was very impressed by the size of this place. The room was large but somewhat cheap feeling as the materials just didn't feel all that luxury.  However, good experience. Nice staff and nice tourist attraction in general.",40
"Awesome stay. Beautiful hotel, one of the best holidays ever ! The casino is lovely. Staff is very helpful and service is extremely prompt. Staff went out of their way to make us feel comfortable. We are definitely going back again.",50
"The hotel is really huge, with thousands of visitors even on weekdays, its unbelievable. We thought we were in another busy transportation terminal! We do love the luxurious suites with its royal European touch, 2 TVs, 2 queen beds and  lounge with a sofa bed, and its great concierge services. Too big to be personal for a 5-star, but considering the  room facilities, it is worth every penny paid! From the north wing, short cut to the hotel main lobby through the casino takes a good 6-7 minutes' walk - good thing we could drop off keys on check out at the wing's lobbies instead of the main lobby. The hotel's free shuttle buses are a great way to move around Macau, by the way.",40
"My family and I stayed at The Venetian Macau in early August 2012. From the first time we booked the hotel, we got a good deal for the hotel tariff.  The first time we got the there we're amazed by the huge size of the hotel. At the reception desk we were given a map of the hotel area. Yes!! Indeed the Map is helpful, people may got lost inside the hotel area. Our suites is the Bella Suites, it's so wow!! Even my son won't come out of the room, it's so comfortable. I never got bored wondering around the shoppes when my hubby is at the casino.  The services is just a button away with the privellege assistant.  And the venetian gives it's best for my 3months baby, the staff was told that there's a small baby in my room so each time they knocked on the door, they would wait…",50
"Rooms are luxurious and comfortable, the view on the city is amazing. Lunch at the bamboo buffet is delicious. Good for shopping. Service is not bad, maybe they're not that focused on each customer because of the huge amount of guests.",50
"I'll keep it short... it's everything it says it is. Luxury, a palace, a true 'resort', theater, shops, casino, pools, Grand Canals... if you have the opportunity to stay here - don't miss it... from the moment you enter the building the wow factor is with you... when you enter your room ... take a deep breath... and enjoy, you won't want to leave.",50
This place is unbelievably huge ! We spent 3 nights here and could have quite happily never left the hotel there is that much to do . It is the biggest hotel I have ever stayed at with over 3000 rooms but even though it is big the place is like a well oiled machine . As soon as you arrive at the airport you see sign for all the different hotels and they point you to the direction of the free shuttle bus so don't waste money on a private car because it's a quick journey and they will try and rip you off . As soon as you enter the hotel your bags are taken and for such a large complex the check in desk provided no wait. The rooms had wifi but it was costly so for the occasional check in most of the restaurants provide it free. The pools were breath taking and with so many you were…,50
"We had 2 Royal Suite and 1 Bella Suite. I was blown away by the Cotai view in Bella Suite. The rooms and bathrooms are huge and clean. The beds are comfortable. No complaints on the rooms.   Venetian is a shopping paradise. All sorts of brands and products, endless shops. Venetian is also full of Asian tourists. The only thing I dislike about Venetian is the smoking environment in the casino. You don't need to walk into the casino to smell the ciggarretes, you can smell them once you are near the casino.",50
"When you visit Macau a must see is the Venetian Macao Resort Hotel at the Cotai Area. It's a huge place wherein you can do all your shopping, dining,family bonding with lots of picture taking and for some .. playing in the casino. Staying in the hotel is just the perfect vacation for anyone. A whole day is not even enough to explore all of it. It's even better the real Venice.",40
"Rooms were, what I expected, large and spacious with amenities thrown in. Everything was good all the way, from the checkin to the check out. Even when I changed room on my second last day of the trip from two queens bed to a king, was done with minimal fuss. The only small glitches, was that my handphone was misplaced at the macau customs.The staff at the hotel, whom I asked for information and help, was generally okay. However, the staff could had went the extra mile by checking with the customs on whether they found a phone there without being prompted. The second glitch, it seems venetian resort hotel is getting more and more crowded. The last time when I visited, even duing meal hours, it was relatively easy to find empty tables and chairs. This time, it was so crowded that…",40
"Stayed in the Venetian Macau during June, 2012 for 1 night.  We stayed in one of the Rialto Suites.  Check-in : Check-in was a bit delayed as we were checking into 3 rooms at once and it was difficult to get rooms which were close together.  Eventually after 30 minutes they sorted it out.  Impressions of the check-in were not as bad as some other reviewers had commented on. Yes it was busy and a bit impersonal but given the size of the hotel I thought it was reasonable.  Room : The Rialto Suite is very big (over 1,800 sq ft) with a very large sitting and dining area with guest toilet connected to the master bedroom and ensuite via a short corridor.  Everything was clean and functioned well.  However, some aspects of the room are starting to show their age (TV, bathroom, general…",40

The casino was one of biggest in the world.the rooms are just awsome  with elevated sitting area near to window...",50
"Checkin / Checkout - Smooth, wait 5-10min, process time another 5-8min, It was like an airline with more then 12counters working in parallel - I think due to sheer amount of rooms they have.  Room - We were upgraded and hence got an one higher class room, very good size, with elevated sitting area near to window, travelling with 2kids (9 / 12) we had two queen size beds in the room and hence no problems at all. Very large bathtub and bathroom, very clean and with soft white towels and large amount of toilet accessories. Breakfast - Very grand buffet, lots n lots of choices you need explore slowly, give atleast 1hour if you want to enjoy breakfast. Casino - Very large with lots of different zones, personally spent very less time as we were kids who are not allowed inside. Mall -…",40
"What can I say about this place that others have not said already.  When you are in the hotel, it looks exactly like Venetian Vegas except for all the Chinese people and signs.  We stayed there 1 night (with wife and my 3.5 old son).  For $250, you get a large suite to live like a king.  Rooms are big enough for kids to run around.  Of course the hotel and casino parts are great too.  I wish the entire Cotai strip would be more built-up to resemble more like the Vegas Strip.  Very convenient from ferry landing and airport; literally a 3 minute drive.  If you take ferry from Hong Kong (like we did), the big blue Venetian bus is there waiting for you.  For a comparison, before the Macau stay, we stayed in Hong Kong for few days (at Renaissance Harbor View) and Venetian room is…",50
"I stayed in this hotel for business purposes and must say that their service was impeccable. They went out of their way to offer us Indian breakfast (Indians have built a reputation for themselves in this area I think), etc.  The Indian food quality was not great and in any case, I stayed away from it.    This hotel is like a city in itself -  with world's or asia's biggest casino, 37 plus restaurants, special shopping experiences in the indoor grand canal shoppes located at level 3, over 3000 rooms and over 70 conference facilities, it is enough to leave you speechless and may be a little lost even.  The rooms were very nice and very large, with separate seating and sleeping areas, two TVs, large bathrooms that came with prompt room service.   the restaurants that I visited…",50
"The hotel are beautifully build and the indoor Grand Canal Shoppes under a virtually cloudy roof and around the canal that looks like of Venice gives the most attraction to tourist. Cleanliness and maintenance of the room is simply the best. The service is very good and the staff are very friendly and helpful. I would stay there again if I go back to Macao. What I can't stand when you step out of the room, other areas are too crowded and the locations are so far away from each other that by walking from end to another end develops a footache. If you wish to go to the city, you can take the bus service of the nearby hotel.",40
i stayed there with family for three nights.The suites are simply superb!I was given a free upgrade from a Royal Suite to the next higher traveling with my wife and son-this room had two king beds. The rooms are symbolic of opulent luxury. Cleanliness and maintenance is simply the best. But the trouble starts moment you step out of the room the other areas. Crowded like a peak hours railway station!Moment you go out for food or shopping the entire fun of the stay evaporates. Morevover all locations are so far away from each other that one's feet develops serious ache by walking from one end to another. The distances warrant walkators or battery operated rides or any other such help to reduce walking torture(!)We went to see the Ice Exhibition and had to walk for such long…,40
"Great place to see, stay and experience! The rooms are nice and clean. But the USP of the hotel is the indoor Grand Canal Shoppes situated under a virtual cloudy roof and around a canal built on the lines of Venice. And yeah the casino is nice too.",50
"The hotel looks the same as the one at Las Vegas.  It's crowded during the day time, but it's very quite at the night time.  I only stayed for one night, didn't really spend too much time at the hotel.  Overall, it's a beautiful hotel.  The room is clean and comfortable.  I would stay there again if I go back.  One suggestion, if you go to Macao, try to go there through Hong Kong instead of Mainland China.  It's super overcrowded at the custom.  It spent me over two hours to departing China and arriving to Macao.  Hope this help!",40
"This is the biggest hotel i have ever seen in my life. It took me 2 days to explore it. This hotel have shopping mall with many luxuries brand,restaurant, foodcourt and gondola as in venice. The casino was one of biggest in the world.My 3 day stay was great.",50
"hotel room is so big its around 70sqm. all room in this hotel is suite room. location is perfect because this hotel have shoping mall with many luxuries brand, casino, restaurant, foodcourt and gondola. they make gondola same as in venice (but inside the building)because people who 'drive' gondola can sing italian song with beautifull voice. bed is comfortable and room facility is good.to go around city you can use bus from hotel or taxi. when i book this hotel in summer they give voucher 500MOP (50usd) which we can use to buy food in mall, buy souvenir or for using gondola. they give 2 ticket ferry from macau to hongkong city. very interesting offer.",50
"We were here just 5 days after the new year and the Hotel is amazing especally the casino!!!! Enjoyed the Gondola Rides, Gambled for the first time  and lost money, Chinese Food as usual was excellent!!!!!",40
"We stayed at the Venetian for 1 night, and it wasnt enough to fully enjoy all the hotel/Casino had to offer. Theres an indoor shopping mall on the 3rd floor with over 300 shops, an artificial skyline, and an indoor canal(with gondolas and everything). The Casino is reeeeaally big, I lost 800MOP there*sigh*, and it was my first trip to a casino, so I really enjoyed it. BUT, despite all this, the mall and the hotel is missing one thing I really feel like it should have: A convenience store.. Doesnt have to be big, just somewhere you can buy vegetables and some fruit maybe. My mom was sick during our stay there, and I wanted to get her some bananas and bread, but after scouring the hotel for 2 hours, we came up empthy. I know the hotel dont NEED a convenience store, but I feel like…",40
"There are many shops, but most are high end. This hotel is just way too large so you don't get that personilised service. Smoking is permitted in the casino area with only a small section that was no smoking. The machines were not in English. Breakfast was plentiful, but too many people.The pool area was great and has an adult only pool.  Wifi is at a cost. Due to smoking being allowed, I would not return to this casino hotel. ",40
"Huge room with very nice facilities, after staying in hong kng budget guest houses, this was a excellent change.  The pool was a great way to escape the humid days while we were staying there.  I didnt think much of the casino however (not much of a gambler) as i felt like it lacked some vibe of some other casinos ive been in.  If you get there before the allocated check in time, they won't check you in early but they will take your luggage.   Reccomend taking a taxi or bus to explore other parts of Maceo while your are there (such as the old city and some of the fishing villiages - as Macao has more to offer)",40
"The venetian macao is one of the biggest hotels I've been to. The place is huge and the shopping mall inside it is more than enough to occupy you in one day. I booked a royal suite here and the room was very big. I was very happy with the room, it was clean and comfortable. They even gave you two sets of travel adaptors so that you can charge your electronic devices which doesn't match the country's plug outlet. The pillows were very soft and nice to sleep on. My only gripe was the wifi service, there is no free wifi service for this hotel. You are asked to pay 160MOP to use the wifi for 24 hours. I expect that a hotel this huge would be able to give me complementary wifi service to its customers who are already staying at the hotel. The hotel is a bit far from the sights as…",40
"The Venetian is the best in Macau, especially for families.  I have stayed in several other hotels in Macau but they can't compare with Venetian in terms of convenient access to many shops, the bustling casino (better than a near empty one like some others) , and cheaper dining options at the food court within the shopping arcade.  Now the rooms itself is also spacious, decorated in European luxury and the Belle Suite that we stayed in had two queen size beds which was great for our group of 4 where we usually have to book two rooms in other hotels!   No need for that here at Venetian.  Room service was good too.  Their pool areas consist of several medium sized pools and can get  crowded very easily in the peak times.  Its not convenient to do lap swimming and the kids can get…",40
"This hotel is one of the best I've stayed at :) it is definitely huge so you'll need a map..and the room we stayed at a Belle Suite, was spacious with 2 Queen beds..very comfortable,service was a nit slow when I requested for some sugar and milk but alright,plus they compensated on giving us much more tea/coffee and bottles of water.The swimming pool was simple but big ,they had 4. Check in and out was pretty smooth as well and we had an amazing view of the Cotai Strip.",50
"This hotel has 3500 suites (no regular room here).... It'll be a bit tiring to just get in your room... Inside your room you'll find it vedy"" spacious... Huge bathroom... 2 LCD tv sets... Overall an enjoyable stay but there's no *home* feeling to it... The shopping arcade on the 3rd floor is also spacious, get a bit lost there, although the information staff's really helpfull. Need improvement for the security guys (men guiding the lift, casino,etc they wear yellow color suit) because mostly they don't understand english... Want to go back there to explore more if I could... *^▁^**^▁^*",40
"A must visit place in Macau...... the experience coupons they give with the bookings are pretty kool, you gotto experience Manchester clubs game experience which is must to visit for any football fan.... i couldnt come out of it...... Only problem is people dont talk English and very few understand it.... nobody could explain the casino games to us... we tried learning by putting money...... but no use.... It has got everything you expect from any property... amazinng swimming pool ! Ample options of food .. if you like italian 3 Monkeys is a good option. Shuttles for local transport are easily available.... place is very expensive otherwise.",50
"Nice hotel overall good experiance . Booke by our travel agent AMATRATRAVEL & LEISURE PVT LTD . All services were upto the mark and transfers were before time  . WE DIDNT HAD ANY PROBLEM . Keep up the good work .I find it as a complete hotel. The rooms are suites, big bed with a sofa beda, 2 big televisions. Big bathroom is partitioned into separate bath tub, shower enclosure, dresser and toilet. Many restaurants from fine dining to food court, shops and of course the big casino.",50
"Thumbs up for the service and comfortable which all travellers can ask for! Had booked a Royal suite room via Agoda and was offered a free upgrade to a Bella suite. The staffs (including cleaners) working in the hotel were expectionally friendly and attended to all requests promptly. All in all, it was really more than a pleasant stay and will definitely return again if I travel to Macau.   Simply impressed :)  P.S: Can't comment on breakfast / Spa as we did not try that.",50
"Hotel is a bit expensive, but a must one time visit . Stayed for 2 days and enjoyed. At level 3 shopping and dinning are available . I lost my address twice in level3. Anyhow it got everything and u no need to go out. ",50
"I'm wondering what hasn’t been shared about the Venetian that I can add... In a nutshell, it is a legend and a MUST-visit on your trip to Macau.  My piece of advice would be - stay here if you are here for the Casino. If you are also interested in seeing the city, experiencing Old Macau and eating lots of egg tarts - I'd recommend the Grand Lisboa. It has a good casino, and is walking distance from the Ruins of St. Pauls, and Margaret's Cafe e Nata is right behind!  We stayed at The Venetian for 2 nights - and WHAT a fabulous hotel! The rooms are all suites (and bigger suites!), in a place BIG enough to be a city!  It's a slice of Venice - both inside and outside. It is very popular with tourists - VERY big and VERY crowded. I enjoyed my luxurious stay here, loved my…",40

Many restaurants from fine dining to food court, shops and of course the big casino. There  are always activities like performers in many areas of the hotel.And the gondola ride just like in the canals of Venice. They have free shuttles either airport or ferry terminal, other hotel/casinos or the border.There's even have an 18 hole mini golf. My only complain is the long walk from one end to the other including going to to rooms.",40
"This was our first stop starting our honeymoon. This place is like a paradise..beauty, interiors, huge property and to top it all a huge Casino. The best place to be for gamblers..the gondola ride is amazing, so romantic...had a lovely experience staying here...just loved it!!",50
"The hotel is completely surreal and you really cant call it a hotel. it has absolutely everything. Gorgeous, spacious rooms. Multiple swimming pools. The largest shopping space you can imagine - i was here for 5 days and i managed to get lost EVERY day :) The food court is awesome in terms of the way its set up - artificial sky and street recreated - really great atmosphere.  They have LOADS of food outlets and there is always always something to do in the hotel even though in Macau itself there isnt much!  Multiple restaurants where they serve Breakfast in the morning - so a food heaven for someone like me!  Note that I dont talk about the casino at all - ok, it is the largest Casino space I have ever seen (never been to Vegas) and its a great atmosphere but im not a gambler…",50

this is one of the man made wonders of the 21st century its a landmark more than a hotel...........the hotel is huge it has got 4 malls gandola rides and so many things the only disadvantage is the hotel is situated at macau penensula which is a 20 min drive to go to macau and if you are a penny gambler this hotel is not for you as its too expensive to gamble here..i was in this hotel for 4 days and i could see only a 30% of the hotel datz how massive the hotel is... i have heard that 15% of macau population works in this hotel.........,50
"Very nice room, huge Royale suit, much too big in actual fact. Make me feel lost!! But then one is in Macau for other reasons and not just just admiring the room decor and having a bath every hour! Yes, the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was very nice. The carpet was spotless and there were even two television sets in the room. However, I could not sleep well, even in one of the best hotel I have stayed in Macau or in my travels! The humming noise from the air-conditioning vent was too noisy to ignore. Maybe I got a bad room??  The other thing is simply, the Venetian is too big!! One can get lost easily in the maze.  On the plus side, checking in was very efficient, once you locate the check in reception in the huge maze. Check out was very good too and the management…",50
"We stayed in a huge suite room with all trappings of luxury. Enjoyed our stayed tremendously. The heated swimming pool and spa were worth mentioning. The  shopping mall is a tourist attraction in itself. The show by Circue du Soleil is also another huge attraction. There are many F&B outlets to choose from. And of course, it wouldn't be complete without a visit to the casino, even if one doesn't gamble. Everything is expensive here in Cotal Strip. The resort a mirage, a replica of Venice, similar to it's sister property in Las Vegas. We managed made a short day tour of old Macau, on the other side of the island. All in all, a nice holiday experience. ",50

Stay for 1 night.. Book bella room but get free upgrade to verona.. This hotel is awesome..!! The best hotel in my life.. Definitely need map to getting around the hotel.. Really huge.. The more positive point is the staff is really helpfull even some of them not speak english but they try so hard to explain to us..  Definitely will come back here next time..!!,50
"I stayed in Venetian Hotel Macau for two nights. It is a beautiful hotel, a huge hotel - you need a map to go arround. Rooms were very big and nicely decorated, view from the room was beautiful. If you visit Macau, you will need one full day atleast to go arround this hotel, it has got plenty of shops, restaurants and entertainment areas, not forgetting a big casino on the ground floor. Services were excellent. Buffet breakfast was served and you can't imagine the variety of items on the buffet menu and it was excellent. It's location is little far from town but this hotel itself is one of the tourists attraction so wherever you live you will have to visit this hotel, so why just don't reside in this hotel. If I visit again Macau, this is the only hotel I will select.",50
"He first thing one notices aout the hotel is the massive size. It took us a good 15 min of walking to go from check in to the elevator to our wing. Same deal with trying to find the pool. Took a good 25 min to find the Cirque show auditorium (not wanting to ask anyone about the exact location).    Rooms are all pseudo suites, with a separate large seating area. We had a group of 8 people in 2 normal rooms + 1 large suite. Facilities are definitely good quality. The room service was also up to spec.  There are big tour groups hitting up the hotel, so there is always a big crowd, but wht can one do. The gaming floor is massive, and very expensive to play..especially compared to Vegas...I think he cheapest blackjack table we found was over $30 a hand. And no free drinks!!!   We…",40
venetian experience starts from the the quick ferry from hong kong  the hotel is huge and spic and span. they provide you with a map at check in !!! . i thought it was the city map . you actually need it to go  around the hotel. the room was fantastic on the 23 rd floor it was almost as big as a small flat in mumbai. the huge chandeliers  in the huge hall ways and the lobby were really grand. not to forget the canal ways and the mall experience and the beautiful 'sky',50
"This is a better version of the Vegas edition. Stay in one of the suites; it is well worth the extra dollars.   The hotel's airport shuttle was quite convenient.   You never need to leave this property. There are tons of restaurants, bars, various pools.  The casino was also the best of all I visited in Macao.   Large and clean suites.   This is a massive resort, so be prepared for some walking.  The only negative was the long lines at checkout. ",50
"The Venetian is an experience which is a must do for any traveller. The beautilful suite had an even better powder or bathroom room area. The kids had a great time at the Manchester United experience. Variety of food plus the presence of the fast food chain popular with kids was helpful. The authentic lady Gondolier from Italy blew our mind away, and doing the Gondola ride is a must (she told us how she was selected in Italy for the job based on her singing quality). We went to the Casino minus the kids of course, and it was well worth it. Overall a hugh place and we did not feel the need to do tourism of the city Macau.",50
"I went to Venetian in 2006 summers!! it is the best seven star one can ever imagine!! From the most basic rooms to the high end suites, this one has it all!! Theater, shopping , eat outs , casino are all found under this one roof. The condola rides and venice feel add to the fun!! its a complete value for money!!! A MUST STAY!!",50
"While traveling to Asia on business, I had the opportunity for a night and day in Macau and stayed at the Venetian Macao Resort Hotel.  Every level of my (our) experience was highly positive.  The concierge was the brightest point of the stay as she was the most helpful to us at the time of this visit.  Our room was extremely clean, spacious, and full of well-appointed amenities.  The casino was more than I ever require as a casual gambler.  The food and drinks were as expected and quite good.  I purchased the room along with a ferry ticket from Hong Kong so I cannot fully rate the value, however I will make some comparisons next time prior.  The shopping and appearance of this hotel are stellar and one that everyone should at least experience even for a day's visit.  I have no…",50
"Wow, massive property in ASIA, good for relaxing with family and wonderful atmosphere to kill time with activities such as Golf, Tennis, in-house boating, GAMBLING at Casino's, exotic shows and courteous staff makes the hotel a great place to kill time with family and friends. I stayed three nights and the package included meals and drinks, wow, nothing could beat them. I invested 100 HKD and returned with 95 HKD, in between my kitty had 1560 HKD. Casino's are real fun.",50
"This is a delight to stay with. The Rooms are huge and give you a palatial feel and make you royal. The Washrooms are also huge in size and all amenities are avialable. Even, minutest details are taken care of. The Hotel has various facilities for offer for each and every one. Sightseeing and enetrtainment options are also never to be slipped.................. worth the price",50
"Visited Macau sometime in November 2011. We had opted for the basic suite and were thoroughly suprised by the size of the room. The decor was immpecable and gave an extremely royal feeling. There is so much to do within this property that you need not step out of the hotel even once in a day.   A variety of food joints always welcome you be it any time of the day..The gondolo ride is a must. The ""sailors"" are at their friendly best and make you feel very comfortable.  In all an extremely entertaining stay. There is definately something for all age groups in this property.",50

Has good shopping - good choice of stores to shop at.",50
"I visited Macau in May-12 with my family. I stayed in the Suites and It is just luxury. The rooms are spacious & clean. The bathroom is just awesome & you wont just come out of the bathroom. The hotel has the biggest Casino where you can enjoy the immense pleasure of gambling. The shops & restaurents inside is also good. They have Two pools - HOT & COLD water. The Bar & the Discotheque is just amazing. They have kids PLAY ZONE which is catch if you are travelling with Kids & want to spend time in the Casino.They also have a golf course on 3rd floor which is small but worth enjoying. If you are newly married, this is the best Place & the best hotel to visit.",50
"The Venetian is all you could want in a great 5 star hotel- amazing suites, great room service, tons of fun activities for people of all ages and interests inside the massive property with a dash of interesting culinary adventures waiting for you to try them out. Staying at the Venetian feels like staying in a mini-city by itself- except, it's all carpeted and air conditioned. We stayed there for only a day (we were on a family vacation to Hong Kong and Macau) so we could not even explore the entire ""West"" of this giant property. There's so much to do and so much to see inside the hotel itself that you probably would not want to spend any time outside it. As gambling is Macau's USP, be sure to find a great Casino in the Venetian. As far as the suite is concerned, the one we…",50

All in all, costly put you feel handpicked for the price.",50
"Once you enter the hotel, forget about exploring other parts of the city Macau! You will never want to step out of the hotel at all...everything is here, and everything is world class! Daytime, the dainty little shops by the canals will leave you exhausted. I was very happy to find a Victoria's Secret store!! To relax after a hard day's shopping, try the wonderful foot massage at their spa-its amazing! Night-time, there are a lot of options for everyone- for the party goers, there are a number of lounges and discs. I loved their Bellini lounge. They have live performances every night! For the gamblers, the casino is fabulous. (I won a few hundred dollars, so it will be a favorite!) Although, unlike Vegas, they do not offer free drinks unless playing high stakes, which was bit of…",50
"Excellent Hotel built on Suite Room concept. Rooms are spacious, 2 twin beds in Royale Suit can esaily accomodate 2 adults and 2 kids. Apart from Casino lot of things to do in hotel both affordable and luxury category.  Stay one night for the experience.",50
"Had an awesome experience for 3 days and two nights at suite of venetian in Macau. One of the best casinos in macau and largest one.  Total rooms of 3800. Great food, golf course, 3 swimming pools, great shopping experience within hotel and gondola experience as well giving feeling of venice",50
"its worh visiting Macau and a  must to stay at The Venetian. The service is excellent, the hotel is very nice luxurious, comfortable. it has 4 swimming pools and kids will love it. the kids zone is very nice. the food court is very child friendly. also if you can plan it during the the carnival, it is a must see",50
"Once you enter the hotel you will be overwhelmed by the crowd at the main lobby or the West Lobby. However, dont be mistaken, the rooms are fantastic for the price. True value for money, good service, great place for shopping, this hotel treats you like a king. So next time you are at Macao and have not stayed at this property, make sure u spend two nites at this place. Be sure to take the complete package including ferry ticket, shopping vouchers and meals. The only negatives about this place are: Long wait for bell boy if you are checking out between 11am to 1pm Grumpy faced security personnel Over crowded common areas",40
busy hotel. take ur own luggage to ur room. indian food at 3rd floor restraunt. mc donald strawberry shake is good. excellent pool. rooms large . wear comfotable shoes coz u r going to walk a lot,40
"this is the best ever hotel i stayed in.  all positive about it.1) huge casino with always some offers going on, if you dont understand the system to roam in casino u might get lost . 2) all the 3000 rooms of venetian are suite rooms with all the luxury amenities.3)4-5 huge swimming pools which i think u dont get time to go if u r a gambler.4)free shuttle transfers to taipa ferry, macau ferry, china border, pls check before boarding.5) shopping centre is a not to be missed experience with amazing cloud lookalike ceiling. 6)i thing it has the biggest spa in asia.7) free mineral water through the day which i think is the only hotel that offers this service. tea coffee and beer free in casino 24hrs.",50
"This hotel is a massive Macau Casino property and overall the facilities are very good and similar to Las Vegas where I have also stayed. The rooms are lovely, really enjoyable experience but as with any hotel of this size the service is not personalized. The most annoying thing about the hotel are the massive number of tour groups that invade the property on the weekend. They are hard to avoid if you decide to leave your room. The facilities and shops are great as are the number of dining options on the property. The area of Macau where the hotel is located Cotai is still under development and a little bit out of the way if you want to get out of the hotel and walk. That being said Macau is so small you can get anywhere in the city in under 20 minutes. Overall, the room…",40
"We stayed here for the weekend for my fathers 50th birthday. The hotel itself is huge and can sometimes be quite confusing. However, as for the stay, it was made extra special by the staff who surprised my father with a birthday cake in the afternoon. The hotel room was large and there is also the ability to get wifi in the room. Incredibly conveniently located in a prime area on the cotai strip. All in all a great stay which was made even better by the kindness of the staff.",50
"Staying at this hotel was like living in a fantasy land. A hotel that seems to never sleep with its never ending shops which really tests your endurance for their sheer number and variety. This hotel is a must visit place if one tours Macau. The suite was the best I have ever stayed. It is royal luxury. The room service is prompt, professional and personalised. Breakfast at Cafe Deco is really enjoyable and of high quality. The multiple freebies offered by the resort hotel made the stay doubly enjoyable. Of course everything comes with a price.",50
Once you stay at the Venetian all other hotels will appear second class to you.  The start of the experience wasnt great.  There was a 30 mins line at the reception desk and there was a sea of people waiting and wandering all over. I felt like I was at a Train station... literally..  I was upset and felt that I had wasted my money by coming here.  Boarding process was pretty smooth and even though I didnt smoke I opted for a smoking room to get a higher floor.  The hotel is huge!  It took us 10 mins to find the elevators. The Rooms are par excellence.  Its well spaced out and well maintained.  We stayed 3 nights at Macau and not even once ventured out of the hotel mentions how self sufficient this place is.  Really loved it and will be back here again!,50
"When we decided to visit Macau, we had completely made up our mind that it would be Venetian where we would be staying - based on the reviews here at TripAdvisor as well as from our friends. Undoubtedly, the hotel was huge with a lot of shops and food restaurants to roam around. But I did feel at times, that apart from the casinos, there wasnt anything much at Venetian for which the hype had been created. Yes, the hotel was nice but it wasnt so great to get such reviews from everyone. Well, thats just my opinion opposing the others. The food was quite over priced and the quality wasnt great. The service provided was exquisite and top of its class. Overall a nice experience, but spending that much of money, you can easily go for some other hotel spending the extra bucks in…",40
"Superb awe inspiring hotel. huge, infact got lost quite a few times. massive casino. but very expensive. staff dont speak much english. also be wary of the 'massage girls' in the casino. the breakfast spread is the best i have ever seen. awesome architecture, but....look closely all the frescos are digital printouts. the casino accepts all currencies. the shopping arcade with the artifical sky is awesome. shops in arcade very expensive, but look out for 'sales'. on the whole...exellent.",50
"Staying in this hotel was a great experience for me...the 1st time i stayed there was during a trip with my friends...rooms are spacious and restos we tried were all good...shopping area is within the hotel too so you don't have to leave the hotel anymore to go buy whatever you need... that was why on my next trip to macau with my parents, we stayed at the venetian again coz my parents get tired easily on long walks... they also enjoyed their stay there coz it was convenient for them to just inside the hotel for dining and shopping...",50
We are a family of four. Two girls aged 3 & 5. Booked into the famiglia suite. Highly. Recomended as the rooms have a separate kids section with bean bags bunk beds cute amenities like toothbrushes and little yellow ducks for kids. The hotel is breathtaking. 300 shops all in an air conditioned place with canals and an artificial sky with daylight. Great service and tons of stuff to do. A huge play area for kids called th Qube. A must visit.,50
"great ambience and luxury hotel but very confusing to reach a particular place ..need a touch screen gps at every corner of the floor or a map given by hotel..good xiaia show,fun ice world,fogosamba restaurent,cafe deco..gr8 place to be..",50
"One of the best experiences at Venetian. Most organized, Courteous staff, hygiene and very huge and awesome ambience. Recommend",50
"It is one of the best resorts, which has complete entertainment.Enjoyed the Gondola ride,the worlds best shopping - the Machester united shop,Ice world,The venetian theatre shows,Biggest casino,spa .The convention centre were our gastro meet was conducted also had the best of amenities.The rooms  we stayed were spacious ,clean and maintained well.It is also very near to most of the happening places in Macau.Over all had a very memorable experience",50
its was a experience of a life time staying at the venetian.this place has so much to offer.a must do is the gondola ride .the rooms are luxurious and the view fantastic.the place never sleeps and is full of life.there are lot of brands for shoppers.the food court offers lot of variety.pool is clean.try the buffet breakfst at cafe deco .you need a whole 2 days to see the entire place.,50
"The basic rooms are not really basic! We booked a room and it turned out to be a suite with 2 queen beds, separate setting area and a HUGE bathroom with tub, shower and separate toilet as well as a walk-in closet! The hotel and casino are huge and you would be doing a lot of walking and most of the time you'd have to go through the casino! I didn't know that there was a ""rule"" about taking photos in a casino :s so one of the security people was very rude with me when i was taking a pic of my friend (not really near any gambling tables) and snatched the camera from my hand and wanted to delete the pic...mind you, there wasn't any warning about taking photos or any...anyhow... The Spa was really nice, although too far away and you'd have to waste your ""relaxation"" mood as you go…",50
"I and my wife stayed at this hotel during our vacation trip to Macau in June, 2012. To say the least, it was the best part of our tour.  The unusually spacious suites are luxuriously furnished with every conceivable amenity made available for the guests to partake. The ambience, the casino, the shopping arcades, the food parks and the vast Cotai Arena give one a wow experience.   For us it was a lifetime experience, and every leisure traveler should make it a compulsory part of his or her itinerary.",50
"Staying at the Venetian is a wonderful experience for my entire family. We stayed there for a night but, boy, how we wish we could stay there for a few more days.  First, the staff had been wonderful, not to mention that most of them are kababayans.  The rooms are so big you can hold a party in it. Our children enjoyed the pool while the adults enjoyed the mall.  And we simply love watching the House of Dancing Waters (COD), just across the street.  We got adjoining suites and it's ideal for families traveling together.  We will surely come back...",50
"I was not disappointed with the size of the rooms in the Venetian. Our suite was big enough to accommodate 6ppl. The hotel features a shopping mall and food court which is very convenient. You really don't need to leave the hotel to experience Macau, everything is there. Since we were travelling with a small child, we took advantage of the family oriented activities - ice world and zaia. Both were great and would be worth it to book the Venetian again even just for this. The only gripe I have is that since the Venetian is also the biggest casino in Macau, people are smoking everywhere...and I mean everywhere! Even if we got a no smoking room the smell still stuck to our clothes and our things. Not good for small children or babies who are vey sensitive.  Would probably go back…",40
"Stayed here 3days 2nyts suite, when i cheked in no bellboy to get luggage and show you the room. If you have request the staff are slow poor service.  Good -  big room n nice decor although the toilet has no bidet.   available Free shuttle to tour around the city.  Bad - smoke smell of rooms n lobby.  Expensive food n things to buy.  ",40
"I stayed with my family at the Venitian for 2 night 3 day stay,this hotel itself is a world inside,breathtaking ,the interiors makes u dumb,high quality place, which has everything inside,no need to go outside,best in the world,unbelievable beauty,one should see to believe the VENITIAN",50
Enjoy very much. Great entertainment for all member in the family. Food available all kind. Shopping brand and no brand no need to travel any other place. Very big room and nice bathroom.,50
"The Venetian Hotel is Beautiful. We got there in there in the evening so no one else was in line to check in. The clerk talked good English and we had no trouble checking in. We was probably in our room within half an hour. I didn't see any Bellboys and we took our luggage to the room ourselves. Which I thought was odd for such a classy Hotel. But probably all you had to do was ask if you neede a bellboy. Our room was Beautiful. We had 2 Queen Size  Beds, 2 TV's, a couch, and a table with 4 chairs. We had a Fridge but no Microwave. The Hotel has so many shops and eating places that you could stay here for a week and not go anywhere else in Macau.. It has 4 swimming pools, Mini Golf, Kids Zone, And of course the Gondola Ride and Casinos.",50
"2 reception locations for check in so can be tricky , huge to wander around again with paranoid security guys all over the place. they hate my shades and keep insisting i do not have it even though it was on my forehead !!! nice rooms like vegas but way bigger as a hotel, no expect any baggage help just like vegas n find your way to your room",50
"I stayed at Venetian Macau for 6 nights (and at Hard Rock Hotel Macau for 5 nights, maybe you should check my other review). The hotel is very good, but the others in Taipa region are great too, so you should pay attention at theirs differences.  If you are going to the casino or to shopping walks, you’ll like Venetian very much. They have the best mall, with artificial canals, gondolas rides (with amazing singers), artificial skies, etc. In the same complex there is the Four Seasons Shoppes, with more luxurious brands, and in front there is the Cotai Hotel Mall, with dancing water fountains and the whole shebang.  If you are looking for the spa & beauty relaxation or treatment in Macau, you definitely should stay at the Venetian, since they have the Malo Clinic spa, with is…",40
"Stayed at the Venetian as my friend had a promo rate for us during mid June. Check in was a hassle as we could barely find where the counter was with such a big place. Interestingly, we found out through the days that the check in and out counter can suddenly open or close at different spots of the hotel.   Had a fabulous room which was big in size but was extremely disgusted by what seemed to be menstral blood stains on the floor in the toilet.   Overall a comfortable sleep though but I guess that despite the promo rate, it's still overpriced and for the same rate or just by topping up a little, you can get a more value for money hotel.",40
"After a smooth pickup by the complimentary ferry port bus, we were driven directly to the main entrance check in.  The lobby was a mad house...once we struggled our way across to the desk, check in was quick, but a little funny.  The staff had been trained well in the up-sell.  The reception staff were quick to tell us our room was their smallest and for a mere $80 Australian per night, we could upgrade to one 3 times the size...we declined and to our amusement, once we reached the room, it was larger than any hotel room we had ever seen.  The hotel complex was great for the shopper or gambler...not much else, although the shopping malls were pretty amazing.  As the hotel casino was so large, there was not much of a personal touch to the service, probably the biggest downfall. …",40
"when we first arrived at the venetian, we weren't expecting much because frankly, the lobby is a madhouse. people from all walks of life seem to be coming in and there are no chairs -- we had to guard our luggage whilst checking in at the same time.  it was a long wait and we had to wait for someone to show us to our room also.  when we were shown to our room, however, our exhaustion faded. quite simply, it is one of the best hotel rooms i've been in.  linen and bathroom also of great quality, view was wonderful as well.   we spent a lot of time inside venetian also because everything is already here!  very near the rooms are shops both for fashion and food.  the hotel also offers gondola rides.  i think the only drawback for the hotel is the sheer amount of people going in and…",50
hi!  i opted to stay here because of the infinite things i had heard about this place. The things that man can do is simply unbelievable. The shopping arcade is surely a delight and the collection of brands there would surely give any mall a run for its money. the rooms are huge and comfortable. the thought to detailing is very nice. every thing here is larger than life but a few things that could make the experience better is like having more checkin/checkout counters... it took us a fair bit of time to check in and then to check out. it is surely to do with the sheer number of people staying there.  i would say the place is a must go but as for the stay it would not be a bad idea to stay at a slightly smaller place and go for an upgrade.,50
"Best hotel I've ever stayed in. You can almost spend all your time in the building as it has everything you need: Casino, shopping, bars, club, golf course, restaurants and live entertainment. The only thing you really must see outside of the hotel is the 'House of Dancing Water' show at the City of Dreams Hotel just across the street. The shopping area on the 3rd floor has canals and gondolas and everything is styled to look like Venice.  There are free shuttle buses to and from the airport, ferry terminals and Gongbei border gate. The room was massive with 2 TVs, minibar fridge, desk, table, bath, separate shower and 2 sinks. Bathroom was bigger than some hotel rooms in Hong Kong! No free WiFi in the room and breakfast was not included (although these are both available if you…",50
"The best rooms, but a pity that we hardly spent a few hours in it given our agenda, we went casino hopping day and night for the 2 days we spent there.. Hardrock cafe was the usual favorite with a live band, good food and dance.. The sprit of entertainment eats into you at Macau, just felt transformed into a different world. I had my kiddo with me who spent most of his time at the play area in Venetian and refused to leave even at closing time :).. We were a group of 3 boys and me and had a whale of a time.. If you're not a serious gambler, go with good company and let your hair down.. ",40
"We visited Macau after visiting Guangzhou, via Zhuhai.  There are complimentary buses awaiting just outside the custom from Zhuhai.  It is really hassle-free to get to the resort.  I was expecting a long queue at the check-in (and check-out) counter considering the hotel has 3000 rooms but it was a breeze.  My family booked 2 ""standard"" suites.  The rooms have unblock views and is huge.  It has a separate living/dining area and huge bathroom.  My 3 teenage children each has a queen-size bed and the suite still has much space to spare.  As in any casino hotel, the main ground floor is occupied by the casino.  But quite separated from the casino, on the 3rd floor, there is a huge shopping and dining area, complete with canals, gondola rides and Venetian design shops. So, if you…",50
"This was my 3rd time in Macau and it keeps growing every time I come.  During my 2nd visit, the construction of the Venetian had stopped due to the poor economy.  Now that I am staying here is seems like they finished the hotel rooms with 2nd rate furniture, appliances, and bathroom fixtures.  The rooms were very large with 2 double beds and a fold out sofa bed which was a nice change coming from the small twin double beds in Hong Kong hotel.  However, the armoire had an old tube TV and the doors didn't slide in, so we had to watch out not to run into the cabinet doors.  Then the sitting area also had an old TV and there was only one remote control in the room to be used on both TVs!  Having stayed at the Venetian in Las Vegas, my parents were not impressed.  The best thing was…",40
"Venetian Macau Resort Hotel is a very elegant hotel in Macau, there is a huge hotel with more than thousands rooms. Each room is as smallest as at least 800 square feet, a very comfortable bed, huge lounge and a big bath room.  The shopping mall downstairs is huge, you never know when is day or night with nice prainted ceiling. Man-made river across the shopping mall, you are easy to be lost in the mall. Casino is huge and elegant, you can spend days and nights in one roof hotel, shopping mall, casino and restaurants.  Hotel is too big that you have to be sure where you are, South Wing or North Wing but you still have to walk a long corridor to your room. It may take you fews minutes to ten minutes. Swimming pool is nice but you have to walk a long way from your room and back. …",40
"I only spent one night in Macau, but what a night! The Venetian was amazing, it was very similar to the Venetian in Las Vegas as others have already pointed out. It was massive, I loved exploring the casino through to the shops through to the canals and the gondalas. The painted European landscape by the canals were so beautiful and very life like, it was midnight but felt like the middle of the day.  The room itself was so large, I think all the rooms are suites. We only had a standard room but it was so well appointed, I thought we must have been upgraded as a suprise. Our room had 2 double beds and in the seperate lounge/TV area was a fold out sofa bed. You could have easily had 6 people stay in the room.  The bathroom was very beautiful, very modern, large and very clean.…",50
"The Hotel is bigger than you thought. Brilliant architecture, and the fact that the hotel is so huge, the directional signages makes it easy to navigate your way around. Shopping was nice and cheap. Gandola ride is fun. Splurge all the money you can at the casino! Rooms are tastefully done and are big as well. We were there to celebrate our first anniversary, and the hotel did make it special for us!   We had some trouble with the vegetarian food options at the hotel's food-court. However, the breakfast spread was scrumptious, and to our surprise, even Indian food featured on the list. Stayed for two nights, and were still unable to explore the hotel in totality. If in Macau, Ventian should be your first choice.",50
"The whole complex is exactly a picture of Venice as most people say..the magnificent architecture from the outside is as magnificent as the inside..the ceilings, the pillars and the flooring are so grandeur! And what amazes me most is it seems like there's no evening inside the venetian because of these magnificent faux sky that makes you feel like it's always daytime.   We also tried the gondola rides, which I think, is a little bit costly nonetheless, great for first time tourists and photo ops at the same time. And we found an array of food establishments on the food court (with massive people that we found it hard to find a vacant table, unfortunately) and we were glad that it cost is just fair enough to have a sumptuous meal after the long walks inside the resort.  I was…",50
"This is practically a replica of The Venetian in Las Vegas though about twice the size. It's located away from most of the casinos in Macau but it provides a bus service to them and the old town.  The rooms are all suites and the 'standard' suit was very well appointed and a great size comprising an open plan lounge/dining area and bedroom. The amenities are great and of decent quality and the room provides small bottles of water free of charge. WiFi is also available in the rooms for a charge.  Service was friendly and functional (and most staff spoke very reasonable English). The hotel is very busy and I'd have hoped for more food concessions and larger check-in/check-out areas.  As with the Vegas hotel, there's a large shopping centre that's designed to look like a range of…",40

Whatever it is, be prepared for your senses to be overwhelm, from the sights and sounds of this huge (somewhat confusing?) complex/resort.  It is literally swarming with people and the cacophony of sounds and voices (China nationals tend to talk VERY loudly, no offence intended, and multiplied this thousands of times and you get the picture.) can be very jarring.  The room is beautiful, but the towels and bathrooms like some reviewers mentioned is already long past its shelf lives and ought to be replaced.  The pillows are too soft for my liking and they don't provide adequate support.  The shopping is plentiful but they don't come cheap.  The…",40

This hotel is really huge! one good thing about it is that there is a electronic map locator every 500 yards. but the thing is, it keeps on pointing the long way.  Smoking is not allowed anywhere except on limited areas on the casino floor. Shopping is one thing that you can do inside the hotel, there are a lot of brand name stores and duty free shopping stores inside the hotel. but they're not 24 hrs, so nothing to do at 3am, except play in the casino. The room was nice and clean, but a bit worn, but i didnt expect it to be brand new, so my expectation of the room was not that high. Food choices are limited to asian cuisine. Try the local food, like the portuguese baked chicken, it's really tasty. Most of the Hotel Staff…",40

I stayed in this giant in September 2011, the second time at this amazing place and my third time in Macau! There is nothing more brilliant than being in this hotel! The rooms are fit for a king and the surrounding views of mainland China to the left and the South China Sea to right bring you back to the reality that this is not a desert resort! The size of the complex is monstrous and you could be confident in not having to leave for 24 hours. The absolute musts are: giant panda house (10 mins by cab); the gondola ride, the old town over the bridge and Cafe Deco which is inhouse. Will definitely sty here again for my next trip!!",50
"It was not the Venetian I had imagined of.  It was more like the Chinese version of Venice, with Chinese people :)  everywhere and it was quite noisy.  The rooms are nice but not soundproof, we can hear people talking and walking in the hallway all night long. But it was a great place to stay with all the dining options and great shopping.  Next time we will surely stay in Wynn or MGM for it's proximity to the city.",40
"One word to represent this hotel is one stop entertainment. This place is a fusion of luxury casino, a cool place to hang out, a variety of souvenir shops, branded goods stores, venezian style gondola, and also the sky who's always resembling the afternoon. Unfortunately very difficult to find halal food here.",40
"My wife's company sponsored a 1 night 2 day stay at this place for all its employees, and it was a real good experience. Check-in & check-out were both very smooth, this was nice. Once checked in we went into the venetian shopping area, and it really looked like different world out there. The structures were designed in venetian style, nice artificial stream, the artificial clouds were also very nice. We also took the gondola ride, its just 10-15 mins & costs 118MOP per person, but it was good. Room was fantastic, a very nice suite, with nice bed & reading room although our view was not great. One thing is you need to walk a lot around this place, even if you just need to go to your room from check-in.   Its good place to spend a weekend i would think. For entertainment, the…",40

We came via ferry from HK and via free shuttle bus we reached the hotel.and we got the Bella Suite and boy was it grand, there were 7 of us the roomcame with huge twin beds, a big living and dining area and huge toilet taht screams luxury. With a great view of a lake and other luxury hotel. The place has a very good ambience, like the indoors made you feel you're in outdoors with blue skies and the atmosphere feels like you're in a European country. The outdoors as well were very nice and good for photo opportunities. The malls, food courts that offerred variety of cuisines, the gondola rides, the children's play room although its quite a long walk. The free shuttle buses form the hotel to other hotels is very convenient and there's…",40
"We used the free shuttle from the ferry which was quick and painless. Arriving at the hotel at nearly midnight the check in staff were fantastic showing photos of the Bella Suite that we had pre booked. We did ask for a bigger suite and we were told that they were on lower floors with work being carried out on the floors below. Getting to our room was a bit of a mission with quite a distance to walk, this was a bit daunting but managed to find it in the end. Once on our floor we had another long walk to our room. The room was great with three of us staying in it, beds were comfortable. All in all the hotel was all that you should expect from a hotel like this the only drawback is the distance to get from place to place and that the corridors are full of people going to and from…",40

Spent the night and was blown away. Casino is huge. Hotel suite was great and staff were very helpful and friendly,50
"Yes, its huge...yes, its quite luxurious, and good value for money, but the rooms are beginning to look a little dated and aged. With the 3 new alternative options next door at the newly opened Sands Cotai Central, the Venetian could do with an upgrade, but to be honest, who wouldn't want to stay in such an iconic building?  The rooms (all suites) are huge, very comfortable and well appointed. The bathrooms are worth the daily rate alone, but the outdoor views can be somewhat disappointing. The overall experience is worth it.   Best restaurant in the resort is North, not to be missed!",40
"Venetian hotel is huge, atleast till now I have never come across such a large hotel. Perhaps Las Vegas would be having such huge places. The place is abuzz with activity much like an ants nest, streams of people coming in and checking out.  We got very good promotional offer through tigerairways (which partners with travelocity), which suited the budget. The rooms where awesome and huge. They have permanent extra bed to take care of large family on vacation.   It has large casino floor, but be warned that the gambling system is different, or it could be that last time i visited a casino was 5 yrs ago in USA and things have changed. We lost money trying to figure out how to play and eventually lost interest and we sauntered off to equally large mall area. The 3 floors of mall…",50
"Just like The Venetian in Vegas, but MORE!  So big.  Exhausting to get around.  But nice.  Definitely eat in the food court - you will be pleasantly surprised!  They should put dehumidifiers in the rooms.  Everything was damp all the time.  Not very pleasant for a desert dweller such as myself.  But overall I would recommend this hotel.",40
"This experience was awesome!!! the hotel is 'huge'....and the rooms are so luxurious.......we came on a group tour to hong-kong, shenzhen and macau. We had an awesome time and enjoyed alot! This place is so cool.....with stores of all the brands for shopping.We could get a really good view for our window and the bathrooms were really nice.  I would really like to visit macau and stay at venetian again!!! <3",40
"Venetian Hotel and Casino is super large. A lot of fun. If you hate people smoking, then you will get frustrated as the Chinese smoke often in the elevators. I have first hand knowledge as I spend a lot of time in China.   Anyway, I love my huge room. Very romantic is what I find, if I could bring my wife.... Pointless being by yourself. Guess the only downfall if I can find one, is the shower doesn't have a handheld and the water is mixed with a lot of air to save water, so feel the shower is a bit fake, but you get used to it. The airconditioning is a bit loud, but I shut it off at night anyway.   I love when they warn the guess about NO Smoking in the room and the note is in the ashtray! Internet charges are super high, can't stand that.   Stay here, the shopping is amazing.",50
"Excellent place to stay and shop all best brands of the world. Excellent service and very warm hospitality of the staff. I was their in April 2012 for 4 days. I would again like to vist Macau and stay at Venetian. The room that they gave us was awesome, I think I could have the best view from their. It's a place where every one should go for a holiday with their families.",50
"Even the standard rooms are fantastic. 2 double beds. Has a nice smell to the room. Great decor. Bathroom is huge. Very Venetian but modern too. Service can be quicker eg asking for an extra duvet. Good value for money. The hotel of course is HUGE with a mile of shops and casino.  Not suitable for honeymooners or young couples. It's very heavily packed with mainlanders, very! The casino should not allow young prostitutes either but there are literally thousands of them everywhere. It is hard for the hotel to control this situation but they really disturb the guests. They hang around the casino tables, start conversations, and some wait by the north and south wing by the elevators.   The luxurious suites on the 30 something floor are magnificent. Probably the best I have seen in…",40
"I was in Macau three days for business. I must emphasize that, this hotel is luxury and great, large room, comfortable bed and a spacious bathroom. The only thing I didn't like was the lack of free wifi, Very inconvenient because I have to check email for work every day. The staff (who were mostly Filipinos) were very friendly and tried their best to make my stay comfortable. Swimming pools are great, but I do not have time to enjoy. The check-in was no problem, check-out was slow as there were too many people in the lines, I had to wait for a couple minutes.",50
"We found this hotel to be very comfortable but very BIG and very busy.  Check in took a considerable about of time due to the large number of people arriving.  Staff were friendly, but we felt like we were being rushed to check in. The Royal Suite was very nice and spacious - the bed and pillows were comfortable.  Not a great view from the room, however, we were not in the room very much. The hotel is very well located if you like to be amongst it all! the shopping mall in the hotel is very good with a terrific variety of shops with reasonally good prices. The casino was very nice - but if you don't like cigarette smoke, it is not very pleasent! the bus transport available is really convenient but allow some time to get around as the place is super busy so expect to wait in line…",40
"*****I am myself   from a  Hill  Resort -Mussoorie   (Uttrakhand)  India   and   connected  to  the   hospitality  industry. I  visited  Venetian Macau   recently . Right   from  the  booking  through  the   net   to   my   check-out ,  the    management   of  the  resort   was  immaculate   &  flawless . Considering  the   size  of  the  property ,it  is   difficult  to imagine   how  metriculously  each  and  every   detail  has  been  taken  care  of.

"Hotel room is extremely spacious, staffs are friendly and helpful enough and a big shopping mall within the compound sum up the rating i had given here. But of course there are some shortcoming as well.  It becoming an attraction whereby truckloads of tourists visiting venetian. It get pretty crowded and doesn't make me feel like a hotel anymore. I visited during offpeak season and hence not that bad so i can't imagine if you staying during the peak season.   I had walk to the opposite galaxy hotel and city of dreams. Both looking great as well and i may try out next time.   But if you haven't stay at Venetian Macao before, do try it out as it is still a great choice.",40
"We stay on January 2012 for business trip. The place amazingly huge for me with 2 lobby separated area.  The lobby that checked in us was crowded and the receptionist staff was a bit rude. Perhaps it was local habit or something. There is no information guiding us how to get to the rooms and the signage was too confusing. We lost somehow on the way to find the elevator. Try to ask the security staff unfortunately none of them speaking in English.  It was so clean and tidy at all area. The room that I stay also so nice and homy. Every corner designed nicely. We able to see the function room as well as Cotai.  The mall area designed perfectly, love that place.",40
"what a place.  left me breathless.  visted during Dec 09 for a business conference and was in awe.  These folks sure know how to pamper.  Stayed in a Royal Suite as i remember.  it was big with a large bed and a separate living area.  Large bath with a separate WC section.  Stocks of wonderful choice of teas and coffees and the quality of the toiletries were excellent too.  as regards the rest of the resort well better check the website ... since theres too much to write about.  connected to casino, luxury malls @ the grande canal shoppe, food court and lots a activities around the place incl the circu do sol.  connect to the other hiend hotels incl the four seasons etc. huge crowds (esp at check in) but excellent service (got a vip check in which incl a separate room, welcome…",50
"We stayed in April 2012, in a Famiglia Suite (same size as the Royale or Bella Suite, but with a kids zone in the sunken area rather than a lounge).  While the room was the same size, and while as just me and the two kids we could all have been easily accommodated in a Royale Suite,  we found the upgrade to Famiglia Suite to be very worthwhile.  As I had older kids the features such as step stool in bathroom and safety edges and plugs were not a benefit, they loved the decor of the kids zone (bright decor, aquatic motif on one wall, lovely floor rug and beanbags), the bunk beds (double on the bottom, single on the top) from which they could watch the City of Dreams lights at night, and the kids table, rug and beanbags to lounge on, cute light fitting, and wii (not that we used…",50
"This is a casino hotel and it's huge not only in the public space, but also the suite. It's great value for money for what you get, the space! I estimate the size of the suite is around 80 square meters. ",50
We went as a family for 3 nights.  Upgraded our room to the Rialto suite and it was worth  the extra expense! Huge space w 2T 1B. Very very clean room. The hotel is HUGE! Food court had great choices and there were also lovely choices for more upscale meals. Shopping in the hotel was so-so... The free shuttles to almost everywhere was very convenient as taxis here are not that cheap and most of the taxi drivers don't speak any English. Some of the decor was a bit gaudy and tacky.. But just think of it as a Disney hotel without the Disney characters.,40
"My family checked into The Venetian during Golden Week and arrived in a midst of chaos. The lineup to check-in was long (would have been a 30min wait) and it was only much persuasion that we could check-in ahead of the queue as we had a hungry 6-month old baby to feed.   The rooms are spacious and comfortable, and the couch folds out into an extra bed. A baby cot was provided along with a bottle sterilizer which was much appreciated. The drapery over the bed needed a good wash as it smelt old and musty, anyone with allergies could have a problem sleeping with the smell.   As the hotel is massive with over 3000 rooms, personal service is not expected and if you're looking to store your luggage prior to departure, be sure to call a minimum of 30min prior as the bell boys are…",40
"Stayed in May 2011.. the best place. But can get lost. Its huge.. the rooms are huge with bedroom plus living room. Like a suite.   Casino is just at the lobby. So many exits. 5mins from airport. So many shuttle bus to the mainland. Went to visit the st peter n Paul church.. so many shopping in 1 location. Gondola ride was amazing. The guy sang us songs.. so romantic. Food court restaurants.. everything..  A place to be. When you are there, all you can say is ""wow""",50
"The rooms are plush and grand. The batroom is huge and has great detailing. Almost all rooms in Venetian are similar so there is very little to complain - may be the view differs. The hotel staff provided me with an early check-in ....which is rare as they are exremely strict about this. Just because my travel agent gave me in writing that my check-in time is 12:00, the Hotel staff honoured it and let me in skiping a long line at the check-in counter which was to open only @ 3:00. There is so much to do in the hotel...shopping, gondola ride, casino etc... I forgot an important file in the Hotel while checking out and they ensured that I receive all that through a courier within 3 days in Singapore (my next destination). Overall a great experience.",40
Once you get your bearings the hotel is very nice. The suites are excellent and very spacious. The swimming pools are a nice quiet oasis away from the crowds in the shops & casino area. Check out was rather chaotic!,40
Here is a video of how a normal suite will look like: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-fqnRXIbK0  The only bad things I have to say about Venetian is that people smoke alot in the casino.  The prices in the mall are high but then again it´s never cheap to buy brand name items.  It´s a great place to visit while in either in Hong Kong or Macau.  Beware... Cirque De Soleil does not operate in the hotel anymore.,50
"Upon arrival to Macau Ferry Terminal , take the very frequent free shuttle bus (5-10mins) to Venetian Macau , check in is so efficient at East Lobby, good map and directions given , family and I reached our room .

"This hotel is huge - and fantastic. Its basically like the one in Las Vegas except on an even bigger scale - which is hard to believe. So many places to eat and drink. As usual with casinos, excellent value.",50
"This hotel was magnificent! I have been to the one in Las Vegas and I have to say this one is just as fantastic! It is massive and one could get very lost in it!  The Canal Shops on the third floor has the gondola rentals along with a singing Pole man! All the stores you would expect to find in Las Vegas, can be found there in Macau too!  The outside of the front of the hotel would make you think you were actually in Venice! they did an excellent job in recreating the front of the building to match the old style of Venice.  The casino was all a ""buzz"" It was rather smoky so was not really a fan! But did manage to find the Starbuck's and was very happy to sit in there to relax! they do take Hong Kong $$ if you do not have Macau $$.   I did not stay in the hotel, only was there…",50
"Huge bedrooms Top class hotel It s like a city... Huge!!!!!!! And then, you have venetian casino and shopping just downstairs",50
"Staying at The Venetian was the highlight of my family's recent trip to Macau. This has been on my wishlist for quite some time now and our stay was made possible via a special web offer that gave us a discounted rate. For just a little more than $200, we were able to get a Bella Suite on the south wing with two queen beds, a living room, an office table, two TVs (one old and one LED TV), as well as a spacious bathroom. The only thing missing was a kitchen! The suite was all of 70 sq.m. and I did like th royal-looking decor, especially the canopied bed which made my daughters feel like a princess.  One you stay in the Venetian, there's really no need to go out since it has everything. We tried one of their four swimming pools, the kids' play zone called Qube, and strolled the…",40
"Beautiful hotel and lovely room, big size.  Lacking a bit of customer service probably due to large number of people just walking around the hotel.  Shame they don't have free wifi as all other hotels in Macau provide free wifi!  Buffet breakfast was lovely and delicious too.",50
"First thing that comes to your mind when you enter the place is, Huge! Its divided into several blocks/Wings and is designed in such a way where you always get that royal or an intimidating feeling.Everything is Quite good . The whole resort is very neat and well kept inspite of not being very young. Food,Entertainment,Casino,Transportation etc... everything is taken very good care of. In all a perfect destination for a 2 day holiday.",40
This was one of many stops we visited on our 4 week Asia tour. We took the cotai boat from HKG (about an hour ride) and stayed at the Venetian Macau for 2 nights. The Bella suite was large enough for the 4 of us. The decor was very elegant and the marble bathroom was so roomy. The hotel is connected to the Palazzo and The Four Seasons. There are tons of shopping to keep the non-gamblers entertained. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is planning to visit Macau. I'm looking forward to returning to the Venetian Macau in the future.,50
"The decor in this place is incredible, it is an attraction in itself.  Accessed by free shuttle from the ferry terminal (and from some of the other casinos) this hotel is decorated to look like Venice, complete with canal (and gondola rides with singing gondoliers) and a ceiling painted to look like a realistic sky.  Every possible designer shop imaginable is here, along with a huge casino floor, plenty of restaurants and a dedicated cirque du soleil theatre.  Worth looking at even if you don't decide to stay there.  It is enormous but very well signposted and the staff are incredibly helpful and friendly.  If you've had your fill of Chinese food check out the American themed sports bar, where you can get fries, onion rings and football on the big screen.",40
"thanks to trip advisor, decided to stay in this hotel, it is a beautiful hotel with wonderful staff. loved this place and will surely visit again.",50
"It will take you half an hour just to get from one side of the hotel to the other side. Now that's huge!  It's easy to get lost in this hotel. Have a map with you on your first day. The suites are amazing, colors are great. The bathroom is big! Overall, it's amazing - the architecture, the casino (which has what, 10 corners?!) the rooms, the golf course, the pool, and the resident Cirque de Soleil show!   The size is amazing at first but it gets really overwhelming especially if you're in a hurry to go somewhere. The casino is in the middle and you can't see the corners if you stand there (it blocks the whole view) so it's confusing how to get to the other side.   The men and women in yellow (security, i think) are ignorant in English so don't ask them for directions. Instead,…",40
"Stayed in the Bella Suite, which was one of the biggest hotel rooms I have stayed in. We were picked up by the shuttle bus from Macau Ferry Terminal and check-in was very quick and efficient. The hotel is huge so listen carefully when they direct you to your room - make sure you get a map. Our room smelt of smoke which we were not impressed with but as we were travelling with another family did not want to complain in case we ended up in the other tower instead of next door to each other as it was the busy Easter weekend.  Other than the smell the room was great, any questions we needed answered were just a call away with the priority button on the phone. Kids used QUBE kids zone a couple of times and thouroughly enjoyed it. The putting golf course was something else, bunkers,…",50
"Stayed at the Bella Suite. The room was huge. The beds were big enough to sleep 2 adults + 1 9yo child. There were 4 adults + 1 child and the 2 queen beds were more than sufficient that it was not necessary to have the sleeper sofa setup for us. The staff (who were mostly Filipinos) were very friendly and tried their best to make our stay comfortable. When they saw that there were 4 adults staying in the room, they left out a bag of extra toiletries, towels and robes at the door (since the room only had provisions for 2 pax).  The room was so big that if you were sitting in the living room and needed to use the washroom, you will actually think twice before doing so as it was a bit of a walk to get there.   We managed to get a promo at the Venetian that included lunch at Bambu.…",40
"It was as I expected it to be.   For USD 300, I did expect some luxury and over-the-top aesthetics and amenities. It offers a taste of luxurious living minus the exclusivity. While you enjoy the the hotel's five-star facilities and outlets, the throngs of visitors (day tours) bring down the opulence of the place. The crowded hallways, tour groups and endless picture taking gives you a feeling that you're at the senado square and not inside a luxury hotel.   But then again, I signed up for a US 300-dollar-per-night suite. So why should I expect more?",40
"Perfect. Only complain was very shallow pools. Make sure you pay in local currency. They rip you off on the dynamic currency conversion. Eg, charge your card in your home currency.",50
"As we had been to Macau before, this time we just wanted to experience the casino and shopping side of things. The Venetian was recommended to us so we booked a Royale Suite on Agoda. From the moment we arrived to our departure, the staff were always helpful and made sure everything ran smoothly. The shuttle buses to/from the airport/ferry terminal are very convenient. Our room was very spacious, just huge! We ordered breakfast to our room which was quite nice, the juice even had it's own little ice bath! And the coffee was hot which doesn't always happen at other hotels. We spent our time at the casino there and walking around the shops which took up all our time! It was worth staying there once for the experience but I personally prefer a more modern style decor so will be…",40
"Stayed in Venetian Macau for 2 Nights in February 2012. Hotel rooms were huge, comfortable and very clean. It had all the amenities you'll need and 2 large TVs. Room service offered a great menu and food was delivered to your room quickly. Wifi is available but at an extra cost.  The Venetian offered every convenience possible. Its free shuttles to several destinations like the airport, ferry terminal, downtown Macau and other places helped us get around easily and safely without the need to bargain with taxis (usual in Macau) to take us around. It is also attached to one big mall with Venetian Canals that has everything you would want to shop for.",50
"This hotel has a veneer of luxury but when you are only offered 2 sachets of coffee in your room for 24-hours, it becomes apparent that the luxury is a facade with little else on the side. The Bella suite was large and the mock-Venetian architecture is amazing - exactly like Vegas and is the only reason I would stay there. The property is massive and impersonal and you feel like a passsenger on a conveyer belt with a number stamped on you, passing through Disneyland. It was actually better to stay at a smaller hotel opposite and look back at the Venetian. We booked 2 non-smoking suites and one was smoky with a guest obviously smoking in an adjacent room. This is always a turn-off for me and would make me very reluctant to return.",40
"The room was really nice and cozy but what surprised us were the swimming pools. Most of the visitors simply went to the casino and shopping mall and so the swimming pools were not crowded at all. There several pools in this hotel, fitting different guests' need, got both kids pool and adult pools, also a warm Jacuzzi mermaid pool, which we liked most.",40
"So after reading all the negatives I was really concerned about staying here (partly because I am SO DEMANDING and extremely FUSSY and pedantic).. However this is my experience:  * Arrive at the airport... Plenty of signage for FREE venetian shuttle buses to take us to the Hotel. It was there waiting for us and service was amazing. * Check-in was FAST and easy * Room was a treat. It was HUGE. It was not dated. It was classy. It had everything I could need and more... Bed was very comfortable. * On the phone there is a button that says 'priority' or something like that... When you press it - the person on the other side can answer ANYTHING.... where, when, how, directions, food, doctor, massage, transport... literally they knew everything... Every time I had a question... that…",50
"From the Taipa ferry terminal, we rode the free shuttle going to the hotel and every time we go to other hotels, we just go to the hotel's bus terminal and rides are free. Check-in is a breeze and even the check-out. Rooms are big and luxurious really fit for a king though it still smelled of smoke even if its non-smoking room. Hotel is huge and we had a hard time walking from the lobby to our room because we had a kid with us and we cannot pass through the casinos which i think is a shortcut to the hotel suites. Try the pools on the fifth or third level just after the qube the views are great. The gondoliers have good singing voices you'll think there is an orchestra.BTW there is an orchestra on the St mark square(?) near the victoria secret shop. For shoppers, its heaven but…",50
"The Venetian is a great place to go and visit, but I found it disappointing as a hotel.  The service was NOT of 5-star hotels in the States.  Slow and the rooms were very expensive!",40
"I stayed here awhile back.Was so overwhelmed by the amount of golden color :) Check in was fast, given a map which I took for granted, something that I'd regret later on..almost got lost in the hotel..LOL..Stayed at the Bella suite with its twin-queen sized bed, both of supreme quality. Loved everything about it, even the amount of money I lost there due to relentless shopping and a little round of the slot machine *grin*. But hey, with the amount of opulence thrown at me...who would mind? :D Love the foodcourt it the massive array of worldwide cuisine, and they also got many restaurant scattered around the resort. Hope to return there someday.",50

Plenty of room for 3 or more. There's a separate sitting room are and we had a great view over City of Dreams, the airport and beyond to the sea.  The team from Guest Relations made this a fabulous weekend my parents and I enjoyed.  I stay in Hotels a lot with work around Asia, and with the Venetian being such a large super size hotel I wasn't expecting such personalized wonderful service.

I have no hesitation recommending the Venetian for a…",50
"The Venetian really is over-the-top impressive.  This was my second stay (first was about 3 years ago).  Last visit, this area was under construction and the Venetian was the only hotel open.  This time, several other Cotai Strip hotels, shops & casinos were open (Hard Rock, Holiday Inn, Sheraton), and it looks like quite a few more are still being built.  As others have said, this is primarily a place for gambling (if you don't mind cigarette smoke) and shopping (mostly high-end).  I'm not a gambler, smoker, or high-end shopper, but there are other Macao attractions, plus excellent swimming pools & good food (outside the casino) to make for a decent 2-3 day visit.    Rooms are showing some signs of age - bit of mold in the shower, dated look overall, but generally clean.  Late…",40
"As you already know, this place is HUGE! There are countless shops, countless gaming tables, many restaurants (although the food was only decent at Canton) and close to other casinos too.  Service was lacking. Obviously because of the size of the hotel it is hard to give personal service so it didn't bother me too much as I wasn't expecting fantastic service.  The rooms are massive. Easily the biggest room I've stayed in. Although to me it felt almost like they were large just for the sake of being large (not sure if that makes sense). I was in the Rialto suite. The room is decorated baeautifully although not as luxurious as it could be. Bed was a little too firm for my liking but decent. The only small complaint for me was that the towels in the bathroom seemed quite old and…",40
"what an awesome stay!! beautiful resort and magnificant city. So much to do, see, visit, explore..huhhh..had been to Venetian Macau in Nov, visiting macau and not staying in venetian is a crime. we stayed there for 3 days and trust me these 3 days were not enough to explore the whole resort properly. It has a huge casino inside and u can surly try ur luck on any f the games.gondola ride was once in a lifetime experience.There were many options of restaurants,coffee shops and bars inside the resort where u can choose to redeem ur voucher for drinks,snacks,breakfast,lunch and dinner. The resort also provided free shuttle services to many of the happening destinations in Macau.  so many things to write..but in short a must visit place when in Macau.. don't miss!!",50
"This itself is an attraction for many. Hotel can be crowded at the lobby, but once inside the room its a different world. The rooms or suites are huge and is nicely done. There are plenty of things to do within the hotel itself, including an excellent play area for the kids.overall, an excellent property but would rate the galaxy next door to be better.",40
"None of the vegas atmosphere but jaw droppingly spectactular.  It is enormous in the extreme.  The gambling hall is a sight in itself.  Bellinis has a live band and decent cocktails.  The rooms are split level and large.  The pool area is good but not as impressive as you get in Vegas.  Would totally recommend catching a cab to Fernando's for lunch.  No reservations, plastic tables, terrible service but just great authentic portuguese cooking.",40
"The Venetian Resort Hotel is ridiculously splendor, with its massive floor plan, the canal running through the arcade under the fake blue sky, it's as good as u get for a short getaway particularly in rainy days. It'd be nice if they provide patrons with golf carts or those tired-legs might end up sitting at the casino winning or losing some serious bucks. For people who love Chinese yumcha I recommend Glorious Seafood Restaurant (shop 3037) for their dumplings in spicy sauce is the best ever of sort I've ever had. I didn't bag that sauce out of embarrassment though. Transport is good and frequent. But honestly, something doesn't seem right. A 1400 square feet suite with no bathtubs? That's quite shocking to me. The suite surely is big enough u can invite the whole dance group…",40
"Venetian is a great family get away. Nice and big rooms with comfortable beds. Nice view of the city of dreams from our room. Pools provided relaxation although getting to the pool was quite a mission as one has to walk a long way and go in & out of elevators. Free Shuttle service provided convenience but one has to go to city of dreams to get direct free shuttle ride to senado. For a casino hotel, I found the food to be a little pricey. ",50

The hotel is a destination so u can expect lots of crowds, check in was easy considering that we arrived late. how ever i saw long queues on the next day when i was loitering in the reception. the rooms are so huge with nice beds. we had a view of their mini golf course and 3 new hotels behind venetian. there are lots of choices for food & we had our breakfast in CafeDeko which serves multi cuisines and i was happy to see some choices of Indian food.

"It is a good start to be taken from the Ferry Terminal to the hotel by the free Venetian bus shuttle service. Our check-in was smooth with easy to navigate directions to our room, although, our room was such a long way from the lifts which became such a trudge. Ask for a room closer to the lifts. My husband was attending a conference at the hotel and many of the attendees did complain of taking more than 45 minutes to find their room, maybe poor instruction at check-in? The hotel is magnificent and our room was beautifully furnished. It was enjoyable to have a spacious room to relax in.

Check-In / Out experience wasn't that great because the hotel seemed to have FULL occupancy so that's understandable.",50
"I can't understand why people complain about the size of this hotel - it's 10,000 rooms after all - what do they expect?! Ok, it takes a while to walk through the casino to the suites but it is well signposted. Had a huge Rialto Suite on the 29th floor - separate large lounge and bedroom and a massive bathroom. All very clean and well appointed with toiletries, coffee machine etc. Didn't eat any meals in the hotel so can't comment on those (we went over to the City Of Dreams for the evening) but called in the Starbucks for coffee and a cake which was up to the usual Starbucks standard. Very good location for the hydrofoil from Kowloon and enough tables and slots to keep you amused for hours. Good service from friendly staff. Would definitely stay here again next time we're in…",40
"We recently stayed in the Venetian, being repeat visitors to this hotel.  Overall, we remain very pleased with the location, room quality and general facilities.  However, we also remain concerned about the wavering quality of the restaurants at the Venetian and continually increasing crowd sizes, making it less enjoyable at the Venetian at times.    As for the rooms, we recently stayed in the 34th floor Royale Suite, found very little wear and tear in the room – finding it clean, functional, semi-luxurious, like each of our past stays in Royale Suites. We just love the large space, sofa and extra television and the bathroom is just great.   What we also like about the Venetian is the Grand Canal Shoppes, the fantastic pool and Italian villa area and the free shuttle service…",40
"Main message: We've just had a 2 night break away from our home in Hong Kong and, for what we wanted, The Venetian was great. A big suite (great deal in the recent sale) with separate space and TV for our son, wonderful heated pool area and a choice of eating options. We simply wanted to relax in a little luxury and The Venetian delivered.  Worth considerng: If you want a home away from home with a personal touch, this place is not for you. While the staff are always pleased to help you really don't see many of them (apart from the many security guards in bright yellow blazers). If effortless transition between reception, room and amenities are important to you the, again, this place isn't for you. Check-in is a meat market of 'theme-park' type queues followed by a long walk and…",40
Recently visited Macau and stayed at the Venetian Hotel Macau. I must say I really enjoyed my stay and the service was exceptional. The standard room was one of the best standards rooms I have ever stayed in. The room had that royal appeal and the bed was one of the most comfortable. I have visited the Venetian in Las Vegas and though the architecture was slightly better the Venetian Macau had that awe and greatness about it. Highly recommended.,50
"This was our 2nd trip to the Macau and the Venetian and wanted a chilled out fun.  We flew straight to Macau this time previously we landed in Hong Kong and took the ferry.  There was a Venetian bus waiting at the airport and within 5 mins we were there.  We landed at about 9.30am way too early to check in so we bag dropped and hit the casino and shops for a while.    We were able to check in at 1pm which we were really pleased about as we had been up since 3am.  When we got to the room the keycards wouldn't work, luckily there was a supervisor who had noticed we were having problems (its a long walk back to reception) and sorted it out for us, she let us into the room and within 10 minutes our new keycards were delivered.  The room was breathtaking as before and we looked into…",50
"People, this is where it's at. Very romantic, great atmosphere and decor, excellent service, room was fantastic! I will go back for sure.",50
"The biggest hotel I ever visited.Same stile like Venetian Las Vegas , but if I need to compare Venetian Las Vegas and Venetian Macau, Las Vegas is much more beautiful. Rooms are very well shaped , large and comfortable, same for bathrooms.Shopping esp.after passing to FourSeasonsMall is perfect.Reception staff are well -trained and hospital. I generally liked the hotel.Two things that I didnt like in this hotel are : dining choices are not much  and spa services are very poor and not professional.",50
"Booked 1 night at the Venetian with a special limited deal for a Bella Suite. The room was big enough to fit all four of us comfortably. Service was great, the rooms were clean and in good condition.  I requested to stay in the south tower which is close to the qube (a children's indoor playground) and the swimming pools. The heated swimming pool was great and perfect for my 2 year old son to play in. My only complaint is the walking distance between everything was too far.",40
My Business Trip to Venetian Macao Resort Hotel was a feel of Heaven on Earth from my  busy life. The view of Chinese Sea from my room was like my soul @ peace. Cherrished the moment in life makes me travel Macao again to same Resort on my next Business Trip... Chao,50
"Its the first time that my family and I choose to go Macau for holidays as it has always seem like there is nothing for kids and those that do not gamble. But out of surprise, its a place for all. Especially The Venetian Macao Resort Hotel (one should never miss out). Once you step into the hotel, you can see that the hotel lobby is all plated with gold and the casino looks grand too. Shopping inside the hotel is a great pleasure and there is also a kids' world for children. Do visit this hotel when you are in Macau.",50
"With the free and efficient shuttle bus service at the border gate and ferry points, you would reach the hotel within 15 minutes. Although the check-in queue was long, it was made up with friendly and accommodating services at the counter. Staying in Venetian is really a all-in-one resort hotel. You can shop, find the famous Da Li Lai porkchop bun store there, play a round of mini golf and try your luck in the huge casino. With so many things to do, staying one night is not really enough, so book for at least 2 nights!",40
"This is by far the most beautiful hotel and city i have ever visited. Very nicely done hotel and casino. one should stay in anyone of the venetian in lifetime. The only thing where they can improve is to handle the crowd, i repeat crowd and not guests. people come in large groups to stay in this hotel and there is not much staff in the hotel to handle the rush.",50
"What can I say? The hotel was really grand. The rooms were huge and nicely decorated. Conveniently close to the mall where you can get canal rides and watch the Cirque du Soleil. Since it was such a big place, didn't really get much interaction with staff but I can see why its a premier hotel in Macau.",50
"Stayed for 2 nights in March 2012 in the wonderful & huge Rialto Suites. Loved to be back to Venetian once again though we missed out on the Cirque du Soleil. Venetian is a wonderful but also a very huge place both good and bad. Just be prepared to walk around a lot.  Venetian also has many famous Macau food. Be sure to visit Lord Stow's Bakery for the Portuguese Egg Tarts(MUST VISIT), Tai Lei Loi Kei for the iconic Pork Chop Bun & Koi Kei Pastelaria while you're there.  I would like to take the opportunity to thank Ms. Joyce Peng & Nana from the Reservations in making great effort in communicating with me on certain changes that  the Cirque du Soleil not being available. Greatly appreciate being informed much earlier.  Would like to thank Linda Dong of the Guest Relations Team…",50
I dont think that is possible to stay in better and bigger room for such a price anywhere in the world. The whole hotel is breathtaking. I wish I can go there again soon.,50
"Huge room and do enjoy the inroom dining, since food prices are the same rate as the food court.",40
"Very,very,spacious,comfy room, excellent service,elegant establishment in overall conclusion of our stay there! Even a great value compared to similar rated hotels in the neighbouring country, a promise of revisit next time!",50
"I didn't expect much, seeing as last time I stayed in a horrible hotel, but this was brilliant! Me, my husband, and my two kids, Kaylie and LeAnn stayed in the Famiglia Suite. There were video game controllers and a kids play area, which my children adored. The gondola rides were amazing, like a piece of Italy was planted there. The Venetian is quite close to the City of Dreams, where we watched the House of Dancing Water. Oh, and I forgot, they have a kids club...",50
"We have just speak 5 luxury days at the Venetian.  It is like being on a cruise ship - you really don't need to leave the building.  The whole place is a work of art from the ceiling to the carpets.  The rooms are beautifully presented, clean and comfortable. It is easy to get lost so take your map with you plus there is lots of assistance from the staff.  The entertainment that simply pops up at different times in different places are a credit to the performers who are so talented.  You  must have a condala ride, play a round of mini golf, enjoy the pool area and try as many different foods as you can.  Don't worry about putting on weight....you will walk it off!!  Highly recommend.",50
"went over in october 2011,with 5 mates on a gambling trip.the pick up from the ferry was quick,and we arrived at reception and as we were going to the races within the hour the receptionist got everything organised,and our bags were in our rooms for us waiting.The reasturants were all first class,and the gambling tables were easy to get on to.The rooms were great,and i look forward to going back there in 2 years time.",40
"Stayed here in Nov.2011. It's just a top hotel. Big rooms, 42inch TFT and a large bathroom. The room has 2 sections. The lower end has a small living room and another one has the comfortable beds. Everything is clean. Just before the lifts u have a guard that checks the entrance. 2nd floor has a shopping mall and the venetian gondol boat. The buffet and restaurants r very good. 5 star all the way.",50
"I think the best way to describe this hotel would be to call it a destination. Yes, it is a destination in itself and travellers should stay at least for 2 nights (if not more) to fully enjoy this Grand Hotel. Everything about this hotel is Grand and first rate. Even if you don't go there for the casinos, still there is plenty to see and enjoy at this Hotel. A must for the Globe-trotter.",50
"We last visited Macau 7 years ago.  Since that time, a number of new hotels have been built, all with in-house casinos.  Venetian is one of them - it's huge!  Rooms are very well furnished - ours had a separate living space with the king size bed on split level.  The bathroom is enormous - and luxuriously appointed.  The complex houses 160+ shops of well known brands and the casino has a large variety of pokie machines.  Payout seems miserly though, perhaps it was not my lucky day.  I didn't like the lack of non-smoking areas.  Food court has most of the Asian favourites and we are happy with the quality of food served.  We thought the main lobby  a little garish, the Italian theme definitely overdone.  City of Dreams is worth visiting and is within  walking distance.  Don't…",40
Good hotel to stay if you are in Macau. Room is very big and the casino is very good. Value for money.,40
"beautiful, pleasant stay and spacious family accomadation well presented",50
"There is nothing to complain about this wonderful resort. The resort hotel provides a free shuttle bus to the ferry terminal and to other resorts.  The check-in was very smooth and took about just 10 mins and the room was mind-blowing. It was very big and had all the amenities that you would need (TV, Fridge, Coffee Maker,printer, Fax). A huge bathroom and etc..etc. In short, we fell inlove with our room. We would definitely go back to Venetian and highly recommend it.",50
"Stayed here for business last week. I have stayed at the Vegas one many times, and was surprised that this one was about 3 or 4 times larger. The casino alone was massive, the largest casino floor in the world.  The suite was perfect, and the service was most excellent.  They have free shuttles to and from the ferry terminals, which made it very easy to swing over to Hong Kong or the airport.  Do be prepared to do some serious walking here, and in peak times during the day, it is very crowded with scads of tourists who are not staying at the hotel.",50
This is luxurious hotel. The staff the area the ROOM sorry SUITE is unbelievable will stay there again our suite over looked the golf course which is on the 7th floor the golf course that is 4 pools every thing you could think off.,50
"Amazing hotel with a huge shopping area, food court and casino. The Reception is friendly and if u gamble enough, u get your room for free.",50
"It was a once in a lifetime kind of stay given the price, but it was very worth it. It is the type of accommodation wherein you wouldn't want to be out of your room all the time as the room itself was THE destination. Service was unpeckable but since it is HUGE hotel, you kinda feel that a personal touch is missing.  But I guess that was just okay because they pretty much give you all the luxury you need.  I would of course stay here again if price is not the issue...Otherwise, I'd be happy staying in a much lesser but decent hotel given that it is MACAU and lots of happening is taking place outside your hotel room. Nevertheless, the stay was worth it for the experience.",50
"Amazing. Stayed in a suite on the 34th floor. Excellent service, arrived at the VIP arrivals. Nothing too much hassle. Obviously the hotel is built around the casino ( which is huge). 330 shopping stores, Starbucks, nice restaurants, it really was quite an experience. Great base to go and see everything else also.  Rooms are modern and huge. split level, huge marble bathroom and separate WC.  Overall, a stunning experience and Macau is a must do. Im not a big gambler but was still nice to try my hand at a few card tables and the like but just even people watching and the bustle of the place was an experience in itself.  Would go back.",50
"We spent a night in standard room here and it was actually a suite, about 700 sq feet and extremely well done.  The entire hotel is way over the top but an unbelievable testimony to what  gambling will bring to Macau.  Lots of very rich mainland Chinese gamblers (minimum bet about $40 US).  The hotel is beautifully done with striking styling reminiscent of Venice (duh), compete with canals and gondoliers. Lots of shops and places to eat.  We went to the Dancing Waters show across the street and it was great.",50
"Well after reading some previous reviews I was with a bit of trepidation that I entered the hotel. Most of the reviews pointed out that the hotel was very smokey, I must say the only area that was smokey was the casino area and that wasn't too bad.  The room was large and well appointed, I was looking forward to the view but when we awoke in the morning we couldn't see a thing because of the fog.  The shopping area was fantastic with all the shops you would need (Try Lord Stowes for their delicious egg tarts).  The staff in the hotel/casino were very helpful and always welcomed you with a smile.  Overall I was very impressed and when I return I will definitely stay their again.",40
"Venetian Macao is a nice hotel. However, please bear in mind for those who intend to have 4 occupants for adults. You have to be careful when you select the number of paxs online. They will email you Key Express so that you do not need to be on queue to check in which is good. However, they are aware of your occupants and will charge you based on your guest list. I personally faced this issue but finally settled after much argument and time.  The hotel is big and lots of shops, and it looks almost the same location from different direction. There are lines marked on the floor, so please follow that or ask for assistant. I have been spending time looking for McDonald even though I saw it somewhere but finally went to a big round to the same destination.  The foodcourt is fairly…",50
"Went to Macau for the first time 4 years ago and stayed at the Venetian. The rooms are huge and luxurious, I felt like royalty the whole time we were there. We would always order room service for breakfast, and it eat leisurely by our big window. We didn't have a problem with checking in or out, and any requests for housekeeping was promptly seen to.   Shopping at the Venetian is tops for a shopaholic like me. I've been to Macau three times already, and I always manage to find great bargains every time I shop here. We also enjoy dancing and drinks at the Bellini lounge. I'm going to Macau again later this year, and will be staying at the Venetian again.",50
"We had a huge suite (husband and wife only) and it was furnsihed beautifully.  The beds are soft (an uncommon attribute in most Asian hotels), and the bathroom huge.  While I usually bring my own toiletries, the amenities here are first rate.  Bath salts and a loofa are nice touches.  Neither of us gamble, nor are we big shoppers, so not much to do in the complex.  But we did see a few local shows, and the location of this hotel is lovely.  I would stay there again if celebrating a special occasion.",40
"Very impressive hotel it's huge and you can get lost the few moment locating your room. we stayed at Bella It's very spacious with 2 queen bed. The toilet is very huge. You have a stand shower, bath tub and another room for WC.  Funny housekeeping I had coffee and quarter full and went sightseeing early morning upon returning late night saw the quarter full coffee neatly arranged at the coffee table.  don't know what to make out of it !  ",40
"Huge rooms, huge bathrooms, surrounded by alots of shops, food courts, restaurants and entertainments. Good for couples and family.",50
"Good hotel, uncanny the rooms are the same as in Vegas, service pretty good, pity I didn't win a million...   Not a great deal to do in this town unless you want to gamble non stop. We played golf at Caesar's - great course and facilities. ",40
"Stayed only one night with my wife as part of a stopover in Macau during a trip to hong kong.   I would say that the place is quite stunning, especially the size of it.  Contrary to other reviewers, we didn't find that it was that easy to get lost however. But better take the hotel map with you !  Rooms are very large (but that's a suite only hotel) and overall we had a nice experience.  The casino area is very nice but it depends on your budget ! We could only afford slot machine as the gambling table had too high minimum bets for us.   Location is not that great if you want to go to the historical Macau (must do!) but not farther than 20mins in taxi anyway.",50
"it was a wonderful experience staying venetian  macau, beautiful rooms excellent interor ,world class ,excellent shopping and entertinement area",50
"The rooms are really big and royal. The bed and the linen, bathroom, bath accessories and the mini bar are at their best. No words to say .. same standard hotel will cost in Hong Kong a minimum 10 K $ where as they charged only 1899 HK $ including 500 $ shopping voucher free. ( plus 4 drinks copoun, 2 free photograph, complimentry breakfast). It's really luxurious.. you feel royal... if you ever go to macau must stay in Venetian..anyhow you have to go to visit Venetian..",50
we enjoyed so much and the hotel is awesome. we were all excited and what a casino it was and each and every moment became cherished it was a very nice moment for all of us. i advise others ought to  go if not gone and what an experience it was,50
"Time and time again I am impressed by the Venetian in Macau.  On my latest visit, I was very pleased to see that the high-standard of service did not change and that the hotel was still well-maintained and full of people.  The mall was not as crowded as before, but perhaps that was because there were even more shops open now and also you have another flood of high-end stores in the adjacent Four Seasons shopping area.  As for the rooms - they were extremely well appointed, very comfortable and the beds were just right.  The comforters were also very cozy and fit the climate quite well.  The views from our room were nice and we were able to see Zuhai, China from our suite.  Unfortunately it was cloudy/hazy on most days so we had limited views for the most part.  Nonetheless, the…",40
This Hotel is HUGE! Rooms are all suite. Very comfortable.  Nice bathrooms! Casino is good if thats what your into. Plenty of Dining and shopping opportunities.,40
"The Venetian is definitely one of the first ones to have come up in Macau and has been on top of the list for a while. Even though the rooms/suites are very spacious and done up well, the other parts of the hotel have started to look a little dated. Maybe 5 years back, Venetian was the undisputed leader, but now with Wynn, Mandarin Oriental, Galaxy etc, this hotel has fallen back a bit. Mostly occupied by the local Chinese, not too many Europeans or Americans prefer it. Bathrooms are well made and provide all basic facilities that you would expect of a 5 star. Beds are comfortable and there are several restaurants and also a good food court with many interesting cuisines. Location is closer to the Cotai ferry terminal rather than for Turbojet. We had a good one night stay at the…",40
"Great property, really - you can spend pretty much your entire time in Macau in the hotel itself! We were there for three days, and spent pretty much all of two days within the hotel. Take a gondola ride - the boatman will sing beautifully for you. They'll take pictures of you and you'll break down and buy them at super-high prices because they're just so efficient and the pictures are so great! The casino is humongous - and if you're fond of gambling, you'll be on cloud 9. If you're a shopping buff, you'll be in seventh heaven. There's pretty much something for everyone there. We got to see the Zaia performance - which I think has stopped now - and it was absolutely fantastic - I hope they start it again. It's the lap of luxury, this place - but then, pretty much everything in…",40
"Stayed in Venetian last November, had a wonderful experience. This property is not hugh, it is colossal and one cannot visit the entire Hotel in one day. We arrived late night from Hong Kong and contrary to perception, our check-in was quite swift and prompt...did not see any queues or line as told by fellow passengers. The suite was slick and foxy with an amazing view and the spotless and royale washrooms took our breathe away. One can have shopping experience of world brands in the shopping area of the hotel. The food is excellent and food court has the cuisine of the world. The gambling zone is of the largest in Macau(as we were told) and gamblers can have time of their life, non-gamblers need not feel out of place as there are many live shows in the casino which keep the…",50
"Getting to the Venetian was really convenient. We rode the Turbojet to get to Macau (which cost us HKD151 / each) from HK. After an hour we reached Macau's waters. I don't know if it's just me but Macau's colder than HK. The moment we alighted the ferry, we went straight to the Immigration officers. Don't forget to fill out the Immigration forms before giving the officers your passport.  Right past the Immigration is an underpass that will lead you to the free buses going to different casinos and hotels. We took the Venetian's bus as we wanted to see the San Luca Canal, try their legendary Egg Tarts, wander around and check out stores and other sights.  Made a quick stop to buy a 30MOP hotdog sandwich right in front of Venetian's entrance. Must Try!  The moment I stepped inside…",40

"Everyone would agree that Venetian Macao is the epitome of luxury.From its exteriors, hallways, to its huge rooms, it screams grandiose and beauty. Its facade is picture-perfect: great for souvenir photos. The gastronomic complimentary breakfast c/o Fogo Samba and Cafe Deco offers wide variety of choices and great ambiance while dining. While getting lost inside is not unheard of, there are clearly-marked signs around the area so you'll be sure to get your way around. All in all, Venetian lives up to its reputation.  However, the glory of Venetian did not make me overlook some little things that are quite important to me, ergo, the con list:   1. No toilet bidet - seriously, this is important. when the toilet is in a separate area in a huge bathroom and no toilet bidet is…",40
"We stayed here for a night and loved everything about it. They have the lord stow's Portuguese shop as well as a very famous pork bun shop (their store in taipa village closed down) so no need to travel far. We enjoyed the private gondola ride and alfonso even sang us a song! Venetian Macau is a mega entertainment complex you simply do not want to miss.   On a side note, make sure to book and go see the house of dancing water performance. It was absolutely amazing and was one of the best part of our trip.",40
"Venetian Hotel Macau is the best hotel to stay in Macau, first because they have free shuttle to and from Airport, and even in Macau or Taipa Ferry, China border gate and Sands Macau! All the shuttles leave very frequently. They boast of all suite rooms, the smallest is 70sqm! Very huge rooms with living room and table for dining. There are 2 TVs in the room, a HUGE bathroom, everything is huge and spacious! Internet is chargeable at MOP160 for 24 hours, but scanner/printer is free to use in each of the rooms!

"The Venetian at Macau really took us in awe.  It’s huge and looks very extravagant.  Given the free shuttle to and from the airport, and the free shuttle to and from the ferry stations, it definitely made life easier for tourists!!!    And you need not worry, there is no waiting in long lines.  Checking-in was also a breeze, and so is checking out.  When we actually entered the room, the only word we could utter was “WOW”.  The room was really nice, elegant and so royal!!!  Our bed was so beautifully adorned with a heart-themed design arrangement.  The hotel took well the note I left when I booked on line that my husband and I are celebrating our 8th year wedding anniversary.  We also got a card wishing us a good stay together with a chocolate box full of sweets!  The bathroom…",40
"The brand says it all, but for first timers the rooms are a pleasant surprise for the rates! They are huge with graaaaand bathrooms. The shopping and food courts are good. Casino is always full of life, though i must say service at casino ( drinks, water) was nil and 'for fun' players will find the minimum bets high. I am comparing the casino to one at Sands and Galaxy hotels, which are smaller but good as you end up loosing lesser :) Galaxy seems like a new hotel, and the outer view puts Venetian outside to shame. The inside is great colorful contemporary but nothing compared to Venetian. I would try Galaxy next time though.",40
"We stayed 3 days 2 nights on Venetian's ""Shop and Pamper"" package. We originally booked a Bella Suite but at check-in were offered an upgrade to the Rialto Suite for an extra HKD600++ per night. The extra cost was well worth it, for the Rialto at 170 sq m was more than 2x Bella's size (70 sq m). It was actually the size of an apartment, with a foyer upon entrance, a marble powder room/2nd toilet, a huge living and dining area, spacious bedroom with canopied king-sized bed, dressing area and finally a marble bathroom which is bigger than a lot of hotels' bedrooms. There was also a kitchenette with a Nespresso machine and complimentary Ristretto, Livanto and Decaffeinato capsules for us to make a quick cuppa any time. There were also 2 work tables, 1 in the living room and another…",40

It seems to me Macau is trying to Out Yank the Yanks...This is a spectacular Theme hotel like Vegas only the endlessly wandering Grand Canal is on the third level considering the ground floor is two stories high.  I might be easier to arrive at the main entrance but I arrived at the west entrance and checked in easily after my Turbo Jet ridge from Hong Kong International Airport. YOU MUST PAY ATTENTION when they tell you how to get to your room or you can wander aimlessly for an hour only to end up back where you started.

Just to tell you how ridiculous it is, the bathrooms alone have THREE TVs - not a typo - 3 TVs! The living and dining room are likewise big - totally overkill if you ask me. The master bedroom even has its own massage room inside. The toilets are heated and automated - surprising though the toiletries are generic. They are the same whether you stay on the entry level room or on the paiza suites.

Even though the Hotel has over 3000 rooms, the rooms are huge, with a separate lounge area and great views. the bathrooms are more than adequate and tastefully done. However, there are a few grouses. Every morning at 7-8 am 2 ppl knock your door down in the name of security. Also, housekeeping and minibar service are very very for a place like Macau. The restaurants and bars are expensive.  Would recommend the Bellini lounge and Lotus club. The casino area is open 24 hrs and is super lively in the nights. Would recommend the hotel for a fun time with friends and bachelor parties.",40
Very nice room. Very clean and cozy. If you are traveling with kids. They have a very nice paly area for the kids to enjoy. There's a lot of shops. Endless shopping with a variety of food to choose.,50
"The hotel is very large and has the usual casino/ huge shopping malls underneath the hotel. The rooms was very large and amazing price. We stayed for 2 nights and there is plenty to do. From the casino to the bars/ numerous restuarnts and shopping. Nice bar with live music to relax. Everyshop available to cater for the other half's need to shop and there is a nice artificial canal through the hotel. If you have been to Vegas then this hotel is very similar in size and theme....  One word of caution though, we ate at the food court downstairs in the shopping mall and we both experienced food posioning which affected us for 1 week and the need for antibiotics to help clear. But uess that is not the hotel's fault.   So when i next go back to macau I will definitely return here.",50
I stayed in this hotel for one night only during my honeymoon to asia. This really is a five star hotel. All the rooms are so big and i will never forget the size of the bathroom. It was extremely clean and every facility you can think of. We got the most fantasic arrival gift from the Guest Relation Team for our honeymoon. This hotel really is a league of its own. You should never need to leave the hotel- it has everything. It is so big and so easy to get lost. It did take us about an hour to find the swimming pool. We arent big gamblers- but there is so much more to this hotel then just the casino.,50
"We spent one night here, but had spent a few days wandering around prior to our stay.  The room was amazing, service impeccable even though the hotel catered for a huge amount of guests.  We had breakfast in the room and the attention to detail with how they set up the table, complete with tablecloth and a vase of flowers was appreciated.  Although we had a no smoking room, I suspect it had been a smoking room in the past, or the whole place just permeates the perpetual smell of smoke from the casino.  Not good for my asthmatic husband.  This could change however, as smoking indoors in public is supposed to be banned as of the 1st of January.  This doesn't seem to be enforced yet, especially if you're a high roller on the casino floor. Anyway, my top tips; use the free shuttles…",40
"As previous reviewers pointed out, Venetian is impressive. The rooms are all generously-sized suites, with large bathrooms. The entire complex is so humongous that it was possible to stay inside for the entire duration of your stay in Macau - more than sufficient dining, shopping & entertainment options. This is either a good thing or bad, depending in your inclinations.   Due to the size of the property, getting around the complex can get tiring. We stayed just one night, and the walking from room to lobby to the shops etc.. got to us on the second day. There's a lot of walking to do if you wanted to go anywhere, even within, and we did not spend our entire time inside! .  Our stay was the weekend before the Chinese New Year, which was somewhat a lull period as far as tourist…",50
"You don't need me to tell you again how grand this hotel is, it really stands up to its reputation! I am going to tell you the negative side, the hotel is always packed with people (tourist or hotel guest alike) and made the ambience lack of that luxurious feel, the hotel staff are not that courteous, and the thing that really annoyed me is the cigarette smell, it is built in such a way that you must walk through the casino when going up to your suite, those smoke nearly suffocate me as I have nose allergy!",40
This hotel was placed right in the middle of the coati area. Rooms provided a quality and restful environment. Although the rooms were very far apart from the main parts of the hotel where the majority of things were happening. But it Enjoy a couple days here just taking in the wild side of Macau.,40
"I haven’t been to any other hotel in Macau but can confidently say that if its Macau, then it has to be Venetian. Venetian is indeed Grand  + Value for money + an engineering marvel. It’s a city in itself, you don’t need to go out anywhere. The rooms are much better than expected of a 5 star property. The bathrooms are massive. The show ZAIA performed within the hotel premises is nothing short of spectacular and should not be missed at any cost. The gondola ride is lovely.",50
"This casino is much like the original in Las Vegas, only bigger.  Much bigger.  A group of friends and I stayed in a Verona suite on the 7th floor and had our own outdoor patio/small yard.  The suite itself was what one would expect from a name like the Venetian, very luxurious.  The complex is near a good number of other brand new casinos, and shares a bus service with the Galaxy next door.  A truly unforgettable hotel stay.",50
"I think it's reputation is enough to give it a chance. We stayed there for two nights and it's not a question I do regret for not extending it at least for two more nights. Very big rooms with atmost luxury, two baths, two TVs, etc. and we were just in a normal delux room! Very beautiful furniture in room with great decoration, definitely you have more than you want in your room.  Staff don't pay much attention as the number of guests is so high, however 12,000 people work there! Also it's difficult for them to distinguish guests and gamblers, so may be you been asked for room card. Generally, worth to see it and pay a little high, no dubt. ",50
"Staying at the Venetian Macao is like enjoying a slice of Venice without the big price tag.   Every room in this hotel (or shall I say a mini-city) is a suite. In fact the Venetian is so big that it has over 3000 suites and the rates are surprisingly reasonable for what you get.  Checking into the hotel was a little bit of a drag, standing amongst your fellow fifty other guests with luggages for at least twenty minutes in the queue was not fun. But given the size of this property, the wait was worth it, because as soon as you leave the check-in counter with a room key in your hand, you are set for a nice journey.   Having been to Venice once before, I could not believe my eyes. The grand interior of this resort features life-like replica of well, Venice. So make sure that you…",50
"This is my 3rd trip to Macau and now finally starting to work things out. So here are a few of my observations. Be warned this complex is huge and involves a lot of walking.  Getting there : we flew into Hong Kong international airport and from the arrival gate walked to Ferry counter to Macau, You do not go thru immigration. We booked with Turbojet because they had more ferries to Macau than the other companies. having booked on-line all they needed to see was our passport and the luggage tag stickers on our planes boarding pass. they collect the bags for you and the next time you see it is in macau ferry terminal. you need at least 1 hour difference between arrival time via plane and ferry trip - i think so that they can collect your bags. do not worry if you miss the…",40
I was at the venetian in Mid Jan for a huge Bollywood Event. The Zee Cine Awards 2012 in the Cotai Arena. The venetian is a city by itself.  All the stars of bollywood from Shahrukh Khan and Farhan Akhtar to Ranbir and Shahid had a great time there.  Venetain has excellent shuttle services for conn ectivity to ferry terminals and macau city. It has great restaurants. Spacious rooms. Huge Casino and the best shopping options. Easily the best bet one has if some one has to stay in macau!,50
Stayed last March 2011 with my wife. Found the hotel very big and immediately I thought service will be impersonal but to my surprise the staff specially the concierge was very helpful. The breakfast buffet was awesome. Hotel room was very spacious and clean.,40
"Hotel is fantastic.Worth staying.Rooms are fantasticyou need two days to tour hotel itself The lunch in Bamboo. is awesome . You can enjoy gandola in hotel itself..Frequent shuttles are available from hotel to different ferry points. It has largest casino in the world. The hotel engineering is marvelous.If you are going to Macau ,must stay in this hotel otherwise donot go to Macau.",50
"Im generally quite happy with the hotel. 1st, the rooms are quite big for the price your paying... Do book early to get a good rate, 2 months advance would help. Also book directly with the hotel its better since their more flexible for requests. 2nd Service was great from the front desk to the concierge (thanks db!) luggage storage and claim was slow though but maybe is just coz of the huge number of luggages that go through them. Thats just the hotel part.... Rooms are great but not the best in terms of quality eg bathroom amenities etc. but as i said for the price. . Its a GREAT deal !!!!! GRAND ROOMS!!!!   The shopping portion was a nice place to go window shopping.. for me... And REAL shopping for my wife... Theres shoppes all over the place. I totally did not mind not…",40

coolest and nicest place which you not gonna miss if going first time and it makes your time valuable with its extraordinary design and architect so from morning to evening it looks like you havent seen the whole place. so you can go for shopping or watch live concerts and events and parties as well as enjoy the food with sky on your headsup,50
We stayed at this hotel in Dec 2011 with my family of 2A & 2C (11 &12). The whole experience was great and the room we had was a bella suite and this room was HUGE!!! The whole building is an absolute ingenuity of architectual design.  You can totally get lost in it. The food court was abundant with choices of food for a very reasonable price (if you're on a budget).  The only drawback (though not the hotels fault) is the walking the long way because we couldnt cut accross the casino due to the children.  Definitely want to come back!!!,50
"We stayed overnight at the Venetian hotel Jan 10-11.   We didn't realise that the rooms were far from the check in counter and there were heaps of check in counters. Very efficient service while we checked in.   although, I wasn't sure if the bed linen was changed since they had a note that says ""please let us know if you want us to change the bed linen due to conservation of water"" or something like that. Comfy bed though.  My only comment would be that smoking is allowed everywhere. Wasn't expecting that since in Australia we have smoking areas in casinos so other guests can have a wonderful time.   All in all it was a great experience and our hotel room was overlooking the Galaxy hotel next door.",40
"Well, since becoming 18 i always wanted to stay in a gambling enabled hotel, and thus went for the Venetian in macau!  Whoa! The suite they gave us was awesome!it was a Bella suite and wow! I was spoilt for choice between the awesome room or huge gambling area! The hotel is itself a big city, so you will feel no urge to explore the outside city ..found all types of food in the great food court!! In all, this defines awesomeness! ",50
"Gigantic and luxurious.Rooms are very spacious with beautiful decor.has huge shopping arcades,gondola rides.zaia show is a must watch.only minus point the property is so huge that u get lost in th hotel many times.",50
"The hotel is too big, we got lost 2x locating the main lobby and our room which happens to be in the south side.   The good thing is there are many shops around for you to shop and food court for eat.",40
I enjoyed my stay at this hotel.  There are lots of restaurants on the ground floor.  The hotel is huge and there are lots of things to do here.,50
"Absolutely great piece of architecure, a marvel to hang around, all day long tiirelessly, it is a place full of energy and liveliness, 24x7. Stayed with family in the bella suite, split level 2 queen size beds, the room was picture perfect and really comfortable. Ask for the galaxy hotel side view in the south suites, Truly impressed with the decor, it is elegant and beautiful, the best money can buy. The indian restaurant was awesome, so was the breakfast in cafe deco. Internet was also free @cafe. definitely recommended",50
"We stayed for 2 nights at  The Venetian , Macau and the overall experience was luxury at its best . On one hand we have the feel of Venice complete with its Gondolas one the 3rd Floor of the hotel and also entire architecture of the building from  inside looks very much Venice like . Basically this is a  huge hotel and has more than 300 shops mostly covering all the top global fashion labels and has a big Casino too . We stayed in Bella Suite which was huge ( 800sft) and has nice Cotai strip view . Bathroom was super luxe with all gold plated fittings and beautiful lighting . Suite also had a  all-in-one printer but I wonder who will go to Macau to do office work .In suite dining was surprisingly not very costly and had excellent taste too . Though most of the people opt for…",50
"We stayed at the Venetian in Nov 11,Very well organised, from the time you step off the ferry from HK to the check in. The free shuttle bus eliminates all the hassle of finding a taxi.There were Venetian girls all along the walkway directing you to the bus.The hotel rates and the price of the ferry ticket are more expensive on Friday and Sat. For a casual stay book in advance and keep away from Friday and Saturday. The food court provides good and reasonable price food, mainly Asian. We stayed 2 nights and would highly recommend a stay. The complex is huge, and there are two other hotels with its own casino in the same building. Keep away from the casino and enjoy. We took the free shuttle bus to Macau town, and find the town thriving. For those staying in Hotels in Kowloon,…",40
"Grand exterior esp if one enters from main lobby and equally splendid interiors.Room service is very good.Security issues are very prompt.Staff at pool and play zone are very organised and helping.Overall a grand festival like feel all over the hotel. Soooooooo if u r going out there to get a relaxing holiday,forget it .But then if u r going with a mood to have party holiday then surely u r going for lots of fun crowds,lights,hussle-pussle shoppings etc.Drawback to me was too much tiring walks even for going to rooms and plus point was stroll around canal area,great outdoor jacujji and pools and ofcourse very helping staff which actualy give a human touch to this surreal grand creation",40
"You will not believe your eyes once they get a glance at the interior of this hotel. The paintings on the ceiling depict angels upon clouds, majestic and regal. Judging by the name, I found it unsurprising that there was a Venetian-style channel flowing through the center of the hotel, Such a thing is to be expected. Yet the sheer difficulty of the task must have been a massive undertaking to the architects, however, surely enough the end result is a truly marvelous centerpiece. The gambling floor is truly packed with tables and slots, overseen by experienced, kind, tempered employees. The only downside it the cost, which believe me, is substantial.",40
"The hotel is huge. It has several known and unknown sections. Its grand, its beautiful, its hyped, its overcrowded but its well maintained. My dad found it more to be like some overcrowded indian railway station. But in all the rooms are very spacious. They provide utmost luxury with the super comfy beds and bathroom accessories. Also they are very kind and willing to provide you free upgrades incase your rooms not ready at the time of checkin. Free shuttles run between all popular hotels and the airport at fixed frequent times. Its just that since its so HUGE, that in times, when you have to cross just 7 rooms to your other room, on the same floor, and the same lobby, you get tired of walking. Overall, its very much worth a one time stay. Food is fantastic.Casino's better than…",40
"I cannot complain about the hotel becuase the room, (we reserved a royal suite )was really beautiful , spacious, with all the amenities you need. I can only say that the bathroom was not very clean , we found hair on the floor. I think that in a hotel like that internet should be free, for what you pay you should get it. I cannot give this hotel a 5 rating because it not quite a hotel, with a own reception, but it is a casino, with a theater, and shops, which is fantastic, but when you enter the reception is really caotic people coming and going, taking pictures, and there's no sitting area, well to reach your room they give you a map. This can be a perfect place if you just need to gamble, but it's not a conventional hotel.",40
"A city in one place.  Arrived by ferry - Hotels provide free busses to most parts of Macau. Lots of busses.  Great arrival experience. The whole place is just great. We were in what we thought was a standard room- but it was huge. Bathroom was the size of other hotel rooms. Split level with a lounge on the lower level.  Very nicely furnished.  Plenty of activities to do within the complex. Man U experience, theatre, shopping, gondola, casino. I recommend you go across and try the Bubble theatre. it was free at this time - not sure if it still is.  There are no no smoking laws in macau so expect smokers everywhere.  Getting around the complex including to and from the room requires a map - usual to cross through the casino etc.  At this stage, there was not much other development…",50
"what can I say? everything is superb... from free airport tansfer, free shuttle bus to ferry terminals and shopping malls around, super spacious room, excellent service... this casino hotel is top notch!  perhaps the only turn down is the size of the hotel, you have to walk quite a distance, across the casino, to reach your room. but once you get familiarized to the different entrances, you can find the shortest way to reach wherever you want.  staff is a little pushy to upgrade us (with additional fee) to a suite, but we refused. the room is big enough.  Oh, the shopping mall, food court and food outlets are excellent too, actually you don't have to go out from this hotel at all, it's pretty much self-sufficient. Having said that, it's still highly recommended to go out to a…",50
"Best hotel you could expect from Macau, the hotel itself is one of the largest building in the world and still keep building on  The hotel has the largest casino in the world at 1st floor shopping area and food court at 3rd floor (the shops here number more than any place in Macau) kids zone, pools, shuttle bus and lot of great facilities there  Friendly staff, the only minus point is since there are lot of guest rooms (around 2000) you cannot expect the porter to bring your luggage quickly, but overall the hotel is perfect",50
"My first stay at this property was a sheer delight. The rooms were opulent and ornate. The check in, staff and service relations were all very prompt and friendly about their work. The building is enormous, the Casino is one of Macau's best and I checked out most of them. There are dozens of shops, restaurants and the guilded halls and painted ceilings make this place grander than most museums. The gym is average and the pool area with jacuzzi and multiple pools is simply heavenly. There is so much going on here one should make a longer stay if possible. The free shuttles are a great way to explore the old and new sides of Macau as well. The Venetian is located in a rapidly developing area with new hotels and some other monstrous ones giving ample opportunities for things to do…",50
"This hotel has to be seen to be believed. It is huge with a vast selection of restaurants and gambling options. We stayed in the standard room and that was amazing. We also got the spa and pamper package which included tickets to cirque du Soleil (brilliant), ferry tickets and vouchers to spend in the hotel - this is worth it money-wise if you want to see cirque du Soleil. There is a free shuttle bus to the ferry terminal and the main town. Would recommend 100%!",50
"If you have visited the Venetian in Vegas then this will be a real buzz for you as it is identical and I mean identical the rooms could be in either hotel, but Macau property seems much larger. It is all about gambling but the rooms and the service are very good. The restaurants that I tried, North and Portafino were both first class, remember always of course that english isn't the first language of most staff so you need to be patient. There is also good entertainment and bars to keep you busy and a visit to Cirque Soliel is a great experience. Another thing is that smoking is being faxed out in Macau and that makes for a better experience.",40
"The bella suite is very comfortable with two big queen size bed. The keyexpress check-in service was very useful, fast check-in service, hotel staffs are very helpful. Nice, comfortable, pleasant hotel to stay in for a relax holiday.",40
"It has everything: casino, shopping center, theater.  Grand and luxurious though it comes at a price.  We stayed for three nights.  Huge room.  Again, convenient, nice but pricey.",40
"I like this hotel. Rooms are quite big you feel like you are a celebrity here staying in your room. The staff are courteous and can communicate well. It feels like you are in Venice, of course with the absence of people speaking in Italian and smell of the canals. Good for families, lots of shops mix of mid and high-end, nice mini golf course, excellent food shops, ambient is awesome. Downside - no supermarket or grocery, cafe deco does not serve good food.",40
"Since its opening 4 years ago, with its superlative scale and profile, the Venetian has set the standards for other casino resorts in Macau. It is squarely targeting the mass market of visitors form South China, and delivers accordingly. While doing so, it manages to maintain an impressively high standard of quality and decent service.   The common areas are always crowded - . In keeping with the Venetian theme, the decoration is overloaded and unrepentantly kitsch, with ubiquitous golden woodwork and faux baroque ceilings.   The ground floor has two grand lobbies with vast corridors, conference venues, restaurants. The Cirque du Soleil is there, as well as the Cotai Arena that caters for big event concerts. Right in the center of things lies the main casino - it is difficult to…",40
"This was, as expected, an ostentatious, luxury hotel. It is HUGE and you are bound to get lost for the first few days. The 'basic' suites are luxury itself, with large bathroom and separate WC, lounge area and enormous bed & 2 TVs, not that we watched either of them. Obviously the whole place revolves around the Casino, which, again, you can get lost in. There are several high class restaurants and also many others, although none are 'cheap'. The food court offers a selection of fast food options with a central eating area. We particularly liked McSorley's Ale House for drinks and food, don't miss their Mexican Thursday with a mouth-watering all-you-can eat buffet for £128 HKD between noon and 3pm. Also Cafe Deco is good for breakfast or mid-day meal. The canals are fun and…",50
"We returned to this hotel for a short break.  It is nice to use a new type of service called KeyExpress Service provided by the hotel well before checking-in such that we could fill in the form online and no need to queue up at counter on arrival.  However, we were asked to collect the key at Hotel Main Lobby but the shuttle bus dropped us at the West Lobby.  It took us quite a long way go to the Main lobby.  Besides, with kids, we could not walk through the casino which meaned a longer distance walk.  This KeyExpress Service would have been perfect if the arrangement be improved to allow customer to collect the key at their choice of either the Main lobby or West lobby.  Overall, I am very satisfied with this hotel and have returned and will return again!",40
"The good points- the finish is nice as nice as the Vegas original.  The rooms are big with living areas with a sofabed and large bathrooms.  Good for families who need the space.  The pools are large and resort like.  The shops are a good mix of high end and mid range other hotels have too expensive shops.  The dining choices are good both in the hotel around the casino and in the grand canal shops on level 3.  The food court is useful.  Liked the egg tarts at Lord Stow's bakery.   Across the street you can see the attractions of City of Dreams like the very worthwhile show ""House of Dancing Water"".  There is a shuttle bus to the Sands hotel so you can see the main island.   Bad points: The cigarette smoke is a problem as it is in many Macau hotels.  The casino has a smallish…",40
"We stayed at the Venetian Macau in November, and I must say simply put its a beacutiful city by itself, mindblowing rooms, all of 600 sq ft for base category rooms, brilliant amenities, brilliant space all over, outstanding eateries, superb banquet parties (we were 800 travel agents in one hotel), mindblowing food(indian as well),the casino, the management, the polite staff and inspite of being a 3000 plus rooms hotel, they had the best , most prompt room service................cheers...............no wonder Macau is incomplete without a stay at the Venetian",50
Awesome suite . Will make you treasure the stay . The lobby itself is a sight to behold !!!,50
"The room is bright and hugh. Large sitting area with comfortable sitting sofa and chairs, so that you wont want to leave the room.  Did a package deal from the local travel shop at the mall and the price was reasonable. The hotel was clean, with helpful staff. A great place to stay in the newer area of Macau. One of the best hotel rooms i ever stay at.",50
"Wow!! Venetian was really a great place to stay, speaking of luxury, its the most ever.the rooms were huge that my children had enjoyed their stay. shopping was the best, food choices at the food court area were great. though the swimming pool was quite far from the rooms, it will take a few minutes walk before you reach the pool area, but the pool area was very nice. it was such a great experience for my family... would love to come back next time!!!",50
"What can I say? Its a great hotel and was the highlight of our trip. The rooms are spacious and worth it. We took a package and hence our return trip on Cotai Jet was free + food + MOP200 worth of shopping. The price was a bit steep but I thought it was worth the while.  The only thing here, though, is the sheer amount of people and especially people from India (I agree with someone who wrote this a while back, it looks like Little India) in package tours makes the whole hotel feel very impersonal (grand, but impersonal). Hardly any personal touches that i could see here.  I think the next time I'm going, will stay at Galaxy, its amazing as well.",40
"Rooms were huge. The large marble bathrooms were nice. They have 2 TVs for the bella suites which were great. Spent some time in the grand canal shoppes, man utd experience thing wasnt open, the shop was but not the game and museum thing. They had really nice painted sky thing in the grand canal shoppes. Worth a stay.",50
The Venetain Macao is a fun filled fantasy which needs at least two whole days. The architecture and decor are beautiful.It is very well maintained with courteous staff.The rooms are large bright and comfortable.The breakfast buffet is excellent with many choices for vegetarians and the Cafe Deco had samosas which were better than most of Mumbai.It takes at least two days to enjoy all the attractions so make sure you spend at least two nights here.Walk around the whole hotel and outside as there are many beautiful sights.If you are a sweet lover at least eat some choclates from See's Candies and Godiva and Haagen Daaz icecreams. Try to stay here if possible as it is crowded during the day with tourists and by late evening things are better.There is a lot of walking to be done…,50
"Travel Review Hotel:- Venetian   Location:- Macau  Accommodation:- Excellent , well appointed rooms. we have stayed at only the Rialto suites and they are more than luxurious , with a separate sitting area and a comfortable bed. The bathrooms are excellent and opulent with a separate tub, shower cubicle and an alienated water closet area.  Staff:- Reception staff are extremely professional and busy as are all the other restaurant staff as the hotel is a countinuous meele of travellers and there is not much personal interaction with the staff envisaged. However the staff are extremely responsive to all requests that may be made.  Connectivity:- Cant really comment on this as we havent really been outside the hotel in our 3 stays there .

"This Hotel is on the Cotai Strip - a place where a lot of action takes place. Venetian has its own Casino (which is really big) - though it has Galaxy, Hard Rock Hotel, City of Dreams, Plaza and Hyatt all opposite to each other in different directions.  So - honestly - if you want to access the Casinos in either of the hotel or any other entertainment facility - go rather for a hotel which suits your choice rather than due to the fact that they house the entertainment package you want. Venetian has the Suites, we stayed in the two level, Royale Suite. So if grandeur and such all-under-one-roof suites your taste then go for Venetian. Bus Transfer from Ferry is comfortable (which seemed to me for most of the other hotels). Check In was good.  Now - one thing that you really need…",40

And for nights ,you cant miss the great casino that spread across the lobby and cant be missed from any entrance.the shows like zaia wereamazing fun. all and all it was suerb.",50
There are some many choices in Macau and most of them are competing very hard for business so I guess everyone will end up with their own reasons why they chose one over the other. We chose Venetian because we wanted to see cirque du soleil  Zaia. Since we wanted to splurge cost of the room was not so much a consideration.   There are so many reviews already about the hotel and the room so no need to repeat. I do want to give some suggestions that may help others.  When booking book direct with the hotel and look for special promotions. If you are able to book in advance more than 30 days go ahead as you will get discounts on the room.  Go see Zaia. It is a great show and not to be missed. If you stay in Venetian the show venue is right at the hotel itself.  Since this is a huge…,40
"Dear Friends,  Let me tell you one thing. This hotel is the Biggest hotel i have ever seen & you may even get lost, not kidding.... Everything about this hotel is unique.I loved this hotel, though was not able to see many parts of the hotel due to limited time (2 nights stay) & size of the hotel. There are 4 entrance lobby each with 8 elevators, hundreds of rooms, 4 Swimming pools, Golf ground and what not... It took me practically 15 mins to reach swimming pool from my room, one way. Due to the mamoth size and number of guest around in the hotel, you miss the personalised service and attention. You may feel as if you are staying in a Super mall, rather then relaxing in a five star hotel alhough cannot be consider as a negative remark.",40
Wow what was the hotel that was above my mind expectation and what a casino it has lovely amazing best in the world must travel once in life. Must Visit live show and take pictures at every corner of the hotel. Venetian is Macau and Macau is Venetian.,50
"a mini city in a hotel with everything in it from food to shopping to entertainment and the variety was soo huge from live music, dance, the casinos which were open through the night. I dont think at any point of time did we see the crowd diminishing even in the wee hours of the morning. Expensive but worth every penny spent.",50
We stayed at the Venetian overnight at the 'Royale suite' room which was huge and tastefully decorated and matched the overall theme of the hotel. We booked it as a package with the 'Zaia' show.  The hotel operates shuttle services from the Macau Ferry terminal with a frequency of 15 minutes. The shuttle services are also available to other casinos and frequency is good.  The hotel's ground floor is full of hustle bustle but the other floors are quiet. Exploring the art around the hotel is in itself a good time pass. The check in was smooth in spite of a long queue. The duty free shopping area in the hotel gives quite an option for shopping.  Morning breakfast buffet was better than other hotels in Macau like 'The Four Seasons'. Large selection of food from various cuisines. …,50
"Fantastic suite with split floors and 2 TVs. It was our Honeymoon and they gave us a heart-shaped box of chocolate pieces and the box was made of chocolate! Tasty! Everything is conveniently located within the hotel, and the Food Court has a good spread of food. Free Shuttle from the ferry terminal to the hotel. Buffet lunch at Bambu was great. Nice Venetian drink stirrers in hotel room.",50
"Our group of friends has a great time here - loved the accommodation, there is so much to see and do here - it such an attraction on its own - we only put a few dollars in the machines but watched the tables - that was fun.  We also took a day trip into Zuhai shopping - what an experience that was - loved it -also saw House of Dancing Water at City of Dreams - do not miss it -fabulous",50
"Huge-if you want to describe this hotel. Everything Right from the entrance,lobby,way to rooms,room itself everything is huge.There wasnt a thing I could say which was small.Even the bathroom was like a bedroom(room no 28054).You get a Shopping mall in the hotel itself with duty free as well.Plenty of Restaurants from all over the world.One of the biggest casinos in the world.Need a taxi to roam in the hotel as everything i so huge & far -you legs will start talking.Advise you carry your own luggage as due to huge no of rooms your luggage arrival might take time.Good nightliffe available.Went to city of dreams again a huge building with 3 hotels in it to watch the show House of Dancing Water which was again superb-one of the best shows i have seen in a very long time.OVerall…",50
"Rooms are huge, luxurious and comfortable. Love the living room area where you can chill out with family and friends. Bathroom is huge. Checking in and out was fast and easy considering the fact that the property has many rooms. Plenty of shopping and dining available at the Venetian too. Like all the other hotels, they provide free shuttle service to various points in Macau. Will definedly be back.",50
"The hotel is so low priced that you may at a time while considering it for booking, underestimate it.  But must say that the place is exceptionally good. The rooms are so spacious and good with the roman and italian interiors.  The hotel gives you a feel as if in the Renaissance period of Europe, flourishing with paintings, elegant art and blooming with shops and people.  Go for a Gondola ride for sure and don't miss the Zaia Show.  The spa is very good.  The dining service is not good as they don't serve Indian food in the room.  Besides that everything is just perfect.",50
"I stayed there for only one night last Dec 11, 2011 during the company trip. The hotel was excellent. My room was upgraded from royale suites into bella suites...So I didnt have to share bed with my roommate...yippiee :D First time I came, it was more like a mall instead of a hotel, as there are foodcourt, and lots of retail shops. There, you will feel like you are in outdoor as they have nice blue sky with the moving clouds as their ceilings. Too bad I didnt have time to try the gondola ride :(  The interior of the room was perfect. nice comfy bed with thick blanket, and also the big big bathroom which can make you want to spend hours taking bath :D Definetely wanna go back there again! hehehe...",50
I and my wife stayed in venetian with my wife from 3/12/11 to 6/12/11. Our stay was vary comfortable. This hotel itself a tourist arraction and whole day groups are coming to spent time. Zia show should not be missed. It is profitable to buy day resort pass as other benefits like free Gandola trip and one lunch/dinner is included. Rooms are well maintain and not costly. Indian food (veg) is easily avilable. Whole day shuttle is avilable free for going to city ferry terminal and that covered other parts of city.Dancing water show (not to be missed) is just across the hotel. Hotel provides express check in. Only in casino minimum stakes are on higher side. Shopping is reasonable and all brands are avilable.,50
"This is the largest hotel in Asia, no doubt about it. Hugh casino, lot""s of retail shops,  restaurants, and nice variety of food in the food court. Too bad, I didn't have time to eat there.       Check in was very quick and friendly. The bellman  insisted to assist us with our luggage, after we told him that we were in a hurry. He promptly walked us to our room, despite how busy check in was. Excellent service all around!     I had reserved a Cotai view room, which you can also see their miniature golf course.  The sleeping area had a huge, comfortable king size bed, and a plasma T.V. There is also a sitting area with a couch and another T.V. I loved the bathroom with the vanity table. It was so perfect for me! We had balloons and chocolate waiting, because I had informed…",50
My kingclub membership no. Is 60655103.  Venetion is one of aa kind it has the best ambience lovely interior. Bst service. A place that is a must see for everyone. One in a lifeyime experience only food is a problem for vegetaariaans.  Tje smell in the restraunt is too much for vegetarians. But this place is awesome I just loved the excperience,50
"Nice place, good courteous staff. Huge casinos. Shopping mall on 3rd floor with the entire look of Venice, you can even take the Gondola ride there. Nice food court, though restaurants serving Indian cuisine shuts early. Very fast check-in and check-out process and you get shuttle service to and from the Ferry Terminal. Overall a very nice experience. Plus we were on our honeymoon and were really delighted to get a heart shaped chocolate box (made of chocolates) and filled with chocolates and a perosnalized card. A very good gesture.",50
I stayed there for 2 nights with my wife...It is simply fantastic,50
"There isnt much to say about this one ! It is one of the largest hotels in the world and has the worlds largest casino The hotel is located outside the main city so transportation costs might be a little high but you never have to step out of the hotel and shuttle services are provided by the hotel to various spots. The hotel is huge with restaurants of all types of cuisines and stores of almost everything located within the hotel. The casino is huge with so many tables for almost every game. The rooms are luxurious with every amenity you will need during your royal experiences. They have recreated venice in the shopping area with the ceiling painted like the sky and  gondola rides on the stream. A great staff but not very polite. But still,its a great experience but you tend to…",40
"If you are at this hotel you need not go any where else in Macau, all in one place. say Hotel residency, Casino a huge one, Shopping Mall, Food places, All kinds of Tourist Attraction, Exhibition hall, mutli-speciality information centres and Hotel Wings East - west - North South. there are multiple attractions too say ICE world etc.",50
"well it was our visit just after the Hk trip and as we stayed at a five star property in Hk ,our expectations were very high for the macao property as well...the moment we reached the Hotel and it was wowww...huge huge and huge...we checked in went to the room and the only expression I remember was wowwww....excellent room...We got to know in the evening that star night was there the next day in the hotell audi and all the stars were staying in the same Hotel..the food court was very nice with all great ambience...We got to see so many stars as well ..The casino was the biggest attraction...Amazing Experience.....",50
"At the outset, the very entrance to the Venetian and the walk upto the suites is something that will fill you with amazement. Extremely clean (despite the hustle bustle), beautiful interiors in the building, frescoes and paintings welcome you with open arms. Proceed to your suite and gape at the sheer beauty of the room. Comfort to the hilt. Automatic keylocks to your room - even if you forget the keys inside or dont want to wake up the sleeping friends to open the door, call the concierge and help will be with you very promptly - whatever hour of the day.  Swimming pools are amazing with clear blue waters. And you can get your drinks within the pool. The casino offers a brilliant variety (slightly on the expensive side if you compare it with Hard Rock Cafe's or City of Dreams'…",50
"Beautiful suites and rooms. Had a lovely view of the harbour as well. Front desk staff however weren't as efficient, and at times were a little impatient. However the romo service staff were quick and lovely!",40
"Big hotel with 3000 rooms, keep map handy or mark your way around otheriwse you will loose your way and spend half and hour walking and searching. Lots of activity and option for all age group. Inexpensive liquor in the bar. Bellini lounge is nice. Nice rooms and professional and efficient staff they had met all my request.",40
"I've made my booking through AGODA, and made some requests since the trip was a surprise birthday present for my husband....just the same I followed it up at the hotel's website. I got an immediate response to a complimentary birthday cake, room near the elevator, nice view from the room aside from an early check-in and late check-out ! Checking-in wasn't a problem at all despite the great number of guests , after reminding the front desk clerk of the ""cake"", it was brought to the room in less than 10 minutes. The housekeeping staff followed to check if there was anything else we need and if we're ok ? The cake we had wasn't just of one-of-those-birthday cakes, it was iced with whipped cream and had fruits on layers. Room was superb, real comfortable bed and lovely bathroom.…",50
"I really like the room as it is good for a family.  However, it took me a while to queue for checking in.  The location is a bit, but the shuttle bus service is excellent as it runs verytorque rely.  Most of the staff is helpful.  Will stay here again with my family.",50
"Cotai Strip will be the Las Vegas Strip of Asia. It is still in the process of being developed and hence doesn't have a lot of stores yet. However, if you are looking for a little of everything: shopping, dining, entertainment plus a luxurious and huge room, this is the place to be.",50
I did not visit the casino as I had a child and was not allow to even walk through for a look. other than a LONG walk to the suites' elavator and a weak shower head I have no complaints at all. the food court was outstanding if you're acustomed to asian offerings in the U.S.,40
Free shuttle between hotel and ferry pier. Room was huge and nicely decorated.  Opulence decoration in the whole hotel. Good location to watch shows and shopping mall was good. Typical casino hotel clientile... interesting and somewhat disturbing.,50
cant say much other than wow thre times the size of the Venetiian in Las Vegas . I bit overwelming with the mass amout of tourists form the PRC coming by bus to gamble Actully found some quite pleseant places and enjoyed my day there .  If you like casinos this is a must see. Im not much of a casino buff but it was fun to watch the people and see the immensity of it all,40
"Very comfortable and luxorious rooms with very good and friendly housekeeping staff. The food at the restaurants is very good,and theCirque de soleil in the theatre is well worth watching. If there is negative,it is the sheer size of the hotel, so everything is a long walk from everything else. Coupled with this is the overburdened,  or short staffed bellhops,so even the hotel suggests you carry your own luggage,or be prepared for a long wait for it to be delivered.",40
the venetian   We opted for the shop and pamper package(check the website) which gave us almost 50% off in value for the 2 nites stay (after deducting for HK 400 vouchers for shop or dine/2Xcotaijet transfer to HK or HKIA/2Xfree B class ZAIA show). We arrived early  at 12 noon but were attended to by the porters who took care of our luggage and promised to send them to our rooms once the check in were done after 2pm. The Check in was fast and efficient considering the long queues and huge weekend crowd. Nice spacious luxurious room/suite with a huge bathroom. Only problem was with the hot water tap as it sometimes need some maneuvering to bring on the hot water( other travel mates also experience the same problem in their bathrooms).  The North suites we stayed in is closer to…,50
"Saw picture of the room before we stayed. But to see the real thing, is like, wow, we felt like a royal couple!   We had an adjoining room, a Royale and Bella, both very huge and more than enough space for five of us. Service was good, when we asked for toiletries replenishment, a guy came with a big bag of towels, toiletries and coffee/tea packets and condiments. Very efficient.  There are lots of shopping but more for window, as they are too ex for me. But good to walk around as it is modelled after Venice, with the various ""canals"", gondola and very entertained by one of the gondolier. The Venetian is the best part of our stay in Macau!",50
"Had the good fortune to experience a stay in this hotel last Nov 24-26. We stayed in the Royal Suite, which was 72 sq.m. in size! I particularly noticed the split-level floor that separates the bed area from the living area (which overlooks either the mini-golf course in the middle of the property or the water view depending on which side you're on).  The room featured a very comfortable king-sized bed with overhead drapes, 2 tvs, a minibar, office table, living room with dining table, a huge bathroom with separate shower enclosure, bathtub and water closet room, his and hers lavatory and a dresser.  The hotel is at par with its counterpart in Las Vegas. There's about 100 rooms PER floor, but we rarely bumped into other guests while at the hallway or the elevator. There's a big…",40
"Excellent hotel. Large rooms, very clean with all possible amenities.  Best service I have got in a hotel outside India. Very fast and smooth Check in and Check out, unlike some hotels in Hong Kong. There is a lot to do without having to leave the hotel. Great staff, very helpful.  Great variety of restaurants and food.",50
"We had the luxury of staying at a suite at The Venetian. Beautiful, clean and just amazing architecturally. Big beds, and a separate living area. They provide tea and coffee condiments and free bottled water.  Bathrooms big and spacious with bathtub. Amazing 5 Star, great service, amazing food court, shops and casino all under ONE roof!  Highly recommended. Stay for The Venetian experience.",50
"Best food, room, room size, hotel size, entertainment , shopping , choice and most reasonably priced and best marketed hotel property in Asia.",50
"It is a little expensive, however good value for the money spent. Room attendants are good and appropriate. Check-in and check-out are smooth and fast, much better that the counter attendants at the Hard Rock Hotel , Macau who have mainland Chinese mentality (self-defensive - ""better not to do it, than make any mistake"") Bad staff attitude in the Food Court in the shopping mall, these people were not trained to be in hospitality services. Free bus shuttle services take you almost in key parts of the city.",40
"The Venetian is definitely the best place to stay in Macau. Rooms are huge, food is fantastic with every cuisine and every budget catered for. The shopping is incredible too, all along the canal complete with Gondolas. We visited the Wynn and the MGM and the Venetian definitely had much more to offer. Closest ferry is the Taipa terminal, 50 mins from HkIA and 60 mins from Hong Kong.",50
"Venetian is like a small City in itself. Shopping mall, Golf, Casino, Canals u name it, they have it. It’s truly an experience to stay in the hotel. The hotel has beautiful decor everywhere and marvelous painting on ceilings. However the main attraction is the Canal area...the gondola rides and the gondoliers both are an experience of a Europe in China.  Coming to the room, Rooms were very spacious and luxurious, and are termed as suites - there are no ""standard"" rooms here. A spacious living area which is connected by a small staircase to where the living area is - complete with sofa, coffee table, tv console, dining table and work desk etc… According to the size of the hotel the breakfast was not the best. Particularly for the vegetarians it lacked variety and taste. Overall a…",50
"I really enjoyed my stay there with my wife. Just across the City of Dreams where you got to see the ""House of Dancing Water"". Fantastic show. The rooms in Venetian are grand! Really worth the money! They even have a golf course (short game- sorry no drivers) on one of the top floors! Highly recommended hotel! Just do not mind the casinos and walk pass them. I am not a gambling type. They even have a floor (where the gondolas are) where it appears as if it is bright and sunny skies 24/7!! You do not need a taxi to get around. Just get in one of the buses to the fairy station and get on any bus to that would get near to where you want to go. For FREE! We even got to go to Hongkong for a while (catch the ferry there). You will not regret staying at the Venetian!",50
"The Venetian Macau is a very convenient hotel for shopping and casino. The Grand Canal shops are located just on the third floor of the hotel complex, and this shopping area is connected to other shopping areas of other hotels such as the Four Seasons Hotel. The gondola ride in the indoor canals is also a great experience. Essentially, one need not go outside of the hotel complex to meet his needs. On the other hand, the casino is located on one of the lower levels of the hotel complex. During the day, the hotel is flocked by lots of people, even those not staying at the Venetian because of the shops and the casino. For security, those booked at the hotel are given a ""passport"" that they must present to the guards to access their rooms. The ""passport"" also contains entitlements…",40
"Shuttle from ferry terminal very regular although Venetian loading spot is the furthest from the building. My overall reaction was WOW!!!!!!!!!!!. Check-in was rather slow but an unsolicited offer of room upgrade was a great pacifier. Such is the enormous size of the complex that a shuttle to the room would have been good! Room left nothing to complain about. Large bathroom with sep. toilet, sleeping area contained two queen beds and still plenty of surrounding room then down two steps to lounge, similar size again to sleeping area, all furnished to the highest standard and then a view to die for from full wall width windows almost floor to ceiling. We looked out over the Galaxy, another large hotel/casino complex towards the main Macau area.  Stayed 2 nights, checking out on…",50
"This hotel is worth every single penny one has put in for.  When stepping into its lobby, one finds him/herself in a galary / museum like atmosphere.  The place is extensively decorated.  Upon reaching the rooms, one understands why Venetian charges such rates.  I would not mind returning to Venetian again.",50
"Well enough has already been said about the Venetian but here's my two pence. If you are at the Venetian, its very hard to not get mesmerized by all the opulence and grandeur. However beware that do not get overwhelmed by  the number of people you see there. Its just something that you will have to ignore. The rooms are superbly beautiful, and the dining options myriad. Must watch Cirque du Soleil and experience the Gondola rides. The riders are very entertaining and will do their best to make you enjoy the ride, including learning your local language and song... yup!!! The Wi-Fi is not free and a big turn off, for a luxury hotel like the Venetian... overall, go for it... You'll love it.... The breakfast is as lavish as it gets...!!!",40
"This was the best experience we have ever had on a hotel. We were in Venice last year and to be at The Venetian and seeing how they have replicated it in such an amazingly authentic way was simply stunning. The size of the resort is absolutely overwelming but thanks to the map we managed to not get lost too many times. There are 350 shops and 3 Gondola canals inside the complex, also Curque de Soila permanent show, Ziai. Also accross the road at the Cuty of Dreams Casino is another permanent show called Dancing with Water which you MUST SEE! We would recommend a trip to Macau as a MUST for anyone, but you must stay at the Venetian. We had a suite of 6 rooms/areas for Aus $300 per night.",50
"Went for my bachelor's party to Macau and we definitely had a great time staying at the Venetian.   Pros: - Every room is a suite (Its absolutely fantastic with that sea view) - Grand Casino (One of the few casinos with Poker Tables) - Mini 18 hole golf course - Variety of Food courts  Cons: - Its off the main strip on the other island  *Worth Mentioning: I had forgotten my iPod in the room, and when by the time I realized it I was already back in Hong Kong. I called them up, they said their room service had found it and it was safe with them. Luckily one of friends was there so he picked it up.",40
We stay in Venetian for two nights on our wedding trip to China. Impressed by its interior and size first impression was far from good. Front desk slow as we understand no mercy we pay from 12.00 PM and not allowed to enter even minute before.It was explained with system breakdown but not true. After 45 min we get the key and pass trough casino to reach our suite. Inside paradise.Bed equal to ones in royal palaces living room well equipped bath spacious. Venetian is surrounded by wonderful replica of Venice canals and include large number of shops mostly top brands. In general our stay was to remember this property best we ever stay in and reccommend to all as it is great great value for the money you pay. Our stay was part of Zaia package so we get A category tickets for Cirque…,50
"The Venetian is like a small City in itself...but thats not inconvenient at all....Its rooms are just too good...casino is huge and likeable (the dealers are stone faced and not very helpful to the amateurs). The main attractions is the Canal area...the gondola rides and the gondoliers both are an experience of a lifetime. The Golf course is also pretty impressive. Zaia show is too good.....even the breakfast was excellent...gosh there is just so much to look around, even two days were insufficient...if you are going to Macau, there is no other place to stay!!!!!",50

"Since The Venetian Macau is highly rated, expect plenty of guests over the place. There was a long queue in the reception area but the waiting time is not that long. The receptionist was very accommodating to us. After our check in, we were given a map and directions towards the access lifts to the hotel. If you are travelling with kids, please advise the receptionist immediately so she can give you the kid friendly route. Kids are not allowed to pass the casino area. The Venetian is really huge and it will be advisable for new comers to bring map of the resort when wandering around. Interiors of the resort is grandioso. Everything is elegant and clean and pricey.  The Bella Suite, as expected, was marvelous. The bedroom and bathroom was very spacious. It was tastefully done.…",40

"The Venetian definitely lives up to its name - the hotel has, in the past few years since its opening, established itself in the Macau scene as one of the hottest tourist destinations, even if you are not accommodated in their fine rooms there.  The opulence and grandeur of the Venetian is mind-boggling, right down to the minor details. Sitting on a huge piece of land along the Taipa Strip (no where else in Macau has enough space for the Venetian), the Venetian has almost everything - A casino, hotel, shopping district, restaurants, food establishments, even a canal with boats in them. And, seriously, which other hotel in Macau can also boast having its own Cirque du Soleil and even its own concert hall, where huge international stars from Taiwan and Hong Kong frequently hold…",50
"This was my second stay at The Venetian Macao. Standard rooms were large and Vegas-gaudy with over-the-top pillows and gold curtains. Two large screen TVs, one in the living room area and the other in the bedroom area. Large well designed bathroom, as well.  Complimentary breakfast or lunch buffets were massive with excellent food! Good restaurant selection in the hotel, as well. If you're on a budget, the food courts offered affordable alternatives. Shopping in the Grand Canal areas is excellent. For entertainment, there's Cirque Du Soleil and of course, the casinos.  If I return to Macao, this will always be my #1 choice for a hotel.",50

"The Venetian is everything you expect of a grand, glamorous, over-the-top hotel and I loved it.  Everything was as we imagined; the canals, the shops, the HUGE buffet breakfast, the glorious swimming pool (although it was too cold to swim when we were there).  You could get private rooms surrounding the pool with individual couches and TVs and drinks in each.   We upgraded to a deluxe suite and it was one of the biggest hotel rooms I have ever been in.  There was a separate bedroom section and living area and the bathroom is amazing! It was a wonder in itself.  We weren't big gamblers so we didn't spend much time in the casino but instead explored Macau.  The old town was a short taxi ride away and there are constant shuttle buses to the ferry terminal so no need to worry about…",50
"I was at the venetian in the May 2011, you get a feeling of being in your castle and the treatment offered to a king. Great ambience, Superb cuisine, Extravaganza entertainment.  I recommend The Venetian if you are in Macau...",50
I was amazed of the interior designs I saw. It's like visiting to Vienna. I love the place.,50
"Great experience! Beyond imagination. 3200 nos. of rooms, 4-5 swimming pools, 8-10 restaurants, big market, boat ride, kids zone, movie halls, clubs, world largest casino, etc etc what else you want. Minimum room size is 850 sq ft with two double beds, two tv ,two washrooms etc. Beautiful painting and carvings all over the place. Huge pillarless bamquet hall. Food is excellent but expensive.Over all fun.",50
"its has all what you want for leisure with your family or even with your friends.... there is no need of going out for shopping, entertainment, world cuisine, golf, and even the casino. man you must just go ones and be theirs for they hospitality. its more like staying there like a KING.",50
"Booked a room for two, excellent ambience, rich interiors, artificial sky are all just amazing, all facilities are included in room rent like swimming, jacuzzi, etc except WiFi access which was quite surprising. Casino on the ground floor is quite addicting, don't forget to enjoy the Gondola ride. Fun World inside the resort is not to be missed anyways. All big brands are inside Venetian, so serious shopping all yes yes... Indian restaurant serves as best Indian food as in India. Be sure to enjoy the disc by the name ""D2"" in the Macao city...",50
"The rooms on the top floor are preferable.. You can have a beautiful view in the night. The Venetian offers a wide range of shops, restaurants, shows and the best services. If you miss the Venetian, you are really missing the best in Macau. The hotel staff was very friendly and they usually have very good deals on Trip advisor. Please go for the suites, as they are marvelous.",50
"Me and may family (my wife, 2 kids-12 and 9 yrs old) stayed for 2 days. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The hotel room is quite spacious for 4 of us. No need to take extra bed. We took Cotai view and view of other casinos - city of dreams, Crown, Hard rock cafe and Hyatt was great. At night, we would just sit and watch all the lighting in these casinos. I took Shopt and pamper package - which gave me free Zaia tickets, breakfast and 10 min fish massage apart from free ferry ticket back to Hongkong. If you don't get this package - they also had on-the-spot package for Zaia, breakfast etc. I got Indian food in Cafe deco and Fogo Samba. Other than that, Venetian food court on level 3 also had 2 restarants which were serving Indian Dishes. We also used their swimming pool and…",50
"Went here for a short getaway with wife and 2 kids aged 9 and 6, no gambling required. Building inside and out dazzles you. Jewelry stores abound. The 3rd floor is a mall Mecca with upper to high end watches. If you like malling this is the best base, if you like street bargain finds look elsewhere as street walking is a no no for this destination, there are no small stores within walking distance. Hotel provides free shuttle to sands hotel and from there you can take cab to city center for US$4.   The rooms are magnificent, clean, smells good and spacious. Doers are glitzy but a little ornamental but it sure beats the holiday inn. It's truly a 5 star hotel. However hotel is  big that there's no personal touch. If you crave for personal pampering move to a smaller hotel. Would I…",50
"We didn't stay at the Venetian but read it's a great place to be. Nonetheless, we were just staying next door and could find EVERYTHING you need in Macau here at the Venetian. It's that convenient!",40
"excellent hotel, excellent facilities and excellent value for money. wonderful experience  the concierge Lucy was a wonderful help",50
"too summarize... the room is beautiful, it is nicely decorated, spacious space to have your family around . The twin beds is pretty large which you could use it for sharing 2 people each bed- total 4. You got bed areas and also living areas with sofas , arm chair and also little dining corner.  The bathroom is beautiful, with his and her vanity , dresser , lovely shower. Other thing which I like is they provide fax, copier, printer in the room, which is very convenient. Price is quite expensive but you really get what you pay for.  Shopping areas - lovely.. you got plenty options... and great food court to taste some pan Asian menus.",40
"We have just returned from 2 nights here and my husband and had the best time.  We flew into Hong Kong Airport and then got the Turbojet to Macau even though our flight was late and we checked in at Turbojet less than an hour before our ferry booking they still collected our luggage for us and it was waiting for us in Macau.  In future we would fly to Macau or get the Cotai Ferry as it is a bit closer and there are still a complimentary buses.  The room was amazing really large, the bed so comfortable and beautiful bathroom, the room has everything you could need apart from free wifi but if you go to the irish bar near the casino they will give you the password to their free wifi (if you are having a drink there of course) and it even worked standing outside when they are closed…",50

"Spent two nights at the Venetian. Rooms were beautiful, replica of Las Vegas. Food and entertainment were great. I would recommend staying to friends.",50
"A world of its own and having been to Venice this brought back fond memories and I was very impressed with the sheer size and detail of the place. It was a bit too expensive for what we got though and we had to pay a ridiculous amount of money to use the internet in the business centre. At the rate we paid a night I thought this was disgraceful. It is so big it is very easy to get lost here. The location is quite far out from the main bit but there are shuttle buses to take you down to main strip and also a very good free shuttle bus service to the airport. The staff however have very poor levels of English and could not even explain to us how we could get tokens to gamble. I do regret staying here and think there could have been better hotel options for that price, nearby…",40
"we stay in Venetian Macau for 3 nights..the rooms are sooo big (you can have a party in the room) the bed is so comfortable and wow the bathroom is amazing. The room service is great and the only thing not good about this hotel is the pool area, the gym and the spa, which you have to walk (almost 1km from our room :( too bad) though the facilities and casino are great but my partner dont like the ornamental plants (its plastic not unlike in Vegas its real plants...hahaha)",50
"I took the suite with cotai strip view, it was amazing! its facing the sea, and the city of dreams. The night view showcased the changing lights of the city of dreams, all this in the comfort of your own room! Sheraton and Shang is still in construction, the Vegas feel will be complete when all the hotels are ready.  The suite comes with 2 double beds and a pull out double sofa bed, so its good for families or a group of 6 pax to sleep comfortably.   The temporary Taipa Ferry Terminal and the airport is just 5-10 min drive from the hotel. The complmentry shuttle bus will bring you around the entire Macau, some routes will have a longer que, especially during peak hours like the first and last bus. (first bus starts at 10am, last bus at 7pm). Taxi from the hotel to the San Paolo…",50
"When i reached this hotel i was really exhausted after a really long journey and headed off to room instantly , the check in was really fast and my room was in south suites.  it was long walk to the room but when i reached there it  was amazing, it had a nice big window with good view, huge bathroom and really nice comfortable beds.  i went to sleep and woke around 3 am and was hungry so i thought to stroll down for a snack and it was like no one was sleeping , the whole city was their and in casino it didn't look like 3am.  Now let me come down to facts to summarize the hotel  Staff: Really nice and very co-operative  Restaurants : its has a lot of choices and if your an Indian then you would see many boards in hindi and many restaurants giving Indian special food.

"Venetian Macao! unforgettable experience!   My second visit at The Venetian Macao, my first time to stay for a night!   When I first entered the room! i was speechless! It was huge! it's 70 sq.m.

"We booked directly with the hotel and we got the Zaia Gold Package. Our suite looked great. The bathroom details looked posh. The bed was so comfortable it was so hard to detach myself from it!   Once outside the room, a whole day is not enough to tour the hotel and enjoy the activities it offers. Our Package also came with a 50% discount at Blue Frog and a buffet breakfast with 3 restaurant options. At Blue Frog, we ordered steaks and it wasn't at all bad. Good value for money. For breakfast, we decided to go to Cafe Deco and they had a wide range of buffet choices.  Zaia was totally amazing. The Gondola ride was made remarkable by the beautiful voice of the gondolier. Ice World was impressive but be warned, don't go there wearing open-toed shoes or slings. I went there wearing…",50
"I stayed here for one night in September 2010, in Royale Suite. The hotel lobby is not so big as I expected, but the rooms are very spacious. The overall hotel interior is very classic and I love the river inside the hotel. There are some gondolas there, you can rent one, a boat is for 4 -5 people, HKD 100/person. The gondola guys will sing for you as yo ride the gondola. Their voice are sooo nice. One of them told me that they took opera class in university. Wow! There are lots of food stalls in the food court, the breakfast venue also serve a huge choice of breakfast menu.  I didn't go to the casino, so I can't tell, it is big though.. This hotel is very big, just like a city.. haha..",40
"I had a great time at this hotel/ Casino . The place is massive , our room was a long walk from the main reception! The food court his great, huge selection. The shopping too in the mall are is excellent. However the hotel is so large, getting from one place to another can be a confusing task. Without a map you'll be walking around in circles .  If you are a gambler , then this is it. Minimum bets are $ 100. Lots of games to choose from. Great place for a couple of night! Good value too.",40
"I went to venetian macao last july and i had the BEST sleep (in hotel) ever. I only stayed for 1 night as a part of my journey to hong kong-shenzen-macao. My family and I stayed at royal-suite room and it was huge! We got 1 room for each 2 people, and it was more than enough. There were two beds and I believe it can actually accomodate 4 people. The bathroom was also large, and there was a livingroom for couch and TV. But too bad the checking in process took like, forever. I think it was because the hotel was TOO large. There are 4 different lobbies and the human resources were not enough to accomodate a place that big (I hope they already improve it by now). And the wireless connection was not working! I tried with both my ipad and my blackberry and none of them were working (I…",50
"I and my family had a great experiences with the Venetian Hotel ! we booked the Bella-suite and Royal-Suite room for 3 nights.   First, the receptionist at the hotel was professional and impressed us with early check in (11 am) since I traveled with my 2 year-old son, therefore we do not have to wait for many hours to check in (the regular check-in time = 3 pm)  Second,  both suites were spacious with huge bathroom and nice decoration; especially, the Bella-suite was very large room which could accomodate more than 4 persons although the hotel allows only 2 guests. Howerver, the Bella-suite room had a bad smell of smoke.  Third, there are secuirty guards at the front of hotel suite's entrance to check guest's key card. This made us more secure  Fourth, the hotel offers…",50
"The entrance is magnificent, I was impressed with the bed room and the bathroom. Shopping canal is so nice...great to take pictures,...love to come back again",50
"to start with their shuttle very comfortable, plenty of people in the lobby and hotel staff were very nice and accommodating.plenty of Filipinos worked in the resort.hotel room is very large with 2 television sets and comfort rooms are big. beds are big i almost got out late the morning after.in my 5 day stay in Macao and sleeping to  4 different hotels i could say that if i will come back i will stay again in Venetian Macao resort.",50
"We stayed at the Venetian and Palazzo Las Vegas numerous times and this one tops the ones in Vegas. The rooms are almost identical but shopping is probably better (they have some good Hong Kong based boutiques and their food court is great, perfect for families with kids) and their swimming pool was top notch. Even though the hotel was busy, the pool area was very quiet and ""tranquil"" Their gambling hall was huge and was crowded day and night. Only down side about staying at this part of Macau is that there's no place to walk outside the hotel. 20 cent water outside the hotel costs over a dollar here inside and things you can buy inside this resort is very limited. So whenever you go out to downtown area for sight-seeing, it's probably a good idea to buy things there on the way…",40
"We were originally staying in Hong Kong but decided to head across to Macau as we are huge fans of Cirque du Soleil. The Venetian Macau have a residence Cirque show there called 'Zaia'. So we took advantage of the Cirque deal whereby we got a room 'suite', 2 A grade tickets for the show and a return trip back to Hong Kong the day after. The hotel itself was very grand and we easily got lost with so much to offer from, not only, the casino but the vast array of shops and restaurants and entertainment facilities on offer. The swimming pools were MILES away though and it felt like we were walking back to Hong Kong! lol The room was very clean and spacious and big and very clean with all the room facilities you would expect. The service in Cafe Deco though was poor and the staff…",40
"Wow, this place is grand! I have never seen a hotel of this scale before. Right from the moment you reach Macau the hotels services takeover to ensure you have the smoothest trip possible. The rooms at the Venetian are a class apart - large, well furnished and comfortable!!! I recommend this place very strongly on your visit to Macao!",40
"Absolutely expansive and a complete city unto itself. We didn't venture out at all as our girl was still a small baby then. You didn't have to anyway as everything is there. Shops, restaurants, pool, casino (just hubby), and the room. It was spacious w/ a separate seating area w/ own tv. Decor was tacky, I must say. Views were of the building itself, fantastic. Bed wasn't king as advertised but was comfy. Bathroom was wonderful w/ the enclosed toilet, separate shower and tub. Breakfast was delicious and filling. Service was good. Pool and kid's playroom were a far walk. Very crowded.  Always count your change and check your order when eating at the food court.",50
"I got this room at a discounted MOP1,300+ per night without breakfast and gave it a go! The room is definitely very beautifully crafted, and details were attended to from the bed lighting, to the mini-living room, to the exceptionally big bathroom.   Nonetheless, the features of this opulent hotel/resort were not isolated to the room, as the best part is actually in 'witnessing' a piece of faux-Venice, in Asia! One can easily enjoy The Venetian without having to book a room, which is what I would recommend to others looking forward to visiting this place ... by the way shuttle rides from Cotai (where The Venetian is) to Macau downtown are free, just by crossing the street to The City of Dreams, where shuttle buses bring you to Hotel Sintra, which is just a few blocks away from…",50
"The venetian is no doubt one of the most popular resorts in Macau.  We caught the ferry from Kowloon to Macau and the venetian coach to the hotel.  The sheer size of the place is amazing.  The rooms are huge and luxurious.  The hotel offer everything from  cirque du soleil to amazing ice sculptures in Ice World, mini golf course, great pool, gondala rides and plenty of shops.  Gambling tables are everywhere and even with a crowd it is not difficult to find a seat at your favourite game.  Free drinks are available when gambling, however, a ;little hard to find a waitress at times.  The amount of restaurants in the hotel is huge ranging from fast foods and food courts to more classy restaurants.  The way they deal with so many people is amazing, however, chck out a little early to…",40
"The hotel is simply the best I have been too so far perhaps the most complete package of entertainment in the world. Rooms are so good that you would want to spend lot of time in it,very comfortable, very large. Separate large seating and bed area, two TVs, mini-office in the room, fax,scanner etc. Victorian Bathroom. Such a large resort but room service is unbelevably good. Blink your eye after placing request on phone for more water and the doorbell rings!!!   Plenty of shows all day long offering you a variety of entertainment. We saw the Iceworld show which was lovely. Casino is open all day long and unimaginable crowd 24 hours a day. Hundreds of restaurants in the resort including Indian. Vegetarian food is available. Almost all the brands of the world are present in the…",50
"After arriving at Macau Ferry terminal, a bus from the hotel picked us up and we reached the hotel. After a swift check-in, we were handed a map to get to our room. We took the suite which was worth it. The food court, the mall, the casino, etc. help us to spend a lot of time! They also have their own sight seeing, etc. which was great! The best hotel in Macau!!",50
"The Venetian is an attempt to recreate Venice, down to the gondolas in the shopping center attached to the hotel. The staff is friendly and helpful and the rooms are all suites and quite large. The bathrooms are also large and modern. Macao is all about gambling and to this end the gambling floor is also ""ginormous"". The floor is surrounded by every designer brand store you can imagine. If you're not a gambler, window shopping is a great experience. Like all the high end hotels everywhere, they charge for internet access (a pet peeve of mine). They have a desk in the hotel where you can check in for flights take drop your luggage for flights out of the  Macau airport. Like all the big hotels in Macau they run bus service to and from the ferry to Hong Kong. They also have free…",50
"Stayed at the Venetian Macau after four years again and while the Cotai Strip is more crowded I find that this part of Macau (away from the Lisboa side) is less crowded, noisy and filled with casual visitors for the day from the mainland.  The hotel is already four years old but still by far as posh and not as ""cold"" as the Galaxy.  The casino floor is huge (tho smokey) and they now have a non-smoking section which is good.  The hotel staff are a mix of friendly and cold people - as is the case everywhere.  Everytime I get annoyed by one, I soon meet one that goes out of his way to help.  A kind security guy walked me all the way to a particular shop that I was trying to find.  The three of us booked in and were given two queen beds which was very spacious.  The last time I was…",40
"Stayed 4 nights there with the mrs and a little toddler and the place was very nice. Big, celan, luxurious room, lots of things to do, plenty of free shuttle buses to go around, kid friendly and great service. It was very crowded, but then again so is the rest of Macau.",50
"We decided to select Venetian after seen the HSBC promotion through a local travel agent and it was a great decision as we enjoy every minute. Though the arrival experience some what different to what I expected as we came through the west lobby, no sooner we are inside the hotel every thing was great.   Except few members of staff who couldn't communicate in English, all were polite and helpful. There is ample choice for food, shopping and keeping your self occupied,  I would have not selected the hotel if not for the HSBC card promotion which was a wonderful deal.",50
"venetian was a very good stay. u dont need to get out of the hotel for anything, starting from food to shopping to casino they have everything... its like living in a paradise.. they have a good variety in food for room service as well.. staff is polite..very clean and well mantained hotel. is packed all round the yr........ good shoppingg!!! the casino rocks!!!",50
"We stayed at the Venetian during for our first trip to Macau and have stayed here several times since. The standard rooms are like mini suites... very spacious and luxurious. The actual suites (I got a peek at one) are bigger than my apartment! But there is sooo much to do in the hotel, you really dont spend much time in the rooms. Not a big fan of the casino, which is huge but always CROWDED (the casino at the Wynn feels far classier), but one could easily spend a full day shopping at the Grand Canal Shoppes. There is a food court and several restaurants that offer ample dining variety. The Chinese restaurant right in the middle of the casino is really nice, and has several options for vegetarians. Be prepared to wait in a long queue for check in and have a long trek up to your…",40

This hotel is opulent. There is no other word for it. With a great shopping arcade and selection of slots and table games there's almost no better place in Macau. However I was expecting the same level and attention as the Venetian and Vegas and was sorely disappointed. The hotel obviously knows it's market is Mainland China but when the staff doesn't speak English and you talk with them in Mandarin and they still don't know where Mortons of Chicago is that is totally a big flop for this hotel.  We walked around for 20 minutes asking about Mortons and found it on the interactive map. We were standing so close to it when we asked the staff it was frustrating.   Although I left with a poor taste for what the Venetian management let's slide as customer care and experience at this…,40
"We stayed at the Venetian Macau in Septmeber 2011. It is a very popupal resort in Macau which you can make out as soon as you arrive at the ferry terminal - by the sheer number of people climbing onto the complimentary shuttle bus that takes you to the hotel.  We did not know about this service and was a pleasant surpirse for us.  We stayed in a Royal Suite which is really spacious, with a huge bed, a living room and spacious bathroom area.    What we liked is the spacious room, the room service was good, the staff is friendly and helpful, the shopping area in the hotel is good (a lot of the brands have shops here), the ice world (which has ice formations of some of the wonders of the world and is really well made), the fact that you can also take care of your work there (too…",40
"The hotel is everything that one reads of in reviews. The rooms are spacious and luxurious. We were there in one of their busiest weekends. We couldn't get twin beds, but the sofa bed pullout was quite comfortable. There is extra charge though for the use of the sofa bed.  The hotel is a nice base to access all the fantastic shows in Macau.  My only concern is if you have kids sensitive to cigarette smoke...expect more than your fair share in this hotel. The casinos are separated only by dividers and to traverse from one lobby to the other, the cigarette smell can be overwhelming.  But I don't know if there are other hotels whose casinos are closed of from public areas.    ",40
Once your booked at the venetian you dont need to bother getting to the hotel & moving around or eating or anything else cause its all either in the hotel or arranged by the hotel outside ! A true holiday without having to waste time on planning & organizing ! If its Macau it has to be Venetian,50
"We stayed at the Venetian Macau last September 5-8, 2011. Complimentary shuttle bus service to and from the airport (and piers) is provided by the hotel, so it was not necessary to take a taxi or make prior transfer arrangements. We were rather disappointed though by the lack of service that greeted us upon our arrival at the hotel. Although there were bellhops around at the main hotel entrance, not a single one bothered to assist us with our luggage and direct us to the reception desk. Three or four dollies were randomly littered on the driveway as if to hint that you're on your own as far as your luggage goes. I have heard this complaint from guests who have stayed here before, and I can confirm the same from my own experience.  We checked-in at 10 p.m. so the process was…",40
"Stayed at the Venetian for a night as I went to see The House of Dancing Water show at City of Dreams.  Didn't really pay attention to the details when I booked and was suprised to see that I booked a Bella Suite...it was just luxurious.  2 very comfortable double beds and pillows, large bathroom and a living area.  The casino itself is HUGE.  Got lost many times trying to find things.  Very confusing getting around.  The other downside is the people smoke EVERYWHERE, be it the casino floor or a restaurant.  Here in Australia (and many other parts of the world) smoking is banned, so was a bit disappointed to be surrounded by smoke either walking through the casino or sitting down to a late dinner after the show.  Shuttle service between the ferry terminal and other casinos is…",50

"We stayed at the Venetian for one night on a last-minute trip to Macau from Bangkok.   It's pretty much just like a bigger version of the Vegas one but without the 'buzz' that the Vegas one has.   We quickly realised that this hotel was not there as a holiday resort like the one in Vegas; people go here to gamble and not much else- so in terms of the 'frills', there aren't many. The restaurants are more suited to just getting some food, not having an amazing meal out (the quality is definitely there, just not the number of restaurants offering the top end classsy joints).  The room itself was fantastic. The size is great and the all-suite format reall works- it gives you somewhere really great to return to after being elsewhere in the resort.  I have zero complaints or even…",40
"We truely enjoyed our stay here. It is located in a part of Macau that is less crowded than some other areas, but there are less attractions to walk to also. I'm sure it will soon change, as they are building so many more things over there (the Cotai Strip). The hotel is gorgeous, very much like the Venetian in Las Vegas, but so incredibly huge! You get a great workout just walking to your room, let alone the shopping area. I wound up in the room many days because we were there for rainy season, but I found the shopping area kept me busy, as well as the Ice Show, and many restaurants. Still it would've been nice to enjoy the multiple outdoor pools a little more. One of them is a large fountain, an interesting place to cool off. There was also a mini-golf area.   We were here for…",50
"Venetian is the best hotel in Macau. If you go to Macau and not staying at the venetian, you are missing something extraordinary. The room was amazing, all suites. It was large and the bed and pillow was so confortable there is not words to describe. The hotel is beautiful with plenty of shopping, gondola rides and a city of its own. If vising Macau, do not forget to watch the show called ""House of Dancing Water"" located opposite of the venetian. It is the best show on earth. Dont forget to make use of the free shuttle service to and from the airport and also to many places in the city. Overall if you want the best experience in each and every way, Venetian Macau delivers it all.",50
"I think the title of my review says it all, but I know it deserves more than that, so here we go:  Pros: The Venetian is not just a hotel but a destination in itself, so stay here for the overall experience, the suites are classy and modern at the sametime, service is excellent, the hotels lobby's are a sight, the ice world is a fab experience and so is the Cirque de soleil show. The casino here is huge too, only thing we did not like was that there were not many hosts to help new comers into gambling, not everyone is a seasoned gambler right! But nevertheless we figured out some of the machines on our own and tried our hand at a few. It would be great if they have more people who can explain in english and make our stay more fun in the casino. The food is also excellent both at…",50

And gondola rides, jetti,etc etc , shopping, food courts ... my god unexplainable.. Its a crime if we call Venetian a hotel or a resort , no its not at all a hotel its a beautiful city itself.. If you ever visit macau stay there atleast for a week(if you wanna enjoy it seriously)",50
"Been visiting Macau a few times and everytime we're there, we always stay here just to relive it's grand shopping and entertainment experiences.    Yes, the hotel is often ery crowded with gursts checking ins & outs in the West lobby area; so a proper fast & swift check in service can be a problem sometimes.  However, the last time we're there, we're immediately greeted and attended by one of the supervisors who took care of our luggages as well as let us check in immediately (without having to queue in line).  This is the first for us, we're so pleased with this indeed.    Make sure to ask for the room on a high floor, 38th floor is the highest.  Rooms facing the City of Dreams are quite nice at night.  All rooms are huge, so don't worry about the small space here.    The…",50
"I simply love staying at Venetian Macau ! The rooms, service, food court options, Casinos, Gondola ride, shopping, ZAIA Show, Swimming pool etc - everything is at its best ! I Rooms are really big, clean & very comfortable. Room service is good too. If you take the room+breakfast option, then there is huge spread of breakfast. The casino is really big & they have almost every game. ZAIA show is worth a watch !!!  The only disappointing service was the line for check in. Otherwise all in all a super hotel ! An attraction in Macau & a great place to stay !",40

"Venetian Macau is one of the finest hotels in Macau and caters to the needs of those who like to  try their luck in gambling.It has a fine huge area for the casino and one can find huge crowd cheering the bidders. Besides the casino, one is at awe looking at the craftmenship and detailing done on its interiors. There is an artificial canal built on the ground floor wherein one can relive the pleasure of riding a gondola as in Venice.Its worth booking a stay in the hotel and reliving the pleasure of dining and gambling in the casino.",50
"This is a great hotel overall. It is massive but enjoyable as we love to walk.  We enjoyed our stay especially the ZAIA show and our room is awesome!  If there's something that quite bothered me it was that they don't have enough tables at the food court. My husband was close to seating on the carpeted floor and do a little picnic-style lunch which we won't really mind doing. Also, I hope the jackets that they lend to kids at the Ice World has a hood as my 3-year old son complained about his ears so we had to rush to exit - we didn't do enough justice to our 100MOP each :-) Maybe we could have rented a winter hat for him but if the kids' jacket has hood like the ones of the adults, that should be enough to keep his ears warm. They should realize that Macau is like 37C in August…",50

"When we got to The Venetian, we were bowled over with the sheer size of the development. We were told it can house 99 boeing jets!! So you can imagine why we need a map to navigate around the hotel, shops & casinos. Rooms very were grand and of a good size. Good view.  Service was great even though the hotel is very very very crowded with lots of visitors from China. If you are looking for a quiet and relax stay, this hotel is not for you!  The hotel is bursting with excitement and activities!",40
We stayed here in November 2011 for 2 nights. We had 2 rooms with i child and 2 adults in each. We were offered an upgrade and we took the offer it was worth the added money the room was huge. We had a nice stay.,50
"With the smell of smoke from the Casino drifting through the shopping arcades, and the occasional prostitute trying to catch your eye, this hotel is clearly catering for a specific traveller who has vice on his mind.      If you are not him(!) then you should only come once, just to experience quite how much gold and superfluous decoration can possibly be squeezed into a single hotel.  The Grand Canal is amazing, lined with every top brand name you can recall.  The rooms are as grand, as you would expect.  But this is not a hotel to relax or bring your family.  Oh - and make sure you order breakfast in your room...the queue for breakfast was stretching out of the restaurant and down the corridor!",40
"Everything about the hotel is nice, only criticism is you can't turn all the lights off from your bed, there was no master switch, otherwise rooms are really nice.",50
"Love the atmosphere of the room and hotel, food court and shops are connected to the hotel and it is very convenient, but the price of the food court is a bit expensive.  Buffet meal in Asian and Western styles is available and the food is tasty.  Casino is right at the centre of the hotel ground floor, the casino has great good range of games but the bet amount is quite high for leisure players, but overall it is a good hotel to stay again...",50
"we stayed there april 2010 This is a Fabulous Hotel we stayed for three nights and then took ferry over to Hong Kong, This hotel has its own canal for gondular rides, it is full of exoensive shops in its own malls, local area was a bit under developed for us to go walk about, watched the famous ""Cirque du Soleil"" show in the hotels own theatre, fabulos to watch, never been to Las Vegas, but everyone says it is as good as Las Vegas",50
"I stayed in Venetian Macauu a couple of times, and I am generally satisifed with the quality of the stay. It is clearly a Casino Hotel , But I have never seen any other Hotel in my life with so many people circulating in every single m2 of the hotel. In each hotel you can find some quiet places or wrongly planned spaces that are not useful at all , but this hotel is alive andalive at every location. Food Court is no different than a crowded bazaar. Gotta line up to get the food ten need to be lucky to find a seat dto dine . For more privacy and comfort you need to move to the St Marko square The Italian restaurant at theSt Marko is good enough , but I personally did not like the quality of the food in their Brazilian BBQ.

"We stayed here for a night. Nice delux bedroom with 2 queen beds for my family of 3. Bathroom was nice. Didn't spend much time in the room though. The hotel is MASSIVE. Not sure I like the fake sky and Venetian replica. Have seen the real thing in Venice. As children were not allowed in the casino area, there were areas where we couldn't walk through with children. Breakfast was ok. Food at food court was horrible and expensive.  Enough to keep you entertained here for a full day. We enjoyed the 'street' performance. Watched Zaia (Cirque du Soleil) and the Ice World exhibition which was present at that time. Next day, checked out early and headed for St. Paul's facade before taking the Cotaijet to HK.  Not cheap. Great for a once only experience!",40
"All rooms only got SUITE, good place for having one stop entertainment, foods, shopping, casino, movie, cirque, what else you can do they got it. Love the fake venetian area where you can ride the gondola seems you are in the real of Venetia with the peoples who sing the songs at the back of gondola. Foods was amazing you can find any kind of foods, branded items you named it. Love the bathroom, clean and all was fantastic. Staffs good and friendly but don't expect in the casino as they keep on eyes all the times :-). Entertainment inside and outside the hotel area was amazing. Superb!",50
"The first time my grandma travelled to macau.   Very huge hotel that is not enough for only one night stay.  We went to the italian restaurant and a chinese restaurant  called North. Great food and services. Recommended the seafood platter and flying noodles.  Nice room though the sunken living room is inconvenience for my grandma (w/ wheelchair ).  Long queue for gondola (20min waiting), but worth trying. My grandma love the ride so much! The gondolier is amazing !  All the staff are helpful and friendly except the busing lady at the west  entrance. she just stood there and do nothing except watching us pushing and pulling grandma up to the shuttle, leaving the wheelchair and luggage on the floor, and letting the others step on our stuff. she never willing to assist placing our…",50
"What you pay is what you get. The room is really big, clean, the food at food court inside the hotel was great.",40
Nice architecture and impressive interior design. Very crowded with lots of tourists everywhere. Check in and out was ok considering the large number of rooms they have. Room typical Victorian style and huge with a nice bathroom. No view though. Comfortable hotel stay for a simple business traveller. Internet is chargeable which is not business travel friendly. Has a huge mall with lots of renowned brand for shopping and restaurants. Price is not cheap though.,40
"Just back home after staying in Macau for three days. We booked Venetian with limo transfer. Room was spotless and pleasant, just as a 5-star hotel room should look like. We hired a scooter from www.macauscooters.com and realized this was the best thing we ever did in Macau. We are not much into gambling, so we prefered to visit all the well and the less-well known places in the territory. Highly recommended.  Venetian itself is on the Cotai Strip and it's not close to anything, so if you want to do anything else than gambling and shopping you need to get to Macau.   Venetian has great facilities / playgrounds for kids - you can leave them there for hours.  Overall we really enjoyed Macau and Venetian matched our high expectations.",50
"Stayed here for four nights this time. Been stayed here for at least 3 times. It's basically a huge casino hotel with venetian theme. You would find everything you want here. Good food, a big mall, a huge casino, etc. Stayed at the Rialto, quite a big 1 bedroom suite. Cons: room's interior is a bit old fashioned, the hotel is too big so sometime service can be slow.",40
"It is the most beautiful and dazzling experience always. You cannot imagine that such a thing can be constructed. I lvoed the place, and have decided to visit it once minimum every year. They treat you like kings, and their rooms are amazing. There are only suites in the hotel, and a casino as big as a football ground. Amazing food court and awesome restaurants, shopping you name it and they have it. If you go to macao keep 3 days only for this property minimum, you might be able to cover it then.",50
"Wow, what a hotel! Big, bigger and biggest. Took a complimentary hotel shuttle from the ferry building, took us about 15 minutes. Although very busy, check in was very efficient and quick. Room was wonderful; spacious, clean, new. And the bathroom I wanted to take home with me.... Separate tub and shower, lots of space. Couldn't really fault anything to be frank. The hotel is not very close to Old Macao and the 'old strip' where all the Chinese owned casino's are. Old town is beautiful, strange;  a bit of Portugal in Southeast Asia.  Cab ride to Old Town wasn't cheap; around 70MOP. Will definitely stay there again.",40
"We totally loved it! The staff was very helpful, attentive and welcoming. The people by the front desk were very nice. They were always smiling. They also welcomed our requests. The bellhops and guards were very courteous and nice. It was, as if, they did not want us to carry anything at all. :) The welcome drinks were great!  The bars and restaurants we visited (Morton's, Vergnano, Bambu, Portofino and Bellini Lounge) were all great and served amazing food! The ambiance was exquisite. The hallways were gleaming and clean. The bedroom and bathrooms was great, very spacious! I loved the idea of the sunken living room. It was great that they had rooms that can accommodate the handicapped and non–smokers.  The shopping area and casino was great! The only disappointment I had with…",50
"It seems The Venetian Macao and Las Vegas are twins. Same big rooms, exquisite furniture, entertainement not at the same level like Vegas, but intentive design, marketplaces, shopping malls and with several gimmicks. Lot of Restaurants and the wellnknown  paradise for gambler. Offering coaches for transport to other destinations on Macao for free. Overall an impressive expierence!",50
"This is my second  stay with this hotel. The first time was with my family, they have two queen size bed, one sofa bed. Very spacious bathroom and a separate living room. Good price with such a luxury room. And they have nice swimming pool.  This hotel was always very busy with a lot of customers. Great location with access to a grand shopping mall.  Just that there seems to be lack of personal touch with the hotel as they were too busy.",50
"Stayed here for one night after spending 2 nights in Macau city.  This hotel is amazing.  Rooms are HUGE, approx 6x17m, separate lounge, incredibly clean, HUGE bathroom.  Service was fantastic.  We stayed on a Zaia Package deal so great value.  Zaia - Cirque du Soleil was fantastic, couldn't fault the show.  Buffet breakfast had every selection although it is like eating in a mess hall with so many people. The shopping here is incredible, and we felt we needed an extra day here.   There are only big Casino style hotels nearby, with no street shopping or street eating available. Will definitely be back - had a great stay!",50
luxurious rooms with all possible amenities... the hotel is like a city within .... the best place to be in macau,50
"Venetian Macao Resort Hotel: All in One but very tiring Date: 25th December 2010  By having alook at the website of the hotel itself we were very excited to stay there. Finally when we got there we were zapped by the hotel in all. Size was huge. Huge casino. Best part is that we were there for 3 nights and we did not even have to step out of the hotel. All facilities were present there. Its so huge that it seems that everyone is on the move. Shopping, fooding, music, gambling, spa, swimming, golf, you just name it. Outstanding shows / live performances. The Gondala Rides.  Only thing I did not like about the hotel is that its so huge that even in the 4 days we stayed there we were not able to cover up the whole hotel. Moving from one part of the hotel to the other the whole is…",50
"Great sized rooms - got a Cotai Strip view - although not much to really see other than Hard Rock.The decor, bathrooms, beds etc were really excellent - and very well maintained - no small feat when they have 3000!  It was too far to get to the pool and that was pretty small even by vegas casino standards. Think there are 4 pools but lost will to live to find others! Lots of food choices and the room service was excellent. Casino totaly rammed so prefer the smaller (MUCH) smaller one across the road in Hard Rock. Watch Hotel.com because they didn't quote tax in price and that hiked it up another 70 usd - so it was pretty steep....",40
"Venetian Resort, A Lovely & a Grand Resort with an ample Shopping Area along with one of the World's Biggest Casino, Restaurants had Mouthwatering Cuisines with lovely suites & the most comfortable enviorment.",50
"Lovely hotel & resort... We spent a night at this beautiful hotel.  Check in took around 10 minutes... Which was way less than what we had expected.  The walk to the room took around 15 minutes...   The room was huge... Different from the small rooms we had experienced in Hong Kong. The furniture & fittings were excellent as well.  Food court with a wide variety of cuisines was available...   Excellent atmosphere... We spent most of the time in the hotel/resort itself... discovering, walking around, shopping, relaxing, and didn't really go out to discover Macau.  Would love to visit again.",40
"Still by far the best choice on the Cotai strip. Shop around on the hotel booking engines, can save you easily 20 to 30%. Watch out when you book on the Venetian Macau website, as the taxes only show when you already booked, very misleading. Rooms are great, service is so so, but that's the case in most Macau casino hotels.",40
"We were 5 friends who were travelling to Hong Kong and Macau. We arrived at the ferry terminal and took the comfortable shuttle parked right outside, to the hotel which was about 7-8 mins ride.  We did know that the hotel is huge and were shocked to see the queue for checking in the rooms. Since we had arrived earlier than the check-in time, we left our luggage at the concierge desk and explored the hotel. The luggage was sent to our rooms as assured.  The rooms were fantastic, huge, clean and extremely well decorated. The view was garden side. The bathroom was, again, huge, spic-n-span with bright yellow lighting and complete a dressing area with vanity desk and chair.  We headed for the casino which is again huge and lively 24/7 with a restaurant in the centre of the casino…",50
"It is a nice hotel. Everything just fine, with the price i paid i find it is value for money. Must try the Pork Bun.",40
Everything was great!   Shuttle is provided from and to ferry terminal. Shuttle is also provided to Sands Hotel Everything you need is all in Venetian. There's just so much to do in this hotel.    The rooms are superb. Service was great!  There's always someone around to help you with anything.    I will definitely be back here!,50
"To start with the lobby was super chaotic and it took them 2 hours to give us our room and to our surprise there was no bell boy to take our luggage to our rooms  Then it took us a little time to locate our rooms as we had to carry our luggage ourselves but the elevators were super fast  as we stayed on the 28th floor but it just took the elevator 20-30 seconds to reach   The room is Magnificent- big rooms big bathrooms 2 TV's one in the bed room other in the living room.nice neat clean king size bed with soft pillows decent lighting and an amazing view of the city from my window- all in all super luxurious the fridge was filled with drinks and chocolates but all on payable basis , so kindly do not take things out if you don't wish to spend on them  The grand central canal…",40
"This was our first trip to Macau and the Venetian came highly recommended. The hotel was very busy, with tourists and sight seers filling the lobby areas but check-in was fast and friendly. Our room was a long way from the lobby and we had quite a walk with our luggage but it was worth it. The suite was fantastic. It was big, bright and clean. The bed was big and comfortable. The bathroom was huge with a separate toilet. The amenities provided were decent and there were plenty of towels. There is plenty to see and do in the hotel, its not just for gamblers. There are some great restaurants, we tried Mortons, which was fantastic, Portofino, which was good and the Blue Frog which was ok. The shopping is good with international brands and a good duty free shop. The singing…",50
"Beautiful, maginificent property.....no rooms, all suites.....had our Cotai view suite on 33rd floor, mesmerising view of Cotai Strip.....picture postcard suite, all decked up beautifully.....provide free pick and drop to ferry terminals and airport.....24 hour casino.....mind-numbing decor.....everything wonderful so as to blow away your senses.....HOWEVER, overcrowded as people not staying at the hotel but just hanging around have soared in numbers over the last couple years.....result - their manpower has fallen short......for instance, the staff took half hour to bring our luggage up.....that was the only sad part of an otherwise worthwhile, memorable stay!",50
"This is my second time staying at the Venetian, and I still very much love the huge luxurious rooms and shopping at the Great Canal Shoppes. However, we did note that the standards of customer service was not the same as before. There were too many staff from the Mainland, and most of them could not understand simple English especially at the Concierge Desk, and because of that, we wasted a lot of time waiting for our turn to be served.   The last straw came when we were queuing at the hotel taxi stand to go out for dinner. As our family was in a group of five, we were thinking if we could ask the taxi driver if 5 of us are allowed in one taxi, as most of their cabs only carries 4 passengers. When it was our turn, we opened the taxi door and asked the taxi driver if he could…",40
"1. Spacious room, that is for sure. I just don't like too many textures on my bed. My personal preference is a clean white duvet, all hypo-allergenic, rather than designed pillowcases.  2. Spacious bathroom - expensive design feel.  3. Complete and extensive amenities - two televisions, discount coupons, show passes, airport shuttle, etc.  4. It was a big hotel, yet everything was well taken care of to the extent that we didn't need any staff to assist us. :)",40
"My wife and I went to Venetian Macao for our babymoon in July. It's nice place to stay, especially if you love Indian food, yet being Indians and wanting some more variety in vegetarian food--food wise, this wasnt the place for us.  It's great if you can eat Indian vegetarian (north) food for breakfast, lunch & dinner.    Personally, I wouldnt stay there again, only because, I think this hotel is more catered to a mass market crowd.  Now if you're looking for something personalized.. it's probably better to go to a small hotel, that doesnt churn out that many people a day.  Somethings were really nice though, we loved the pool.  The staff was really nice, lots of different pools, kids, hot jacuzzi style, super cold, a pool with huge slide for kids.. and another one for adults…",40
"We stayed in the Venetian this past May, not our first stay, and remain highly pleased with the consistent quality of rooms and customer service they they deliver.  The rooms remain a treat, the casino a fun experience and the canal shops a nice compliment to the total Venetian experience.   We also returned to the Venetian this past weekend to enjoy the Ice World experience, one of the exhibitions the Venetian frequently have at their Macau hotel/casino.  This was a fantastic experience for MOP100 per person, MOP 30 per coat rental.  This exhibition will remain at the Venetian until mid September this year so if you are considering a trip to Macau, make sure you find time for a stop at the Venetian for the Ice World exhibition or better yet, just stay there.   Not all is well…",40
"This resort offers a taste of Venice. Although most of the staff members are locals and Filipinos, they do not fail in delivering the friendly experience. If you are traveling with a family of 4, staying in one of the 3000 super spacious suites is sufficient with no extra bed needed! My 3 siblings and I shared a room -- 3 people on 2 bed and 1 person on the spacious sofa. We didn't want to spend so much time away from the room because it was so cozy!  The Grand Canal Shoppes is definitely a great alternative other than spending 24/7 in the casino. During sale period, branded boutiques offers great deals that are definitely cheaper than sales in Singapore, USA, Canada, Indonesia, and even slightly cheaper than HongKong (conversion rate). They also have the famous Portuguese tart…",50

No need to pay taxi, just catch free shuttle bus from West lobby to harbour and catch another hotel bus to downtown. It's totally free.  Room very big, with cozy sofa, working desk, 2 TVs, big bathroom with separate shower and bathtub.

"This was an exceptional hotel.  The staff was extremely helpful and were really nice.  The rooms were really clean, big and nice.  There are a lot of places to shop in the lobby and it also looks like Italy.  There is also a handful of entertainment and a lot of places where you can relax.",50
loved the hotel the only downfall being that the hotel is so big that you have to walk quite a bit to get to different locations. other than that  the hotel is very elegant and beautiful. the staff is very friendly and helpful. the food court has a great variety of asian food which is of a very good standard and the show ZAIA from cirque du soliel is a must see!!pity about the internet charges which in my opinion was quite expensive.,50
"The room is big.  I love the bathroom where it is huge with separate bath & shower.  There is a study room below the bedroom with its own sofa, desk & television which is kind of nice.  We had a room facing East looking at Galaxy, Crown, Hard Rock which is nice at night where the neon lights are on.  The bed & pillows are soft & comfortable.  Check-in & check-out was smooth & fast (<10 minutes).  Overall, the service & clealiness of the room is fine and as expected as a 5-star hotel.   The only bad thing I had about the room is the noise from the air-conditioning which sounds like a small engine running all the time.  It could be quite noisy when everything is so quiet.  I did not visited the pool but I heard it was great with lots of kid's area & even there are water slides.",40

"This is a fantastic hotel with so much of shopping and things to do. Rooms are huge with the basic rooms starting from 75 sq meters. The casino is huge but has one MAJOR problem which is that most staff speak chinese and almost zero english. For any problems on language the staff has to call someone who knows english in the casino. I has an argument with one of the black jack dealers when she kept trying to explain certain things in chinese. She kept on getting irritated and I kept on getting angy till a time when I almost screamed at her to stop explaining in chinese and to get someone to translate whatever she wanted to say in English. Otherwise the hotel is just outstanding with its huge shopping area, gondola rides, fabulous restaurents, etc. Indians travelling there should…",50
"Venetian Macao is an excellent getaway resort. The room is luxurious and very spacious. A very nice place to spend a quality time with your spouse. The shopping center inside the hotel is quite extensive. Good taxi service to take you around the islands.  Some possible drawbacks: lack of porter service to carry your luggages to your room, too crowded during breakfast, no free Internet in the room.",50
Stayed at the Venetian in early July 2011 with my family. There's a free shuttle at the end of the airport to get us to the hotel easily.  Checking in was a breeze. Romo was huge with a living area and 2 huge queen beds.  Over the next three days room was kept very clean by the cleaning staff. Definitely a bargain given the size to price ratio.  The only gripe is that the casino normally raises its minimum bet to about HKD300. It has been progressively increased from the previous min of HKD 200 a year back,40
"We stayed in a Royale Suite by booking their ZAIA package. It came with 2 A-tickets to their Cirque du Soleil show (ZAIA) which btw is only playing in Macau (most CDS shows are exclusive to their launch cities). It also came with buffet breakfast coupons, HK$100 (US$12.80) shopping coupon and 1-way ferry tickets to HK. All for about HK$3500 (US$450). Not a bad deal when you consider just 2 A-tickets normally cost HK$1400!  The suite: Very nice indeed. Every room at the Venetian is a suite, actually. Ours was the 2nd size up, and we opted to pay a bit more to get a Cotai View (it means your window faces the Strip where all the casinos are). Because we weren't high up and the strip is a good distance away from the hotel, we mainly saw the gold course. Still nice enough. The suite…",50
"It has everything you would expect from a 5-star casino/resort: grand rooms, a giant gambling hall, huge shopping center, top-notched restaurants, shows and entertainment, etc.  It would literally take pages to review everything in detail abt this hotel, so I'm just going to list out the pros and cons.  Pros: 1. HUGE grand suites with incredible bathrooms (makes taking dumps so much more luxurious) 2. Decent variety of restaurants and tons of shops 3. The Zaia show (excellent performance) 4. Luxury items were decently priced 5. Transportaion was convenient (free shuttles and taxis) 6. Everyone was helpful and serivce was good (some give really bad English driections though) 7. Good live music at the club/lounge 8. Festive atmosphere 9. Hot cleavage revealing working girls (they…",50
"Hi,  Macau is an excellent place if you like gambling.. and staying at Venetian Hotel is like a cherry on the cake.  Venetian Hotel is very huge and has one the biggest Gambling station. Good shopping (of the Branded products) can be done in the hotel itself.   The only problem at the Venetian is that at the lobby you get lot of smell (believe Kitchen should be very nearby)  But the overall experience is excellent and would love to visit the place again after a year or so.",40
"One of the Best Properties in Asia , Especially the venice theme and not to forget the ""Gondola"" , great hospitality and the ZAIA Show was a great experience . The food and beverage was mind blowing. The stay at the place which I will never forget and will back .I`ll recommend the same to others looking out for a lifetime experience.",50
"To sit and eat in an indoor hall feeling like you are in Venice, overwatching a gondola passing by? Is it possible? In theory no, but in reality YES! This amazing hotel complex offers something outragesly strange and facinating, that is hard to find anywhere else. After checking in, you get a map to find your hotel room... Needed? YES! It is mega-big. You pass through a ""play-ground"" which feels like the whole of Las Vegas. Must be heaven for people who likes gambling (I do not). I suppose you could stay in the complex for days/weeks/months without having to even start feeling that you need to go anywhere else, thanks to the outdoor pool area, which is unbelievable in itself, like the rest of this fiction copy-cat of Venice!",50
"The venetian is simply enormous. The biggest resort we have ever been to. You will get fit walking around this place. We stayed for 5 days which was possibly a bit too long as we did not come here to use the casinos, rather to rest and hang out by the pools. If you are not doing the casinos a 2-3 day stay is enough. The pools were nice and we enjoyed relaxing poolside in the hot summer weather, although for the size of the resort itself, they could have had more pools to use as they got crowded at peak times. The venetian canals were simply amazing. It was like a Disneyland theme world. The venetian street performers added some atmosphere to the over-exaggerated luxury shopping. We got the breakfast passport which meant we could eat in 3 designated restaurants or have room…",40
"Stayed there with my husband and young toddler. The rooms were really huge...even my 2yr old was impressed by the size. It was a proper suite with a sunken living room, separate toilet, tub and shower. The service was excellent. They also provide free bottled water as there are no convenience stores around. My son loved Ice World and the cirque de soleil show is definitely worth watching. If you must go to Macau...do not leave without seeing this show.   The one thing I did not like though was the smell of cigarette smoke. I've stayed in other casino hotels but this one just reeks of smoke. We stayed at the non-smoking floor but even the corridors there smelled. They also had an ashtray in the room which was strange because it was a non-smoking room (there was even a non-smoking…",40
"The Venetian Macao continues to improve.  We were able to take advantage of many great ""new"" restaurants in the surrounding casinos and enjoyed our usual HUGE suite!  The sleep quality at this hotel is one of the best in the world.  The comfort of the surroundings and luxurious bedding were a welcome site!  Our son fell down an escalator during our stay and was treated very professionally by the staff at the Malo Clinic (inside the Venetian/Four Seasons complex).  He ended up needing sutures and we were grateful for the response of their medical team.  Since we aren't gamblers, I would highly recommend taking a stroll over to the Fish Spa to experience a ""strange,"" yet wonderful foot treatment . . . as always, I would recommend the Venetian to anyone visiting Macao.",50

"Venetian is not the ordinary hotel experience one would expect. It's good for MICE or leisure travelers interested in an adult theme park type of accommodation, but it is no luxury resort or business hotel.  Great:  Separate living area great for meetings Large room, plenty of storage space 5-piece large bathroom Good choice of tea, including caffeine-free option Nice job of cleaning, turn-down service only upon request though. Power supply inside safe Synthetic pillow inside closet.  Concern:  Amenity is generally basic. No fancy cables, Nespresso  nor bedside controls in most suites.

"We spent 3 nights here and 2 days in a suite called the royale suite. Loved the amenities in the suite. The room is large about 70 sq mtrs and very luxurious. The bathroom is good, the shower and the bath are excellent. A big + for the room  Ambience is great. If iceworld is on, do not miss it. It is quite delightful. The casino is unbelievable and fun.   To go to other casinos, use free buses or cotai connect buses. If going to casinos other than sands in macao, go to macao ferry using venetian bus and change there to other casino buses. Well organised and runs efficiently. Specially useful for families. For the romantics who may never get to the real Venice, enjoy  your Gondola ride here. The Gondoliers sing and sing well !!!  Negatives : Check in is a nightmare. Long queues.…",50
"We took the shuttle bus from the airport to the Venetian. The weather was sweltering, so it was nice to get on a cool bus and even nicer to get inside the cool lobby. Because loads of people were arriving, the lobby area was crammed with a long line to check-in. However, with plenty of people to service the crowd, check-in only took about 15 minutes and was quite efficient.  The hotel is enormous so you need a map to find where your room is. Fortunately, good signs along the way help to find where you're going. All of the rooms are suites and ours had a very nice sunken living room, large bedroom area, and large bathroom. The decor is Italian and tasteful. There were two televisions in the suite, along with a desk area...alas we had to pay for the Internet. That really should be…",40

"Stayed here with my mom & sis for one night while we were in Macau.  Venetian was great! although sometimes there seems to be too much going on, especially in the lobby areas.  Service was so-so. Nothing fantastic or memorable. Room however, was amazing. It was huge. It was also extremely clean. The bathroom was hugeeee, so were the beds. Slept like a baby really. Only thing missing is the free wi-fi. For such a fancy hotel, there was none. Just wished we could have stayed here for a couple more days! but there really isn't much to do in macau, the very next day we were off to HK.",50

The hotel provided a free shuttle service to drop us from Ferry terminal to hotel.Well here is my experience. 1)It was like a market in hotel premises and inside lobby full of tourist. Outside guest came to visit hotel(as there are other attractions excluding hotels) added to chaos and made us feel like we are in wrong place. 2)As normal you can't expect the kind of politeness & elegance from Chinese  staffs, so be prepared for it. Fluency in English is a problem one have to regularly deal with , but not an issue. 3)the room was huge, clean, in-order, and everything you desire for. really good. 4)other attractions like casino, pool, ice world, zaia show , pups , others are good and will keep the tourist engaged and wanting them…",40

Stayed in Venetian Macao Resort Hotel for a night with family in June 2011. The hotel is huge and we chose the Realto Suite with city view. There were two rooms in the suite and both very big. There were two bathrooms. The highlight of the hotel is the Cirque de Soleil show which should not be missed. The hotel also has an impressive ice world. Of course there are lot of gambling options in the hotel which we decided to pass as were were with children. The hotel has an impressive array of shops. The hotel offers free shuttle service to and from the ferry terminals.,50
"Venetian Resort Macau, It's A Full City In Itself, Having The Biggest Casino In The World. We Feel Like As If We Are A King A Staying In A Big Palace. I Found No Problems In Any Department Of The Resort. Even We Had Some Indian Vegetarian Dishes. I Feel If Anybody Is Going To Macau He Should Definitely Stay At Venetian Resort For Atleast 3 Nights.",50
"Room's huge. Large bathroom, living room, bedroom, surprisingly iron & ironing board provided. You can check in earlier than the stipulated time. We checked in at 1pm and was given a detail map of the hotel & its facilities. Great place to shop, all big brands can be found here. MacDonald's & Lord Stow bakery outlet in the mall too.   The place is so huge that we keep getting lost and cons you need to walk at 15-20m mins to get from shopping mall to shuttle bus bay. Shuttle service is very completed, even covers shuttle bus to Galaxy where you can take another shuttle service from Galaxy to Taipa (small little town).   Love the swimming pools and inhouse facilities.   Unfortunately no free WIFI.",50

"Back again at the Venetian and must say the condition after 2 years is still perfect.Large rooms with great ammenities and the bathroom is also very comfortable.Check in takes some time but not too bad, only negative thing is the huge distances you have to go before entering your room.But ok you don,t need work out anymore.All by all a great quality place , will return for sure",40
"It was my daughter's first international trip and her first Rakhi(festival in India) in this world.My husband planned for a hongkong n Macau trip.He had stayed in Venetian Macau before and he was so impressed that he wanted us to enjoy the luxury &  ambience too.We(me , my husband and our 2 kids) stayed there for 2 days, first day we just wandered around the property.Its very well maintained.Hotel is really very beautiful.Those paintings on cielings are just awesome.Its a huge place and you  need a seperate complete day to just look around the whole hotel without indulging into activities.Reaching Venetian was easy as their own pick n drop coaches are available at ferry terminals and service is really good.We enjoyed Gondola ride within the hotel,the man who was rowing the…",40
"Checking in was a breeze. We stayed here for 2 nights and was amazed by the beautiful design of the huge hotel and specially our room which had 2 beds, 2 tvs, business desk and very comfortable atmosphere. Toilet and baths were very clean and neat. Sadly the Wifi is not free and the casino and lobbys are reeking with second hand smoke which is a turn off. We also saw some people spitting in the beautiful carpet in the casino (maybe too much bad luck?!).  After these 3, we couldn't ask for more. The sumptious breakfast buffet has a wide array of food cultures and very satisfying indeed.  Also took the gondola ride, amazing powerful voice of the gondola singer. Checking out also was fast if you didn't get anything from the mini-bar. I will be back.",40
"Stayed in Venetian last year with friends and this year with my parent. The moment they step in the hotel (Entrance from the shuttle bus area), you can see their feeling ""okay, it's big hotel"". The moment they step in the room ""my god! it's soooooooooooo big!"" hahaha.. This is what i'm expecting all day.   Yes, standard room in venetian is 75sqm and most of the people will be so surprise with it. We stayed in 31st floor facing ""City of Dreams"" and you have to bend a little bit so to see the mini golf at 5th floor.  We don't gamble, but we do enjoy the show Zaia very much. 360 degree view of the show makes it so unique and fantastic.   It's a good place for relaxing or meeting friends. Do not hesitate if you are not on budget. My personal feeling Venetian Macao is the best hotel…",50
"What a place to be...Venetian makes Macau complete! It has a touch of Las Vegas, Venice, New York, Iceland and off course India..you just fall in love the moment you entre the lobby. Great gambling area, spread emaculately! Rooms are just much more than the value you pay for...truely a royal treatement. Candola ride and the charming singer who rows it, make the 30-minutes ride memorable. Shops are expensive but thats what you expect at such a place! Very friendly and courteous staff all around!",50
"We booked this hotel based on reviews on trip advisor and recommendations from friends. This hotel is the biggest hotel that we have ever stayed in – its enormous! This hotel has thousands of suites, a shopping centre – two concert arenas & casino. This would be the Disney would Florida if we were comparing theme parks.   The casino is located at the ground floor of the hotel and has a variety of different gambling tables.   Pro’s   •	Free bus transfer from the ferry port & airport to the hotel & back   •	Suites are large with bedroom & living area  •	Bathrooms are massive – bath separate shower, separate sinks  •	5 – 6 TV channels in English – a couple of movie channels & comedy channel  •	Large safe in room that will fit Laptops and more  •	Large Casino about the size of 2 – 3…",50
"We stayed there for 2 nights. The hotel was fabulous!! I don't have words to describe it. We stayed in Royal Suite. It was luxurious-2 canopy draped beds, sunken living room, study table ....what all and what not !!Roaming around in the hotel was much better than the city tour. Do have a gondola ride when in Venetian...It’s a different experience all together...I simply loved my stay at Venetian Macau :)",50
"First and foremost the gondola ride for which venetian hotels are famous for!!! its very very romantic perfect for a couple in love ! the gondola ride staff is also helpful !! the shops in the hotel connectivity to four seasons shopping stores !! directions, staff, offers are fabulous! connectivity to the city thru the hotel bus is a boon!",40
"We stayed here for two nights, and totally enjoyed the rooms and service of  Venetian, Macao.  The rooms were spacious and the bathroom was huge. Totally a Las Vegas style room.  The bed was comfortable, and the malls had plenty to offer for those who did not gamble as much.  I would definitely stay here again the next time i am in macao.  However, there are some cons to staying in the Venetian. First, the breakfast was really awful,  and the service was terrible. Food selection was a lot, but everything tasted bland, as if they only cared about the quantity and not the quality of food. Not something you would expect in a place like this!! I finished the first round of food and went to the buffett line to get seconds. When i returned to my table, everything had been cleaned off,…",40
Checking into the hotel with 3000 suite rooms is a challenge despite its multiple lobbies. Avoid arriving at the hotel before 1 pm. We were very fortunate to book an ICE package which included the Zaia show and visited the ICE exhibition. The 350 shops and singing gondolier in an authentic gondola in the grand canals were awesome. The Zaia is authentic extravaganza acrobatic show. There are two banks of elevators to the suite rooms 7 to 25 floors and the other set from the 26 floor upwards. Helpful hint - take a room overlooking the cotai-strip with seven hotels group and the macau airport in the background. Water bottles are costly so pickup water supply at the ferry terminal itself. We stayed on the 31st floor in a split level bella suite room overlooking the hotels and the…,40
It was our first trip to Macau & trip to Venetian was indeed a memorable one.The reception was really really crowded but the line for check in moved fast.After the initial waiting to check in.....the rest of the visit was a dream.The rooms were huge and split across 2 levels.The overall look of the room was indeed royal.The hotel has many options for food and shopping.We actually never stepped out of the property during our 2 day stay there ! The entertainment options are great and alot for the kids.Dont miss the gondola ride and the street entertainment that keep happening on the various shopping levels.,40
"It is a one stop entertainment Hotel. You can find a big casino, Gondola ride, huge shopping arcade, dozens of restaurant, children area, and of course relaxation. The resort is so big, so you have to use a hotel map to get to your suite. It's a bit pricey, but it's worth it. There's a hotel transfer in and out to the international airport for free. It's the best I've ever stayed in.",50
"Hardware is unbeatable and amazing.  The hotel's decor, scale, facilities are gorgeous.  Pictures (it's not painting I believe) on ceiling imitating the Italian ones are jaw dropping.  It's fun to spend a whole day there, shopping, walking, eating, and of course bet in the large scale casino if it's your thing.  There are theaters where performances or concerts are held.  We stayed in the Belle suite for one night.  It's on 31st Floor, excellent views facing the Galaxy hotel complex which lights up in golden colour at night.  About the room inside, everything excellent though I regret to say that it had already started running down and tired due to heavy use by flocks of guests.  There are 2 washing basins, 2 TV sets in our suite.  Bed comfy, you got everything you want (though…",50
"How does one describe a hotel experience which is so awesome and mind-blowing that it leaves you asking for more? Where in the world will you get hotel rooms which are at least 3 times larger than other hotels in the world? And this too in Macao, next to Hong Kong, where space is at a premium and rooms are so small that you always want more…  The Venetian is a different experience all together. Breath-taking, fantastic, knocks you out of your socks when you enter the hotel. Huge lobby, with bigger reception for check in (never seen such a big reception and so many queues for check-in). Over 3000 rooms and later we came to know that they had another check-in and reception at the far end of the hotel.   Efficient service in terms of check-in, clear instruction on how to reach your…",50
"This place is like a world in itself we had the best 3 days of our lives i guess inside this place its huge, massive and i am sure one cannot see the whole place in 3-4 days of stay the check in procedure is a little bit crazy with a lot of confusion at the front desk, but once you find the right way its all good the rooms are humongous, its all fully equipped and very choice-fully done up interiors the rooms are perfect for people on business or on a holiday it has a separate living room and bedroom so basically every room is like a suite the beds are extremely comfortable so after a big night of gambling that is the most ideal thing one looks for apart from the huge and lovely casino its shopping center is amazing and one should not miss the gondola ride is can go on about…",50
"Absolutely fantastic hotel. The rooms are huge and has comfortable beds, clean, spacious and pure luxury. I have never seen a hotel so huge and yet so well maintained. They have so many pools, the eating places are great and the atmosphere is always a buzz. Great shops and the Canal and the Gondolas and the Gondoliers add to the atmosphere. I would love to go back there with my family and the cost of the hotel is not that great in comparison to what you get in return. Yes there is a line at reception but the staff there do their best to serve you as fast as they can. Yes its a place that is full of people but all of them are there to enjoy this fantastic place. Its full of life and such a great place to be...cant wait to go there again.",50
"anyone going to Macau should stay there once  its beautifully made with shopping and food and lot of fun, venice in Macau is venetian....... roof of d hotel seems like a beautiful sky with rainy clouds, granite polished to look like wet everywhere but its not!! opera singers and a fairy tale river flowing inside something you can just imagine is what is venetian all about.  i was here for two days and couldn't leave my hotel for even a city tour, everything i enjoyed inside and nothing can be better than this.  casino was d d best,  my room was a 'verona suite room' and the size does matter, it was a huge room with two queen bed two tv two bathroom enough for a family to live comfortably.  i m vegetarian and food was the only problem here, although there were huge food courts…",50
Venetian Macau is one of the top 3 hotels in Macau. i would love to stay with Venetian again if i am back in Macau. the 2 queen beds is simply enough for a family of 4 to 6.  hotel check in staff very friendly and helpful. kudos to them for keeping the smile on their face even though there are like tons of people checking in during that period of time.   the only fault i could fault Venetian is the way the free shuttle bus's drivers behavior and  attitudes. was put off by how they behave towards hotel guest like me and my friends onboard the coach.,50
Amazing experience. Perfect place to stay with family. Rooms are very spacious. Facilities are all world class.,50
The hotel had big rooms. The bathroom had a full size dressing area attached. The room  had sofa-bed at no additional cost. This was overall a very comfortable and plush suite.The hotel staff was very helpful and service was prompt.   Its too easy to get lost in the hotel property. High end shopping options are plenty. The hotel has various multi cuisine restaurants if you are willing to walk. This hotel is a holiday destination in itself. This is recommended for anyone looking for a luxurious stay.,40
"The hotel,the rooms are excellent ,the view and the hotel itself is  so vast its like all in one beautifullllllllllllllll.It is the perceptive and friendly service that makes it worthwhile staying . It is a place you would definitely come back to and recommend to your friends. Thank you very much for making our stay so pleasant!!! The hotel itself h as all the branded showrooms within the hotel .The largest casinos tooo",50
"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Venetian.  We were very impressed with the rooms.  The decor is lovely and they are very spacious.    They currently have the exhibit ""Ice World"" which I believe runs until September.  This contained ice sculptures of landmarks around the world.  It was stunning as well as a lot of fun.  It was a favourite for our entire family.  The Gondola ride is very much like you would expect in Venice although perhaps a tad shorter - time wise.    There are many stores available if you would like to shop.    The pools are reasonable, especially if you have younger children as they are not very deep (about 1.2m).   Although I did travel with my children (12 and 9), I appreciated the fact that they had a pool for adults only.  Breakfast at Cafe Deco was…",50

But first day been starved, because we didn't find money change office in hotel, finally we did change at reception and happy and...",50
"If you're looking for the type of hotel where you could check in for a week and never have to leave the Venetian is the place.  Whether you are looking for relaxation (pool, golf), food (tons of restaurants), gambling, or even shows and entertainment (Cirque du Soleil), this is a great place.  The all suite rooms are great for a bit of extra space and the service is always good.  I wouldn't say the Venetian is the ultimate in luxury, but it is a great 5 star hotel where you are sure to have a good time.    The only potential downside is the resort is MASSIVE.  When you check in they will give you a map to find your way around the property!  It is actually quite easy to get lost.  :)",40
"I went to Hong Kong and Macau on a 4N/5D trip with my office friends organized by Thomas & Cook. We were booked for 3 nights in Hong Kong and 1 night in Macau. We were booked us in Venetian in Macau and it was the place to stay. The best part of the entire trip has been Venetian.  Luxury at its best. Hotel or Mall !!! The rooms were simply fantastic, with all facilities that one can expect plus many more which is simply out of imagination. Great view, spacious room, comfortable beds and sofa, ultra modern washroom, beautiful interior. Though we ate Indian foods in Honk Kong in 3 different hotels but the Indian food served in Venetian was simply superb. I would of given 10 out of 10 on all parameters, be it variety or look or temperature control, or taste. It was delicious.  One…",50
"This a must visit plave during ones visit to Honkong.  The resort houses a massive casino, Golf course, children's play area, a number of swimming pools and huge shopping malls.  This also has regular shows like the ICE WORLD which showcases minitures made out of ICE.",50
"In the world of big hotels, Venetian would probably be right up there in the top 10, the size of the property is simply amazing and the interiors are very well done. We stayed here only for 1 night as we were on a business trip in HK. We booked a Cotai view suite and boy we weren't disappointed with our decision one bit. The view at night after the other hotels light up is pretty amazing. The property itself is well organized and looks very much like Venice including the Rialto, they even have a gondola ride!!  If you don't mind spending that little bit more for staying on the Cotai side then Venetian is definitely worth a look",40
We stayed there for 2 nights.  It is a huge place.  We arrived from HK by the ferry and there are free shuttle services to the hotel.  There was no help at the shuttle service and we had to load our bags into the bus overselves.  But once we reached the hotel our bags were collected and tagged.  We did check in a bit early (about 2 hrs).  There is a queque but many counters and friendly staff.  The hotel is really huge.  We were on the 12th floor and it had an amazing  cotai view.  There is a large food court on the 2nd level with all kinds of cuisine.  Plenty of bakeries and coffee shops too.   All types of garments and accessories are available at the shops including precious and semi-precious stones. There is a mcdonald at a far end where we did have breakfast.  An indian…,50
"I visited Macau in August  2010, along with my family and family friends. We stayed at Venetian, Macau for 3 nights. Well to start with this hotel is truly the ""Las Vegas of the East"" and a "" Shoppers Paradise"" (expensive though)  The USP of this hotel is the courteous staff ,the plush interiors, gondola ride and shopping. The Venetian has only suites to offer to its guests. To begin with there are hotel buses making multiple rounds at all the hot spots of Macau to ferry their guests to and fro the hotel free of cost. The parking area of the hotel looks like a heritage structure with ancient paints on the ceilings. The hotel is huge. Infact huge is an under statement for the hotel. The interiors of the hotel are super plush and very well maintained. The lobby has their ceilings…",50
Bought a royal suite overlooking the kotai strip on the recommendation of my agent. One of the best hotels of the world. Has 6 swimming pool with different themes and temperature. The casino is huge and treat from every visitor. Arc de soliel show was fantastic. Great theme activities within this huge hotel. Sligtly pricy but worth it.,50

"Stayed at this hotel from 10th to 12th May. Must say, this property is fabulous by any standards. The rooms are huge with fantastic interiors. They have a fantastic shopping arcade with most top brands available; its bigger than some of the malls we saw in Hongkong. The food court has amazing variety. Gondola boat rides beneath artificial sky within the hotel are not to be missed. The casino is huge & time just flies. They even have a kids play area which my kid never wanted to leave, one has to pay for it though.  The Spa is very nice for relaxation, a bit pricey. If planning for Macau, this is must stay.",40
"During March 2011 my family & i stayed at this huge hotel for 2 nights. The property was magnificient, rooms huge, meal choices enormous. We had to wait for a couple of hours for the room after checking in - this was a downer, but once we got our room we enjoyed the hotel to its fullest. There is a big food court with a wide selection of cuisines for those on a budget. There is a nice selection of restaurants and we enjoyed the thai food at Mango tree. The mall housing the shops is huge and you require two days to navigate and look through the shops. The casino was also huge and sure tempts you to try your luck. Overall a lovely hotel which we would love to try again.",50
"Its a destination by itself...You wont feel like going out from the place...food Courts,best of shopping and not to mention the Casino which is the size of two olympic stadiums..The suite only hotel is ultra luxurious...Everything rocks..",50
"Great rooms, clean and big with friendly and fast service.    If you are a gambler and while in the casino, don't mind a bit of cigarette smoke, occasional pushy Mainlander or a few solicitations from the ladies of the night, then this place is for you!  Lots of tables, slots, you name it, they have it.    If you are into staying indoors, shopping and mediocre food, but lots of it, then this place is for you.  You can pretty much go to the Venetian and never step outside into the hot and muggy June air until the day you check out to go home.  This is not our way to spend a vacation but for a business meeting such as this trip, it was by all means, excellent.  As for food, a quick bite at the food court is fine but I still preferred a normal restaurant in the city center.  As for…",40

"I was not too impressed with the hotel as it boasts and looks for comparison with Las Vegas.  The check in is a real issue and severely delayed.  The staff is not well informed on airline partners.  i think the annoying part was that Wi Fi is chargeable, where today everywhere you go it is free.  I see the point the hotel wants you to gamble.  As for entertainment the shows were great, and shopping is not only convenient there is also variety, but i would rather go to Vegas first then to come back here.",40
"Hi,  We really liked our stay at Macau, we felt it was our second honeymoon. Venetian went out of its way to give us a royal treatment. The beautiful royal shopping arcade and Gondola ride was fabulous. We couldn't have asked for more.  Natasha",50
amazing hotel. worth staying. No words to explain. just go and stay there to know.... u will definitly enjoy.......... best of luck!!!! amazing hotel. worth staying. amazing hotel. worth staying amazing hotel. worth staying,50
If you are not in Vegas...then the Venetian at Macau is the place to be in. The hotel stands tall by itself in Macau.  The check in fast. The rooms are really cool and with a view... opt for a higher floor for complete value for money.  The Gondola ride(with in the hotel) is expensive and not worth the money spent. The casino is where you want to be... every moment is worth it.  The rooms are very nicely done and the bathroom amenities are pretty neat.  It is a complete value for money...  Try booking early.... they give you an early booking discount... and booking through tripadvisor is recommended.... they get you a good rate....,50

Most of the shops were closed . As we entered from the west lobby of the Venetian , I was stunned with the marvellous interiors of the Hotel . My friend gave me the Map of Venetian and it was like a city inside the city , with a lake inside the hotel . I have never seen a lake inside the hotel before . It was mesmerising , the boat ride with the artificial view of the sky on the top .    While searching for the room we filt like treasure hunters .The room could adjust 10 people , it was that big .

"The first impression you get here is of the number of people! Its absolutely huge and super-crowded. We had to stand in a roped in queue to check-in! The other negative is that when we were checking out we had to wait for over an hour for someone to come get our baggage, but despite numerous calls, no one came and eventually we had to carry it ourselves, which was difficult as we were traveling with a child. On the plus side, when we checked in, for $90 a night we could upgrade to a Rialto suite, which came with a number of perks such as free activities and free ferry transport back to Hong Kong. The casino is huge and there are enough activities to keep you occupied for days. The canals created by the hotel are absolutely beautiful, but a bit confusing to navigate. Overall, a…",50

stayed in the hotel for 1 night. the room are all suites and huge.The bed.the linen  and all the ameneties were upto the mark of a 7 star luxury hotel .It was a superb experience.The bathrooms are fantastic and the view from the room was just amazing as we would see the whole harbour of macau. They have promotions and was a very good experience to stay in venetian and would stay again without any doubt.,50
"Very good property. Very nice rooms. The experience was great good, very good shops and casino. Food court and restaurants were very good. Loved it! The casino had variety of entertainment going on which was nice. Oh and the new Poker room at the casino is a must go. Its a bit  away from Macau town on Taipa I think, 40 mins by taxi which is not so bad.",50
The hospitality at the hotel was mind-blowing with casinos all around. The night-life was great during my stay there for around 3 nights.  The hotel had its own cab-service which made it easier for me to go around. Food and drinks were awesome.,50
"The Hotel is huge. The property is very well maintained and beautifully done. I loved the hotel and if i ever went back to Macau, i would definately stay at the Venetian again.

- i was blown away by the massiveness of the Venetian.  this is the first time i've booked a hotel this huge and this busy.  But what was amazing is the capability of the staff to cope with all the activities that's going on.  check in was fast and crisp with perfect instruction on how to navigate the hotel.  even room service was served on time.  The rooms a huge.  a Family of 5 can fit comfotably in one Bella suite.   What i didn't like was the smell of smoke from the gambling area and the number of people.  Venetian is part of every tourist's itinerary so expect lots of people walking in and out.  Indeed it takes a whole day to navigate the whole place and expect a lot of walking and getting lost.  trying to find the main lobby can be a chore the first time around. …,40
"Staying at The Venetian felt like a luxury. The rooms (""suites"") are very spacious, with 2 queen-sized beds in the sleeping area and a separate living room.  The bathroom is very elegant too.  Everything you see in the website is true.   While in this hotel, one gets tempted not to explore the rest of Macau. There is just so much to do. There's a lot of eating choices. Going around the maze of shops can take days. We also went on the gondola ride. (Tip: The first gondola station coming from the main lobby tends to have long lines. But there are other gondola stations, usually with shorter queues.) A lot of stores were on sale when we were there and we got some good deals on clothes and bags.   If you do decide to leave the hotel, there are other places nearby worth visiting. We…",40
We stayed at the Bella suite located at the south wing of the hotel  The room was great. It was very big.   The view outside the window was the only problem. There was nothing good to see.  The hotel was great. You can shop all day. It will take you a minimum of 2 days to fully enjoy your stay.  It's like being in Venice yet your in china hehe cool...  Had fun.  ,50
"We are an Expat family living in China and have taken an R&R break three times to Macau.  This time our 19 year old son joined us.  We booked a standard room (Bella) and upgraded to a suite for 600HKD and it was WORTH IT.  We booked the ""Ice Package"" on Agoda.Com which offered a significant discount from the Venetian prices.  The package (available until Sept 2011) offered free tickets to Ice World (a fun diversion to wander around the Ice Sculptures and we did a ice cold Vodka shot at the end).  The package also included the Acrobat show and breakfast at the Blue Frog - great value - great food.  As for gambling - the tables at the Venetian are high stakes.  A 5 minute walk away is the Hard Rock hotel & casino.  Great music, no crowds, and tables with minimums that are half the…",40
When in Macao you want to be in a classic hotel and the Venetian Macao is just about it. We went there with kids and seniors and had a great time. Their in house kids club called Qube is an excellent child entertainment facility. The pools are also fantastic. The hotel is very new and doesnt smell like its Vegas cousin (its only 4 yrs old in 2011) and is well maintained. The breakfast buffet has three options the biggest spread being the most chaotic in their cafe. The hotel also shows the cirque du soleil show 'Zaia' which is the best Crique show I have ever seen in my life and is a must must see for everyone. The food options are ample and its just convenient to be here. I got a massage at the spa and its quite an unreal spa & the staff is very skilled.,40
"We had heard alot about this and were not sure if we would be let down - we weren't. No matter what you hear about - you will be truly awe struck once yoiu see this property.  They have free airport shuttles. Although massive in size, they have 4 huge check in counters in each direction which makes checking in a breeze. The suite upgrade recommended to us at check in was totally worth it.   The room was one of the best rooms I've ever stayed in. The facilities like restaurants, casinos, theatres, shopping, venetian canal are all an experience for the senses.  What really struck me is how these huge propertiers are run so efficiently - truly a management lesson.  The Bad - being a huge property, u need a map to get around, we often got lost :(.  Plus language is a major poroblem…",50
"This is the best hotel I've stayed at in Macau.  The suites are very big and huge, spacious bathrooms all done in style.  Casino and walking mall similar to Las Vegas.  The nightclub attached to the hotel was kind of a weird space.  Seemed like an afterthought;  however, the band that played there was amazing.  The restaurants outside the mall were a bit overpriced IMO.  Only downside was we couldn't get tickets to Cirque d Soleil.  They were sold out during the whole busy season.",50
"The Venetian Macao is the biggest hotel that I ever stayed in. It has huge suites and they have really made a good replica of Venice. Everything that you need or want to do is there at the Hotel itself whether it is shopping, casinos, night life, etc. We had taken a Rialto Suite and it was huge and really spacious (almost the size of an apartment). Service is excellent. The only negative would be the crazy crowds in the hotel all the time and especially at the lobby. There is no place to sit at all in the lobby and if your check-in takes time then it is difficult to keep standing with all the luggage and the maddening crowd.  Overall, this is a place to stay at least once in a lifetime for everyone.",50
Hello  One cannot express the experience of staying in Venetian Macao Hotel. The rooms are very spacious & beautiful. The bathrooms were big & very clean. They have amazing food in their Food Court. No words for shopping ... I stayed there for 2 days & could not see the big shopping arcade they have in the hotel. The vegetarians may face some problem of getting good food ... but it's paradise for meat lovers. My advise is not go to any Casino ... They have the biggest & plush casino. Thanks,50
"You can't really fault the rooms - they're large, very well appointed (if a little gaudy) and comfortable. But I can't stand the place. I hate huge hotels - and this is one of the biggest. My wife likes a gamble (hey, she's from HK) and is always getting free stays (which is the only reason we go here), so I shouldn't grumble too much but I still do. My top tip: for breakfast, avoid Cafe Deco like the plague. It's way too large and busy (and the food is pretty crap too). Instead, head for Blue Frog just round the corner. Good massages can be had at the Malo Spa. Will I return? Yes - but only if it's free.",40
"It's our first time in Macau and though The Venetian is an expensive hotel to stay in, we decided to stay there just to be able to say we've experienced it.  And what an experience it was!  Beautiful hotel, awesome interiors, very spacious rooms, good service, lots and lots to do.  Shopping was the best.  Food was quite expensive though, even in the food court.  Location is not the best as it is quite far from the peninsula, but the free shuttle buses provided by The Venetian make it very convenient to travel back and forth.  To save on cab fare when going somewhere in the peninsula, you can take the free bus to Sands and just take a cab from there.  You can also take the bus to City of Dreams and from there take the free shuttle to other hotels in the peninsula such as MGM.  We…",50
"This is simply BRILLIANT. With 70sq m, my room is very spacious and lux. The luxurious bed and bath room made ​​me feel treated like a king, hahaha...   Many outstanding restaurants, cool grand canal shops, casino, excellent swimming pool. Woow, i just very impressed with that. I think it will takes more than two days for us to explore this hotel.  Then, i think i will come back to stay at this hotel again with my wife... :D :D :D",50
"Extravagance, loads of shopping, attractions, food, dining, lots of gambling, BIG, tons of hotel facilities - just some of the words and thoughts that come to mind after staying in this place. Abit soulless though if coming back from visiting Macau's great historical landmarks and streets.",40
"We went to the Venetian because it came highly recommended by friends, but maybe this was not the place for us as gambling and shopping was not the reason for our stay - but it is hard to fault the hotel for this. The hotel revolves around gambling and shopping - though the pools are also nice  We booked a Rialto suite but upgraded ourselves to an even bigger suite upon check-in. The suite was fantastic, nice entry hall, huge living room, huge bedroom, one amazing bathroom with jacuzzi, triplet showers and a total of 3 tv's just in this bathroom. Then the suite also had an additional toilet and our very own room kitted to be like a cinema...  The view from the 37 floor was great, but the windows were filthy dirty on the outside, I understand it can be hard to clean on that…",40
My daughters and I stayed in the Bella Suite at the Venetian and it was wonderful. The suite was the cheapest of our travels throughout China and by far the best. Although it was Easter and very busy the place was immaculate and staff were excellent.,50
"We stayed here in Early April.  What a fantastic hotel.  I was concerned with some of the earlier reviews I read about how busy check in is (half hour waits etc) and how far away the pool etc is from the rooms and I must say that although that is true, it is not as far as what I was expecting and check in was quick and efficient. They have a mini golf course on the roof, A Man United soccer experience, Fantastic shops and street performers walking around and about 4 or so swimming pools, plus a kids centre and the gondolas.   Alll in all there was plenty to do here to keep teenage children occupied. The Suites were fantastic, Room service quick and good food. Would highly recommend and would love to go back.",50
"Has a great ambience.. Tries to recreate the magic of  Venice - perfect with Gondolas et al . Rooms need better maintainence other wise it would be prefect.. Concierge very helpful.. A one - Stop shop .. It's great for a fun - filled holiday but if you are looking for some quiet , this is not the place . As busy as a railway station",50
"Truly a 7-star hotel with a 7-star experience is what I would say about this hotel. Had the best time here with my wife and kid. The set of 6 swimming pools at different temperatures is one of its kind. The golf course on 7th floor is mind-blowing. Casino does not need an explanation. It's best in the world and the biggest in the world.  The show at ZAIA theatre was brilliant. Nothing in the world can match the Grand Canal Shoppee at Venetian. Beautifully designed roof and the gondola ride are just too good. The attractions at this place are just too many!! if you go to Macau, and don't go to Venetain you have missed something in life.",50
"We had heard alot about this and were not sure if we would be let down - we weren't. No matter what you hear about - you will be truly awe struck once yoiu see this property.  They have free airport shuttles. Although massive in size, they have 4 huge check in counters in each direction which makes checking in a breeze. The suite upgrade recommended to us at check in was totally worth it.   The room was one of the best rooms I've ever stayed in. The facilities like restaurants, casinos, theatres, shopping, venetian canal are all an experience for the senses.  What really struck me is how these huge propertiers are run so efficiently - truly a management lesson.  The Bad - being a huge property, u need a map to get around, we often got lost :(.  Plus language is a major poroblem…",50
One of the finest property in the world. Best place to stay & business center & chill-out in south Asia region.                                                                                                                                                  .,50
"Check-in was smooth as always in this hotel. We were escorted to our room as we stayed in a larger, Rialto Suite.  The Rialto Suite is a spacious suite of 170sqm comprising of a large entrance hallway, a guest powder room, a large living and dinning area with work desk and  kitchenette a separate bedroom, a dressing room and a large marble bathroom with separate bath and shower. The room furbished with inexpensive fittings and the marble walls in the bathroom are not real marble.  The 'In-Suite Dinning'  for dinner is very good, there are a wide range of choices. The in-room breakfast is also very good and they even offer a wonderful Japanese Breakfast Set.   ABF costs HK$180.   The Portofino restaurant located in an area between the Zaia theatre and the Four Seasons Hotel is a…",40
"It was an extremely pleasant surprise to have checked into The Venetian Macao Resort Hotel The room is extremely comfortable that we could have cut short the stay in HongKong and spent the rest of the 3 days in Macau instead. The room is well designed and the service is great. Large rooms and well equipped with the amenities that you can imagine. Great for the folks and children. The hotel has such a variety of Shopping and good foods. Well designed and assessable to and from the Ferry Terminal with their free transportation and well planned network. Money well spent and we have a great time at Venetian. Highly Recommended. The room is as nice and cozy as shown on the picture itself... big rooms, luxurious bathrooms and a spacious living space in the room... Staffs are polite,…",50
"Venetian re-defines the terms 'self-sufficiency' and 'luxury'. Everything about the Hotel is grand. The Hotel actually has an in-house map that enables its residents to work their way through the property. It has a mini golf course, an almost throughout the day shuttle, huge shopping complex (with all the big brands therein such as Zara, etc.), swimming pools and spa, entertainment shows, a humongous casino and the food at the Irish pub McSorley's is to die for even for a vegetarian! To top it all its an all suite hotel :-)",50
"Stayed here twice. The first one was with my husband and the 2nd was with my colleagues to celebrate our annual company party...The room is huge with 2 television, comfortable bed and pillows, clean sheets, very spacious bathroom and elegantly decorated(i really enjoyed the bath tub LOL) complete with basic amenities, toiletries, etc... The hotel has a nice interior, very classy.... lots to see and do....i wouldnt recommend this to senior citizens and family with small kids coz you have to do a lot of walking here.... otherwise bring wheelchair and strollers coz its pretty tiring going around the hotel. The hotel provides free shuttle bus to/from ferry terminal which is great. ... Tried the gondola ride and i must say its not worth it, very short canal , i think less than 5…",50
"There are already a million reviews on this hotel, but the hotel deserves them. But to really make the most of it, at least stay for 3 nights and then you'd enjoy the gambling, shops and the food. What surprised me was the in-room dining.It was really fast, firstly I was surprised to see some Indian dishes on the menu, and when I ordered some food I was sure it'd take a lot of time. But I was wrong, and the service was really quick. The only down-side, so to speak, is that the hotel lies on the other side of the city. Everything else, kinda, lies on the other half of the city. So if you're staying at the Venetian, you gotta take cabs (or may be bus) to get to the other side.",50
"Any travelers must  book a room for 3 days in this hotel a fantastic experience. The property itself so huge that you take a whole day to explore the hotel itself. There is huge food court, A grand Shopping Mall, A Casino, And many more to which is difficult to describe. A  must visit.",50
"It is apparently the second largest building in the world! 5000 rooms, 2 Venetian canal water ways, humongous food court, gargantuan size  rooms, huge casino spaces, an entire shopping district, kids play area.... What can I say.... You need a map to find your way around.",40
"Everything was perfect in this hotel. Haf 2 swimming pools and a huge casino n a very beautiful shpg ctr. The room was super big with 2 TVs, sofa, mini dinning table and a huge toilet. It was really a royal stay at my royal suite and although chk in was at 3 i was gvn a room once i rch at 130pm. Same for chk out whereby itz sup to be 11 but requested for late chk out n was gvn time till 12pm.The only feedback would be the staff who served us to check out as he was not friendly or warm enough as there was a long queue waiting to   check out. Other than that we had a  wonderful 1 night stay here before  leaving for HKG. Loved the Man U  shop and the night view of the other hotels. Had free shuttle bus from the immigration and to other parts of macau like taipa and to the ferru…",40
"My friend and I got an amazing deal from Venetian Hotel -- we wanted to catch Cirque du Soleil and found a package tour posted in the hotel's official website. With the show ticket, the discount and the free ferry ride back, it was as if our stay at our amazing suite was free! Highly recommended for those who want to watch CdS Zaia. No money out since you don't need to pay by credit card to make a reservation.   If you're going here, I hope these tips will help:  1. The Trip Advisor reviews warning you about the crowded lobby with tons of tourists is correct. The lines to check in or out are pretty fast, but they are also very long. People smoke everywhere so it's a challenge for asthmatics, pregnant women and kids so brace yourselves! People also attempt to cut the line so…",40
"All rooms were suites (even the cheapest ones) with separated living and sleeping zones. Spacious and relaxing. The bed was so comfortable that we didn't want to get up in the morning. The bathroom is also spacious. The shuttle bus service was good and we saved a lot in transportation fees.   The cleanliness of the room could be improved: stain on the sofa, body hair on the toilet floor, the bathtub which appeared not cleaned, and the cigarette burn on the cover of the room menu (though it was a non-smoking room)...Would be better if there's DVD player in the room.",40
"The hotel / resort is too huge and one needs a map to go to the suites.With small kids we were not allowed to go thru the casino and so needed to go thru a maze of escalators and lifts to reach our North tower room.All the streets and lanes in the Grand canal shoppes look similar so it is very confusing.Although the rooms are comfortable, i was not comfortable with a virtual city within  Hotel in which so many daily tourists come for ""sight seeing"". NOT A FAMILY PLACE AT ALL, BUT SURELY WORTH GOING TO AT LEAST ONCE,",40
"Very very nicely decorated hotel and room. Casino is also one of the best in the world. 6 stars hotel with fantastic customer services as well. Cannot find any complain on this hotel. You can find shopping, spa and amusement anywhere in this hotel. Free ferry ticket as well!",50
"I had heard about this place from my parents and brother who had been there last year.  He was all praises about this place (he is usually very conservative when it comes to praising a place) So I knew whenever I visit Macau, i had to stay in this hotel. Interestingly since macau has an on arrival visa, me and my wife decided to to go macau and booked venetian hotel for 3 days. it was about 220 USD. we booked online from the venetian hotel website. a couple of days before my arrival, I emailed them confirming my booking and arranging flower in the room as it was my honeymoon. I got a reply asking about my arrival time and they said, since its my first time comeing there and i am coming on  a honeymoon, they will be sending a limo to pick me up as a complimentary on the hotel.

"went for one night. restaurants closed early which was a pain. only one fast food joint open till 2-3am unfortunately. would expect more places/shops to be open for an all night casino. The floor was just full of high rolling asians. A few ""working girls"" seated/standing near the stairs/cafe for any gamblers wanting a ""refreshing break"" from the game.   Went there with bro and his in-laws, not really a gambling man myself so didn't do much.",40
This is one place I would love to go back to time and again. The Venetian is one of the best places to stay in Macao and the Room Nights are very reasonably priced. Excellent Room Service and the rooms were opulence re-defined....very Roman!! The Grand Canal Shoppes offer your all the Luxury Brands that you would ever want. And the Casino are fantastic. Won over $1200 at Casino Wars there!!,50
"Venetian Macau is such an extraordinary experience. My family had a wonderful stay in this hotel. Everything is just perfect, from the rooms, the shops, and our kids enjoyed playing in their play area which is the highlight of their trip in macau. Only thing is, the hotel is far from the city. taxi ride was about 20-30mins. If it's your first trip to macau, i suggest looking for a hotel in the city itself , to be able to leisurely tour the sights of macau.   Amenities of this hotel is just amazing, the gym equipments were great. i got a good workout while the kids are asleep. The pool is amazing. service was great too , check in check out was a breeze. Very knowledgable and helpful staff. Overall, we had an excellent time here!",40
Our suite was fantastic! Superb hotel with very accommodating staff,50
"Wonderful hotel. I stayed in the Bella Suite, which was spacious. They had a printer, internet in the room. The hotel is huge enough that you can spend a full day there. Might find it expensive while purchasing, but it is worth the money. The food is wonderful.",50
"The huge casino, shopping center & hotel complex starts check-in by handing over a multi-page map of the hotel - you really will need it. After three days I still managed to find new shops and restaurants behind every corner.  The casino is obviously the main attraction of this hotel. Do take the 5 minutes to get the loyalty card if you intend to gamble as you get nice little perks like dinner vouchers, discounts at shops etc.  Only downside of the hotel was that the hotel room doors provide zero sound proofing, any noise from the corridor will wake you up.",50
"evry thing is very fine in this hotel.this is my one of the good hotel and i love to stay there agine and agine wiht my family.i love the night life of this hotel.food are also very good.rooms are fine ,tolits are to good,every thing are with fine feel.",50
"We stayed here for 1 night only, but memorable experience.... Its very huge, they have created small city within this place which is fantastic... you feel like you are roaming around in Venice, even at night you are feeling like its day time, which fills energy even at 12 night.... No need to say best casino in Macau....  Only problem with this place, hard to locate something, we have to walk a lot.. which could make you tired....",40
"I stayed in hotel with family and friends for one night. This is an excellent hotel with huge space and facilities which include excellent shopping mall with small lake, casino etc. Rooms are quite big and are very comfortable. If someone goes to Macao, its a must go place, however it is slightly expensive.",50
"We booked this hotel from India through my friend he living in china for our childrens winter vacations.  We have stayed at many hotels in hongkong &china but this hotel experience was awesome ,we stayed before many time at many hotels but this hotel felt kingdom dream.this hotel food was sumptuous.",50
"DATE:22 feb 2011 WE went with our college for this trip and the hotel was just amazing. As per i believe thir is not  a single hotel like this in iniida, I was damn excited staying in this hotel..In the hotel itself there are branded showrooms to shop, awesome restaurants to have food, casinos, and many other facilities. The best thing was that the hotel has 900 conference halls which was amazing, beautiful suite which was out of anybodys thought and their yummy food.inspite of  being a foreign country they knew how to cook indian food.  THE BATHROOM EVEN PROVIDED WITH EACH AND EVERYHTING. IF I HAVE TO SAY A SENTENCE ABOUT MACAO THAT WILL BE, IF U HAVE NOT VISITED VENETIAN IN MACAO THEN U HAVE NOT VISITED MACAO.",50
"We crossed the border from China at Zhuhai into Macau. Staff in royal blue uniforms greeted us right outside the station. were directed to a shuttle bus just to the left once you exit the immigration building.   Dropped off at the hotel west lobby. Not enough doormen for the traffic at these doors. Made it difficult to enter the hotel, as everyone tried to go through the few open doors.   Despite the line for check-in (we arrived at 3:20, check-in starts at 3) it moved very quickly. Everything was settled, but we noticed the digital picture frames featuring the hotels suites. We saw a deal to upgrade from our Royale to a Rialto suite for 690MOP. The clerk was very helpful in helping us upgrade and issuing all the various items included in our package. (ZAIA package). Were told…",40
"Arrived by shuttle bus from ferry in what I would call "" The  Back Door"" but was actually The West Lobby. It was where all the buses bringing the gamblers to the Casino arrive. We were given directions to our Bella Cotai View Suite in the Hotel Suites South. It was very very confusing trying to find our room. The Hotel is overwhelming, a bit daunting and tacky in an American way.BUT it was quite an experience, I'm glad I have been there and would recommend it for a day trip but not for staying unless you are a heavy gambler who did not have to find their way back to their room. We departed from the Main Lobby which was beautiful.",50
"We were fortunate enough to be able to get away for a long weekend and used this time to do our Christmas shopping.  The suites were spacious, comfortable, clean and well decorated.  Staff were friendly, but with 3000 suites, service is a little less personalised, but we expected that.  The facilities were great and we especially loved the opera singing gondola sailors.  The restaurants and shopping areas were out of this world.",50
"I stayed at the Venetian Macao for just 1 day, an extension of my trip to Hong Kong with 2 friends and 1 child. We  booked via asiatravel . com and got package for ferry tickets on Cotai Jet & Breakfast included. Exchanging for tickets of the Cotai Jet can only be done on the day I check in to the hotel but that was okay.   We were on the 12 noon ferry from China Ferry Terminal from HK to Macau. It was a Sunday which was the reason why it wasn’t so crowded at the customs. There are free shuttle buses from the various hotels waiting for guests. We boarded the 3rd Venetian bus to the hotel. The buses came one after another pretty fast.  We checked in with no problem. The guy at the reception who checked us in asked if we need help with luggage to be sent to our room, we said no.…",40
"Venetian is just an amazing resort. Gondola ride is a must to take there. Its got man made skies and its beautiful. Its an complete resort with loads of shopping. I stayed here for 2 nights. One can easily stay here for 7 nights.   Pools are a must visit there. They have 5 pools, couple of Jacuzzi .   The rooms are very big and simply amazing. They are done is old classical style and I simply loved it.  Drawbacks are check in and check out take lot of time. Since its a huge resort the checkout takes approx of 40 mins and check - in the same time.  Venetian is an example of dreaming big, very big and making those dreams come true.",50
"Well really speaking Amazing & superb are understatments for this heaven. Well to start with its in the cotai area of macau which is about 10-15 mins drive from the Macau Maritime Freey terminal which also has a helipad so u can reach macau either by a copter or by high speed ferries and about 4-5 mins drive from the Macau International airport. The hotel is really really huge have about 3,000 suites, 3-4 swiming pools, 1 golf course, 40,000 sq feet of casino & 350 shops.

"I had read great reviews about the original Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas and wanted to check out its counterpart in South - East Asia for myself. Even though i had rather high expectations, the Venetian Macau Resort Hotel still blew me away. The sheer size, opulence and grandeur of the place can be matched by few other hotels/resorts in the world. It is a colossal hotel with about 3000 suites and A SMALL RIVER running through the hotel ! Guests can enjoy romantic gondola rides on this river which runs through the heart of the hotel and get a feeling like you're almost in  Venice. Every other aspect about the hotel - the staff, service, facilities, shopping, suites etc are absolutely top class ! Although staying at the Venetian is pricey, its definitely an experience worth…",50
"We booked an ""explore Macao"" package, which included the room and a half-day Macao tour. The tour was good. The check-in process was easy and the hotel is quite new and extremely big. Since we are not into gambling, we spent time walking around the hotel complex and shops. There was great variety. We enjoyed it.  The room itself is very spacious, with ""2"" levels. The first one has the bed and tv with nice decor. Then, there is a fence and a few steps down to another area where there is a sitting room complete with another tv, a small ""dining"" table and work desk (with fax and scanner).

Brilliant 5* hotel.",50
"This resort is quite extraordinary, but where to begin...  ARRIVAL  Getting to the place couldn't have been easier, the Coach was waiting when I cleared immigration at the ferry terminal and I was at the resort inside of 10 mins.  The sheer luxury of the place hit you the second you walk in.  I was checked in straight away by a very pleasant young lady, who offered me a room upgrade for a certain amount but when I declined, that was the end of the matter. (I mention this as I have read other reviews about this place, suggesting that some high pressure sales tactics are used in trying to get people to upgrade!)   Although being provided with a map to get from reception to you room sounds a bit silly, take it...you will struggle to find your way otherwise.  Bags were collected…",40

"The Venetian Macao is a grand hotel to say the least. We visited for 2 days and did not need the leave the hotel premises. They have a extremely large number of shops withing the hotel, its like a shopping mall within the hotel.  They have gondola rides, a massive food court, so many great restaurents (we ate at Lei Garden which was great). Obviously the casino is good too with various games of different stakes. Something for everybody. It was also good that they have a seperate non-smoking section which is very important for people llike myself who are allergic to the smoke fumes. The rooms are large and lavish with equally big bathrooms.  Since it is an all suite hotel even the base suites are great! Despite it being such a large hotel the service levels are kept upto the mark…",40
"The Venetian Macau is a fabulous hotel. Following is a jist of our experience:  1) Lobby of the hotel - Majestic. As soon as you enter the hotel lobby you would want to take out your camera and start clicking pictures.  2) Casino - There are 4-5 casinos in the hotel, however, not much of a difference in them. The casinos do not have many options for poeple with low budgets. The min bet in the blackjack table would be HKD 200 which i though was very high. 3) 3rd floor - This is a wonderfully designed arena where one could easily spend a full day. There are artificial sky, shopping areas, fooding, the Gondola ride etc. The Gondola Ride is highly recommended for those who have not been to Italy. 4) Rooms - There aren't any rooms, there are just suites in Macau. The suites are…",50
"Pros: Very convenient transportation from either ferry port or airport on one of the many Venetian transport buses, beautiful and giant hotel, canal shopping area is really fun.  The Casino options are plentiful and there is easy access to other casinos, shuttle buses or linked walkway to Four Seasons.  The rooms are very nice and well serviced, the mini-golf course (pricey at MOP 50 per person) is good fun.  Lots to eating options as well, we particularly like the Cafe Deco for main dining and the Pizza Pizza in the food court (surprisingly good pizza).   Cons: Its not cheap to stay here but price is comparable to other hotels in this range.  The mini-golf course has some dodgy greens (but who cares about that!).  The Casinos become very smoky and busy in the evenings.    Deal…",40
"The Venetian Macau is definitely worth the splurge.  We took advantage of a package deal that included a suite, tickets to Cirque du Soleil's Zaia and tickets for the Coatai Jet ferry.  When we arrived we were graciously allowed an early check-in at no extra cost.  The front desk agent was kind and extremely helpful.  On our way to our room we stopped to book our Coatai tickets in the lobby and were taken care of quickly.  The room was breathtaking.  We especially enjoyed the full-size bathroom with a luxurious bathtub, shower, double sink, toilet, vanity and many more amenities.

Its beautiful, every detail has been taken care of architecturally. Its like a small city with in a hotel. You need minimum 2 days stay and anuthing more than that would be wonderful.One day is just not enough to explore this huge property. thers an artifcial water bosy been created within the hotel like Vienna ( replica) , boat ride in this river takes you around the hotel.

"This is the first time I was given a map to my room during checking in to a hotel and the map helps. Hotel was huge and I didn't really expect a nice room but it was value for money. The shopping in Venetian had already taken us a day. The shopping mall was beautiful and it was nice to have our meals in the foodcourt which is so beautiful too. Opposite the hotel, there was a 3D show which I strongly recommend. It's in a huge bubble and it's free.   My husband and I loved Venetian Hotel and would strongly recommend to anyone who wish to go to Macao. Breakfast in CafeDeco was a little disappointing but you can actually choose breakfast or lunch. I suggest you have brunch cuz the lunch starts at 11am to 2.30pm at Bambu restaurant. Bambu restaurant's choices was fantastic!!! Had…",50
If you visit Macau then you have to stay at the Venetian!! It's an awesome property. The best I have seen in Asia . Everything bout the hotel is just perfect . I think the casino in the hotel is the biggest in Macau . The  suite rooms are huge and comfortable. The bathrooms are brilliantly decorated & look very chic. We had booked the royal cotai view room(29058) on the 29th floor which had a good view. The rooms have all the possible amenities required for a comfortable stay. The hotel shopping arcade has some of the best brands in the world and the whole experience of shopping there is wonderful . They have an artificial sky roof made over the shopping arcade .

Venetian Resort macau is one of the best hotels i have ever visited anywhere. It is not only a hotel but a city in itself. They have the Best Suites ever.

This hotel is on taipa island which is identically being developed like las vegas strip.And the hotel is the same copy of the one is in las vegas.excellent 700 sqft rooms elegant.Iwent during the time when there was this special package going on which offered many freebies if booking on urself pls chk wid hotel u may get additional perks i would love to go again on my next trip at this . EXCELLENT restaurants.Iwould recommend the zia show to one and all,50
"Booked the Bella Suites hotel..  And really, the price pays for the room. Great amenities inside, large room, and very luxury.  One minus is dirty window so that we can't take pictures to the nice view outside. Highly recommended if you want to taste luxury,",50
"Booked Royale suite through travel agent.  When checked in, they offered me to upgrade the room to Bella suite with some amount.  Take the chance..... and yes.. the room was so big.  The bedroom is quite big, living room is also big, bathroom is big with additional separate wash room and toilet.  There is a mall attached to this hotel but not much to see.  Choices of food in the food court is good.  When you started to get bored walking around the mall, just hop into the casino.  Can play from small to big money there.",50
"The Venetian Macau does not have the same feel of luxury in the public areas as the one is Las Vegas. However the rooms here are amazing, the size of the bathroom is greater than the size of most hotel rooms in Asia. Not to mention that the toilet is in its own room and that the double sink was impressive. Perhaps I was just impressed because spent a month in 3 star hotels before this. The twin Bella Suite had two huge double beds with plush linen and mattresses. The two huge plasma TVs was impressive as was the view from the lounge and dining area. The room is so nice you are more than tempted to order in. The casino and all the restaurants are of a high standard. The Venetian has its own shopping centre. All in all an excellent choice for Macau and only a shuttle bus away from…",50
"The hotel is the most famous hotel in Macau. It offers a wide range of experience to those who stay there. From the entrance, it shows that the service is very satisfying. The concierge come running to open the door and carry your luggage to a very efficient check-in. But one thing that bothers me a lot is that they don't provide direct access from the hotel lobby to your room. You have to go through casino and boutique to reach the elevator. But overall its a very satisfying experience for me.",40
Our second visit to this hotel. The rooms are substantial and very well fitted out with all the modern amenities. The service astounded us and was beyond expectations. One of the only hotels in the world that have super service. An added bonus was the large shopping centre and all the other entertainment within the hotel complex.,50
"We stayed here for four nights. We got the Bella Suites and 4 to 5 people can comfortably sleep. We also got a good deal from their website. The Venetian has its own world with a casino and shopping mall that would easily eat up a day. However, unless you are well off, the meals from the food court inside the hotel are expensive. Also take the free shuttle buses of the hotels to get you anywhere you want to in Macau and possibly to Hong Kong.",40
"If there is a hotel in the world , it has got to be only venetian in Macau. This is the most beautiful hotel I have seen in my life, the details with which the hotel is made is remarkable. It is almost a painting on a canvas. It is magical and really make you think twice that there still exists beautiful things in world which are made only few times.  The hotel rooms are remarkable, service is amazing! Well the only hotel I have seen in my life where you need to stand in a long queue to check in. Still the wait is worth it! Live there to live it",50
gotta stay here if you're in macau. the food in the casino is so-so for their prices,50
"This hotel is huge. The rooms are fantastic and the restaurants, shopping and facilities are second to none. The experience of walking through the massive foyers, halls, along the canals and down to the casino is something everyone should have. Rooms are fantastically appointed and the view across to the Cotai Strip is particularly good at night when the light show from the City of Dreams starts. If it is not the biggest building on earth it has got to be close yet getting around is not that hard, the 3 restaurants available for breakfast were all good but definately there to serve the Chinese market.  This hotel/casino gets 70000 visitors a day.",50
The caesars salad with cajun spiced shrimp listed in the in-room dining menu gave me food poisoning. I am sat in the hotel now with a 5 hour wait for our ferry and I feel absolutely terrible.  Careful with the seafood here!!!,40
"For the girls who had watched ""Boys before Flowers"" must have known this Hotel. This hotel had been appeared in lots of Korean and Taiwanese drama. I was curious about it happened to stayed there with my family and you know what i'm very amazed about it. The hotel was very luxurious. it's just like you live in a kingdom. The thing which captured a lot my attention is the bridge and the gondola because, once again, it was appeared in the famous drama "" Boys before Flower""",50
"On a recent visit to Macau, we did not stay at the Venetian but of course, we did venture there to have a look. The shopping canal was cool and not as exhausting as the one in Las Vegas!  My daughters went for a ride on a gondola & were serenaded by the delightful lady oarsman (oarsperson??!). Both the staff at the gondola rides were great - very friendly and great to chat to. They were enjoying the calm night as it had been insanely busy in Macau over the New Year period (I'm glad we missed it!).  We went to the McSorley Ale House a couple of times which was very enjoyable. Great decor & very friendly staff. The first time we only had drinks and the staff bought  out a complementary plate of mini hamburgers which were delicious and totally unexpected. We returned the next night…",50
"Great experience, although we stayed mid week so maybe a little less hectic.Wonderful room reasonable price..Great show package (get the passport ) only $10 hkd more for the show and endless treats included 200hkd cash voucher and ferry ride home among other things! Would def stay again..",50
"Hotel Bus will be waiting for you at the airport.  The 7 minute bus ride will take you directly to the front doors of the hotel.  Hotel was nice, but nothing I haven’t seen in Vegas.  Actually Vegas is better.  Check in was friendly and fast and I declined the upgrade to the larger suite.  The room was already huge and had everything you needed except for a blow dryer?  Bed was so comfy and the blackout curtains made late wake ups restful. I didn’t even try the expensive internet.  Overall service was good including room service.  The gym was simple, but had everything you needed for a workout including a personal trainer(who was great and spoke perfect English). There is ample shopping on the third floor(complete 5 star shopping experience) , including a food court, mostly fast…",50
"BIg suite and bathroom, clean, nice resort connected to The Plaza by walkways.  Beautiful swimming pool complex which was never very busy.  Nice restaurants, also never too busy.  Fitness room a little small considering the huge size of the hotel.  Would have liked operable windows in the room as air tended to get a little stale.  Overall, a good experience and helpful staff, good room service as well.  Walked to cultural sites downtown, and had quick taxi rides or free shuttle to airport or ferry.  Had to take bus to many of the other casinos however.",50
It was the first time in my life that I had to wait in a queue to check into a a hotel... But the wait was worth while as we were upgraded to a higher level suite for Free! Never in my life i had to travel inside a hotel with a map.. but trust me you will enjoy every bit of finding your way. The staff here is always smiling and greeting.. the free bus service to and fro from the freey terminal and to other casinos.. i will not have to spend a buck on local transport to see the major places in macau. Me and my friends gifted ourselves with the treat to go to HK and Macau for a small christmas vacation and chose to live in Venetian and I am assure we got back the worth of every penny we spent.  It is one of the most beautiful piece of architectural proportion work I have ever…,50
"[gambling assessment at bottom]  I spent 2 nights and 3 days in this hotel with my wife celebrating our anniversary.  We felt that the hotel room itself was perhaps the nicest hotel room we've ever stayed in, especially in this price range.  We were in the smallest room that they offer, and it was enormous!  The bathroom had two sinks, a separate tub and shower, a separate vanity, and a closed-off toilet closet - it was the sort of bathroom we only dream about having in our own house.  The bed was king-sized and barely took up any space in the rest of the giant room.  There was a separate couch seating area and a decent view of part of the Cotai Strip.  We were incredibly happy with the room itself.  However, leaving the room and going to the casino meant forfeiting our lungs to…",40
We stayed at the Venetian Macau for two nights after a family friend recommended it to us.  We took the cotaijet to Macau and then the hotel shuttle.  The first thing that hits you is its size and grandeur! And of course the number of people around! It is a tourist attraction in Macau so the corridors are always crowded!  We got to the hotel around 11 and were told that the check in would only start around 1 30. SO we got our bags deposited and decided to get some lunch.   Do give youself some time to get used the size of the hotel. We got lost plenty of times on our way to the Food Court. But eventually figured out the place.  We also saw Zaia in the evening. We had read the reviews online and they weren't flattering but we still decided to give it a shot. It is quite an…,50
"Stayed at this hotel during my vacation in Hongkong & macau. Till the time we reached the hotel lobby after a long flight, ferry and carrying our luggage all around ourselves , we were totaly exhausted. and after seeing the rush at the lobby, it was a real put off. after about 30 min at the reception and 15 min walk to the room, the moment we opened our room door, it was just AMAZING!!! Had heard a lot about the hotel, but never expected it to be so great. The rooms were excellent. It was more like a predential suite with a seperate sitting and bedroom and ofcouse a great vanity room. The room had a great view towards the golf course and the near by hotels. One needs to reach breakfast at time as 15-20 Min waiting is normal. Though the variety was very good, just that the hotel…",50
Our final stop of our 5D4N Hong Kong/Macau trip and we are impressed! The room was large and elegantly decorated! We had the Bella suite which could accomodate for 4 adults but I'm sure it will do fine with small familes of 5 as well. A good all round hotel with easy access to local food at the food court and great shopping arcade too. Nice!,40
"This is a all suites hotel. Having just squeezed ourselves for a week in HK, really appreciates the big big beds, big big toilets, big big sitting area. No more fighting over TV channels with my kid, there're 2 TVs (and one is a 32""LCD).  Transportation is not a problem, although the property is in Taipa. There're many free shutters to various casino in town & it's ever ready to transport you from point A to point B, regardless of whether you patronise the destination's hotel / casino or not.  Check out the property's website, it often has all kinds of summer, winter promotions (packages), which may include ferry tickets to HK, meals or shows. Could get a good deal.",50
"Everything in this hotel is ""huge"". The rooms are big (all suites) and designed for royalty. The casino almost fills the entire ground floor and the Venetian inspired shopping mall is truly ""fantastic"". It feels and looks like the real thing, but this is inside/under one roof. Very good shopping from their endless shops. Location is near the City of Dreams, another complex of hotels, casino and entertainment. transportation to and from the city is relatively easy. The sky painting on their ceiling looks so real, that the ""Sun"" never sets, while you are at ""The Venetian"".",40
"The Venetian Macau Resort Hotel, Cotai Strip December 12, 2010  Upon exiting the Macau Ferry Terminal, it was only a short wait (around 2 minutes) before the next available Venetian Macau Resort Terminal shuttle bus was available to pick us up, free of charge. Upon arriving, I had only one thought - hands down, the Venetian is the grandest hotel that I have ever been to. There's a short walk from the Main Entrance drop off to the concierge (which had around 7-8 terminals ), and if that wasn't enough, after check-in a map of the hotel was given to help us guide to which lift we needed to go. Another short walk from the concierge to our suite's side involved going through the huge casino area.  The room was huge. There's a separate area for the bed and the foyer (which had the…",40
"The Venetian Macao is the finest hotel/casino we've been to. Everything about it screams luxury and class. Our room was just lovely and the view (outside the window) was spectacular.  I love that they offer free shuttle service to all the places we wanted and needed to go to. There is also a cab stand right outside the West entrance which made getting around Macau a breeze.  Service was generally so-so, but there was one employee (whose name is George), who patiently answered all our queries and went the extra mile in helping us build our itinerary. He was awesome. WE LOVE GEORGE! :)  Every single penny we spent on our stay was well worth it. We'll be back very soon!  P.S. The House of Dancing Water was absolutely fantastic, but Zaia by Cirque du Soleil made more of an impact…",50
"Venetian Macau is truly grand, shopping is great as well, and well facilitated. Many activities to be done there, you might not even want to leave the hotel. I booked the ZAIA gold package 2D1N stay at the Venetian, and I found it worthwhile. However, I simply hated the fact that the whole place reeks of cigarette smoke. I would not stay there again because of this problem. If you have respiratory problems, I would advise you to stay at maybe Four Seasons instead, the air there is better.",40
"We booked for 2 nights at Bella Suites. We prefer the SOUTH wing which is more convenient. Food court is just next to 3rd floor lift. The room is truly beautiful. The toilet is amazing. The hotel pictures are true reflection of actual room. There is separate bath tub and a standing shower. There are actually 2 TV in the room. Lots of channels in different languages!!!! No kidding about the 200 or so shops! I got quite lost in the shopping area on 3rd floor. Check in took 5 mins including waiting time and check out took 2 min, amazing in such a big hotel. plenty of taxi at main lobby. You can take a short cut to City of Dreams, Hard Rock etc from West lobby (5 mins walk). Hotel Shuttle bus at main lobbly to airport starts at 11am. Although this is a beautiful hotel and has the…",50
"The Venetian Macau surpasses all standards of elegance, sophistication, charm and hospitality. The entire resort is huge and you need days just to explore every nook and corner. Begining with the main hotel, the resort boasts of the centrally located mammoth casino, food courts, fine dining restaurants, kids gaming zones, couture shops, gondola rides, and of course the Four Seasons Hotel at one corner too. There are no rooms here, all suites starting 750 odd square feet to 1800 square feet spacious habitats inclusive of living, dining, separete baths, sofas and lavish comfortable beds. When you enter the lobby of the hotel you are in awe of the inspiring murals on the top and tastefully decorated ambience all around the hotel. The entire resorts bustles with people and you never…",50
"The Venetian is a tourist destination on its own. The rooms are very large and modern (one of the biggest rooms I ever stayed). The hotel offers many shops, restaurants,.. in a Venetian setting (similar to Las Vegas). The casino is massive and most guest seem to only come for the casino not leaving the hotel nor the gambling hall",50
"I stayed in the venetian for my 1st wedding anniversary.   The venetian is the most luxurious hotel money can buy. Everything was just too perfect.   We stayed in the Royale Suite & it was spacious and very well designed. Food at the Cafe Deco is very good. I was pleasantly surprised to get Indian Veg meal in it.  The hotel staff surprised us by gifting us a big box of chocolates for our anniversary. The shopping at the four seasons is great. The casinos are nice too.  They give a venetian passport which offers truckloads of freebies. The best of all was free tickets to Zhia show, 200$ gift vouchers, free ferry tickets, etc.  To sum it up in short.......the best hotel stay a person can get.",50
The Hotels like a maze . The map provided is pathetic and its very easy to get lost. Enjoyed the decor and loved the Suite. The performances at the hotel were very good. Loved the X-mas feel to everything. Watched Cirque de solel.....a fancy circus thats at the hotel. The tickets are too expensive and the show is nothing great. For such a fancy hotel it lacks personalised service. Tried the food only at the food court and the quality of food was average. I wish i'd stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel just across the road and come to Venetian for a visit instead. Their deal and shows are far better.,40
"During January we stayed at the venetian for 2 days, its grand and amazing hotel, huge escalators, halls and shopping will dazzle you for the first time the shopping has all the best brands of the planet and the resort is made into town form inside.  it also has a artificial river with gondola rides which will make you feel romantic and high the food court is excellent with plenty of vegetarian options  the rooms are spacious with queen beds and bathrooms are king sized and spectacular casino is one of the biggest in macau  we never went out of the Venetian its was full of surprises and it was totally worth it !!!!",50
"Awesome hotel, a world in itself. The Gandolas ride ( boats on the 3rd floor of the hotel) was an amazing experience. Artificial blue sky was looking so amazingly beautiful. Rooms in the hotel( Mine Royal Suite) were amazingly big and royal. Every amenity and room service was there. Quick servicing and all kind of food delicacies were available for room servicing. Vegetarian food also available and indian too. In the hotel, there are shops of all the top brands of the world. Good shopping experience. They also host a show ZAIA which was a circus show and was worth a watch. Overall a very good experience. They provide free shuttle bus services to and from the hotel to both the ferry stations of Macau for transit to Hogkong or China. Very comfortable and full of life experience.…",50
"Well, not much to be added here, just confirming all the positive reviews! I might not be a big fan of big hotels with hundreds rooms, but The Venetian Macao is an experience itself. From the oversized suite (we booked Bella Suite, which had view to the City of Dream Casino across the street), oversized bathroom, grandeur interior, and the huge complex of the resort. Nothing can’t beat that experience in any other places in Macao.    We stayed for one night only and unfortunately it was raining the whole evening, but we never got bored. We spent most of the evening exploring the huge complex, which is very impressive with artificial blue sky on the ceiling, Venice architectures, canals, gondolas, and off course hundreds of shops and variety of eateries.   I didn’t gamble, so I…",40
"Awesome suites, huge bedrooms and bathrooms. A complete city in itself. The canal shoppes are excellent if you want designer stuff.  The blackjack stakes are minimum HKD 200 so be sure to carry a stash of cash.  The show ZAIA should not be missed.",50
"Stayed in the Royal Suite for 2 nights using the Sensational Shopping Package. Transfer on the TurboJet from HKG aiport to Macau was seamless. Turbojet even transfered the checked baggage from arrival lounge of HKG airport to Macau Turbojet arrival lounge. Cirque du Soliel (ZAIA) as part of the Sensational Shopping Package is worth a visit in the evening.  Total package is worth every penny. Rooms are great -Very Comfortable Hotel.  Only issue noted was the room cleaners 'cleared' the coffee and tea bags from the rooms on 2nd day stay, and left only one bag of tea and creamer !. This was also the case with our friends staying in the room next to us on floor 19.",50
"I stayed at the Venetian Macao for 2 nights during the Macau Grand Prix (not there for the races though). The flight arrived at Macau at midnight, and it was a short 5 minutes taxi ride to the hotel. Upon arriving, we wanted to check-in but it took quite a while as ""the hotel is quite full today so we need some time to find an empty room"", ok, maybe not perfect efficiency, but the bell-boy who brought our luggage up was very helpful. We walked past the casino area to the South wing, up to level 27, and walked quite a bit till the end of the floor to reach our rooms.   The bella suite (twin room) was absolutely gorgeous and the bellboy took some time to describe the room and the facilities in the hotel to us. (Yes of course he was rewarded with a reasonable tip). Everywhere was…",50
"After a long overnight flight from Sydney and a big wait at Hong Kong for the first ferry to Macau we were met at The Venetian by a wonderful lady who ushered us to the check in. She took care of our baggage, introduced us to the young lady at check in who wished us a ‘Happy Anniversary’and before we knew it we were in our beautiful room with an upgrade. We had booked a package at this hotel with the circ du soleil, show ‘ZAIA and breakfast.  We had a wonderful stay. Our seats for the show were the best in the house. The show was amazing. It was very very busy at breakfast next morning but there were so many staff you did not notice and it all went very smoothly. What a grand hotel and wonderful shops and entertainment throughout the complex. The hotel stored our bags while we…",50
"For people looking at weekend getaway and want to try their lady luck, this is the place to go. This resort is built in acres of land at the center of Macau. Best way to reach Macau is via Hongkong (which is what most travellers do) and take a ferry from HK to Macau. Ferry station is hardly 20 minutes from Venetian. HK there is no visa required for stay upto 15 days, ferry costs around 100HKD. When you reach this resort you get astonished by the magnificence and beauty. With huge welcome desks, worlds biggest casino and amazing suites. Service is of the top most quality and almost every staff speaks English, unlike other countries in China.",50

we were in the verona suite and i have never ever seen a room as big as this 145 sqm room with a huge balcony. the hotel is must fr families with kids as there is so much 2 do..........lovely hotel will never forget it.,50
"We were 8 of us. Teenagers with Spouse. We had booked this hotel as few known persons had recommended it. My experience: It was jus toooo goood.. VENETIAN is equipped with everything, you name it & it has.  On Check-in they gave many complimentary things like: Welcome Drink, Dinner For 2 persons, 200 HKD as vouchers, 300 HKD to be used in Casino, 2 tickets for Ziia Theatre, 2 Cotai Jet tickets for Macao to HK Intl airport.  The hotel is equipped with all the below facilities: Theatre, 3 Swimming Pools with Jacuzzi, All rooms are Royal Suite, Casino, Kids play Area, All types of Restaurant, Coffee Shops, Travel Agent, a BIG Shopping mall which has all the top brands. Its reallu amazing!!!!",50
"One of the best hotel I've stayed.  Check-in was a little slow, but service was faultless. Great hotel amenities. Shopper's dream. Wide selection of food. Next time, we'll try watching the shows.",50
"If you like big, anonymous hotels, this one is for you. If you are more toward boutique hotels, then don't even consider it. This hotel is simple HUGE!!! To enjoy it, you also have to appreciate kitch/fake/cardboard settings. But that's a matter of taste, if you go to the Venetian, you know what to expect from this point of view, so now let's talk about what is less obvious.  First of all, the value is excellent: the rate is among the lowest in macao's 5 stars hotels, but the rooms are the largest. The rooms are magical! Very roomy and confortable. I found the service to be very good. All the employees were speaking an understable english, and almost all were friendly and well trained. The mall is also fascinating. There is a game place for children (so you can leave them and go…",50
"This one is a must stay in Macau. Go to macau just to stay in this hotel. This place is a city in itself. Imagine we spent entire 2 days only within the hotel. Has countless shopping centers, resturants and not to forget the Casions. The Hotel also has a Gondola ride as it is modelled on Venice. The staff was polite and we were amazed they knew basic hindi salutation Courtsy IFFA. The entire delegates of IFFA were based in this hotel when IFFA was held in Macau",50
"The sheer size and structure is breath taking. The hotel is extremely busy and there is always a stream of people in every area moving in and out. The building is huge and every area is designed beautifully. The shopping area(St. Mark's Square) is something I have never seen with more than 300 shops of all the best brands, and there is always some entertainment and activity happening. No need to buy anything just be there and you can have a great time. The rooms are fabulous and huge. service is impeccable.",50
Totally NO COMMENTS AT ALL with VENETIAN MACAU!!! Its PERFECT!! Although its far away from St Paul but... we still could reach there by any hotel shuttle bus  (u may take off from City Of Dreams-Shuttle bus-Ferry Terminal-Hotel Shuttle Bus). & dun forget to try de Four Seasons White & Dark Chocolate (Its total FREE from the Casino).,50
"If i had to define my experience at venetian in one word, it would be ""wow"". Grand hotel (3000+rooms, 300+shops and tons of restaurants), extremely elegant with perfect venice feel (watch out for the artificial blue sky) and large rooms (suites only hotel) with mega casino floor (4 casinos on one floor) make this hotel the ultimate choice of stay in Macau. We took the sensational shopping package (great value), tried our luck at casino (won some $$$) and thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the venetian (will surely be back).  We stayed for 3 nights and were checked-in on the 32nd floor in the north block. Check-in process took little time (can understand given the quantum of people pouring in) and it took some walking to reach our room (huge hotel, ask for room in south block to be…",50
"Simply the best! From the check in (which was done pretty quickly despite the bad reviews I read) to the entertainment, to the shopping - everything was superb!  Firstly the rooms - all suites and with the most luxurious bathrooms. We were celebrating out anniversary and had chocolated coated strawberries as a surprise for us in the room! A bit of a walk from the lobby but that is expected with a hotel of that size. A good tip would be to ask for a room near the elevator.   The casino - Huge! With free flow of coffee/tea/soft drinks.. something you hardly find in casinos in other parts of the world. We did play a little to try our luck! Great fun especially the blackjack tables.  The food - So many restaurants in the Shoppe area. The food court was good too. A tad difficult to…",50
"Stayed here for our 1st wedding anniversary!! The hotel is huge, very beautiful, St. Marks Square of Venice has been re created very nicely.. all rooms are lovely twin levelled suites.. great bathrooms( complete with a powder room et al).. Enjoyed a beautiful Gondola ride at this Oriental Venice .. even the restaurants have good food( especially 3 monkeys).. The free shuttle to and fro the ferry terminal also helps in getting around.. The architecture is truly magnificent. Worth it!!!",50
"My husband and I took a four (4) days vacation in Macau and stayed here in The Venetian Hotel.  I would like to call it SPLENDID because of it's wonderful structure. I would say that the hotels in asia would not compare to the hotel's magnificent interior and exterior. However, let me go into details in rating this hotel.  a.  ROYALE SUITES - the room is very impressive.  Since it is a suite, i expected it to be large and it is indeed large.  The sheets are clean and the bed itself has a nice feel (homey, as i would call it).  The room comes with a living room and has 2 tv.  The bathroom and toilet is large that it has a separate tub, shower room, dressing room and a toilet.  However, i find the hot water to be a little slow.  You need to turn on the faucet for 1-2 minutes…",40
"We booked this Hotel for our holiday trip of Macao & Hongkong during first week of November. We stayed in Royal Suites which was a spacious room, beautifully crafted & amazing location. Venetian is grand and we actually felt that we will loose our way back to our room, unless we actually understood the Venetian map. The Grand Canal is the best part of Venetian, it does not look artificial at all, it actually depicts the real ambience of Venice. Shopping was also a good experience within Venetian. The casino's, Medi Spa, Heated Swimming Pool, Gondola ride and many more activities are a must for everyone who visit Venetian Macao. I highly recommend this place for a perfect vacation. Please be carefull if you are going with your kids that there are certain areas like casino's where…",50
The rooms at the Venetian are one of the first of excellent experiences that greet a visitor to the hotel.   Over all ambiance of the Hotel including one of the best shopping arcades makes for a complete trip.,50
great hotel in asia i suppose...... casinos are just bonus to its extra large rooms and that to what a cheaper price as compared to hotels in Goa etc.... enjoyed a lot with my 12 friends and really need to say that will definitely come back ......,50
"Magnificient large hotel with  rooms that were so spacious. The bathroom was so huge that they had a bathtub, seperate shower area,  2 wash basins, a seperate lavatory area and a dressing table.   There was simply too many shops to see during my first trip there. If you wish to find a hotel which has everything, well this is simply it.   The only not so positive thing about venetian is that its not on the main macau island. However, there are shuttle buses so any traveller can just hop on one to the main island.",40
"I dont know but the name ""Venetian"" strikes a chord in every indian traveller.. and it feels like everyone stays in Venetian only..  First the nice parts.. Awesome looking with awesome rooms.. i think the best rooms i have been to.. i think the most well decorated.. features.. casinos.. canals like venice..  But once you get there.. TOO OVER CROWDED.. lots and lots of people.. check in took me more than 45 minutes.. I was tired so i asked them to deliver my luggage to my room.. believe me it arrived almost after an hour.. that too after 2 calls to the operator.. not their fault.. with the kind of guests they entertain.. i understand it can be quite a task..  had to almost skip my breakfast becuase of the crowd.. the queues u have to wait for everything..  and also.. location..…",40
"This is an awesome hotel to stay! Luxurius and beautiful. The hotel got a huge Casino, the largest in Asia for sure. Food was not that great. Rooms were spacious, neat and clean. The hotel also have a shopping mall inside it. The best part was the way they have tried to recreate Venice in the third floor. It was truly amazing.",50
"I am impressed by the surrounding of the Venetian, with its man-made structures, bridges and canals. IMPRESSIVE.  And with all the shops and restaurants conveniently situated all around the hotel, we don't even need to step out of the hotel premises throughout our stay ! There are free shuttle buses almost every 10 mins to various places in Macau !  VERY CONVENIENT.  The suites are luxurious and the service is wonderful too !  Room rate per night is a little high. But, it is worth every penny ! GREAT HOTEL.",50
"Stayed 2 nights in venetian macao, first impression is very impressive, terribly huge and grand, like a golden palace.. The room is huge and grand, the bed is comfortable, but I expected a king bed rather than queen bed in such a huge room... We enjoyed the food at the food court and Blue Frog. The pools are excellent, BUT you have to be prepared because have to walk at least 300 meters to reach the pool from your hotel room!  The room has no shampoo and shower gel, room cleaner must have forgot to put in. Overall, great stay!",40
"What a crazy, over the top, impressive place! The rooms are huge and so luxurious, the pool area is fantastic as are all the shops, canal and restaurants. We stayed for 2 nights and I was ready to leave by the end of it only because I'm not much for gambling so the casino didn't appeal and was a little put off by all the prostitutes on the casino floor - my fiance got approached twice.. urghh so annoying..",50
"This was our second stay at this magnificant hotel and we got a very good rate by signing up on their website to newsletters and offers.   Last time I wrote the review we considered it to be the best hotel we had stayed in but having just stayed at L'Arc in Macau it is no longer our best but still awesome. The rooms are so spacious and luxurious, it is a real treat staying there.  The rooms service is very expensive. Even though it is a five star hotel their check in is far from it and it can feel very impersonal and a bit like a cattle herd. The casino across the road is more fun and lively. Don't miss out on seeing the street entertainers the opera singers are fantastic.",50
"This was our second trip to the Venetian in Macau.  We are not gamblers and were traveling with our children . . . our first trip was great, but the hotel still needed to work out the ""kinks"" of getting around the casino with children.  Since children aren't allowed to walk through the casino, we had some difficulty getting to places on our first trip.  However, it seems that improvements were made since our trip one year ago.  First of all, distinct striping has been placed on the flooring so that it is easier to find your way around to the shops and restaurants.  The Venetian ""complex"" is HUGE and it is helpful to have the striping (along with a map and the interactive touch-screens).  Our room was enormous and beautifully appointed!  We enjoyed all of the shopping areas and…",50
"We stayed at Venetian Macau during last winter and it was definitely a memorable one. The hotel oozes grandeur and opulence. No matter when I looked, there's something interesting to see and admire, from the indoor canals to the ceilings that resembled the outdoor sky. Amazing! The views outside (landscaping) were also just as amazing.  Our suite was just like the photos on the website. It was comfortable, cozy and provided good space for evening get together with extended family who were also staying at the same hotel.   There were many shops in the hotel and we did a fair bit of shopping. We had buffet dinner in one of the restaurants and it was one of the best buffets we've ever had. If we ever go back to visit Macau, I will stay here again.",40
