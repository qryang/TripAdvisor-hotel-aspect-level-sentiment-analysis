"So far our worst hotel experience. My wife have been to very embarrassing and humiliating discriminatory selection process every time we need to go through the casino, and going through the casino is the best way from the main lobby to our elevators to access our room, so it’s pretty much every day and a few times a day the same thing. If you are black, south asian and young, avoid this hotel. The hotel itself is up to the Venetian standards.",10
"They cancelled my reservation because we arrived late. We stuck in traffic and had busy travel schedule. But why did they cancel my reservation when they had plenty of rooms available? They gave me a room but charged me a higher rate. But what was worse was a reeking “100% non-smoking room” with stale smoke! And we had toddler and elder. After some wait, we got another room which they seemed to spray it with febreze.  Next day, the room could still clearly smelled of smoke. Was it from before but covered by febreze or due to the air filtering system? And the bedroom TV wasn’t working.  Anyway awful 2- night stay!  Later I couldn’t check out on TV and called twice for a bill. The staff seemed to try hard to satisfy the guest. But the hotel management seemed to focus on pleasing…",10
"This is my first night at Venetian. The hotel is place and spacious.  However, the service of the employees are terrible and money-seeking.  We asked for additional room key temporarily due to the nature of our work on business trip, but they were not understanding and continued to require extra absurd payments. The way they explained was not only rude but clearly money-seeking.  Would not recommend due to poor service.",10
"I like the hotel appearance, it is grand, beautiful and worth to visit.  But with the rude staff, I am wonder how can they get the title of 5 stars ? Spending few thousands here with such services, I rather not staying here. There are several nice hotels nearby with good altitude, recommend you guys to go there.",10
Very very loud construction noise right on top of our room. I have an 11 month old baby who suffered badly because this. I begged them to stop the noise for only 2 hours while the baby is asleep and they refused. Why do you even accept guests in this room that is like a war zone??? Why do you charge me for this hell hole??? If you have construction planned for so many days you should NOT give the adjacent or nearby rooms to guests! I should NOT be paying for a room that traumatises my 11 month old baby.   Other problems: staff do not speak English. Inconvenient elevators. All public hallways smell like cigarette smoke which made me nauseous. Terrible mattress for baby crib. And so on. Please for the sake of your health and sanity AVOID THIS HOTEL. ,10
"We stayed here one night before a conference and it was the most expensive room of the trip; granted it was huge (70 sq m) 'cos there were 3 of us.   But, the whole place was completely overwhelming.   Imagine a giant mall, plonked on top of 4 separate casinos, topped off with a conference centre and several 1000 rooms. Oh, and there is a facsimilie of Venice interwoven with it all, complete with bridges and gondolas.   The whole place has massive corridors and 1000s of people (many being locals coming just to see the place as a tourist venue in itself).  We hated it (will never visit Vegas either).   Restaurants were very pricey (like poor ones charging  a lot) and obviously the designer   shops are too.   You practically needed a bus to get to your room from reception...we…",20
"  This is definitely one of the worse experience that I ever had so far in  my life !  The hotel is massive! It have 3700 rooms and because of the big shopping mall under it , it’s alway in a height occupancy !  When we arrived the lobby was like a train station! Almost the 1000 people queueing for check in and check out and only 20 front office staff !!  It took us a very long time for check in !  After they give the key to us they give us a map and asked us take the escalator and go the 3rd floor which one the biggest shopping mall in Macau located their and find North east entrance! The shopping mall is very huge and very busy , we couldn’t find the entrance if we accidentally didn’t met a Filipino staff !  The room is average nothing like a Macau 5 diamond ! The worse part…",10

"Room was amazing, big, spacious and newly renovated. All was great except one thing. One guy from FRONT OFFICE, Mr. Kenneth he’s attitude towards us is not good.  Also check in time should be 3pm, we arrive at the hotel almost 5pm. He ask us to wait for more than 1 hour. ",10
"First of all, I want to point out that I had previously spent 6 nights at the Venetian resort in Las Vegas and it had been the best hotel I've ever stayed in. So this time, I couldn't help to hold the same high expectation when I took my family (4 of us) to check in the Venetian (Macau) hotel. We booked 2 rooms with the ""Cotai view"" on the 26th floor and were staying there for 1 night. Unfortunately, the Venetian in Macau was nowhere near as good as its sibling's branch in Vegas. Here below were some of the reasons:  1) Cleanliness: Got 2 huge problems in the bathroom:  i) We found faeces/ poo marks on the handlebar of the toilet flush and also on the toilet wall. (Please see my pictures).   ii) There were a few small dead fleas on the bathtub and the bathtub was very dirty, it…",10

"For an amazing hotel overall stay in the wyn, not here! Over crowded, horrible service. Do not care about the customers at all   An amazing hotel but the most horrible customer service. Can’t even check in as a couple if you want, are told to wait for ages with your bags in a massive crowd. Also we left a key in our room and told to wait 30 mins to be let in our room even though we were able to provide all the details we needed. 3am and having to wait half an hour.

I have checked in this evening. I’m yet to use my bed. The pillows are stinking. There is a layer of dust on everything in the room. I guess sands is finding it difficult to maintain such a huge property. Just so disappointed. Will post dust laden room pics tomorrow  ,10
"We ordered a bread basket for breakfast in room. Staff on the phone said it would take around 15-20 mins. Food arrived after 45 mins. As we chose to pay on the spot, we did not check every thing served on the table, partly also because we did not expect anything so disappointing would happen in this 5-star hotel.   To my horror, I then found that one of the jam they served was already opened and consumed by half. My husband in bed could not believe what I said I had to repeat 3 times to him. We always like ordering breakfast in room in 5-star hotels and this is the first time something so disgusting happened.   Another reason we chose to pay on the spot is that we don’t need to line up again for check out. The checking in alone took us more than 30 mins lining up. The taxi line…",10

It is very confusing hotel and very crowded and you have to go a complete round to go to a place if you have a kids as in between Casino is present so nice place to visit but not for stay. Even they do t give any discount if we stay there like the other hotel like City of Dreams they give u a card for free even though u dont stay in there hotel with 10 percent discount on many of restaurant and show present in there hotel and around.  ,20
We were 2 families...4 adults 4 kids..... Never visit during indian vacation time.....in lobby u feel like u r at railway station in India....there was 2 hrs waiting for check in....all restaurants also have 1 hr waiting atleast during rush hrs....nd there are really some very good options in macau.....,20
Fairly Hyped and an extremely crowded venue. Place is not well maintained and not at all pleasant.  Minimal spoken English so brush up on your mandarin.   Head out of the venue to the traditional shops for a more realistic experience of Macau. ,10
"The hotel room type was incorrectly reserved, but the Venetian did not modify it.  They didn't even adjust the number of people or change the guest name. Even though there was an error in my reservation which was not my mistake.  The following is what has happened in the last five days.   I'm planning a family trip to celebrate my father's 60th birthday. (This is a very important day in our country because it is a blessing for longevity.That's why I'm even more upset about the problem.)     I booked a hotel through 3rd party channel, but when I saw the voucher after the payment, the reservation details in the voucher were different from the information they posted on the website.    I asked the agency about the matter and they asked me for time to check it. Because the answer…",10
"This is a horrible hotel. Stay anywhere else. You will even have to pay for water. The hotel is too big and they cannot bring service levels up to a decent acceptable level even after ten years. It took me a super long time to check in while my elderly father stood in the lobby. No courtesy chairs for your family while they wait while you take a super long time to check in. And they routinely allow other newcomers to cut the line because they paid to check,in more quickly. I was already paying almost $1000usd  a night for my room.and I need to pay to check in quickly? We were given three miserable bottles of water after which we were asked to pay. We were staying at Wynn on the Taipa side the night before. Much better service and as much water as you like. Finally the operator…",20
"This is an expensive hotel but remember it's a casino.  That means prostitutes.  It's not a place to bring kids.  We had a room full of prostitutes next door to our room, customers going in and out. We did not expect this.  They position themselves as a family destination in the summer- NOT.",10
"Firstly I hate to leave negative reviews and very rarely do but it is always this hotel and their stuck up guards which force me to. I love Macau but I try to now avoid this hotel when I can. Every hotel I never have a problem but there's always one guard who wants to make life difficult. Apparently they cannot accept a UK drivers license for a 28 year old yet 2 members of staff in the same place previously did and many more didn't even ask. When asked to ask their manager to check they refused to, they then told me they know I'm old enough but need a passport to get in. If they know I'm old enough then why are they asking for ID? I walked straight to the next entrance and went straight in and was only cutting through the casino anyway. There's always one guard here who makes it…",20

"First visited this hotel in 2008 when we stayed for only 1 night but had a pretty good recollection of the visit then. Thus was excited to visit the hotel again, booking a family suite for my young family for 2 nights this time.  Unfortunately the experience we had were much less impressive this time round. First impression was that the hotel has gotten really old. It seems they have done little or no improvements or proper maintenance for the last 10 years. Compared to their sister hotel at The Parisan, The Venetian looks and feel ancient. Next thing to hit you is how crowded and chaotic it is, with most of the guests coming from India and China.  The main hall has a distinct budget feel as a result with all the shouting and pushing going around. The restaurants and food courts…",20
"This hotel feels worn.  The carpets are worn, the fixtures are worn, the rooms smell old and worn.

First the limousine officer replied and said that they couldn't find the booking number. Replied by attaching the booking confirmation email screenshot.

The worst transportation arrangement experience I had.",10
"First, the hotel looks amazing with the canal and the great casino. As for the casino, if you want to have a drink it's impossible to find the staff. If you want service, the reception never answers, so you need to walk all the way down to the lobby which very very far because the hotel is big. Almost nobody speaks english and aren't nice of helpful. After gambling in MGM, i realized that the venetian is not that good. The room itself was amazing.",10
"The buses to the ferry are not clearly marked. Caused me to miss my Ferry. There are actually 2 different ferry terminals and was not explained properly by the staff.

Different lobbies and concierge gives you different answers",10

The room amenities are all great, however the tv does not notify you that movies are pay-per-view nor did I notice any information about the price before we turned one on. Maybe I didn't notice it on the screen, but you would think they would make it obvious since it is an additional charge. However, this was not what made the stay a disaster.

After I made my reservation, I was told that hotel do not have any free special arrangement service. OK! Fine.

The tacky imitations that you literally can't escape from is a horrendous reminder of how disillusioned the tourism industry in Macau is. Ugly replicas of paintings on the ceilings and walls an insult to renaissance art, a mockery of artwork. Everything in the building oozes cheap, commercial mass tourism with drone-like service from the front desk, ignorant tourists photographing every corner and the laughable ""canals"".

Everything about the hotel is unorganized. It really surprises me that this hotel has such high ratings.   Check in is a mess. It takes an hour to check in and the receptionist could not speak english properly.   Slow room service. No veg options. And highly highly expensive. We paid 20 k a room per night. This hotel is crowded worse than cst station mumbai.   The only plus point is the room size. Which is actually pretty huge. ,20
We arrived at 4pm and check in was 3. After over an hour lined up we finally got up to the counter. By now our two small children were very upset. Then to top it all off our rooms were not ready til 7pm. They gave us another room to sit in til then but was very annoying. The manager Sam was so good helping us with the complications and a credit for a lovely dinner and limo back to the ferry terminal. He was amazing and for this reason alone is why my rating is not lower. Now the casino is huge but we could not get a drink. Everyone we spoke to hardly understood English and apparently we had to go out of casino to a bar then bring drinks in again. So pathetic. Same with the Parisian. The Plaza Casino had a bar and an amazing barman. The games weren't very good but. Las Vegas is a…,20

Facilities at the hotel are endless, so much to see and do, revolving around the casino.  Shuttle buses to and from the airport and port are smooth.

"I have been staying in this hotel since its opening, usually once a year or two. Sadly I have seen the hotel continuously going down in both service and facilities. Here are several observations and I hope the management will take these comments seriously in their future plans.  a.	The room looks really tired. Some of the furniture looks aged and not properly maintained. One of the two TV sets in the room is an old “tube type” Philipps TV (which can be only found in a museum I suppose). b.	The customer mix has really changed over the years. I was totally annoyed by group tourists who were lousy and loud, yelling to each other in the hallways.  c.	Breakfast was a total chaos. It took me a while to get a cup of coffee (which by the way tasted awful) so I had to run to a Starbucks…",10
"Unfortunately, as I stayed in the Studio City, I can only base this review on what I saw the few hours I was here; however, this hotel was incredibly boring. The service was very slow and rushed where we did go, and it is very easy to get lost without knowing where to go. The model Venice itself was just shops, and felt very unrealistic and over the top. It was just the same after the same, and the gondolas were clearly a very boring experience as the water stretched for about 20m. Too commercial. Limited options of where to eat and drink, and no affordable cafes for a small coffee. Overall, I think I'll stick to the less grand but overall much, much better Studio City.",10
"I can finally appreciate the word 'mass luxury'. This hotel is lovely in terms of size, has ample food options, casino, free shuttle everywhere, shopping, et al. What you can't expect is great service, given the size, about 3000 rooms, of the property. They have good staff, but the queues are check-in, shuttle service, even food court somehow don't go well with the premium prices. Guess my opinion is different from the rest of the reviews here but I'm sticking to it. ",20
Was told at check-in by hotel staff that my original payment was a credit authorisation and can't be processed unless I have my foreign card with me. So I paid on the day of arrival in cash. Then contacted my bank regarding this and was informed I had in fact been double charged. And now the hotel is saying the original debit charge would take 2-3 weeks to refund.  Wasted 2 hours on customer service line and still no result. Shocking !,10
"We had a really average experience at this Hotel and wished we had have booked one of the hotels opposite this property, such as the Crown, Conrad or Sheraton.  Luckily we were only there for a night.  Once we had checked in (which was very efficient and attentive) we then had to wait in a que for 15 minutes to get into a lift.  It felt like they were herding cattle into a feed lot. This seemed to be a common occurance for us as the south wing of the Hotel in which were allocated a room was seriously under lifted. We decided to eat all of our meals outside of the Venetian as  the ambiance was not conducive.  The rooms are very spacious but jeez the beds are rock hard and the a/c kept on fluctuating temperatire all night.  We just couldn't wait to leave.",20
"...unless you like waiting in queues and walking long distances for everything.   The hotel was a disappointment from the beginning: when we arrived by shuttle bus from the ferry, it took us 10 minutes to find the right counter to  check-in. There was hardly any staff to tell us the way and, of course, no one to help us with the luggage. We had to queue up to check in which took  us around half an hour (!). The queue line was prepared to hold twice the people than what were there when we came, so prepare to wait up to an hour for checkin (see photos).  The rooms are big, yes, but also need a renovation. Whether it's the old-style TV or the stained floors - you can see that this place is worn out for sure.   There are queues for everything, and so for the breakfast. The breakfast…",10
"Had a problem every single day of my stay. Day 1 started with waiting 45min to check in because of the massive lines (I got in at 9pm...) then my tvs don't work in my room so I had to wait around for 5 different people to figure out what the problem was and then they ended up replacing them because they couldn't figure it out. This took about 4 hours. Day 2 I was rudely woken up at 4am by the occupant in the adjoining room (which is the hotels problem because the walls must be paper thin). I ended up moving rooms to avoid this happening the next day. So now in a new room, the new problem is that there was no hot water in the shower. Day 3 I leave my room around 10am and return at 6pm the room wasn't cleaned and the cleaner show up at 7:30pm wanting to clean.. so I tell them I'm…",10
"It was our first trip to Macau via Hong Kong. We heard so much about the Venetian Macao and though to give it a try. To our dismay, the room was so old and the bathtub was spoilt and typically, we didn't shower for a day as the tap was not working well and the water was super hot and can boil an egg!  Front desk was not able to communicate in English and the breakfast was disastrous and totally in the mess in terms of food presentation. The whole stay was totally bad and I would not recommend anyone to even consider this hotel until they rectify all the issue 360 degree. It was so bad until i fell so sick and have to cut short my stay.  I regretted so much for the amount paid to suffer in this hotel which i could use the money to pay to my preferred hotels. Obviously, we have…",20
"Over 25 million visitors a year and 6x more sales of casinos compared to Las Vegas that’s Macau. Unfortunately the former fisherman's village cannot meet this onslaught of visitors and I understand, because the infrastructures have not grown at the same pace. Arriving with the ferry from HK an unbelievable chaos, departure is even worse. It has taken us 40 minutes to wait for the hotel shuttle bus. Waiting outside under the sun for an 8 minutes Bus ride to the Hotel Venetian, an absolute no go. The story continues: after arriving at the lobby an endless queue, i.e. waiting time 45 minutes. The Venetian Macao Resort Hotel claims to have 3000 suites and 12,000 employees but I experienced no customer service at the check in. After successful managed the arrival problems followed by…",20
"Understaffed hotel for checking in, I suppose all their staff are assigned to the empty casino tables. Otherwise an OK stay, wifi is free although you might need to reconnect from time to time. Breakfast is average. The shopping areas and the mini-canal is well maintained and full of shops, not sure how their prices play out compared to Hong Kong shops. All in all not a bad place to stay except for the poor check in service area, good thing they have express checkout so I dont have to experience their ""reception attraction"" again",20
"Suites were lovely but check in took 2 hours of queueing! Not what you'd expect from such an expensive hotel.   Furthermore, they mixed up our booking and tried to charge us for an extra guest that we'd already paid for.  Even when we managed to pull up the emails from the venetian booking team, they were unapologetic.   Awful. ",20
Used to be a top choice for Macau.. But NOT anymore.. Rooms are smelly (even for non-smoking room). Fixture and furnitures are all worn out.. like a 3-Stars hotel.. Definately need a MAJOR renovation for guest rooms... but no doubt the room size is huge...,20
"Don't stay here. The rooms are dirty and smell of smoke. We booked a suite but it was barely larger than a single bedroom in other hotels. Breakfast is like feeding time at the zoo. Staff are rude. The pool area is nice - the only nice thing about this hotel. There are much better hotels nearby. The location is convenient, and good restaurants downstairs, but I still recommend staying elsewhere.",10
"avoid this property especially if you are going with children. Huge casino right in the center. The shortest route to go anywhere in the hotel is always through the casino. And kids are obviously not allowed to enter the casino. Hence, it generally take a half a kilometer walk to go from one place to other along with kids. The rooms are old and nothing to talk about. After paying 18000 HKD for a room you are made to stand in half an hour in the check in queue, while look at your family sitting on the lobby floor along with other guests. I am sure one will get way better service at this rate in another property. Most of the hotels in cotai strip are nearby. one can take free shuttle buses to visit these properties. Advisable to stay else where and visit the property to see its…",20
"Count 1-2 hours waiting in line for checking!!! If you want to waste your holidays standing up in queue, choose this hotel! Else try another one. Never seen this. Most of the check-in counters are unattended and the few staff taking care of clients take their sweet time. What's the point of treating clients like this?!!! Does the management think clients are to be treated like cattle?  DONT GO THERE!!!",10
"I booked a bella suite, the second tier from all the choices, and apparently all bella suites are double bed, no king size bed. So when we requested a king size bed, the receptionist told us that it will be a downgrade to the king size bed suite and if that is okay. So we said, yes that is fine, we just need one bed. Then after working on checking in about 3 mins, she said she found a room and upgrade us to a royale suite. So we were happy. And we even commented, that's very nice, we are now upgraded not downgrade anymore. Apparently, we were not upgraded as what the receptionist told us. Royale suite is the lowest and our room smells like fresh paint. I mean, we already said it's okay of the king size bed is lower price, and we accept that. So they don't have to pretend…",10
"Went as a group of 5 to stay one night. Check-in didn't open until 3 which is very late. We weren't allow to queue for check in together, so one of our party had to stand on her own in a line for an HOUR AND A HALF whilst the rest of our party waited at the side with our bags. Once we reached the counters, the hotel had our booking down incorrectly - 2 suites for 4 people instead of 5 - and tried to charge us an extra fee. Luckily we had evidence in the form of emails from the Venetian discussing the booking and cost, however regardless of this the check-in staff needed to send for a manager, and then manager said that she would need to make phonecalls to verify this. By this point we were hungry, annoyed and completely fed up of waiting, so told the staff we would just pay the…",10
"If you are going here with children or the elderly, BEWARE!  As the children cannot go through the casino, there was miles of walking up and down escalators, around shopping malls to get back to our lift lobby.    There are also long queues for everything.  It started at check-in where they rudely informed us that only one person could be in the check-in line as the queues were too long.  The wait there was a good half hour.  Then came the trek up to the room located on the North wing, another good 15 minutes from the main lobby.  Then the breakfast queue at Cafe Deco, another good 30 minutes even though there were empty tables.  As for the connecting rooms we received, one smelled so badly, probably of vomit or paint.

I have stayed several times at the sister properties in Vegas and Singapore but to my disbelief the Macau property is horrifying. Don't stay here if you are sensitive to mold. The hallways and rooms need paint. Old and crusty. I left the A/C off to keep the mold from blowing into our room. Staff laughed at me when I complained. Key didn't work the 2nd and last night. A nightmare. Save your money and stay elsewhere. I'm selling my stock in the morning too. ,10
I stayed last friday for 1 night. Its Too Big and Too Busy for me. I can live with that for 1 night but…. When I returned to my room $700 was missing from my Travel wallet which was inside my bag. If thats not bad enough when I reported it The Hotel GM really didn't care one little bit. Be warned !!!  :(,10
"Well, very disappointing, but it saved me money, I couldn't wait to get out. In the middle of the shopping mall you walk into the Casino, there was no sense of excitement, fun or anticipation. I'm use to laughing and excitement,  people drinking and having fun, but nothing not even talking. All very serious. The only good thing was there was no smoking.",20
Great place with everything under one roof. Hotel rooms hundreds if metres away from reception and you must go through tbe casino to get anywhere. On 12 September 2p16 the hotel had a conference and there were literally hundreds if not thousands of guests trying to get in the lifts to go to their room. It took me more than 2 hours to get to the lifts. This is unacceptable when it should only take 1-2 minutes to do so  Staff and security most unhelpful and were herding guests as if they were cattle. Could bot recommend this hotel to anyone.,20
"If you're thinking of visiting Macau with your family, never stay in this stupidly built hotel! It's absolutely designed for casino gambling, not families with kids. The minute you arrive to the hotel if you have kids, you need to go up the escalator or take the elevator to a mall and walk 10 minutes just to see another hotel entrance and take the elevator or escalator again to the hotel. This of course providing that your kids wouldn't stop at all of the mall shops while searching for the hotel entrance so you can go to your room! This's very annoying especially when you're tired and wants to go to your room! It's basically designed for gamblers and never thought, not even 1% about families with kids when they designed it. Oh, it's normal to see the security guards at the…",10

No live entertainment no live music no lounge no daily shows nothing When you step outside the hotel there is no shop no restaurant nothing to see The Italian restaurant serves the worst pizza I ever had and at US$30 it's a rip off !

"rude staff. first impression was checking in when some guy just walks up to reception and starts screaming and abusing people, staff just let him scream for 5mins.. no one cared. Room... large yes but tired and low quality worn furniture. The writing desk next to the window looked like someone had taken an axe to it with random chunks missing. The toilet seat too had cracks taken out. Maybe the same axe man. We watched a One FC event at the Cotai Arena. After we walked around for 45mins asking where a bar was. No bars open at 11pm...

Well, I was wrong. Really regrets booked total 4 nights there.   The premises is quite big and easily lost your way and don't really see any hotel service staff around nor security. All security are only standing at the entrance of the casino.  The food court food are all over priced.  Before visiting I made a few calls to the hotel and was told the currency used in hotel are in HKD.

"On a positive note, the room was great, the service was good and the quality of the room service food was good but for me the negatives far outweighed the positives. The layout of this hotel is the worst I've ever seen. There is a huge casino between the lobby and the elevator to the rooms. You need to walk about 250metres from the lobby to the elevators. If you have persons under 21 years who aren't allowed in the casino then you need to navigate through a maze of shopping arcades and canals adding to that already inconvenient walk. One wrong turn could add 5 minutes of extra walking. The pool is over 300metres from the elevators and the gym about 200. The place is also very crowded with loud and sometimes obnoxious guests with very little concept of social etiquette. Finding a…",10
"We have visited Macau several times before and have always dreamed of staying at the Venetian. However, little did we know that the rooms were very dated.... and not like the photos!! We still got lost finding our hotel room after we stayed there for 4 nights, it is like they built the shopping mall and casino and then thought, 'we are a hotel and have to put in guest rooms'. The check in staff were not very welcoming and the pool was hard to find- a 10 minute trek. The carpet felt dirty and we could hear the lift from the first room they gave us before moving. The pool area was very nice and the only place were we felt as though we were staying in a hotel. We will not be staying there again",20
"I booked this hotel from hotels.com and stayed there for 2 night, 6/13 and 6/14/2016.

I tried to talk to that hotel but they said they can't find flea from that room. But the truth is, my son and my wife got flea bite there. It's a very crazy experience and we have to throw away all of our clothes and luggage. We never got such flea bites before, and we thought it's caused by mosquito; but the 2nd day those bites become much worse so we send pictures to our US pediatrician, he reviewed those pictures and he told us most likely they are flea bites.

Very very poor customer service. Looking at customer service it is not even 1 star. Went with family and I had two small kids with me. Fun started as soon as I entered into this property I had 4 luggage and two kids with one in stroller. It was middle of night when I arrived there and no one from concierge helped me to checkin and luggage guys were there and nobody helped me until I gone to reception which was very far from concierge and then I had to go back to front to give luggage tag to luggage claim and then they picked up my stuff. And they give you coupon for food and then when you go for dining resturent will say it's not valid here even though it's mention in that discount book. Not recommended to anyone.,10
"This is a BIG hotel with 4000 rooms! and it blows your mind. You need atleast 4 days to cover this hotel. The first two levels is just food and shopping. It also has a Venetian style boating which is very charming. It has a artificial sky which looks very real. Express checkout is a breeze, if you dont use the in room bar, just drop your keys in a box on your floor and walk away - simple. The biggest pain is the checkin. We stood in line for almost 2 hours which was worst than any airport immigration. This was the most disappointing aspect of our stay which is why I give it 2 stars.",20
"The Venetian is a fantastic hotel, no doubt. From the rooms to hotel interiors, they have got everything going to their credit. However, the sheer scale at which they operate makes the whole experience for the guest less personalized, special and sometimes pure hassle! Unfortunately, that was the case for me.   I was travelling with my mom, who is about 60. Given her age, she needed rest after the travel but we were made to wait 1.5 hours in the queue for check-in. The front-desk asked if we needed assistance with the baggage to be taken to the room, I said yes but i was told it would take upto 45 minutes to reach the room. Tired of waiting for so long already, i just dragged my luggage up on my own.   Once we got to the suite, we were tired and hungry, and ordered room service.…",20

If you are having a baby like me, the casino would block some of the way to the lift lobby and you need to go to the mall level to get around. Very inconvenient!  The whole building is big, it could take you long time to get to the right lift lobby to go up your room and then to take you another long walk from the lift lobby to your room on your floor.   Rooms are big which is the only thing I think I could appreciate. But the room is very smelly, I am sure lots of previous guests smoked in the room. The carpet, the sofa, the bed, the wall...basically everything is full of third hand smoking. I have hanged my own towel in the living room during the day and when…",10
I visited Venetian Macau in May with my family. The place is overall decent but being huge has its own disadvantages.The breakfast tables saw huge queues. Overall food was average. Besides that there are no activities except for pool and Golf club. The mall on the first few floors are unattended and expensive. Too many people moving around aimlessly add to the overall crowd.,20

Reception did not take my credit card details at check-in, so I had to pay everything in cash. Found out I was not the only one. 2. Therefore paid room service in cash. Change was only returned after calling. 3. Rooms are very moist smelly and you can actually taste the fungus 4. Ready for the gym? Get prepared to walk past the smoking rooms first!  5.Food: If you are not a Chinese food aficionado, forget it. Even the spaghetti Vongole have one organ too many. 6. Internet access was on and off. Moreover, no international calls possible! When I called upon customer service they told me to buy a phone card!   All in all, a casino resort aimed at the Chinese market…",20
"As the title implies, it has some redeeming features but overall I was just disappointed.  I called to book the room on the day (was catching the ferry from HK), and booked a Rialto Suite for a rewards club rate (free to join, can sign up at the casino). The lady on the other end of the line spoke very broken English but we got there.  So, you can imagine my surprise when we arrived at the hotel two hours later (3.30pm) and were told (after a 35 minute queue) that the room type we booked wasn't available.  The receptionist and I couldn't really communicate properly so she called someone on the phone.

Majority of staff also couldn't speak english or seemed like they didn't want to speak english.   Had a really bad incident on the last night which ruined our stay and the way it was handled.

This is certainly not Vegas style and wouldn't make my 5 star rating.",20

Staff were mediocre at best and the rooms are tired and dated. Jens Busch, the front desk Directory was very good however. Stay elsewhere if possible.",10

I have just rang them to be told that we used the NON - FREE WI-FI   My advice to ANYONE that stays at this cheating resort to NOT use the WI -FI as you will be charged and unbelievable amount ..... They also fail to inform you of this until you get home so you cannot question the excessive amount...,10
"Stayed here without a choice for work.  Having stayed there, I know I would have preferred any other hotel.  Growing up in Vegas I do my best to avoid fake facade or theme hotels.  As our limo pulled up, I immediately was haunted by memories of Vegas, but I could not really see the hotel through the thick haze.  Once inside, the noise of the casino, the gaudy artwork and architecture and the shops made me feel back at home and not in a good way.  I could not avoid passing through the noisy casino to get to my room and each morning I had to politely decline the many prostitutes hanging in the casino awaiting their prey.

The Negatives:  This ranks as one of the biggest disappointments in the last 20 years for us.    a. 35 Minutes to check in.  We were herded like cattle into a queuing system that combined 'check-out' with 'check-in' and the 'check-out' line was highly favoured.  b. North Suites - 10 minutes' walk from the check-in desk.  c. Room service food was terrible - cold, flavourless and to use a single word, 'disgusting'!  d.

The room was large with a good view but the place was dusty and not very clean. There was no bath tub even though the bathroom was massive!  The worst thing about this hotel was the checkin which took almost an hour (and this was on a Monday which should be quieter). The hotel itself was massive... Absolute maze with no clear directions on how to get from A to B (obviously they want you to keep getting lost so that you can't escape the casino and shops), so be warned!!!

"Dated room - at least the basic suites. Things falling off, cracks, broken things, didn't feel like a clean room at all. Also had a bit of a stench. Overall experience was that of a mass scale hotel with 0 five star services - except for an occasional smiling staff. Staff was average - the front desk person put us into the worst possible room in spite of asking for a better view. The breakfast was the worst I have seen in a 5-star. Felt like a shop floor of factory workers queuing up and the staff and everyone around all over the place to pick up food. Some of the food (e.g. cheeses) were stale. Its a beautifully made hotel - pity they don't know how to maintain this property and more importantly give the guests a five star experience in spite of the scale of operations.  You…",10
"While the shuttle bad of other hotels are waiting for the clients, we, as client of Venetian are welcomed by a long queue with very infrequent shuttle schedule, just a harsh experience for us taking 2 young kids there. I suppose this should not be the quality of such for a 5-star hotel! ",10
"The room was very huge and luxurious, but there is no shop that sell baby clothes. And i hope the venetian can provide more children playground (like QUBE), so when parents spend their time at the casino, children can play too.",10
"Only big room, buffet lunch and breskfast expensive and no food to select and low quality, the decoration is same as ten year before, nothing change and old feeling, no amazing, Galaxy or Holiday inn or intercontential would be better",20
"What a real shame as I took a large suite in the North Tower and requested a non smoking room which stank of cigarettes. Clearly the management do not monitor guests behavior within these rooms.  The place is huge and it is a nightmare to navigate around without requesting the assistance of staff members. The hotel appears to be majority Chinese staff whom are rude, rarely smile, do not know how to great customers and speak little if NO English at all.  As a white westerner I was so thankful to the Filipino and Indian staffs assistance, friendly smiles and great English.  I did being this matter up with reception whom was Chinese and all I was told it's the law to employ majority Chinese in which I appreciate and accept BUT BUT put these Chinese staff on a course to learn the…",10
"After staying previously at the Venetian in Vegas and not particularly liking it I should have known better, but the rest of my family quite enjoyed the former and persuaded me to book. However, none of us particularly enjoyed the Venetian in Macau.  Rooms are large and well appointed but he "" non smoking"" room stank of stale smoke- we changed rooms to a slightly less smelly one but the air never really felt fresh. If you have kids the only way out is to walk through the huge, confusing and crowded shopping centre. I felt trapped and it didn't make for a relaxing stay at all. Pools were fine but long walk to get to them.  Even if you want to spend your holiday in a shopping centre the prices are high by UK standards, especially food items ( including £5 for a bottle of water and…",20

"This was the  third hotel I stayed in, during my three week vacation in August 2015, after a visit to Singapore and Malaysia. We always wanted to stay in the Venetian ever since it opened, but have been put off by its teething problems, reports of long queues etc. I eventually booked here to try out for a night as I got a reasonable rate compared to other 5 star hotels on the Cotai Strip.  I visited with two of my daughters as my wife had work commitments back in Hong Kong.  I was concerned about check in but it was  generally painless in the queue system. We arrived about 2pm, the peak check in time.  I was asked if I wanted a non smoking or smoking room, I answered non smoking room.  Although the queue was long, the line moved very quickly and considered efficient as the hotel…",10
"To begin with, the T.V. in the room are still living in the 80s. Complimentary tea & coffee are Nescafe & Dilmar whereby their Sands Hotel in Singapore is giving you Nespresso & TWG.  Too much PRC tourist, loud & rowdy. Hotel staff are just as rude especially the day we check in, 1 staff just brush us off saying ""no English!""  I am sure a front office staff welcoming a checking in guest could get a English speaking staff to assist us. The only good & helpful staffs are the concierge in the Main & West Lobby. Very professional & helpful. The are the reason this review is not rated terrible. The priority staff, when we request for 2 boxes of bath salt, 2 bath foam,1 shower cap. They send the housekeeping with 1 set of amenities. We have to call again & they send a bagful of…",20

For us to collect them, we had to go to 3 different counters (where one was at the other side of the hotel)...

"The whole hotel was full of cigarette smell, including non-smoking rooms.  Even bed linen and duvet smelled awful. A hell for non-smokers.  Also not a place for senior persons, as there was no place to sit at all at the lobby while waiting an hour just to check in!  Extremely tardy reception check-in.  Concierge was a failure.  Booked and paid for an hour's limousine service, but the driver did not show up until after 40 minutes (leaving only 20 minutes' ride).  The concierge did not apologise, nor offered any compensation.  Absolutely disgraceful.  Failure on all accounts.",10

"While visiting Hong Kong my husband and I took the fast jet boat from to Macau for an overnight stay at the Venetian Hotel. We always stay at the Venetian Hotel when in Las Vegas, Nevada and thought this one would be just as nice. Wrong!  No matter where you stay in Macau, when you arrive there expect crowds of people around you being herded to the bus with your hotel's name on it. Once we arrived at the hotel we waited in a long line to get inside the hotel and to the registration desks. Once inside the hotel it did not look at all like the ornate over-the- top Las Vegas Venetian, disappointingly. While checking in the man assisting us offered me a choice of one of the several cards he was holding in his hands. The one I chose turned out to be a free night at the Venetian, so…",10
"Dear Travelers!  If you are looking to spend your time trying to push through hordes of tourist groups, then the Venetian is the place to be. Its loud, crowded, the rooms are old and stale, while the carpets have stains in the lobby so you have to tip toe about!  The check in queue is so long, that it took us ONE HOUR to get our keys. Another 15 min later we were standing at the door with two keys that did not work! 15 min later a staff was able to let us in. What hotel that claims to be a 4 or 5 star has front door to room time of 1.5 hours?  Breakfast is included, but does not even have simple basics like Fresh orange juice. Instead, there's powdered juice, very cold food, and even the eggs are pre-made for you at the ""live"" counter!  We went there on the Beauty and Beast…",20
"Huge, impressive, and all the other superlatives that go with such a large establishment of this nature, the one biggest disappointment is that non-smoking means just that.... The whole wing of the hotel section we were allocated had that residual smoke smell about it. You cannot cleanup smokers remains that easily and unfortunately the North East wing seems to have been rebadged.   The rooms are huge, the facilities great, shopping seems expensive to HK, but the masses are from the mainland and flock here for an experience.   Macau is a great place to visit the blend of Portuguese and Chinese cultures, and Asias gambling capital.",20

Its large and not well directed for choosy ones who would like to know were they are going and not keep guessing all the time if this would lead to that or that!!   I had great expectations from their bellagio suite as everyone before us gave super opinions of the place but we just felt was another ordinary suite at a 4 star...  This should not be more than $200 at tops, The check-in at both entrance felt like we were at the train stations, one from the developing world and another from a Third world. Not worth some $699 that we paid with breakfast!!  As a couple, you would do best to avoid this place.  Visited June 2014",20

Afterall, we have paid almost hkd3000 per night for the room so we have quite HIGH expectation on it. However the Venetian kept making us really Unhappy! The thing is we stayed there during the ""1/5 Golden Week"", we understand that there were hell lot more of tourists but it was not a proper excuse for giving us things we requested (e.g. Pillow, slippers and opener) ONE hour delay. During the process, my friend and I was asked to call different lines.  Also, as mentioned it was CROWDED everywhere, but the transport arrangement sucked. The rigid shuttle bus schedule made us mad when you saw bus and driver all available plus a super long queue. And it…",20
"I was surprised at the efficient check-in given the size of the hotel, that's the end of the good. Tacky rooms in need of some TLC, swarms of people, terrible breakfast. Stay somewhere else, there are lots of lovely hotels nearby that are infinitely better. ",20
"There are so many rooms here that be prepared to be treated like one in a million. Check in is a nightmare. Waiting in line is a nightmare. Walking from check in to the room was l-o-n-g.  And then even though our room was classified as non-smoking there was still a definite smell of smoke.  Calls to the operators were a challenge because they seemed to only speak Chinese and had poor command of English.  The rooms didn't have laundry bags, which Would be considered pretty basic for a hotel that charges hundreds of US dollars.  Not a pleasant stay. Certainly don't get what you pay for. I Would recommend a smaller, newer hotel for sure.",20
"stay clear if you have kids as you will have to make a long, long detour to reach your room, passing by the Mall's food court. Does not matter if you pay top dollars, you will be diverted. if you have ever wanted to experience the most amazing buffet breakfast, then skip the Venetian's one. Food choice and quality is sub standard. Our suite lacked of freshness. Overall, Venetian is a beautiful hotel but not worth to pay high price for no exclusivity.",20
"This review is strictly for hotel, not for the mall grounds I think we have to be able to differentiate, as the shopping grounds are just fantastic and amazing.   The hotel itself is starting to feel outdated the room although huge, but that is about all that is good about this hotel.  The hallway constantly smells like mildew it is pretty gross, the tv's a poor mans flatscreen tv and the bathroom fixtures are starting to fall apart as our bathtub was leaking.    For someone that travels a lot, the price they are asking for does not match the what you should be getting, not to say our room was filled with dust that our whole family had a coughing fit.

Then the breakfast voucher showed breakfast finishing at 11am... so my wife went to breakfast at 9am and the restaurant was closed...  they resolved this by allowing her to go to another restaurant, but also by taking the voucher off her, so we could not use it for the second mornings breakfast...  this took over an hour of arguing to resolve... as no-one…",10
"We recently  spent 3 nights at the Venetian, it is not a five star hotel. The Cotai view suite we had was dark and dinghy with a terrible stale smoke smell. The bathroom vanity had black mould in the grout, th carpet was dirty and the lounge was stained, not what you would except from this hotel.  Look elsewhere , not good value for money.",20
"It's like a factory in the hustle and bustle.  tacky interior , smelly room!! There's nothing but a huge hotel. If you get a service, you should ask for it 3 times. I asked them to give me a non smoking room cuz i'm pregnant. But i was given a room that smells strange. And then they just sent a housekeeper with an air freshener! What I want was a different room. We waited and waited. It took an hour to send a manager. She showed diffrent rooms. The second room was also stinky and the next one smells moldy. I guess I had no choice.  If you want to receive a great service, relax and go shopping at the same time, I would suggest choosing a diffrent hotel.  In addition, Breakfast  buffet was terrible ! ",10
"Booked 2 nights in a suite for family of 4. Checked in and found amenities for only two. Asked for two extra sets and room service staff arrived with a bag for 1 extra set. Took another 2 complaints before they got it right. Bathroom door hard to close, literally having to slam it to close and push hard to open. Bad luck if you had to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night and wake-up the family. Internet in the room was extremely poor. Better internet reception in the public area. To top it off, the toilet was block in last morning, after 2 phone calls and waited for 45 minutes for maintenance to fix. Have been to Las Vegas and got much better value and service. Overall very disappointing.",20
"We went to stay at the venetian thinking it was going to be a treat and ended up forking out quite a lot for it. Service was awful, from the time the maid refused to get us another complementary bottle of water, to the time I found faeces all over the seat of the toilet in the casino and the toilet attendent refused to acknowledge it, to the fact that there was no room turning down service or breakfast included.    This is a resort which bills itself as a luxury retreat but is instead a total rip off with no focus on hospitality or service. The room was actually very nice looking and the bed very comfortable and clean, but I was stunned by how little attention there was on the guest for the 5 star prices we paid.  Note this isn't a grouchy review from someone that lost at the…",10
Location is great but you feel like you're staying in a shopping mall.  Hallways smelt of smoke too.  We were allowed a late check out time but had to pay for wi-fi.  Pay for wi-fi in a fricking 5 star hotel!!!  The casino is the largest in the world and the location is great for serious gambling and/or events at the Cotai arena.  Room was spacious with a good view and quiet.  Comfortable bed and splendid bathroom.  Not worth the money overall though.  Complete lack of a personal touch due to the size.  Wasn't given any information on breakfast i.e. where to go etc so can't tell you about that.,20
"Premium pricing for average service and overcrowded facilities. This is what we experienced during our one night stay at the outrageously overpriced Venetian -   Spotted blood stains on one of the unused towels in the bathroom  The room was not properly cleaned and we could see cobwebs in one corner  The electric kettle kept in our room was extremely dirty with moulds on the inside. We called housekeeping to replace the kettle and they replaced it with another equally dirty kettle.   The suite comes equipped with a mini bar stuffed with overpriced snacks, soft drinks and alcohol.  The hotel lacks basic courtesy to even include plates and cutlery. We called the house keeping at least five times to get us some knives and tea bags. Finally after 45 minutes they did actually get the…",10
"I really didn't like this hotel. It was tacky in my opinion, and the breakfast area was a crazy noisy chaos. I didn't feel any luxury feeling even though the rooms are enormous and full of marble, everything is just very fake. It was also tremendous cold, the air condition so cold that we all got a cold. Impossible to turn it down we just had to put on winter jackets in November. I couldn't stop thinking of all the money they could have saved just lowering the AC in all the halls and lobbies, the hotel is huge its hard to find ones way. I couldn't wait to leave this place!",20
"In terms on price/quality this hotel is definitely not worth… Top prices for average service and overcrowded facilities (bear in mind that the casino and the shopping malls are open to everybody).  The hotel is a massive building holding 3,000 rooms and suites and a fake Venice full of malls. The reception is like a railway station full of signs and directions. One needs a map to go anywhere. Since it a huge place it´s very difficult to have good service in such a big place, but the truth is that you are paying a lot of money and deserve more than the average service you are offered in this hotel.  The suites are just big and lack soul and warmth with lots of golds and marbles, making it a baroque and uncomfortable. Shoddy flat screen TV's with a poor resolution.  It is…",20
"We had planned a 5 nights 6 days trip to HongKong and Macau in last week of December 2014. Having heard so much about the venetian and my husband having seen the sister property at Vegas, was quite convinced that we had to experience the place. Hence we booked ourselves at this highly expensive resort thinking it will be worth the money.   Well, property wise it was worth it. Experience wise , it was not. It was bursting with people. the moment we stepped out of the ferry terminal in Macau, we were made to stand in queues everywhere - to get into the shuttle which would drop us to Venetian, to deposit our luggage before check-in, to check-in, to have breakfast in either of the restaurants !

"Dear Venetian,  With the reference to my booking number 4408147 / 4408138I was travelling with my parents which are senior citizen and 2 of my babies which are only 1 and 2 years old. I would give credit to the hotel to offer me the express check in pass and also a late check out. However overall we are truly disappointed with our 3days 2night stay at Venetian Macau. This is due to the poor crowd control by the Venetian Management during the New Year Eve countdown outside the main lobby with the theme Winter in Venice. One of the door was closed due to massive crowd out there and we were directed to walk to the drop off main lobby. I just wonder how come Venetian Hotel guest wasn't given priority to this event? As I saw a lot of outsiders joining the event, I am not saying that…",10
"The Venetian is just like a dirty big Yank Cadillac.   Poorly designed, old technology and ugly.  Prices are unbelievable AUD $10.00 for a can of coke.  Rooms are not designed and laid out well with obsolete technology and if you have a suite you spend ten minutes walking around turning off all the lights. The rooms aren't smart wired. Lack of international adaptors and messy wiring around the desk.   No top sheet on the bedding only the duvet. When asked for a second sheet it took forever trying to explain what is required. Towels are small and thin in quality, and the amenities are cheep and tacky.   The suites are just big and lack soul and warmth.

We didn't enjoy our stay and wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.  To begin with, we got three rooms in the possibly the worst section of the hotel.  The lowest floor at the end of the hallway.  Long walk from the lifts and a view of the roof construction next door.  The whole place just reeks of over-commerialization.  The attached mall is full of luxury shops and Chinese tourists. It was crowded everywhere.  It was hard to find empty tables at the food court during meal time.  Prices at the food court and mall restaurants were on the high side, even relative to top HK restaurants.  TVs in the room…",20

Upon our arrival they told us the spa was closed. There was also a 1000 hkd price increase between the phone reservation and check in. But as we checked in at 1130 pm it was too late to change or dispute.   The non smoking suite smelled heavily of cigarettes.  Max at the front desk was nice.  The concierge found us an alternative spa that was open late.  Most things at the hotel are as you'd expect. It's Macau though. Breakfast is with another thousand or so people, it's all built for massive groups of ppl to gamble, so any personal touch or feeling of genuine quality gets lost amongst the masses of people and slot…",20

"With such a price, I would think free wifi should be included. But it wasn't!  Free wifi is only provided to guests who book the room through their official website!  We booked through Agoda, so if we wanted to have internet access in our room, we had to pay for an additional MOP 168 for 1 day - that's only 24 hours of usage.    The sign and direction for the shuttle bus area was not clear enough. For a few times we actually got lost.  The directions should be more clear and easier to follow. The price and quality of food at food court was horrible.  I would rather spend money on food in somewhere else. There should have been a free shuttle bus to San Malo area. I think it's a place to get bored easily. I would love to see more performance at the streets in the shopping area.",20
This Hotel is made for travellers who love to travel in groups without any touch of personalised service.   Waiting for airport transfer and later for check in at hotel at long queues.  Walking to the rooms is a long way passing the casino security with restrictions like no sunglasses and no carrying no cam in your hand. As men you find special attention by Chinese and Philippine prostitutes waiting in casino area for customers.  The rooms are very spacious and comfortable.   After I visited already the Venetian in Lad Vegas the Hotel there is much better.      ,20

As early as nov. 9, I was trying to book with them through email, I figured I just book through email since I was already talking with them anyway. I provided my credit card details and all. They only replied to me on Nov. 13, at first they were apologetic and told me that they can honor the discount since it was a delay on their part. But after a day, I got another email which said that they can't give me the discount rate that they had even though it was clearly their fault when they only replied to my email after 5 days. Each time I emailed back, a different person would reply to me. Its truly frustrating, never…",10
Stayed for a night just to experience a Macau casino hotel. Chose the Venetian as we wanted to see how well they had recreated Venice in the form of a shopping mall.   The hotels website makes a big deal of offering free wifi and late check out if you book via its website - we did and got neither. Instead we were offered wifi for 160 MOP ( about £15 after tax). Ironically wifi is free on the free shuttle buses so if you need it just go to the west lobby and stand next to a bus.   Check in is not as slick as in other hotels - and not available at all arrival points - be prepared for a walk. Beware the sneaky attempts to upsell you.

The checking-in at the reception was slow, the staffs were unfriendly and they look grumpy. However, could not disagree with the fact that the hotel room were spacious and well maintained. stayed in the west wing and the housekeeping lady for the 11th floor was extremely friendly. Had initially checked with the receptionist during checking in and she was confident in telling me the wifi is complimentary in room.

The lady checking us in tried to up sell us to a larger room and a breakfast package. We also booked a deal which entitled us to late check out - we were not given this late check out. We ordered room service for breakfast and were very disappointed: the food was of a low standard and some listed items were missing. Worse, we asked if we could use the swimming pool after check out (as is permitted in most other hotels) - we were told that as you need a key card to enter the pool area we would not be permitted to use the pool. Overall furnishings in the hotel room are dated (but kept clean by the maid staff). As a frequent visitor to Macau I…",20
"I am currently staying at the Venetian for my birthday. The service here is appalling and the food at the breakfast restaurant was pathetic (wet plates, ketchup everywhere and no fresh eggs). They even have a so called Michelen Star restaurant called the Golden Peacock - this by no means is close to any Michelen Star with the food being cold and rude service.   After raising the above issues with the general manager, I was informed that the breakfast restaurant is outsourced hence not part of Venetian's responsibility - which is contradictory as they include it in the package they sell to their customers.   No efforts made by the Manger to improve our stay.   In summary, the worst experience I have had ever in staying at a 'luxury' hotel. Would not recommend to anyone. ",10

I have been sitting on the FLOOR in the foyer along with about 50 others waiting for my husband to check us in.  The queue is roughly the same long. Have been here for nearly an hour now.  At least I can sit. My husband has to just stand and wait.  If you can't cope with this many people. ..why accept our bookings? Not happy right now. ,10

First some obvious comments: too crowded, waiting in line for check in, big walking distances to the room, no personal attention. But well I guess this is what everybody knows when they book this hotel, its just so massive. Its something they cannot change, its just what comes with running a big hotel, however points to improve:  - wifi internet: is overcharged and only available in the room - tv / remote controls: outdated and dirty - i had a pillow that smelled like old sweat, luckily i there was a spare pillow - somebody emptied his nose on the wall, and not cleaned - directions in hotel are not clear - restaurants in the hotel are overpriced - luggage service to bring luggage…",20
It is definitely a place to visit and check off the list. But if you've been to Vegas you will surely be disappointed with Macau especially if you're not a gambler. The casinos are extremely smokey and overcrowded. At the Venetian there was a non-smoking section it was very small but still reeks of smoke. The majority of the gambling is table games so if you're into slot machines you won't find much to play with most of the slot machines being very old. Do you get out of the casinos and go to restaurant bro we highly recommend the restaurant O Santos which I did a separate review for. Getting to Macau we recommend paying the extra few dollars to upgrade to premium service on the turbo Ferry. You bypass the lines and it really makes for a smooth transition,20
"What a disappointment! Unless you are a hard-core gambler, avoid this place at all costs.  Okay, the room was very nice.  That's about the only good thing I can find to say about the Venetian.  Although old-fashioned with a very out of date decor and weak shower pressure.  Oh, and wi-fi was MOP 160 per day! The worst thing about it was the crowds--the public spaces were jam-packed with HORDES of tourists, mostly from Mainland China, which made even walking through the lobby like getting through Times Square on a New Year's eve.  The hotel pools were TERRIBLE.  All four of them.  The water was only a meter deep, and the temperature of the water was like a hot bath in each of the four pools (it was a hot day and we were desperately seeking to cool off).  There was an HOUR wait to…",10
Was our first time staying at Venetian Macau. Had a lot of expectations as there were so many good reviews and the hotel looks great from outside. It turned out that the whole experience was extremely disappointing. The place could be for you if you are into gambling but not if you want to have a relaxing weekend.   1) you need to walk through the gambling crowd / whole bunch of visitors wanting to take a look at the architecture and all. the smoky areas before reaching checkin  2) we checked in after 3pm and the room is still not available. No explanation given.  3) we need to scold and continue to insist to get a room in the other tower after over 40 mins. By then we lost all our mood.  4) you need to walk another 10 mins and through the crowds again before you reach the other…,10
Purposely took my son to the Venetian transformers Expo as my 6 years old boy is a huge fan all the way from Hong Kong.   The place was huge but with little to display mostly posters and toys but nothing else much to see.   There is a laser game which the staff wouldn't bothered telling you how to play and when you finish they time you and say by the end of the day the winner will get a prize. My little boy finish within 4 minutes and is in the top 10 list so I asked how would they contact us and the staff was so rude and say she doesn't know and asked me to wait till the end of the day when the expo finish but it was only 3 pm when I was there but the expo close at 8 and the expo have so little to see you can finish within half am hour.   By the end of the expo you could play…,10
"We came here to stay during 6/24-6/27. Terrible things happened since we got off the shuttle bus. We came a few hours earlier than the Check-in time, so we first went slot playing and registered for the membership cards in the casino. Not until we checked in at the hotel counter did the clerk tell us that only those who register for the membership cards after check-in can have free 100 HKD vouchers. As their customers for 3-day stay, I asked them why this cannot be worked out, but the clerks just said no and left us alone. Money was not the point, but we just couldn’t swallow this nonsense treatment. So, we returned to find the casino counter and after a long-haul argument, a mean female clerk told us to bring down the registration form put in our room. She said she would send…",10
"I booked my room directly from its website and everything was fine before I got my room keys. I was quite excited about having full experience in the hotel as they invited me to join their Express Check In program which was new to me. It looked like a grand hotel from the outside. I went to the lobby with my friend, queuing up for the room keys then one of their Front Desk staff waved to us so we approached the counter. The receptionist called Charis and she had no smile, no eye contact, no greetings at all and she just didn't say anything unless I asked her. She neither mentioned when I should check out nor my deposit information. And when I asked her, she spoke extremely fast and I felt that she was being offensive and rude. The room keys and key card holder were the worst…",20
"I have been booking my room for 2 nights from 23rd to 25th July,  and I got the room confirmation via email. However when the time husband and I checked in about 4pm , the receptionist told us that there was no room available at this moment and asked to wait for at least 1.5 hours for the rooms  ready.  My husband was very angry and made complaint to that receptionist named Ella. We came after the official check in time, why is no room for us and we almost started our journey from 6am here till 5pm now, We felt disappointed of her response to just asking us shopping around first and there is no complimentary from the hotel, you just have to wait. In conclusions,  it spoilt our evening schedule and no place for us to rest at all.",20
"The hotel is situated far away from town and everything else.  Unless your idea of a holiday is casino and being stuck in a massive complex with thrones of people and rows and rows of shops, I wouldn't recommend this place.  The rooms are large but that is about the only positive I can think of.  The beds are not comfortable and the quality of the towels and other hotel room amenities is poor.  For example, we paid for 4 persons in our room and only got water and towels for 3 and 2 miserable packets of coffee.  If you are lost within the complex, it is impossible to find the service staff or any house phones except for the security officers that double up as guest relations officers.  While most are polite, some cannot speak English and are absolutely clueless on directions…",10
"We were in Macau for an overnight trip and someone mentioned that the Venetian Macau was running a show about Transformers.  A quick Google search and I found transformers30.com which is a site created by the Venetian to promote the new show which runs from June 1, 2014 - October 5, 2014.  Since I have an 8 year old boy who loves Transformers it was an easy decision to go check it out - he had to wait overnight due to our schedule before he could attend.  What a major disappointment to say the least.  It is housed in a large warehouse type space, divided into areas.  The spaces are 90%+ empty with a couple of posters on the walls.  There were some nice replica's of things like the AllSpark but they are the size of a tennis ball in the room the size of a tennis court!  My son…",10
"The hotel staff are not friendly anymore. Worse part is , the bed pillow is crazy smelly. I think it should change long time ago. Terrible !! Smell like ppl no taking shower for months .   For a 2600HKD  WIFI  should provide free .  I should think the management must look into this hygiene !!!",10
"Stayed here over the weekend and was very disappointed. It's is a monstrous, almost vulgar display of  new money geared towards mass Chinese and Indian tourists who arrive by the coach full. If you want a relaxing stay then avoid as it is too big; it takes ages to get to breakfast, ages to get to the pools, ages to get to reception, you can't just 'nip' down anywhere as its a massively busy shopping complex. My boyfriend especially hated the fact that to get anywhere 'quickly' you had to walk through the huge casino and you couldn't have your camera on you. If you have kids you have to walk round and that would take even longer!!  You can't check in before 1pm nor use the facilities whilst you wait. However they did allow us late check out at no extra cost.  Reception staff…",20
"This is perhaps the worst show I have ever attended. Certainly not value for money. I visited on the very first day with my kids and we were greeted by indifferent staff, carelessly slapped on posters and statuettes and Oh the highlight was three xbox stations with long queues forming in front of them. The people manning the station kept announcing the 5 minute rule for turns, which was mostly ignored. The ""details"" talked about shows, but it turns out that the show needs a separate ticket. You are photographed two steps into the exhibition and lo and behold, your family photo shows up just a few steps ahead. A total con job, NOT recommended.",10
"It's a worse place to stay. Staff is cold n arrogant, ambience is cold and it feels as if u don't belong there. Just artificial. Facade. Rooms r big and very outdated. Who is watching on old ctvs. Furniture is old. And to my surprise wifi was chargeable at 120 mop. The canal shoppes r good. That's it. Hundreds of people getting around n u feel u r in a railway station. Just no soul... Keep away. City of dreams is stunningly beautiful. ",10
"The fourth time to stay there within these few years. All in-room facilities are still in very good condition such as the shining water tapes and door knobs, clean bath tub, clean floor carpet, etc. However, the staff quality needs to be raised to catch up with the competition from other hotels at Cotai.  Remembered when I was taking rest in the room after checked in, a lady suddenly standing in front of my bed and asked she wanted to check the drinks stored in the fringe.  I was shocked there was no door bell ringing.  She just came in by using her staff key card.  Although she was polite, it made me quite embarass.  The second incident was happened when I approached the Conceige for enquiry speaking in Cantonese, I  recieived a cold response from a smile lacking face that "" I…",20

"We are currently based in Honk Kong on a work contract and visit Macao periodically to unwind and generally stay at the Venetian because they have a lot to offer in terms of room size, restaurants, shopping etc. On this occasion though, we had a very different experience. Firstly the room prices were over 1000HKD per night more expensive. Wow....but then it got worse. The casino was very busy and as the day wore on the air quality became steadily worse until by around 8pm when we left the hotel. Our eyes were red and sore and we both had trouble breathing and talking and the smell of cigarette smoke was very prominent throughout the casino area even in the non smoking side of the room. (smoking and non smoking zones are separated by a walkway not separate rooms). By the end of…",10
"The hotel interior are super kitch and the room are very big but super dirty. The carpet is full of dust, same as the sofa'. I am allergic to dust.... you can imagine! The shower is super noisy and the tub was not clean as well.   The worst is you need to pay 16 euro for day for the internet connection! Is a shame in 2014!!!  Better stay away from here!",10
"It was the second time we stayed at the Venetian Macao. To be transparent with the management who might read my review, we stayed in room 54 on the 34th floor between march 25th and march 27th.  Our cons :  - my fiancee and just got married the same day we arrived at the Macao and i mention that to them when I booked the room. I kind of expected to have a plate of fruit or some chocolates in the room, the kind of things you expect from a 5 stars hotel, but there was absolutely nothing.   - We asked for a non smoking room but there was a strong smell of smoke coming from the bathroom. The smell stayed during our stay, it's probably coming from another room, anyway, that was a problem for us.   - Room service : i ordered a turkey club sandwich for $hk130 or $hk150, something like…",20
"was forced to stay here because of a convention and hated it - the enormous crowds, the bling decorations, the way you are forced to pass thru the casino to get to your room (non-smoking signs and fines cheerfully ignored), the ghastly breakfast at cafe deco.......basically this is tricked out dorm for the gambling hordes  the only good thing is the proximity to taipa old town which does have decent restaurants and some good views",10
"We went to the Venetian all starry-eyed and left very disappointed. The resort is impressive in scale, but cheap imitation decorations and poor inside layout make it feel closer to a theme park experience than a 5-star luxury resort. Taking a good 5-10 minutes to get from lobby to your room and routing everyone through massive empty hallways or shopping areas feels like going through an airport terminal rather than a luxury property.  Issues started at check-in: Non-smoking king rooms (as booked) were not available (so much for being the largest hotel in the world) so we were ""upgraded"" to a two queen room on a higher floor when it fact it was a downgrade. Worse, we entered the room only to find out it reeked of smoke, despite the clear non-smoking signage. Walls are paper-thin…",10
"Second trip to Macau and the initial plan was to stay at the Hyatt, but that was fully booked so I thought let's try the Venetian instead. I somehow wish I hadn't.   While 'run down' is a bit of  a strong term, the place does have a bit of a feel about it that its best times are already behind it, at least as soon as you leave the shiny entrance hall and the huge casino.   We got a Cotai View suite on the 24th floor, which gives you a great view over.....the muddy and grey construction site that is the Cotai Strip at the moment. So nothing for nature enthusiasts or landscape aficionados, that's for sure. The room is quite big at 70 square meters or thereabouts and includes a small step down from the area where the bed is to the sitting area. It has two TVs, one in the bedroom…",20
Was there for a company big event with 9000 delegates from all over Asia pacific. Was disappointed to see how inadequate they are in managing the whole event with the traffic flow around the hotel. Most part was blocked to make a one way traffic hence you need to detour a big round to get to your destination. I was also made to understand that both breakfast & WiFi are not provided and if in need you can pay for it but is very costly. The room maybe big with sitting room area which will hardly be in use as you only spend time in the room for sleeping. Further to that the room is also not well lighted up.,20
"What an absolute nightmare I had. I landed off the ferry onto the Venetian bus, everything was ok. While I was getting off the bus and this is according to the hotel my passport and credit cards were stolen from my backpack. I was told by security after giving them the report to wait for around 45 minutes. After two hours I was told nothing was shown on cameras. It was obvious they weren't bothered. After that I was told to make my way to the police station and considering my wallet was stolen I asked if someone could take me and it was a straight no. I had to make an ardous journey in the rain. Also before I left I was told to stay with hotel as room was already paid. There was no mention of a refund. The hotel didn't guide me whatsoever or help me with some numbers. My whole…",10
"Having heard an Asian Vegas vibe, and having loved the shows/activities in LV, stayed with a friend as part of a combined trip to HK/Macau/China.  Couldn't cope with the rudeness of some staff within the casino as well as the shops eg one of the ladies at the  Chinese food shop right on the corner on the LHS across from the chocolate shop on the level of the Hotel Suite North blatantly served other people whilst I was waiting - in the end I asked if she actually wanted my money, ended up serving me after  this. This happened at different shops on the 3 nights we were there.  Asked the staff at the activities/shows counter at the Venetian what shows there were, the ice world show was the only one. We also asked what else is there to do apart from gambling and shopping and she…",20

"This hotel only good for its name.  Lack of personal touch by the staff, you had to queue for everything. Even for asking a direction, you had to wait in line, when it comes to your turn, the concierge is rushing to the next guest. One of the concierge did not even speak English. The room is spacious, can accommodate 6 adults easily, but they will provide you additional pillow. Since the hotel itself is huge, room service will take 10-15 minutes time to arrive. 2 months ago, I stayed in another hotel in Macau, and now I realize how important to had that kind of 'personal touch'. Will not stayed here in Macau. For USD. 350++/night, I had better options",20
We stayed just one night and we are glad that we did so.  It is a different world coming from a 5 star in Hong Kong. in comparison the Venetian is only a 3 stars.  It is just everything to the maximum which leads to a lot less attention to detail. Our room had a broken cupboard knob and dental care packs lying in the room. Breakfast was a big let down. It lacks class but that is no wonder when you see its size.  Ps. Be prepared there is no free Wifi in your room.,20
"My holiday has not started but I have already had a bad experience with the online booking system by the this hotel. I received an email from Venetianmacao.com a couple of weeks ago promoting their Ice World Package  25 November, 2013 - 28 February, 2014. It says the package comes with all attractive freebies - water jet tickets, lunch for 2, ice world tickets (of course). What it doesn't say is any blackout dates, not even in small prints. Yesterday, I decided to book my holiday through the link provided in the email. It all went well - I was given a ""best available rate"" so I happily submitted my persaonal and credit card information - until I realized that there was no confirmation screen or email. I contacted the customers service by email today and was told that what I paid…",10

Surprising, there was not a single staff attending to the queue. Check-in process took 15 minutes and Check-in staff was not prompt and attentive as he did not provide the Ice World package we had paid. I had to remind him to include the package in the hotel ""Passport"" issued. Time wasted.  The hotel should put up a lounge and provide some refreshment for the comfort of guests who are waiting to check-in.   Suite given to us was poorly prepared, short of towers and amenities.

After exhausting travels standing in line for 1 hour just to get a key is no fun.   Check out was again the summum of inefficienty.  Hordes of employees behind the check out desk, though at least 20 minutes queuing.    It is obvious that the Las Vegas Sands corporation (LVS) is not caring about the ordinary guest.

On arrival we didn't have a clue where to go its not obvious where to check in - there are many lobby's but the one you enter has empty desks - we had to ask concierge.

After the meal, we called the dining hotline to have someone clear our plates - lady on the line said no problem. So we left for the morning to go swimming. Came back lunch time - room was cleaned, new towels etc but all the breakfast cutlery was left of the table with the half finished food the kids couldnt eat.   Fine, so i called the service again.

On the plus side, the rooms are large and luxurious but there are only so many ways you can do luxurious before you have to just do it bigger. Two TVs was unnecessary and over the top in our opinion - as were the 3 telephone extensions (one in the loo!) The bed was big (of course) and the shower was amazing. On the other hand, the thousands of staff they employ there either don't know or don't care where anything is and are every bit as misleading as the signs.

"Not good for families. It took a long time to get from the room to the pool or to the gym, down two lifts. Very congested hotel with more people just visiting the hotel shops and casino than actually staying in hotel.  Air condition kept making noise. Sounded like a tap running so had to turn off.  A man was banging on our door at 2am in the morning looking for his friends and smoking, so we ended up having a terrible sleep that night. Definitely no security with regards to who is able to enter the floors. Also the buses to the hotel from the ferry terminal are apparently for everyone who wants to visit the hotel not just hotel residents. So it took a while waiting in line to board the bus.  Would not recommend to anyone.",20

Stayed in Bella Suites and the room was very spacious. No issues in terms of beds, sofas and amenities provided in the bathroom - all perfect.  However,  with all the good rooms and facilities,  comes the inconsistency part which made the experience unpleasant - the water provided in the room was really small so we called several times requested for drinking water.  Totally surprised when the staff delivered the water spoke to us in Mandarin to tell us don't call anymore and request for water! Is this how they trained their staffs? Will definitely avoid this hotel if possible.",20
"When we booked this hotel we knew it would be big but not quite as big as The Venetian.  The scale of this hotel is undescribable. For a 5 star hotel it lacks any form of intimacy or specialised service.   The queue for check in is like an easyjet airport check =-in desk. Be prepared to queue for a while.   The rooms are big and acceptable although they lack anything special.   Incorporated in the hotel is an extra large shopping mall.   The hotel tries to sell you an all inclusive deal which incorporates vouchers and gifts. Do not buy this! the food is buffet, the vouchers aren't accepted in most stores and overall these are a waste of money.   The casino is good which is the very least you would expect.   Overall if you are looking for a 5 star experience do not stay here.",20

First impression as entering the room, was to go back to the hotel standards from the late 80'. Design, furniture, amenities, entertainment systems, TV, remote control not working, bad maintenance, not turn down service...  My worst experience was at checking out; When I checked in, as my room was fully prepaid by my Company, I had no problem, as requested by your staff, to leave a print of my credit card in case of extra expenses, it does happen anywhere, to keep record of this number and use the card if necessary, but I have  a serious issue when, at check out, the lady told me…",20
"I have mixed feelings about this hotel, but in the end, my wife and I don't think we would return.  I stayed at the Venetion with my wife, her parents, her brother and his wife and two children (7 and 10).  A total of 6 adults and 2 children spread out in 3 different rooms for 2 nights.  We arrived at the Macau airport and got on the shuttle bus to and from the airport.  This hotel is located very closely to the airport.  We got to the hotel and it was quite impressive and opulent, along with noisy.  Since it was before check-in time, we all went for a stroll with my wife's cousin who lives and works in Macau.  We had the hotel hold our luggage, it would be sent directly to our room after check-in.    Upon returning around 15:00 hours, my wife, brother and sister-in-law went to…",20
"Although this isn't our usual hotel type, we were there for a conference and were looking forward to staying at a fancy hotel.  We were very disappointed.  The first thing we noticed was that the hotel is falling apart.  After spending time in Macau, it's apparent that nothing is being built to last because there's always something newer coming.  The rooms were large, but not well kept.  The shower leaked onto the floor (cups of water for each shower) and tiles were cracked.  Everything cost extra, including the overpriced internet at $22US/day.  Although we didn't hear our neighbors in their rooms, we heard EVERYTHING from the hallways, all night long.  We were staggered by the volume of shopping and the size of the building.  It took us about 15 minutes to get from our room to…",20
"Upon arriving at their hotel bus terminal, which was near the West Lobby, we had to push our luggages from the West Lobby THROUGH the casino in order to arrive at the main lobby to do the check-in. The walk was far as the building is huge.  (They have a total of 4 lobbies: Main, North, South and West.)  After we check-in, we had to push my luggage THROUGH the casino again in order to get to our room in the North Lobby. We were told that WiFi is chargeable at 160HKD for every 24 hours window period. We subscribed to their WiFi in the room on the first night and we regretted. On top of the expensive charges, the WiFi was super lousy. Data just couldn't load to the extend that you wouldn't be able send a simple text message from your phone without the system lagging.   I STRONGLY…",10
"Just visited Venetian Macau as my Easter holiday and found myself in the middle of major renovation - not sincerely a nice and pleasant surprise. I recommend that all who are planning to go during spring 2013 would check from hotel, if the renovation is still ongoing. You might reconsider to stay at nearby Galaxy instead - visited there and it was magnificient!",20
"Venetian Macau.... I stayed at this hotel is 2 times, in fact one time is enough (because bad service) but I stayed 2 times, because a family member is forced to stay at the Venetian Macau, because the hotel is so iconic, so he wanted to stay here...  Pros: -This is ""THE"" hotel in Macau... You've got to Macau if you have not stayed in this hotel. Very iconic for Macau. -Oversized Room (up to 4 people in the room, I think it is still comfortable), as they have a sofa that can turn into a mattress. -Located in Big Complex (food court, shopping mall, casino), all needs can be obtained here. -They have a free shuttle bus to many places in Macau (including Ferry Terminal), maybe every 15 minutes (vice versa).   Cons: -No Bellboy, so I must take my heavyweight suitcase about 800m from…",20
"I read favourable reviews of this hotel at tripadvisor and decided to make a booking for 2 Bella Suite several days ago. I used the search engine of tripadvisor and chose agoda.com which appear to be offering a pretty good rate. However after making the payment, I realised to my horror that the specified date is a week earlier than my scheduled date. I tried to inform agoda.com of the mistake immediately and also tried to email to the hotel to seek their understanding of the incident and to assist me in changing the dates. Agoda informed me after 2 days and responding that the hotel refused to make any changes due to their booking policy. I sent several emails to the venetian macao resort hotel again hoping that they may consider helping me with a fee rather than forcing me to…",10
"When we first stepped into the room, it looks tremendously grand and luxury. The room size was at least 30 sqmetre with a decent size of bathroom, separate toilet, a lounge area and with two tvs ( one at the lounge and one in front of the bed). I was very happy about it until i smelt something disgusting when I lie on the bed. We found out that the smell was in fact came from the hanging curtain behind/on top of the bed !! FYI,the curtain is for decoration purposes.Since it was already midnight , we thought it was too much trouble to make a complain to switch room. It was absolutely a nightmare sleeping under such a smelly and dirty curtain. We bet the hotel never washed or changed the curtain for years. If you get a room like this, request to make a switch immediately! It was…",20
"Went to Macau for a few nights. Stayed at venetian because they were running a buy one get one. Should have coughed up more dough and stayed at Wynn. Room is identical to Las vegas but not near as clean. In vegas, venetian is my goto spot. Not in Macau. Asians must be hard on the property because it is showing wear bad. Elevator buttons are worn, Awnings are blown off the outside of building, place looks like its 15 years old. Mildew all over our shower, drywall patched ceiling but not repainted, cracked baseboards, ect, ect. Casino is nice, one of the friendliest craps staff I have ever played with, made the game very enjoyable for hours of fun. Asians are rude, they do not wait in line, they bulldoze into you like your not even there. Free shuttles from the ferry terminal,…",20
"I was there for a trade conference… Not the best experience. Overall the hotel as one would expect is focused on people who want to gamble or shop not for people coming there for business and yet they have huge conference facilities... a little confusing. I have been to The Venetian Las Vegas Casino, Hotel & Resort on holidays and have absolutely had a blast but I don’t think even if I came to The Venetian Macao Resort Hotel for a holiday I would have enjoyed. There were quite a few things wrong with the hotel, first and foremost is the language barrier I faced. If you are portraying yourself as an international vacation/business destination the lease you can do is train your staff appropriately, using sign language is not what I had in mind. Dining options were limited around…",20
"After the experience of the Venetian I am intentionally writing my first review on trip advisor. Venetian is the worst ever hotel we have stayed at.   We always spend good money and stay at high end hotels on our holidays and usually the price we pay reflects the service that we expect. After reading all the reviews on trip advisor we decided to opt for the hotel over the famous  banyan hotel. Big Mistake. The allure of staying at this concept hotel as well as the view of the room we decided to pre book and pay for two nights stay. Firstly our flight was delayed, and we arrived in macau later than expected and we were at the hotel at 10am. The rudeness of the woman who checked us in will not be forgotten. We were abruptly informed that our check in would be at 2pm. As we had…",10
"I checked into The Venetian Resort in Macao on Feb 3rd. At the check-in counter, the receptionist, Colin, checked me into with a poker face. He merely pulled up the reservation made by my god-daughter, received her deposit in cash, and gave her a receipt. Nothing else was said. No directions given to help us find our way to the room in this bewilderingly huge hotel. We walked for a good 20 minutes before we found the right elevator lobby. In fact the most direct route to the right elevator lobby is to cut through the casino and the very smoky environment of the casino made this very unpleasant.   The first room we were assigned to had a funny smell. We requested a change in room and this was done rather quickly. The concierge arrived within 10 minutes to help us make the change.…",20
"I didn’t read any TA reviews before booking here, as the conference I was attending was being held here, so it made staying here a bit of a no-brainer, but I would not stay again.  The hotel is absolutely huge – and I’ve stayed in the MGM Grand in Vegas by comparison – and just sprawls out in every direction. The public areas are clean, immaculate presented and generally quite good. The rooms are furnished with materials that look good, but don’t wear well. I had a Rialto suite because it was so cheap I wanted to experience it – but it was not great. The fixtures and fittings just look a bit tired and, I have to say, a bit grubby (rather like the rest of Macau). The wifi is also in your room only and is painfully slow. I speedtested it and got 128kbps in my room. There is no…",20
"I came to Macau for an expo at the Venetian and decided to stay for an extra 2 nights as the trip was already a long distance and as a fan of Vegas, I thought I'd stay to either relax in luxury or party and gamble hard if the mood took me. I am now sat here with 8 hours to go before the ferry finally takes me away from this disaster of a place.  I am not a fan of the Venetian in Vegas having stayed there in 2011 but against my better judgement decided to give it a go in Macau as the expo was there and I wanted the convenience. It was obviously a mistake as the couple of other hotels I visited - Wynn and MGM had a much better vibe. Having said this, I still think I would have not particularly enjoyed my stay at either of these hotels as Macau itself is not my cup of tea and a far…",20
"We saw the good reviews for this hotel, so we didn't hesitate to book it for our macau stay. The room was HUGE!!! Very nice and clean! I really must commend on the housekeeping. They do such a good job. It's such a huge hotel and such huge rooms but they could keep it so clean! To the smallest details. They kept the hair dryer into the drawer everytime I used it. Coiled up perfectly! I was really impressed.  Now comes the bad part. When I checked in, there was a system failure for the creating of room card keys. I was waiting and waiting at the front desk and the receptionist was running around behind the counter. I had no idea what is happening. So I kept asking: Is something wrong??? What's happening?? But as if he didn't hear me, or couldn't understand me, he just ignored me.…",20
"We arrived at the airport in the morning and went straight to the taxi rank to be told there was a Venetian shuttle bus. We walked to the bus and the ""guide"" pointed to the luggage area and told us to put our bags there. No offer of help and that included elderly people, too busy talking on mobile phone. On arrival at hotel we were early and room wasn't ready, so we left our luggage again no smiles or welcome from staff. We wandered round the canal area upstairs with shops which is impressive but struggled to find anywhere for a coffee. There was no one around to help. The focus is on the enormous casino on the ground floor. When we checked in staff were friendly but just told us which wing our room was in, no offer to show us where it was or help us with our bags.It was a long…",20
"May be the biggest casino in the world, but not really conducive for family use.  Or maybe just not our family.   Currently at the Venetian which we chose because we've stayed in it in Las Vegas and had a nice time.  In Las Vegas we enjoyed our stay from the initial check-in through to the end. But in Macau its more like hangar sized spaces and major lack of service mentality or any real hotel feel.  Just a big casino.  And super smoky and hard to get around at that. From our initial arrival when, after having just got off the bumpy jet boat that finally got us here (both people in front and back of us vomiting during the trip), all we wanted was a little calmness and easy check-in, what we got was the West Lobby entry which is just a lot of big buses dropping customers off. …",20
"This place is just bad.  It is nothing like the Venetian in Las Vegas. In fact this place is just terrible.   See my review about the casino in another review, that will help understand more about that.  Anyway here is my review of the hotel, it's long, but informative, any questions just send me a message.  Positives:  Rooms are big and clean, but expensive.  Beds are comfortable.  Close to the airport, about 10-15 minutes I think by hotel bus.  There are shows that go on in the ballrooms of the hotel, to get there you need about 20-30 minutes as they are quite a long walk, and you need to pay extra to get into those things, some events are like trade shows and stuff like that. When we were there in August there was an ice show that was actually pretty cool.  Negatives:  Some…",20
"Massive hotel, stayed one night for the experience. The room is a bit outdated but nice all the same. One big disappointment is the wifi you have to pay for which is rather expensive, it barely works really slow and only works in your room and not the hotel. Kind of annoying when you want to use your iPhone. Another huge issue is they overcharged us at checkout by $100nzd which we are currently trying to sort. Go here for the experience but don't expect anything amazing.",20
"There is a huge variety of Hotel options available these days in Macau and in particular the Cotai area that was once dominated by the massive footprint of The Venetian. Although we have loved The Venetian over time - for it's original Cirque de Soleil show that is no more, the occasional event such as the UFC in the Cotai Arena and the Shopping Cannel - the time has come that we'd really recommend that you consider the alternatives when it comes to retiring for the evening.   Some PROS: The Room Service, although pricey even for a 5 star venue, was good quality and delivered quickly. But then for the price - shouldn't it be? The Suite was very spacious with a king size bed and a step down lounge area. That's kinda it. Nothing terribly special or cool or luxurious.  CONS On…",20
"This was my fifth stay at the Venetian over the past four years. What use to be one of my favorite hotels around the world has slipped way down my list. I booked a non smoking room and was overpowered by the smell of smoke as I walked into my room. Located in an ashtray, I noticed a small card that said the room was designated a non smoking room next to a couch had a rather large cigarette burn in the arm. They obviously do not discourage smoking in no smoking rooms. I tried to stay in the room as it is quite a long walk to the check in area. However, when I went to bed the pillows were filled with the smell of stale smoke.  So I had to get up, pack up my bags and walk all the way back to the check in area. When I informed the desk of the problem, they reacted like this happens…",20

You will get Bella Suite (Double Queen Bed Room + Sofa Bed) + 2 persons BF / Lunch + Free 1 photo + 2 tickets to the Titanic Exhibition + 1 way Cotai Jet ticket (Macau to HK).   The room was splendidly good. It has a certain class. It's the type of room that you will go scream as long as you arrive at the hotel. The bathroom was very spacious, the amenities were great, all were fantastic.  Nevertheless, I have to write some of my disappointing experiences while I stayed there:  1. I took a free shuttle bus from the port to Venetian Hotel. They didn't arrive at the lobby as most of the hotel guests were expected. No porters are available to help out with our luggage.  My grand mother and I arrived with…",20

The rooms look nearly identical to the ones in Las Vegas, but the marble tiling in the bathroom is uneven, and there are weird odors in the hallways. It seems the Chinese tourists have a bad habit of keeping their hotel room doors open whenever they're in their rooms...so the hallways tend to be a bit noisy and smelly...walking by room after room of Chinese people hooting and hollering while they gamble in their own rooms...not classy.  The casino is disappointing...the rules are very different from Las Vegas, and the concept of personal space is lost because the Chinese gamblers crowd over you at the tables.  The…",20

This one in Macau is no match with the one in Las Vegas, except the front desk check-in services that was wonderful and the only bright spot.  1. There were too many gamblers - the noise was worse than a night market, unbearable! 2. There were hookers openly soliciting in the casino 3. Guests from China were smoking in the hotel hallways and elevators 4. The services at two casino restaurants were pretty bad 5.

The hotel is too big to my liking, service was not personal, walking from point A to point B easily takes 10 - 15 minutes at least.

The staff was a mixed bag. ALL Filipino staff were amazing. ALL of them smiled, said hello, and did their jobs great. The Chinese staff did their jobs fine, but obviously struggled to say hello, smile, and go out of their way to be extra helpful. I see it as a cultural thing, but it was noticeable.   The food in the hotel was good, but priced on the high side of course.

Toilet was equipped with seemingly luxurious fittings but I was disappointed to find that the shower head was of poor quality, the water jet was too strong and not adjustable and made a clanging sound when turned on. Towels were coarse and toiletries provided did not live up to expectation. The bed was comfortable but pillows were terrible, with hardly any filling. There was little head support even with 2 pillows and I woke up with a neck ache.  The 'snaking' Check in queue was a nightmare and it took us almost an hour to check in. To avoid the long queue on check out, we opted for the express check out, which was a breeze.  It was a convenient hotel as shops and…",10

The first night someone had come into the bathroom to smoke as they left ashes all over the floor. Our bags had all been opened and searched.   We called customer care to complain and for clean up and expected things to be better.   The next day we were out, someone left a bag in our room. We called the front desk to have the bag removed. No apology or explanation was issued.   This was completely unexpected and unacceptable for a 5-star hotel.",10

Upon check out, we were told for the first time that we owed $300 US for use of the hotel phone for a 50 minute call.  Complained.  ""Too bad.""  Won't stay there again.",10

Its too large and takes forever for to get from 1 spot to another. The service also requests 40 mins for any room delivery, even for a babay's meal and its far too crowded and loud.  The rooms though big, just are a bit outdated and boring. This hotel works on large volumes so offers many great deals, the discerning traveler will definitely be disappointed.

The hotel is huge, at times it becomes difficult to find you way to your room and the hotel staff also does not guide you properly and is rude.

Traveled with extended family and booked 6 rooms for an overnight stay at Venetian Macao. Checking in took a while. We were given rooms in different floors and different wings (North and South) to our dismay. The front desk clerk said they were very busy and there was no way to remedy the situation. The hotel was enormous and we had to walk a distance from the West Lobby to the rooms. I had to go back for the maps as he forgot to hand them to me. The hotel lobby was packed and people were everywhere.  It's like being in a classy market... chaotic is the best way to describe it. Air smelled like smoke in most places.

The rooms are the same & so are the facilities compared to Vegas, nonetheless, I would rather try another newer property called Galaxy in Macao the next time i visit.

The water and plumbing in the rooms is poor IE lukewarm water , weak pressure, etc.. The bedsheets smelled like the previous occupant, and the breakfast was absolutely awful.

This was our second time here - the first being several years ago when it first opened.  We had issues with the hotel then but blamed it on teething problems and decided to give a second try staying over new years Dec 29th- Jan 1st.  During our first trip the staff were not well trained nor helpful and also had some security issues.  Overall things have gotten worse particularly the service particularly on the service front. The check-in was longer than expected but tolerable - the English of the check-in staff was poor and also took longer than it should have.  The suites like the first time around were spacious and comfortable for the most part.

Even though it is only a few years old everything about the place is looking tired and nicotine stained although the hoards of buses arriving from China keep the whole place permanently packed so I imagine it would be hard to keep-up the necessary maintenance.  We had a non-smoking room on a (supposedly) non-smoking floor and yet everything stank of stale smoke and the air quality was awful.

I found a Red hair in my bed which is not mine since i have brown hair ! i checked the rest of the bed and removed the hair with gloves i had and went to sleep.  The next morning I woke and was going to have a shower when i hopped in It was cold water i waited about 5 min and the water was still cold :( I had a meeting in the morning and was…",10
Too huge. Not suitable for family with children. Poor direction from main lobby to west lobby. Children are not allow to go through ground level and have to go to level 3 and going down again to ground floor. Not a friendly hotel. Too crowded and noisy lobby. I have a bad experience and will never stay again.,10
"Let me be straight. If you are looking only for gambling in a surrounding in a lot of noise. It will be your place. But if you exspect more than that, stay away as far as you can. The shows are great technical deals but most of the performances of the artist lacks the glamour of the great artistic. Cirque du Soleil on a low artistic level in a country where everybody exspects specially high performances. We also exspected that the restaurants opened late night. But the 24h dining only offered food I would nout eat for free. And do not try the beakfast. You will get one piece of toast cut in half and a very, very small croissaint with two eggs a litte bit of marmelade and honey and butter for ""only"" 30 USD. When I (190m tall and 101KG) ordered more bread, they told me that this…",20
"This hotel is too big and you get lost very easily as there are too many entrances.  It took me around and being pointed in different direction to locate the lobby of the hotel.    Once I got to the lobby the staff in the front desk were rude and acted like he don't want to be there.  We ask for a non-smoking room and were given a smoking room and were told there is nothing they could do.  So we were stuck in a smoking room but luckily we were there just for 1 night.  The so call suite is nice but room looks old and worn out and seems like a renovation is needed.  One good thing is the bed is extremely comfortable and big.  Other than that, I would not stay here again.",20
Third stay in the hotel and pleased to report they are consistent...consistent in becoming average.  Seems as though those profits are not being reinvested in maintaing the same standards as when they first opened.  Customer service is on the decline and minimum bets are on the way up!  One thing that hasn't changed is the croupier service which is still verging on angry if you win and agnostic if you loose.  This will be our last stay...,20
"We stayed for a night in Venetian last weekend.. i had high hopes from this hotel, but were so very disappointed.. depite being so popular globally, it was like any regular chinese hotel.. no international feel.. its so big & vast that you tend to get lost.. its like a railway station (in India or China).. crowded & a feel of chaos ... rooms are big but one has to really look for a plug point if you need to recharge your camera or phone... breakfast & meals were ok.. worst thing, we got rooms only after 4.30 pm, though normal check in time is 3 pm.. .. the staff just kept blaming the travel agent without realising that we were now the guests of the hotel & have to be treated like a guest.",20
"We stayed for 3 nights at Venetian. Usually we stsy at Wynn/Encore, but wanted to have a new experience. Unfortunately, we had. This is huge world of tourists like a ralway station 24 hours. The disgusting smoke smell everywhere, the service was terrible in front desk, restaurants, consierge desk. For example, Mrs Keira, consierge staff, spent 40 minutes to sell me ferry tickets (!!!), with mistakes (!!!). It was at West lobby with a lot of crazy noisy tour groups. Finally, no smiles or pleasure. Avoid this property.",10
"..the brothel. I don't even know where to start with this place...  1. The place is crowded and loud. There are tour groups everywhere and extremely rude tourists. One actually got into an argument with a family member and had to be settled by management. I felt like I was in a marketplace with tons of people and their noise.   2. The smell of smoke is so acrid. Walking in the front door, you could already smell the smoke. We visited other properties and none had this problem. Probably could be attributed to the large size.  3. The rooms are old and they show the poor workmanship. There were chipped counters and paint. There was also 'repairs' that were so visible it was almost laughable.  4. The housekeeping is very annoying. On the day of checkout, they were standing out in…",20
"The Moment me and my family entered the Lobby, We felt like we have came to a fish market. There were long queue for the check IN, People standing with truck loads of there luggage. After waiting for an hour in the queue and thereafter a 20 minute tussle with the receptionist, we finally got a room and were told that we shall be getting the rest of the three rooms after 2 hours (i.e. 4PM). I must agree the suites were awesome and were decorated, Just a small problem that there were no locks at the bathroom and the toilet.  The room cards(keys) were troubling us too much and for getting new keys, we almost had to stand in the long queue at the reception.  The casino was almost dead with more than half of the casino not operational and with the rest of the casino was in low…",10
"We stayed at the Royal suites, for 1 night. Firstly, ... if you are an Indian and would like to have a feel of Macau - DONT STAY HERE! As this is more of a Mumbai housing board colony with dense Indian population. Every second room taken was by an Indian. The check-in process is toooooo lengthy and It took like 30 mins to get to the check-in desk and baggage counter. Reminds of you tirupati darshan!  The place is toooooo crowded from the lobby, to the casino aisles, the swimming pool, the Canal Shopping area ..... every place is so populated, that u may just get lost! Though the shuttle service to the ferry areas and airport is too good. I guess Venetian has more buses than the local public transport service. For the price we paid (about 1800HK$++), We could have stayed at much…",10
"My husband and young child travelled to the Venetian over Easter and were not impressed.  Firstly when booking our accommodation we received complementary ferry tickets to get over to Macao and were told by the hotel that we couldn't prebook tickets and just to arrive at the HK ferry terminal to collect the tickets on the day/time we wanted to travel, big mistake we actually couldn't get on any of ferry for 4 hours!  Once we arrived the hotel was so busy we had to carry our own bags to our hotel suite, given we booked one of the more expensive suites we were far from impressed. When arriving in our room it took housekeeping 5 hours to provide a baby cot, something which we had pre ordered 2 weeks prior when booking our accommodation. Also when ringing housekeeping to replace 3…",20
"Just arrived back in Melbourne today after a stay in room 10-064 on the evening of 8 Jan. I was compelled to hit Trip Advisor after such a frustratingly poor experience however, give them credit this is the first hotel I have stayed at where I was robbed by management.   We caught the Coatijet to Macau then the hotel shuttle bus where we had to stand on the bus whilst staff were seated, when disembarking the bus we were herded like cattle to the reception, we were then trampled over by four men I presume high rollers or wannabe’s in a hurry to hit the casino, there was no control of the reception check in at all, the lady on patrol just watched it happen.   When checking  in our room key was inserted into an express check out folder, and we filled in as requested the mini bar…",10
