"I was a gold member and when I check in, no room upgrade was given - which was perfectly fine if the hotel was full but the way that receptionist told me (frank? I forgot the exact name) makes people feel so bad and not respected.  Room was clean and had a good view. Gifts were cute yet 1. Handy phone was not working, no internet connection when it was brought out of hotel 2. Shower head holder has to be fixed, it falls suddenly when I was taking a shower, luckily I was not hit on my head  Hopefully the experience will be better when I come next time",30
"The place is very homy yet elegant. It helped me unwind in such a short period of time. That was a very relaxing.and comfortable experience.Accessible to everything you could possibly need, shopping is just few steps away.",30
"We stayed here previously and had an excellent time, but when we returned over Easter, it had unfortunately taken a turn for the worse.   Pros: hotel room was great, functional, with lots of space and very quiet. The gym and pool were fantastic, equipment was aplenty and worked well, sauna and jacuzzi was great as well. Glenda and Shirley at the gym reception area were fantastic.  Cons: Food and beverage.  First, room service was terrible, which is a shame because it used to be very very good especially for vegetarians. Now, the portion sizes have drastically reduced, and so have the vegetarian options. Despite informing Arthur, F&B director, he apologised and we were still charged the full price of the meal upon check out by Tony, the front desk manager. Second, breakfast is…",30
"I took this trip with my parents. My mom knows about the nice treatment I get when I am at this hotel such as the huge room upgrade and extra amenities. I am a Hilton diamond member and frequent guest of this hotel. However, on this last trip, I felt it was average in some ways. Ivan who is like a dear long lost friend can’t be faulted. He has always been very kind and he is the only one who remembers me every time I go back to the hotel. It says a lot about the other employees at the executive check in lounge and the F&B staff of the lounge. Besides Ivan from the executive team, no warm welcome or recognition from the others.   Even when we were having an afternoon snack in the Conrad Lounge, we were ignored the whole time. It seems that they were busy attending to other…",30
"I made a reservation of two beds room with view of Eiffel Tower (Macau). Positive: Staffs are very helpful and nice. We can feel that they pay attention to guest, like simple say ""Hi', ""Good Evening"" . You can feel that they express in sincere. This make us feel comfortable from check-in process, personal services, check-out, dining experience. Negative: The price of room is quite expensive and the 70% of view from room is the room of another hotel. So made us half of curtain keep close. Overall, we enjoy the time in stay.",30
"The room was spacious and comfortable.  But boring in the midst of all the exotic hotels in Macau. There were nothing special and the service was not superior.  Food was terrible, both conference catering and the lobby lounge. ",30
"This hotel has nice rooms. We stayed in this hotel twice within a week, and while rooms are nice, the hilton member experience is lacking compared to other Hiltons worldwide. The lounge food is quite limited, while the staff taking care of the lounge serving area are very nice, especially Tyra and Sunshine. For members, there is no welcome fruit platter or complimentary welcome snacks unlike at other Hilton hotels. Members will not get top floors as well, as preference is given to casino guests. Casino guests will get better priority and service than Hilton members.  Overall, this Conrad is a lower standard hotel than Hiltons, Conrads or Doubletrees around the world as preference is given to Casino guests. While the staff tries their best to be accomodating to members, we know…",30
Some guests do not have lift level access card but able to get others to help them to access to their level. They do not know each other.  Every guest access lift level card should only can access to their level which they stay. Bodhi Spa is not a good choice for me. I would prefer Studio City Zensa Spa in term of skills. ,30
An expected large room with living room; however the sofa on the window side is too soft and not firm enough. The flushing system is almost broken down on my check-out date of 3D2N stay.  Service responsiveness is acceptable as a whole.,30
"Conrad is one of my favourite hotels, as service was good and remained. However, cleanliness did not remain as before that an used tissue was found on the table next to the bed when we first went into the room after check in. ",30
"Macau offers so many new, excellent hotels that difficult to understand some reviews here. I think US guests have low standards. Old fashioned room , bit smelly, with not comfortable bed at all. This hotel needs a serious renovation. However it was clean that cant complain. Orbit restaurant for breakfast suggest to come early to avoidt people push you out at the buffet. Service staff was good and friendly which was positive surprise for this kind of environment. Also nice and attentive service in the ground floor bar . Iam also wondering why there is an ashtray in non smoking room :-)) and why no cream for a coffee. Just a small box of milk in minibar ? ",30
"I booked room under my friends name , 2 times stay at Conrad Macau  Arrival experiences was good , hotel has enough staff in the main entrance , lobby and reception ...majority of staff very attention to guest .  Lobby ambience and atmosphere very boring and no sense of luxury   Hotel building integrated with shopping mall and casino , my personal experiences about the hotel complex is boring and not suitable for young people ... good for family or old people.   Room feature , first visit ""Evian"" water provided in all deluxe room , 2nd visit no longer evian water in all  room.   every room has teddy bear and in the bath tub has a duck toys which is good and I like it .   Lobby lounge located in the middle of high traffic area where many people passing around in this building…",30
"This hotel is attached to holiday inn; which is odd since Conrad is suppose to be a 5 star luxury hotel and holiday inn is more a budget friendly selection.  The Conrad offers a free shuttle ride from the ferry port, but only from the ferry port near the hotel. make sure you check with the hotel website to make sure you get on the correct ferry port if you want the  free shuttle ride. We stayed at a queen suite. It was a very large room with a living room and they had notes for our kids welcoming them, which was a nice touch. you can walk from Conrad to the Venetian. the hotel pool is terrible! its 4 VERY small pools next to each other. not sure what the heck they were thinking when they designed it but  it looks like 4 kiddy pools next to each other.",30
"2nd stay here and it was not as good as my previous stay. The positives are that room upgrade for Honors Gold and was excellent large suite like my previous stay. The staff was also exceptional and the best I've experienced within the Hilton Chain. Isaac, Fenny, Sarah are a few names I could remember.  Negatives to be addressed by management   The communication quality on the phone was really poor while contacting in room dining and conrad guest services, unlike my last stay where the English levels were great.  The food spread at breakfast, Lunch and Evening Canapés in Executive lounge was really poor and slightly limited compared with other Conrads and even Hiltons I have stayed at. Dishes are more geared towards Chinese than Western tourists as well.  In-room dining has…",30
"As my first stay as a HHonours Diamond member, I was disappointed when comparing it to the Sofitel Macau and previous Accor Platinum experiences.  I was certainly happy with the upgrade to the suite, however, that was about it. There were numerous small issues that added up to make it not such a memorable experience I mentioned these issues at check out and the lady was very understanding. As Mr. Xu was not available at the time, he sent me a follow up about the issues I encountered, however, I never received a reply when I gave more details and asked when my bonus points would be credited. I sent the e-mail 6 weeks ago! So I am concerned that Conrad Macao has not taken my issues seriously. Here are the issues listed in my e-mail of 3rd February 2017:  Thanks for the follow up…",30
"I have booked my stay in Conrad Macau this coming April in celebration of my son's first birthday. As my son is still an infant, I emailed Conrad to see if baby cot bed and stroller etc can be arranged. They said they couldn't find my booking (I booked through those common hotel booking website) and would get back to me as soon as they can.   As one of the world's most famous hotel group, I am surprised they need to take more than two weeks for just checking my booking and up to date, I still have not heard back anything from them, not a single reply or follow up email. My request was made as early as mid February.",30
I travel a lot for work and privately and this was the least personalised 5 start hotel I've ever stayed. Went to attend a work event held at this hotel with other 100 colleagues but we all felt we're just another number for the hotel staff to process.  Didn't feel welcomed at all and it was very disappointing. The staff who put the even together for us was a massive help and very professional so for them I take my heat off but the rest of my experience was very average. ,30
"Stayed here during a week long stay in Macao, very nice and lavishly laid out rooms, nice attention to detail and all... That's about all it had to offer really... If you not into gambling then you will become board pretty quickly... Breakfast was disappointing for the standard one would expect...",30
"Spacious room with King bed with sofa, writing desk, two closets, bath and shower. Complementary provides candies and the little bear with hotel name which is unique. Having the coffee anytime as there is capsule coffee machine in room. Hotel offered the tasty Tiramisu to us for celebrating birthday which is very nice. It's convenience to buy the ferry tickets at Concierge directly.  Difficult to access the reception and it's far away from the guest lift. The staff said there are nothing to see as construction areas surrounding or the higher floor seeing opposite building. The dices in the plastic duck are sticking together, seems unclean. No milk powder provided so you can only have black coffee. Some of the drinks in minibar are sticking as well. Small outdoor swimming pool.",30
"As H Hilton members, I've sent email to the hotel asking for any anniversary room upgrade, offers etc.  They only promised a complimentary cake without other offers whereas room upgarde to suite and complimentary cake were offered by other hotels in Macau for celebrating birthday such as Grand Hyatt, Hard Rock Hotel.   So siappointing and will not stay again!!",30
"Being one of the three hotels at the development known as Sands City, this is one of the most non-descript Conrad I have ever stayed in. The location is convenient, being within walking distance to other hotspots and entertainments in Cotai, with frequent and comfortable shuttle buses from both the main Macau Pier and the Cotai Pier. Journey to the hotel from both is short. The lobby of this hotel is small and is franked by shops shops and more shops, making it kind of cold and commercial. The staff, as expected of a Conrad, is polite courteous and efficient. The room is large and luxuriously appointed, with delightful little touchs such as a Conrad rubber duck sitting on the bathtub edge, and handmade truffles awaiting one's arrival.   The swimming pool seems small comparing to…",30
nice room  good and fast reception  all de luxe rooms with all the amenities and very clean what most impressed me of this hotel was the breakfast room grand orbit not very big but waiters very polite and attentive choice and quality of food at high standard even if the price is a little bit higher than others,30
"firstly, I gave them my ID and was told that I did not have a reservation and that they could not find my name. I gave them my travel documents for them to look me up but they couldnt tell what was my surname and first name (from my english name). After trying again and asking crap questions, they found it and said the booking I made on booking.com had switched the order of my name (lame excuse). It was actually cuz the receptionist was too incompetent to figure it out -_-  Seriously.. the worst mistake a hotel can make (being 5 star or whatever) is not being able to look up the reservation and tell the guest that they cant' find it while asking if it was made under another name. I was pretty pissed..and asked for an upgrade which was first denied unless I paid extra. It was a…",30
"Overall it's good though, can't say was great or definitely want to come back.... The staff @ check-in was NOT so helpful, he didn't give me an upgrade and even told me they will deliver newspapers to my room every morning but never did. Most staff try to talk to me in LOCAL language even I do NOT look like LOCAL which was really uncomfortable...  But, concierge lady was very very kind and worked great!  Compare to other Conrad, does not meet its quality.",30
"My company had a conference in Macau.  I was assigned to a room full of the smell of cigarettes. I went into the room of my colleague which was supposed to be the non smoking room but still had the smell of cigarettes.  This was totally unacceptable. Since we only stayed there for one night, therefore we did not request to change the room.  Since this is supposed to be a pretty new hotel, it already had flushing problem in the toilet.   Since this is supposed to be a 5 stars hotel, some of the staff can't speak English at all.  The room is very spacious and the service is pretty good.  If you don't like cigarettes, I would suggest you pick other hotels.",30
"I stayed at Conrad for weekend getaway and celebrate my aunt's birthday. The service was excellent, staff was greeted upon check in and I arrived a bit earlier than check in time but the room was ready which I was very grateful. I also tried the food at lounge, the set lunch was tasty and great portion, service was excellent at the lounge. One thing I could not believe it was I requested extra bottle of water and the staff told me it will be $28 dollars. I understand some guests will ask for a lot but I would suggest just offer extra water for the first time request and second time need to charge. I booked directly from official and spend few thousands dollars on my room and dining and even internet... I'm even an elite member of your hotel group.. I think it's a bit stingy not…",30
"Being located on the southern island of Macao, it's far away from everything interesting (which is on the northern peninsula). The hotel lacks a bar and in general it lacked atmosphere.  Staff was nice, sometimes helpful (e.g. tip to catch a City of Dreams shuttle to get to the northern peninsula for free), sometimes unhelpful (I booked a room with breakfast included, someone from the reception told me this is not possible and sent me to the bar in the lobby).  The breakfast buffet (once I found it, it's outside of the Conrad part of the building complex) was huge, but a labyrinth - at first it wasn't clear to me which parts belong to the breakfast and nobody of the staff could answer me the simple question where I could get some eggs...  Charging extra for WiFi in the room is…",30
"The room was great but once you leave the room, it becomes average: - To get a drink in the lobby bar takes an eternity. - The ordered eggs at breakfast arrived with a considerable delay and were cold. - The beverage service at the pool was also extremely long. - No free internet in the room. When questioning this at checkout, we were told that it was allegedly free. - Although it did not matter in the end, the staff told us to wait in a wrong area for the shuttle bus.  On the upside, the spa was wonderful.",30
"The hotel rooms are spacious and comfortable, but there are nearby is still under construction , it is affecting environment , then breakfast in general, do not eat it anyway. Room not provided free wifi only in lobby if has this service in room be better.",30
"I have booked this hotel & arrived on 22 Dec 2013 at 2:30pm. The receptionist told me to come back after 3pm & the room should be ready & my luggage will be directly put in my room. However, when I came back at 3:30pm. The receptionist told me that the room was still not yet ready & would change another room to me. Also I needed to wait for another 15min for the luggage. Though I finally got another room after spending some time negotiating with the receptionist, this was totally unacceptable for such a 5-star hotel.  Once the hotel promised the customer, she should tried her best to make it done!",30
"I surprised my husband with a weekend get-away in Macao and decided to stay at Conrad Macao since I'm a Hilton Gold member.  The lobby was impressive but that's where the Conrad experience abruptly ended.  The lifts to the rooms were not located in the lobby but rather off to the side, near the mall and not particularly obvious.  There was a ""bouncer"" to make sure you had key cards before you  could enter the lift lobby and his steely glare made me feel more like a criminal rather than a welcomed guest. The decor of the common corridors and rooms were surprisingly sub-par to what I'm used to seeing at Conrad properties.  The carpet and wall-paper leading to our room had clashing patterns and literally made my husband feel seasick walking down to our room. Even though we were…",30
"The location is 8mins drive from airport, quite accessible to other casinos & shopping area (COD, sands cotai central, venetian & four seasons) in cotai strip. Nice clean room with FOC toy bear, candys & duckie, comfort bed but no free wifi while lobby area is free wifi.",30
"My experience does not support Conrad Macao Cotai Central being rated #1 of 82 hotel by Tripadvisors.  I was misled this time and regret making the wrong decision.   Conrad Macao Cotai shares the same Sands Cotai Central Complex with Sheraton and Holiday Inn.  The rates of the other two are lower.  So why pay more to stay in Conrad and use the same casinos, restaurants, and other facilities of the same complex, which as a whole is already showing age.  My wife and I booked online and paid Can$685 to stay 2 nights in Conrad, for a room with city view and a king size bed with breakfast included.  We are certainly not pleased to have to pay extra for Wi-Fi.    Now we are kicking ourselves for not choosing Galaxy Hotel which for around the same price would give us a suite of much…",30
"Lovely staff, good location, beautiful room, nice breakfast from in-room dining. But a charge for wifi?! Come on Conrad, catch up. We enjoyed our stay and it's good to be next to city of dreams, hard rock and Venetian. But the lack of wifi will probably mean we go elsewhere next time, in this day and age, and in that calibre of hotel, wifi should be a given. Hope Conrad sort it out soon.",30
"My wife and me stayed one night in the Konrad on 24/25 Oct. It was actually a birthday present flying down from Beijing to see the ""House of Dancing Water"". The overall design is very beautiful and high-end, no doubt. What is truly confusing for first time customers is the overall layout of the place as all is very unconnected - the lobby, the check-in, the elevator and the breakfast buffet restaurant. We didn't like it at all. What bothered us a lot during breakfast was the constant breeze of cold AC air - we changed our table twice, to no avail. They had made sure that airflow will cover the last corner. The breakfast room has no ambience, and feels like a big high-ceiling casino dining room. My major complaint is a tiny little matter that - as you will see - can have huge…",30
"Booked two adjoining rooms on 4th floor.  Unfortunately, it was directly facing another hotel (sheraton?) which had continuous (very loud) music till nearly 2am during both days of my stay.  Music was so loud you could actually hear every word of the songs.  Extremely unhelpful when trying to get young children to settle down.  Furthermore, on the dat i was checking out the flush on the toilet decided to breakdown resulting in overflooding of the bathroom.  Bad to worse!  Complained on check-out, Supervisor provided with name card so next time he will ensure i get a better room.  However, it is extremely unlikely that I will be returning to the Conrad.... ",30
"When I check in from the port. It was raining, I was carrying a large suitcase . Female staff she wore the uniform ( the hotel joint two other and Conrd). I said when I check in to the Conrd hotel . And help me to carry the luggage. However, she refused to have said no, to my request. Male staff who was also nearby did not help at all. And if I know that the shuttle bus is (to carry a human) service minimum, reject any further. I would have selected another transfers. It was a response that I do not think the hotel service.",30
"We stayed one night at the Conrad as a wrap up to a great Hong Kong trip.   Our stay in Macau began by catching the complimentary shuttle to the hotel, where the driver was asleep at the wheel and didn't get out to help anyone with putting their luggage under the bus.  When we got to the hotel, the lobby was lack-luster and having stayed at a wonderful (and slightly cheaper 5star hotel) in Hong Kong I was a bit disappointed.  The staff were not as attentive as in Hong Kong with us having to ask for our bags to be sent up to the room ( I just assumed this was normal practise in a 5 start hotel).  Our booking was for a ""pool view"" room which ended up being a ""building view"" as our room looked directly into a neighbouring hotel with zero view of anything but windows.  The room is…",30
"I was very happy with my previous stay when they first open this property in Macau in 2012. My whole family loved the Conrad executive lounge at the top floor. Quiet and spacious (the largest of all Hilton executive lounges I have ever visited), beautifully appointed and excellent (close to over) service and needless to say, the display and selection of food and beverage items! But one year later, on our 2nd visit to this property, the lounge at the top floor was gone. Instead they ""relocated"" the executive lounge to the noisy lobby bar - right in the middle of all hotel and casino traffic. What a major disappointment and downgrade. On my complaint, the management was apologetic and all. Yet, there is no more reason for us to come back to this hotel in the future.",30
"Everything is fine and good, the breakfast was very good, and the swimming pool was clean and tidy. But no free wifi in room was out of my expectation and please prepare drinks for yourself in room since the drinks is room are extremely expensive.",30
"If size is the only thing matters, then Conrad is the place for you. It was the biggest suite I ever had for the rate I paid. Everything was big, even the toilet nook; it’s bigger than the bathroom of some hotels. As a matter of fact, it had two, one in the master bathroom and the other by the foyer. Service was great too; the staff was friendly and efficient. So why was I not exactly satisfied?  Here is one reason, as soon as I walked into the room and looked out to the pool area below and the cityscape beyond, I was stunned by the streaks of grimes on the windowpane that dimmed my view. When I mentioned it to a receptionist at the front desk, she smiled as if she had heard it before, jotted something down, but the dirt remained for the three days I was there.  Another surprise…",30
"Maybe it is new but the service standard is simply inferior to most 5 star hotels.  The exception was the concierge manager. The room is clean but I would not consider it big for hotel standard in Macau. The pools that I viewed from my window look rather small for such a hotel.  Design of the lobby is not so appealing to me as well.  The shopping mall at Sands Cotai Central is not as good as the Venetian mall but hopefully when the connecting bridge is fully completed, it would be more convenient for the hotel guests to shop at Venetian mall. Overall, I am quite disappointed.",30
"Room 1314  Not sure where to start as improvement is needed.  Please note that my stay was in July 2012 so improvements may have been made since then.   I was really looking forward to staying here as I have fond memories of my stays in other Conrad facilities. In my mind, the Conrad brand is considered a “fancy schmancy” five star hotel. If you read my other reviews, you will see that I range from guesthouses to Super 8 to Shangri La’s. I really do adjust my expectations accordingly based on the hotel/motel type and cost.  The room itself was beautifully decorated but had a strong sewer smell.  Great seating areas with a sectional sofa, nice comfortable bed, separate tub and shower, multiple coffee and tea choices.  Incredible bathrobes. Very cute Conrad duck (clear with dice…",30
"My family (2 adults with 1 kid) stayed at the Conrad Hotel for 2 nights in the 2nd week of August.  The hotel is new and clean with great bedding.  Most of the staff are very nice with a smiling face.  However, as a resort, the swimming pool is too small.  It will definitely discourage guests to swim in such a pool.  Our room is on the 26th floor and we experienced regular noise, some vibrating sound like aircraft?? all through the day & night.  We don't know the source of such noise but it has inevitably affected the sleeping quality which counts too much for a good hotel.",30
"We've stayed in the property for 2 nights last week,  booked a King Club Suite. The property is very new since it is only opened for 3 months. We've been staying in the Suite in Four Seasons, MO and Grand Hyatt in Macau in the past 3 years and sorry to say, it is really not up to standard! The room is ok, as a suite in the Cotai, it is small, The suite in FS is mush bigger and with much amenities in the room. You just won't expect you need to ask for a DVD when you stayed at the club suite which I will think it is something very basic! But you need to call them to ask for a DVD, then they told you we have to wait since it may not be available (Can you imagine you need to share this machine with the guests from both Holiday Inn and Conrad!). Then what till the DVD arrived, it…",30
