"To be honest, the interior is nice and glamorous but that's it.  We wanted to change to a standard room instead of a queen-sized bed but we were told no room. In this covid19 situation and in late-Chinese national holiday which I strongly doubt it cuz the girl was asking other staff if we can get the room or not.  So our room was arranged to the opposite side of the lake and there's absolutely no view at all. We wanted to change to the lake side but also told it's 'difficult'. We'd pay for it.  The most unbearable case was at the bell service, where we had our luggage checked first. One of the concierge girl came and helped us, but she used her feet to balance our luggage on the ground which was a backpack.  I don't think it's appropriate for a girl, for a hotel man, or a service person to do such behavior, and it's simply just rude. Most of the staffs at the front foor are Taiwanese.  I'd not recommend this hotel to anyone anymore although it was my second time staying in this hotel but it will definitely be my last.  There's plenty of other great hotels to stay, you just don't expect too much despite of the price. I'd say St. Regis would be a wiser choice or any other hotels.  To prove I stayed here I post a pic.…",20
"We first had a good impression on the hotel as we came for a special occasion.I was almost planning my next visit. However, It was ruined a bit when we were told to pay MOP1085 for an hour late checkout later the day. I was Wynn insider member and supposed to get 2pm late checkout. Since I knew we’d stay up late, spend some night times downstairs or in casinos. Therefore, I did want to get some rest in the room after breakfast which was half an hour queuing at Fontana. Unfortunately I couldn’t get a room through the hotel website while the other online travel agencies still have plenty of rooms of your hotel available (that’s weird as they REALLY have MANY rooms available at the time of booking). I had to book the hotel room through one of the agencies at last minute. When I…",10
A very palatial place and the most wonderful facilities and ambience totally ruined by rude and arrogant staff!!!  The only two staff I would recommend is Britney and Patrick in reception!!!   The room was upgraded to a parlor suite and that was pure bliss.... Great property but need to work on your software... And unfortunately that's what counts... The people working to deliver that service.  Pics attached. ,10
"The hotel did have a very beautiful decoration, you may enjoy a feast with our eyes. However, I had a horrible experience at the last momemt. FOUR peoples used more than 25 minutes to find our bags. We almost missed our boat on that day. This mess really destorys all my good impression on this hotel. The efficiency of the hotel service is really bad.  Anyway, you may take a round of the hotel.",20
"From Sheraton we walked over and entered Wynn Palace on October 25 around 1025-1030pm via the cable car station in the building. Upon entering the premises and I approached the only staff there to enquire when next show will start.   He looked at me, smirking, and simply replied sarcastically (I can understand but can't speak) in cantonese:  ""You speak to me in English? I DO NOT KNOW English.""   More smirking and all the while with an altitude like a rude, impolite and unwelcoming bouncer from an underground gambling den.  I was extremely shocked and disappointed the very first Wynn staff I approached was behaving in such an unprofessional manner. Naturally our money went to other nearby casinos that night.   Talked about first impression.",10
"Looking for a disaster? Go to Wynn Palace.  After watching the Fountain show, I wanted to take a taxi. When I was trying to get in, the door staff literally just pushed me into the taxi and closed the door without noticing that 1/3 of my dress was stuck between the car door. By then my dress has already been ripped and I had to walk on the street with a huge hole in the back just right below my butt the whole night because I didn't bring any extra clothes with me and it was already late at night. It was one of my favourite dresses but the door staff just destroyed it and most importantly I was put into the most embarrassing situation ever as someone on the street even approached me and asked if I was ok (though I got raped or something).  This was absolutely ridiculous. A total…",10
"I think this is creepy. And a invasion of a guest’s privacy.    I left a bag of my medicines on the room table; and i saw this note beside it after housekeeping cleaned the room.   The medicine could have been vitamins.  But for housekeeping to write the note... meant she took a look at the contents of the bag and read that they were not vitamins; hence, the contents of the note she left.  Nonetheless, i think it is bad taste.",10
"I have several times stayed with Wynn Palace but this time it was a nightmare. The Hotel is beautiful and amazing but the beauty doesn’t reflect the Service you get. We booked for 3 nights but due to some misunderstandings and errors, which was not caused by us, they had in their System the booking for one night. Upon Arrival we informed the Front Desk clearly that we are staying for 3 Nights which they were fine with. Next day we start getting calls from the early morning if we were checking out. We informed them again that we will be staying for 3 Nights. We thought now the issue is solved and we can enjoy our stay but then in afternoon someone else calls us with the same question and at night again. This happened every single day. We had to confirm to more than 10 different…",10
"Had very high expectations since last visit when it just opened to hopefully iron out the small kinks. Took the kids this time to experience the luxury of the Wynn. What a mistake! The host tells me, that there is no gurantee, but good chance of an early check in at 12 noon. So we book a nice lunch at the Fortuna buffet, great value , great location in front of the fountains. Service is good but choice is slightly limited, Belon in the Banyan Tree it is not, but at half the pricve good value. Try to get the early check in, front desk says 3pm, so iw whinge a bit and they take my cell phone and tell me that they will see what they can do. No calls, countless trips on the sky cab (its free for guests), but you need to show your key card and get a ticket, which is bit painful.…",20
"I can say the hotel itself is pretty luxurious but lacks service recovery.   However, my boyfriend booked us a night stay for our anniversay by phone and he informed to have the room with the fountain view and also told that we were there for anniversary and later also received an email confirmation by the reservation Josephine Chiu (photo attached) and to his surprise- when he checkin, He was given the smallest room and no view at all and they never gave any amenities for our anniversary.   So when we got the room, we were not happy and called the guest service and carol assisted us to room move to a better view room and slightly bigger and we ask for a late check out they they said latest is 13:00 and we ask if we can have a little later - she said really the latest she can…",20
"When I checked in in the morning, someone I did not know was booked with me. But I was relieved because your staff told that there was nothing wrong with me. I returned to the hotel in the evening i can not enter my rood because the key did not work. When I contacted the staff, I was embarrassed that my room had changed without any mention . I was so tired that I packed my bags in the 20th floor and went to the newly assigned room, and I found that  the stranger was already in the room. The manager upgraded the room, but I was not feeling well. Especially the most unpleasant thing was that the next day when I checked out, the staff was the employee who checked in the day before and there was no apology to me.",20
"Being a regular to Macau, I have stayed at all the luxury hotels on the Cotai Strip. Wynn Palace is by far the most opulent. What sets these luxurious hotels apart from the rest, is the customer service.  This is my 4th stay at Wynn Palace, and I have only had positive experiences until now. The property, room, decorations, all elements of the hard products are simply breathtaking. Steve Wynn did an exceptional job designing this hotel.   However, the soft product, or customer service aspect, needs to be retrained and improved. Upon checkout of my recent stay on January 7th, I proceeded to the Registration. I gave my room number and key to the registration agent. She looked up my room and said ""Oh you have ordered a movie in your room last night. The charge will be 135 MOP.…",20
"It was holiday after ny2017. Expected and excited initially with staying at Wynn Palace, but disappointments set in as you step in to check-in.  Checking at 4:30pm ( 3pm check in time ) to be notified that there is no room yet available in the next hour. We urged and gave us a non-smoking that smells smoked.  We have to wait another hour to have another room arranged. We were kept waiting for that long with room service kept telling us that they will send someone to our room with new keys.  I was certain of the waiting time because we watched the fountain show for 3 times!!  Eventually got arranged a fresh room and went out around Taipa. We were amazed with other nearby hotels, and saddened with the fact that we are staying in this pseudo 5-star deluxe hotel!  Next disaster was…",10
"I'm staying from 25-28 Nov 2016. Gave feedback on the first day on 2 to 3 occasions on the poor air conditioning. The Airconditioning temperature is set at 19 degree Celsius and the temperature remains high. Service staff, Peter, came and sounded defensive trying to manage us by saying and perhaps we need to take a shower or it will take a longer while. The fan speed was at auto and not high and the temperature was set at 20 and not 19 degree Celsius. At the highest fan speed, the aircon vent is not even blowing out cool air at all when I stand on the bench to feel the vent.   A very, very big disappointment. If service recovery is not done, it is the last time I am going to choose Wynn. There is no point apologizing if service recovery cannot even be carried out for a 3 night…",10
"You might have to prepare some cash if you order in-room dining. Because I was asked to pay in CASH or a Credit card without password.  And don't forget to check the minibar usage when you check-out. I was charged for almost 1000 HKD, which I did not even touched. (although it was adjusted, it was very unpleasant experience)",20
I spend 30 mins to check in the hotel and I spend 20 mins to check out. It's really waste a lot time to waiting for! Also I purchase the boat ticket and spend my 1 hour to wait front the counter! They told me that system is crash!!! After I check out the hotel and I found my phone charger might be forgot in the room. I ask them to check if my charger in the room and they said please wait here. I am wait for another 30 mins there and get the feedback is we don't have time to check your charge now. What about you go back to your rooms to check? OMG... what service they provide? I will not stay this hotel again!!!  But the room is clean and big. ,20
"After 5 visits with Cafe Fontana since its opening, my impression and satisfaction level with this Ritzy cafe has come down hill overtime. Why do I rate this cafe shop as poor currently ?  My initial ratings on the first 2 or even 3 visits were average or even above average. The dining room has been decorated uniquely with a magnificent view of the performance lake. The background music jives in with glamours dining pleasure. The servers and the team manager were helpful in accommodating diners' needs.  The poor part was the food variety. The cafe only offered buffet and very limited A La Carte. The food in general was near average but I think its performance lake and service lifted up its reputation more above average.  The price was in general OK for upscale dining.  Here is…",20
"My friend stayed at Wynn Palace and advised me to check with them on the TV channels provision as she found lack of choices. As my hubby is a big TV fans, I would like to do some research before my stay. I sent message to Wynn Palace via its official facebook page, the admin replied me within 1 day and promised to get back to me asap. Then after 1 full day, the fb admin told me to call direct to hotel enquiry or send another email to its inquiry instead!!! My goodness!!! All I am asking is what TV channels they provided, it should be an easy questions I assumed. Then I sent email to its inquiry asking for the room facilities, after 2 full days, I didn't get any reply!!!!! The special room promotion has ended.  Wynn Palace claims that they provide you 'palace' 'royal' experience,…",10
"Came here twice in two months during grand opening and for my wedding anniversary. Front office staff managers highly inexperienced and  lack professionalism and are quick to overpromise and under deliver. After a brutally subpar first visit where they booked me into a already occupied room by Chinese loan shark gangster and wee-morning hour visits by casino prostitutes ringing my doorbell,  front office staff were quick to apologize for the mix up and say they would ""WOW"" me on my next visit. They definitely WOWed me by overbilling me and laying the blame on others. Wynn Palace is a  superficial oasis facade with an immense problem of employees lacking leadership and ownership.",10
We had to wait an hour to be seated for breakfast. I've never had to wait for breakfast in any hotel. I was with my grandparents who are 90 and 88 (one of them in a wheelchair) and they would not help prioritize us and let other VIPs cut before us.,20
"First of all: the hotel is new and the style looks fantastic. Nice suites, newest technical gimmicks and a great selection of shops around the casino. However, the staff at reception and guest relation is useless, lies to guests and causes anger and confusion. The good: Spacious rooms, great design, brilliant amenities Fountain and music show almost as good as at Burj Khalifa (Armani Hotel) Koon decor amazing Nice casino with elegant atmosphere   Great service at the pool restaurant  The bad: Disappointing gym facing walls No access to the pool area to watch the fountain after 8 pm A lot of tourists running around and disturbing guests The ugly: Reception can't handle the amount of guests checking in, level of English could be better Useless guest relation: my TVs didn't work…",20
"I went to make a complaints here regarding to my bad experience as I can not find your hotel e-mail address from website. I had stayed in your hotel on 11th-12th Sep, room no.1776 Ms. Tang. I had given feedback and complaint to the duty manager at the hotel lobby when I was check out yesterday and I hope the duty manager had followed up my complaint regarding to my bad experiences at swimming pool yesterday morning at 11:30 am. I checked in the swimming pool, no staff escort me to the sunbed and I had to found the space to seat by myself and finally I had found a sunbed in the swimming pool. But I sit there more than 15 minutes, no one provide towel and water to me and my friend. Therefore I had looked for the pool staff to give me a food and drink menu. I had ordered some food…",10
"I had stayed in Wynn Palace with my family and overall experience is good. However, the services in the swimming pool is very bad, no staff doing services in the pool deck and the pool staff attitude was very bad and not caring the guests. The facts, I was enjoying the sunbath in swimming pool and I was asked the pool staff Cesar for water, towel and food menu but the staff was trying to ignored me as he was playing his mobile phone until I had raised up hand 3 time to ask him for services. When I was leaving the pool, he was not allow me and my son to bring the towel to back to the room. During the conversation, he was very rude and no services at all.  Unbelievable that such a luxury hotel the services was like that, the above experience were make me and my family were very…",10
"We stayed in the suite for 5 days, the hotel and the room itself is very beautiful with views towards the fountain show and swimming pool. However the service in that place is very poor!   Firstly, when we arrived the hotel we got told by the staff our room wasn't included breakfast and asked us to go somewhere else to eat. (We had double checked with them many times as we remembered we booked a room with breakfast.)  Secondly, we wanted to take our clients to afternoon tea on the other day and the staff told us there's no reservations allowed and you have to just WALK IN by luck as they only have ""20 sets"" of afternoon tea a day with hundreds of guests waiting!   They also have like 10 staff saying goodbye to guests while only one cleaning the table and serving the guest!   The…",20
"Since when a luxury resort has this habit of changing policies for their own convenience instead for patrons?    Not accepting reservation for any meal sessions and telling you to walk-in?    Is it because you can't control the floor and  balance the flows? So to make sure your in-houses have enough seats, the walk-ins have to be the ones to suffer?  I made a reservation at the buffet restaurant few days after your opening, then called in to cancel on 31 August.  I called again this evening, wanting to keep my reservation and I was given a ""NO"".  But why didn't you people tell me the ""NEW POLICY"" when I called to cancel?  I could have just cut down the capacity then cancelling the whole booking as we are actually going to celebrate a birthday.    The Birthday Star likes buffets,…",20
"This is a place with countless staff but no one willing or able to help you. It takes multiple exchanges with the staff to get an answer to even the most basic of questions, they nickel and dime you on every corner, and the facilities are not very clean or well maintained. Do Not Waste Your Money Here! (unless you have children there are seemingly more children than adults). This was supposed to be a romantic birthday getaway for my Fiancée, however now our perception of Macau is forever tainted.",10
