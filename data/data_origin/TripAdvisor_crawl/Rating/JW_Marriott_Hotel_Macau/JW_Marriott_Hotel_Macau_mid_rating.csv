"There are various so called 5 stars hotel in macau. Similar to Las Vegas, patrons came over to gamble.   I stayed here for two nights. It’s only an average hotel, and there is nothing interesting to write home praising it.  But, the room is reasonably clean, and the services are acceptable.  Let me give you a booking tip, please do not book it through booking.com or those devious apps, because the “extra” charges are steep while the listing price is insanely expensive. You should book it through the local Macanese travel agent, and it will be nearly half of the price.  Don’t be an idiot. Be smart.",30
"Macau has a huge offer of hotels.  This one is new and facilities are very impressive, specially the swimmingpool and water games (which are shared with other hotels nearby), but I felt nothing special if I compare with others.  I am a memeber for Marriott Bonvoy and the staff did not make me feel like I was, no special offers for nothing and not complimentary extras.  Gym is small and there also lack of quality at the sauna and steam room.  Maybe it´s OK for the customers that spend 90% at the Casino, but if your are also a tourist that goes for enjoy facilities and the room, my choice will be other.",30
"This is my third consecutive year to stay here. The suite is amazing, clean, nice resort view. Thanks to Guest Services Manager Samantha and Ana. Best of the best employees especially Samantha. However, it was the worst experience at The Lounge (restaurant) at the ground floor. We are sad and angry. Been waiting the food for over 30mins and there are ONLY 3 TABLES only!! yet the food is cold and bad services from the foreign waitress.  Should go to Ritz Carlton Cafe at first. Anyway, we are huge fan of this hotel but this experience as minor as it still affect out loyalty.",30
"Cant fault this hotel - 5 stars for room (upgraded and luxury), housekeeping and breakfast (great service from urban kitchen-very engaging staffs). The loss of the 2 stars (unfortunately) were from reception and concierge. Reception was unsure of upselling prices of breakfast - replies were “child breakfast cost 80 something”. Would expect an accurate amount. On our last day, we were taking the shuttle to the ferry terminal. Was sure that it was macau taipa terminal but the concierge told us that it should be macau outer terminal since we are taking turbojet. Glad we followed our own instinct..else will have missed our ferry. ",30
"2-Days-1-Night Trip in Macau again. We traveled with our 5 years old kid. 3 in total. We have stayed in various hotels in Macau and this is the 1st time we stay in JW Marriott. It is so-called 5 stars hotel and the largest JW Marriott in Asia and that's why we would like to have a try.  Pros: 1. Fast Check-in service  2. Excellent facilities in the room, including coffee maker, switchable window, electronic curtain, good toiletries, etc.  3. Good swimming pools and the water park resort.  Cons: 1. We especially noted to the hotel that we would come with our 5 years old kid but there is NOTHING prepared for our kid, no toothbrush, no slippers, no bathrobe...We called the Guest Service to ask for them but after 15 minutes of the call, the lady replied that the bathrobe is out of…",30
JW Marriot is a relatively quiet hotel located within the larger Galaxy Macao complex. Decoration wise it is rather basic but service is good and most staff speaks good English unlike the majority of most other hotel staff who speaks only local Cantonese and Mandarin. It is rather strange and annoying as these staff seem to have little tolerance if you speak to them in English and are generally very unfriendly and unhelpful. These hotels will turn away tourists who do not speak Cantonese or Mandarin. Good luck to them ,30
"Good 1) large room with comfort decoration 2) most of the staffs were helpful and friendly 3) delicious buffet breakfast 4) constant temperature swimming pool  Bad 1) bathrobe had dirt Worst 1) front desk staff - During check in, I requested front desk staff to talk with me by English or Cantonese.  Lynn was spoke with me by fluent English, no smile, gave me a black look.   What's wrong?  Although overall was good, the first image was worst.  I always like to choose Marriott, don’t know why both Marriott & Courtyard made me felt unhappy recently.  A good hotel can’t without friendly staffs, unfriendly staffs make the hotel become worst.",30
"After all the opportunities and alllowance for this top tier luxury hotel, service standard definitely needed solid improvement to match its hardware.  Slow and relatively inapt responses are recurrent for providing solution to thier error.  Incapable of real customer care to meet 5-star standard for my case.",30
"Tried to spend the weekend there at JW Marriott Macau, but ended up we had to check out after one night.  The hotel is a big hotel with a proper lobby.   It looked great but the lobby was always full of people all the time when we were there, all the seats were occupied so it was impossible for my family to take seats while I was doing the check in.   Room was big, the beds were large enough. Bathroom was nice and large too. The toilet was an automatic toilet. The shower room was big but the shower door couldn't be closed properly, so the bathroom would be flooded after shower. The room had good lighting and it was good to have a coffee machine in the room.  The kids club was great, with excellent staff. We could leave our kids there for hours and the staff took good care of…",30
"the hotel is fabulous but some of the problems need to be paid more attention.  we arrived the hotel at 3pm last Sunday and supposed we could get our rooms on time, after 10 more mins checking, the front desk staff persuaded us to come back after swimming then he could arrange us 3 rooms to be in the same floor.  as i knew some facilities would be closed at 6:30pm, we wanted to have our rooms first and didn't mind if our rooms were on diff floors.  then he checked for few mins again, my room was still unavailable and he told me my room could be checked out lately at 1pm the next day. he told me I could have my room card at 3/F, so i didn't need to go to the lobby after swimming at the 3/F.    First I was told the delivery service wasn't available when I was in the pool entrance.…",30
"We spent 3 nights at the hotel. The hotel is located in the Cotai part of Macau, which is an area rich with resorts, but less with other attractions. it is part of a gigantic complex of hotels and a shopping mall, called Galaxy.  We arrived from Hong Kong airport with a ferry to the Cotai pier and took the Galaxy shuttle bus to the hotel. The shuttle takes apx. 10-15 minutes to reach the hotel, after stopping at several other hotels of the huge Galaxy complex.  Upon entering the hotel, one cannot escape the beauty of the lobby, with its glitzy (yet not over-the-top) design, and just how freezing the a/c is. However, as Marriott Gold members, we were quickly escorted to the Club lounge on the 2nd floor for a nicer, more private check-in.  Check in was quick and courteous. We made…",30
"Stayed here with my family (2 boys, ages 13 and 8, plus husband) in an Executive Lounge room. You pay much more for an Executive room, compared to the standard room rate, but the Executive room gives you complimentary access to a buffet breakfast, afternoon tea, and a buffet dinner (they don't call it dinner, but there is so much food you could easily make it dinner). Unfortunately the room is the same as any other standard room... you are paying for access to the lounge and the buffets.  Pros: Pool access. This is really the only ""pro"" given the high price. The Grand Resort Deck is shared by all the hotels that surround it, but you have an amazing lazy river, 3 huge water slides, a wave pool, and the hotel pool itself. Kids love it. Would be nice if there was more lounge…",30
"staff from front line works very hard to deliver their services. the people working in club lounge also trying very hard to fulfill customer's need. but i find the food quality there is not attractive at all especially the food quality, the quantity for the afternoon tea.",30
"I suppose JW Marriott will be a nice hotel providing friendly service and the room hotel restaurants would be nice also. It seems that this hotel services was under JW Marriott service quality as the staff was not care about handing customers who were not following the queue for check in. Also, since it is a large hotel offering a lot of room, their check in counter was extremely small which resulted a long queue for checking in and out. Well, I hope Marriott could consider adding some portable counter to handing check in or check out request during rush hour. Thank You",30
Stayed for two nights for business..excellent service from airport to check in..rooms was spacious but stingy on the nespresso cubes (only 2 provided and next day there were no refill) first experience which is least expected.  Peking duck during the lunch buffet was excellent but the server was rude ,30
"Check in was a swift. The room's design was ok, but I was surprised that the bathroom's door could not be properly closed - likely that it wasn't installed properly and creates sharp noises and causes a deep scratch on the marble floor. This happened to both rooms I have booked.   Furniture was with relatively sharp edges so beware if you're staying with kids. Breakfast is at the restaurant which connects to the mall and offers typical buffet breakfast of a 5-star hotel but nothing special.  Our room had the view of the water fountain of Galaxy Complex which was nice :)  I stayed at Ritz-Carlton next to JW Marriott the night before moving to JW Marriott and it was during Chinese New Year so the prices were equally expensive, Ritz was slightly more expensive but it wasn't a big…",30
"The hotel ambience, amenities and rooms are definitely of a 5-star hotel standard, however, the staff need to be more attentive and service-oriented to their guests, especially those at concierge, bell service and doormen. Their demeanour show no interest in serving guests and are unenthused with working at the hotel, by not greeting guests with a happy smile, and a simple warm greeting is hard come by.  Their service is lacklustre, as we had dropped by the Hard Rock Hotel as a visitor and were assisted very well by the doormen there, who helped us tell the taxi driver where we wanted to go in mandarin, where the doormen at JW Marriott couldn't even open the taxi door for us when we left or arrived.  Breakfast spread remained the same each morning we were there, where most…",30
"I REALLY like JW Marriott hotels so it’s a bit strange for me to say that I probably wouldn't want to come back to this one in particular.  I think giving this an average grade is very harsh but I'm a big believer in the statement that people make a hotel not necessarily the building.    First of all the positives!!  The pool (as per the other reviews) is amazing!!  If you have kids - go here for this.  They will play here for hours and for smaller kids a very nice play area.  The rooms are well equipped and decorated with a lovely art deco theme which is very pleasing to the eye.  All the good stuff like subtle and elegant lighting, comfortable beds as well as all the gizmos and gadgets.  These include a tv screen built into the bathroom mirror, remote controlled toilet seat as…",30
The hotel is nice and has access to the resort deck which is nice.   Staff are excellent and friendly.  It compares very unfavourably to the ritz Carlton next door though and for a suite the ritz is around the same price.     The food and drinks in the ritz lounge is so much better and feels more like a restaurant.  If you are with a family just go next door,30
"This is my second time visiting the hotel, nice environment but staff are getting less friendly. The checkin process took almost 25 mins to complete, while the requests ive already put upon reservation, but still, everything has to reconfirm all again. Very unprofessional staff - Fantasy.  Rooms are very nice. Not recommend to take breakfast in the hotel - bad quality and service at the restaurant. You can find more options at the mall. ",30
"Stay at JW Marriott Macau for 3 nights with my family in Jun. Really have mix feeling when writing down this review.  Marriott is my favorite hotel brand. So, Booking at JW was an easy decision for me. I am bit paranoid. therefore, i always confirm my booking detail with hotel if i book via agent or website. After I complete my booking online this time, i send an email and make several calls wants to confirm my booking detai. But, they just refuse to confirm it with me an ask me to check with the website. This is unacceptable to me. I made an escalation and it was solved. Miss Sally from customer caring was very professional to handle my escalation. And I was offered with an room upgrade. As I was booking 2 rooms for may family, i was also committed to have those two rooms at…",30
"Amazing Room. It is a cozy, comfortable and spacious room. New hotel with fanastic design and luxury bathroom amenities. The hotel guest can access all leisure pools including lazy river of the Galaxy Resort World but exclude the private pool for guest of the Banyan Tree Hotel. Recommended hotel in Macau.  However, please be reminded that the check in arrangement and service provided from the front desk staffs are absolutely terrible and unprofessional.",30
"We have visited this hotel before when it was new, the rooms are excellent and well appointed, the executive club is very good (thanks Cliff and Joan) and the pools are great for families.  Booking a connecting room for us and our small children however seemed to be one step too far for the central reservations, being unable to confirm a connecting room until we payed for the two rooms and actually arrived in Macau.  Seriously!!  (too bad if the answer was no when we arrived!!)  Many phone calls and emails to fix something so simple.  Not everyone who visits this hotel is from a one child family, Marriott.  Also, the beds had an unpleasant odour when sat on initially, a room change clearly not an option after the ordeal getting the connecting suites in the first place!  So a…",30
"I did an express check out last Friday and I am expecting an invoice to be sent to my email in 2-3 days. However, it's not received after 5 days. Then, I have to call the hotel telephone number which couldn't get through 2 times out of 4. And I have to wait for the front desk to answer me twice but not succeed. Finally, I have to look for the busy duty manager but he/she was too busy to take my call. Then, the reception guy said he could help to send me the invoice at once. What kind of this customer service which require so much effort. I would expect way better service by JW Marriott, or it's just poor management of whoever the owner is.  My advice, avoid express check out and insist in getting it sent to your email if you need a soft copy before you leave the hotel. It's…",30
"We had a 3 days 2 nights stay in the executive room with executive lounge access in JW Marriot Macau last weekend. Everything was perfect, the room, the view, the pools, and the food. We had a really good time and enjoyed everything.  But after we checkout and left the hotel, my grandpa found out he forgot his medicine in the room, I called the hotel back right away and thankfully they found the pills. but here's the thing, the lady told me go back to hotel right away and she will leave the medicine at the checkin counter with a message. As I go back to the hotel, I waited for 15 mins in line, then the staff asked for the guest identity (got confirmed thru phone with my grandma) then I waited another 20mins for her to get the pills, as she came back she asked for my identity…",30
The hotel is very nice that can connect to a couple of other hotels' swimming pools. It fun to stay a whole day there just for swimming and water games. Hotel staff are friendly with decent buffet and a Chinese restaurant. The only thing is that our room is full of second hand smoke smells despite it is a non smoking hotel.  ,30
"The hotel is impressive when you first walk in: high ceilings, large chandeliers, modern furnishings and a huge lobby.  The room was beautifully decorated.  It had that modern, new vibe combined with the business hotel feel that most JW’s have.  Sadly though, it’s the service and room that was disappointing.  When we made our reservations we told them we required a connecting room.  That was the reason we stayed there as they said they would confirm this.  When we arrived they said they only had one connecting room and it was at the end of the hall.  We got there and were upset that the connecting room where our kids were sleeping smelled like cigarettes – despite this being a non-smoking floor  We requested a change in room or upgrade but they said neither was possible.  They…",30
"This hotel was recommended by a good friend and I booked it for a one night stay in Macau. It is very new and spick and span.happy to say rooms are very spacious.  Very reasonable rates too for such a beautiful property - unfortunately because it is so new - it seemed to have some teething problem - bathroom wash sink was clogged , television channels had problems with reception etc.  Service was good efficient and polite but as I only stayed one night and had to rush back to Hong Kong island early the next day , I had no chance to try out the restaurants or explore other facilities in the hotel besides the gym which was large and well-equipped.  This hotel is adjacent to the suites only Ritz Carlton - do go over next door for a look around !",30
"We had an early check in that morning since we were switching hotel from galaxy.  I think there must be a system problem overall in their chexk in process.  We had to wait for long time already for the morning check in as we insisted to check in first since we like to just pick up the keys as we had a bad experience checking in from galaxy.   We just wanted to pick up the keys later in the day.   Again. . Just to pick up the keys, we have to wait for 15 mins and then the process is another 10 mins.   This seems ridiculous to me if it's claimed to be a 5 stars hotel.   It seems like no one understand what to do. .the hotel overall is facility is nice though with many nice features such as tv in the bathroom. .. you turn on a switch to turn the blinds. .. etc... but the wait tone…",30
"We chose the hotel based on the other reviews on Tripadvisor, especially those that mentioned exceptional service.   We didn't want to stay at a big hotel in Macau with the long check in queues and impersonal service (Venetian/Galaxy). And having done the near perfect but no complex attached Mandarin Oriental, we wanted a hotel that had great service but would allow easy access to shops and food. We had hoped that the Marriott would be the answer. Sadly, we were mistaken.   Rooms are modern, fantastic. Check in at Easter was a fiasco. Long queues, messy and impersonal. Further annoyed by a man standing too close at the check in line picking his nose. (OK. That was neither here nor there) Room was clean but in housekeeping's hurry, they had left some rubbish on the counter in the…",30
"I have stayed here before but only for a night at a time and it was fine, but now I am here on a 10 day stretch and the cracks are showing big time. The rooms are wonderful with the exception that they are extremely cold at this time of year and the maintenance seems to be lacking, for example the very expensive Japanese style toilet doesn't do half the wonderful things its meant to and there is no point attempting to explain it to the management as in general English ability is near zero over the phone.  The real killer is the service, rooms are not serviced until late afternoon (today after 6 and only after a complaint), the amenities are not restocked even after requests, nor is the minibar restocked, which while not a major issue does cost the hotel money.  Next the club…",30
"Stay for 3D2N, come back to the hotel for my sister's birthday and expect some iimprovement. But no surprise at all compare to my last visit. Check-in is smooth as I had already write to the hotel, thanks Sergio for that. If you standard is only expected a spacious room, then that will do. For us, we prefer to spend some more time in the hotel, then that may not be the prefect place. They do not have indoor swimming pool, the service is still at their slow movement speed. The communication is still a problem, I ask for a ""paper bag"" at the check-in counter ( at that moment, it is not busy), I had to speak to 2 ladies at the counter, then I get a A4 paper in return. The staff Elaine is too clear what her role is, she told me thay don't have it and ask me to go to  the concierge…",30
Stay there 14 dec to 17 dec. Booked 3 rooms and Stayed 3 nights with sister families. The doors lock come with high tech security . One of our room door 17206 batter was flat and could not be open . The house keeping did not clean our room the previous day probably because of that but they did not feedback . This morning I was stuck outside of my room. They made me went down to concierge twice and waited for more than one hour before they sent someone to change the lock. I went to the hotel manager to feedback on this event and they just told me that they were sorry that this happen.,30
"Book a 2 night family package in JW Marriot Galaxy last week. Check in to a excellent room early as a marriot member online and was given a choice of my room. While i was in my room, another guest got a key and walk into my room! This is absurd! How can another guest have the key to my room and this is unacceptable?! This shows how ""well trained"" the front desk are when they encounter numerous check in at the same time and alloted rooms which are already been taken up! My family was upset and so was the other party. However, I should give a special compliment to the Relationship Manager -Princess Lat who came up to my room to offer her apologies and sent amenities to my room. She even help me book the dinner buffet at Urban Kitchen which was already full for the whole month,…",30
"We stay for two nights in early Aug. The hotel was nicely decorated and beautifully designed as you would expect from any new hotel. The service hotline was great and requests are promptly addressed. However, the check-in and check-out process were completed a waste of time. Although I must admitted we were allocated a great room facing the resort.  The breakfast items are great but it's difficult to find a table after 8:30. The most frustrating part comes with the lack of knowledge about our package purchased. We have to chase every item to see if it was included. My understanding on the package is different from hotel's interpretation and so some of items are offered only once despite we have stayed for two nights. It's sad we are not able to have a great time in such…",30

At check in, was asked to sign guest registration where details arent all that accurate, address listed as bangkok in hkg, check in lady said she fixed it in computer (then why didnt she give me a corrected one to sign?). Then was the payment, listed as cash, but agoda was credit card prepayment. There was also the departure time, check out is 11am the following day, but the registration states 00:00.

"It is new in macau, so we were excited to try. We had a room with the club lounge. However, as a 5 stars hotel, the service at the lobby and lounge need to be improved. The staff at lounge made me feel like i was having dimsum in chinese restaurant which the staff always try to ignore customers and give bad service. One female staff is friendly and helpful, but others... It is mainly how i feel about the stay this time.  Other things are very standard as in macau,  nothing surprise us. ",30
"It was a complimentary stay (Friday Night, June 24) given by my friend so i was happy to try this brand new hotel! The Lobby is bright and comfortable as they have a window ceiling which is good. My bad memories start up from the elevator, it was smell and the buttons are not function right. The hallway of my floor feels like there is no AC on. The view of the room is quite nice especially in the evening. But how could you enjoy the view when the windows are muddy and full of water spot? i went down to the swimming pool in the afternoon, it was very nice, and the food from the pool side restaurant is good too. After i done with swimming, i went up to the room and when i open the door, something fell and hit on my toes, it was painful!! and that object is the lock of the door!!!…",30
"I went to this new hotel for the MLTR concert package. Staff responsible for the check-in is a bit careless. After I gave him my credit, he walked away to collect the MLTR concert ticket, with my credit card left at the front desk. It would be nice if he could give it back to me. He also told me the wrong number of floor I stay and failed to show me the location of escalator.  I expressed my concern in check-out and requested a written feedback, they dealt with it promptly, which I appreciate. However, I expect a high standard of service in JW Marriott, it is disappointing.  The design of the hotel room is quite nice, but there is difficulty in opening the drawer/door, they are not smooth at all., my mum even get hurt because of that.  I sincerely hope that it will be improved…",30
"Not the best experience, as the staff is badly organised. From the hostess at the ferry pier who could not speak english at all and made us wait in the heat with a toddler for 40 minutes as the shuttle was late to the horrible receptionist. I guess this is Marriott according to China standards. The only positive things were the skimming pool facilities and the executive lounge staff who were extremely friendly and helpful. Not worth it at all.",30
