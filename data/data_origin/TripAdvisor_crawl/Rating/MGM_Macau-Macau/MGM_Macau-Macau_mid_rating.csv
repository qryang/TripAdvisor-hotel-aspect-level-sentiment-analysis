"We stayed here for the GP. Very few of the staff can speak English, they don’t provide fresh milk in the fridge for tea or coffee. Getting them to understand we drink English style tea was a mission. The restaurant was good breakfast and lunch was good. If you don’t gamble Macau is not for you...we don’t gamble. There are no shops around the only ones in the area are high end and in the Casinos. I would not recommend Macau or this area for family’s at all very much for Casino and Gambling.  We went for the GP which was great. We did have a few staff that were very friendly and helpful.",30
" The checked in staff was not professional as a 5 star hotel staff, chit chat with the colleague next to him during the process, the smile was not for welcoming guest but the conversation with his colleague. ",30
"Hotel check-in was excruciatingly slow even though we checked in at 3pm and there was hardly any guest checking in.   My husband use a Company credit card and reception keep asking if he could use a personal card instead (It's a business trip for him). We find it rather odd as we never face this problem with any hotels we have stayed in Macau  (Grand Hyatt, The Venetian, etc) or any other country. It was to the point of getting annoying, we never get to find out why but in the end he get to use the credit card.  We were than informed we could not have our room yet as it is not ready; even though check-in time is 3pm. In the end our room was ready after 4pm.  Luckily room is ok and rather spacious with a small sitting area.  A little gaudy, but that is subjective.  Bathroom is…",30
"Rooms are spacious and well appointed with large bathroom. Nice set of amenities. Good choice of restaurants and cafes (great pastries) and high quality food. Breakfast spread was varied and food excellent. Fitness is well equipped but unfortunately no steam room or sauna available, another 400MOP are to be paid to enjoy those in the nearby spa. Quiet disappointing, given that these features are standard in any luxury hotel worldwide. Overall a good stay at a reasonable price.",30
Though it has been opened for quite some years already the up keeping of the hotel in general is quite good. They are revamping the shopping area to give some freshness. The staff was very friendly and the lady at reception was very helpful and informative. ,30
"I set the bar high, so maybe that's why I was disappointed. A little bit more from this hotel would have been nice. Being the MGM brand I assumed it would be pure luxury, but compared to it's American competitors like Wynn and Venetian properties, I did not think it was up to the same standard even though they charge the same price if not more. If they modeled the room after their American property, just like the Wynn does, I think it would be a much better room.   The property itself is very nice, but I did not particularly like the rooms. The hotel is old, and you could feel the rooms age. They should do some upgrades on the room. In addition, the room was a bit small and really had that typical Asian room feeling with a very hard bed which I did not like. I would much rather…",30
"Attracted by the aquarium in my last visit, I've decided to book MGM for my family! Surprisingly, there is a new theme about butterflies and gardens! My family and I were truly stunned by the amazing decoration!   However, there is a large room for improvement on the service in this 5-star hotel. I arrived at the hotel at 3:30pm and the reception said that the room is not ready (although I've already stated that I'd arrive at 3:00 at the time of booking). They said they'd call me once the room is ready and it turned out to be a lie too. We didn't ask for any coupons or sth, so my 60-year old mum and I hanged around the hotel just to wait for the room. my mum saw a large painting in the corridor of the 2nd floor and she wanna took a pic of it. Suddenly, a middle-aged security…",30
"Great rooms comfortable beyond words, nice decoration, accurate service, great breakfast  for an additional fee... but honestly .. Is this worth the exorbitant rate? Maybe not.  Ok to experience once, but nit to return.",30
"Great location , lovely building lots of people there but lacked a little spirit / noise for me ! Thought a casino would be bussing and loud ! Even they only serve drinks "" beer "" after 8 !!!! Didn't stay long ",30
"The hotel was okay.  The rooms were a good size with a nice bathroom, but didn't really smell the best! The Swimming pool was a disappointment with no food or bar service at the pool. The casino is great but pretty much the same as all the other major hotels in Vegas, and no where near the same as Las Vegas!  Overall it was an okay experience but nothing to write home about!",30
"I had a booking and a little problem with my money. I lost my credit card and was waiting to receive money the next day via Moneygram. But the receptionist first told me, check in is after 3 pm. So I had to wait for over 1 hour. Finally at 3 pm she didnt want to let me check in without paying a deposit to the room. I explained her the second time, that I will receive Money in the morning and just had so much cash, to go out for dinner and so on. This was a big problem for her. She was not friendly at all. She had to call the manager and he finally said, ok, but if I would order any service to the room, I had to pay cash. I said sure, thats no problem at all.  I felt not welcome from this lady. The service in the hotel was ok so far, but not special. I guess I'm not chinese,…",30
"We recently visited the MGM Macau to see the recently opened Gold Brick Exhibition, featuring the works of artist - Wang Kaifang that is taking place between 7 Feb to 2 April 2013.   The Gold Bricks are all on open display, six being in the main Grande Praca area of the MGM Grand while the rest are located in the One Central shopping arcade and mall area attached to the MGM Macau and Mandarin Oriental Macau and one being outside on the Nam Van Lake promenade just outside the hotel.  The gold bricks to be quite interesting to inspect and look at.  Unfortunately, with the vast number of visitors in the Grande Praca, you have to compete with sizable crowds to enjoy these pieces.  However, the others located in less heavily visited areas were easier to see.   Overall, they were…",30
"Due to its good reputation,I chose it without any doubt for my first trip to Macau.it's easy to get via various lines of free shuttle bus within the city.a fantastique shopping mall is next to door.bath room is nice with big space and huge tub.however,free wifi is only available in public area.few plugs spaces are provided in the room which can't make cell phones and cameras get recharged at the same time. No breakfast is provided,either.they don't even provide foreign money exchange.all mentioned above are pities for this stay.and I may not repeat my visit in this hotel in the near future.",30
one of those hotels you hope will give yu a break in regards to the price but they are consistently in the 220 usd range at their cheapest good rooms huge casino nice room service and views of the sea from the room  the facade of the hotel is beautifully lit at night and the lobby and the grand praie is just spectacular  must stay once just for the heck of it...recently has a mall attached to it however most of us can only window shop there.. they have a hotel tower and a more private vip tower great mood lighting throughout the hotel,30
"Most of Macau's casino resorts are brand new and offer competent service, so they have to diversify through style. What follows is very subjective. I wish MGM would have played more on the movie theme, which one would expect to be their forte; instead, they went for a glamorous flavor long on gold but short on cultural references, which may work well with the South China new rich but makes the place less interesting to me. The relative lack of taste in the interior comes in contrast with the building's striking and elegant appearance when seen from a distance.  This being said, I found no fault with the excellent service level, or the superior comfort of the very large rooms. Management appears to have cut no corners to ensure consistent quality in the guest's experience. The…",30
Nicely located hotel along Macau hotels strip. Friendly staff although some of them don't speak good English. Nice sauna and Gym. Restaurants were good as well. Biggest disappointment was the Casino which was small and full of smokers everywhere . Nothing to do with MGM Vegas. Finding non smoking rooms was also a challenge,30
"The rooms are very nice; ""Asian modern"" is a good way to describe the decor. The main lobby and the Grande Praca are easily some of the most beautiful spaces in Macau.  But.  The casino doesn't give free drinks (the Wynn, on the other hand, does). I lost 20 000 HKD and couldn't get anything comped (in Vegas I'd have gotten at least 2 nights comped). The room was expensively priced (especially relative to Vegas). Honestly, the player's club is only worth it if you AREN'T staying at the hotel (!!!). The food at the MGM itself, whilst not bad, wasn't amazing.   The casino has a nice, elegant, subdued atmosphere.... it kind of looks like an Art Deco and much more restrained version of the Venetian, with more romantic lighting. Also has the equal best gaming conditions in Macau (tied…",30
"This Hotel has a vibrant, very stunning look from outside but the services is not up to its class,  The checking in/out are smooth. The moment we step into the Hotel and way up to our the feeling a great, the ambient lobby and cozy corridor and room are excellent. The beds are very comfortable, the view is good, either side. But there are no magazines or brochure or anythings for reading pleasure  We loved all these.  We stayed here for 3 nights everytime we passed any staff, they never bother to greet you except the doorman. There is no lobby lounge, but there is one and only inside the casino, I can't enjoy it with my kid. The cafe offer good B/F but a bit expensive. Around the Hotel there is nothing to do about. We need to walk 10-15 mins Wynn Hotel which is behind MGM to…",30
