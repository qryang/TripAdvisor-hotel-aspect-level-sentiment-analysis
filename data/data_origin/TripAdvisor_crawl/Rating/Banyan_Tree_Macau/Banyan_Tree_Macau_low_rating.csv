"not value for money. not a traditional Banyan Tree the worst breakfast i ever had i stayed in signature pool suite. the room is big, but not clean enough, i can't feel the signature sensory of Banyan Tree.  ",20
"unexpected.  this trip is my trip trip.  I heard that Banyan Tree Hotel was great.The service was great.  Receptionist are great,  but the room not expected big and clean. the pool in room are dirty. But thanks for the birthday cake. ",20
Very expensive for no particular reason. Food is at best ordinary. Very low quality ingredients and underwhelming. Staff are not particularly friendly or helpful. Location wasn't particularly amazing. Wouldn't recommend ,10
"Had my wedding banquet here in Macau Banyan Tree half year ago and received a free one night room certificate, so just redeem it and have some fun with my wife as a 'half year' anniversary.  The room and service were all impressive until when we were leaving/checking out the room on next morning.......we found a used ""condom"" on the floor, somewhere next to the sofa seat and pool.  We didn't notice that when we checked in the previous night.....it is just disgusting when we think back...and really mess up our memory.  i did report that to the front desk during check-out and they did apologise, well i didn't blame them much as i think the Housing/Cleaning team should take the blame.  I am always a fan of Banyan Tree(that's why i had my wedding here) and i hope this …",20
"Transport connections too far away Room Rates is too high  .   服務人員態度很好,但位置距離酒店接駁車站有點遠,戲水也沒銀河方便. 建議如果帶小孩去玩水或是要去澳門各酒店或是景點還是住銀河好了,因為Banyan Tree 真的不方便.讓人覺得房價如此高卻沒有相當的禮遇及價值..當然你出入都搭TAXI 是非常方便.我住的是兩房一廳的.讓人有點失望.應該是不會再想入住這酒店了.",20
" I feel disappointed with the service I received.  First of all when I do check in the staff seems don't know I booked a package with afternoon tea, he needed to double check see if I was booking a package.  Second, after the staff knew we booked package with spa included, the staff asked us if we wanted to make appointment for spa. But my boyfriend already sent email for  you guys to arrange, is this your responsibility to know guests arrangement other than I repeat what I reserved? What's the point for me to reply your email then? I think your hotel need to strengthen communication between departments.   Third, we included a turn down service in package, my boyfriend also replied your email according to the turn down time. Unfortunately, we received question about turn down…",20
"* room had funky smell * room was not thoroughly cleaned * interrupted hot water in shower, which was a disaster when it's around 15 degree outside  * water in the small pool was not wam enough to use - kind of a fancy but useless function  * service was not prompt * not a good hotel at all.",20
"We had our office annual team building, booked 2 pool villas for 3 nights for 12 persons. The villa was good, overpriced as can be expected from macau in peak season, but the service was really bad. Daily cleaning did not clear stuff next to the pool , wifi did not work well, calling bell and telephone did not work well, one of the service managers was not able to understand simple requests and the other was better in comparison. No one was in attendance and you have to call them on mobile if you needed anything. The breakfast in villa took 2hrs to serve, you cannot ask for coffee because it may take an hour. Pizza not just looked bad, the waiting time was 1hr. The BBQ dinner in pool villa was organized better when rain struck and food was good but changes were so difficult to…",20
"I only had the opportunity to write this after I received my credit card statement a month later to find out that I was repeatedly overcharged.   I was first overcharged when I made my booking online as they billed me for an extra spa package. As I queried on the extra charges, I was advised to have the total charge refunded and charged to another card.  Along the way, I also found out that they were refunded my bill to someone else's credit card as well.  After the first refund was done,the hotel not only charged my new card provided to them but also to the previous card the same amount. In other words, I was charged once, refunded once and charged twice again after (on two separate credit cards of mine). Because of this issue, I have had and will have to incur foreign exchange…",10
"Right off the bat, Banyan Tree was as expected; courteous staff, spacious lobby, the rooms were huge and has an indoor wading pool. Just as advertised and just what we paid for. Then comes two hitches that is simply unacceptable for anyone claiming to be 5 star hotel.  1. Lady at the breakfast buffet by some stroke of genius overlooked us and let 2 parties cut in front of us. And we have already been waiting for 15 minutes. 2. Front desk calls us to check if we are leaving on time at 1pm which by our experience normally ranges from 1-130pm. We said yes. Lo and behold someone loudly bangs on the door at 12:46 asking why haven't we checked out? That was the last straw. We went down to talk to Michael the Manager at front desk and who profusely apologized and provided concessions…",20
"Stayed over Easter long weekend. Hotel was nice but the service was terrible.  I was extremely sick with food poisoning from something I had eaten in the hotel. My partner and I both made it very clear on serval occasions that I was extremely ill and not one member of staff made any effort to address the situation. It was as if they had not been ""trained"" to deal with sick guests so they just ignored it all together. Meanwhile, 2 of the 4 days we spent were there were ruined as I couldn't leave the hotel room.  On the final day I was well enough to go to the outside pool. When I got out there I realised I didn't have my sunglasses and thought I had maybe left them in the indoor pool change rooms. The galaxy resort is a big complex and to walk back would take me 10-15 minutes.  I…",10
