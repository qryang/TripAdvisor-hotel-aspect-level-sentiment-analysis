"I have stayed in St Regis hotels all over the world and generally like the brand. But this place underwhelmed me in most respects. Apart from having good service and a nice breakfast, the rest is substandard. It was a pain to get here from the ferry terminal. Other reviewers noted the difficulty finding the shuttle and clearly nothing has been done to fix that. When I finally arrived, I was greeted with the annoying ‘thanks for being an Ambassador Elite member, but we couldn’t get you an upgrade’. The room was generic, sterile and dated (even though the hotel is relatively new). The view from the room was of the building next door. A fruit bowl amenity without a welcome note. The hotel bar was too full to accommodate me—no seats left. They did do a decent job with happy hour…",30
"It's not easy to find the hotel shuttle bus at the ferry terminal and I didn't see any staffs at the ferry guiding us to the shuttle bus.  When I reached the hotel, it doesn't stop at the hotel but another hotel and I have to walk. The breakfast at Menor Restaurant is good, I am impressed by the egg station.  Perhaps I should not go to Macao during festival seasons.",30
"The bellman is very helpful, helped me with my luggage when I arrived. Then a friendly staff escorted me to check-in.  Same feeling as my last stay at St. Regis Singapore a few years back.  Luxury!   Unfortunately, there was some problem with the phone but it doesn’t stop me going to this hotel again in the future.",30
"Overall average. I feel that the service of Conrad Macau is a bit better.   I expected it will be the same as other St Regis, but I feel that others are more luxury.    The room view is not so good,I can see whats in the other hotel room, maybe vice versa?",30
"Unlike my past stay and dining experiences here, the hotel lobby was full of tourists waiting for check-in.  I cannot expect no wait but I waited for my good 20 minutes.  When it was my turn, the agent was nice talking with me recommending me the hotel facilities, but didn’t notice that I was tired!",30
"Very spacious room and the bedding is very comfortable!    Easy to access to the mall and is convenient.  Casino entrance is just next to the hotel entrance.    The equipment is updated and clean, but the changing room in the gym is quite small and there’s not enough shower facilities.",30
"I was hestitated when my husband asked me to choose a hotel for just a 1 night transit in Macau and I booked this hotel because it has the lowest price comparing with the same class hotels nearby and we found we made the right decision.  The room is very clean. The room service staff who took our order not really understand my husband's request. Anyways, I appreciated the male staff who helped to helped us to press my huaband's shirt as well the complimentary coffee. We took shuttle from the airport however the shuttle did not stop at hotel entrance but stopped at another hotel and we had a long walk through the mall to the hotel.  We had a lot of luggage and took taxi to ferry port instead of shuttle.",30
"In the context of a St Regis, this property is just an average one.  It looks very aged.  You can tell the towels are really ""used"".  The location is nice.  But Macao is small anyways.  The breakfast options are oK but nothing exciting.  The staff is keeping the St Regis standards.  Very professional and helpful, from front desk to bell boys.",30
High standard high end brand of this hotel group. Check in took time... Haha. Room is average. The restaurant manor was good. I like the bloody Mary cocktail here. Many things should be improved. A bit disappointed ,30
"Helicoptered over to Macau w family for two nights - three days w family .. check in efficient butler service welcoming but this hotel not up to St Regus standards by any means..   Awkwardly tucked in a corner of a casino , many tiles in pool missing, and operator reception not attentive...  we spent most of our social time at Four Seasons...  they have work to do here  ",30
Very classy hotel. But Macau can be boring for adventurers of historic places and original landmarks. Best to travel with authentic friends and family members. If you want to gamble your savings go ahead as people gamble even in the morning. Porkfloss cookie (?) was so-so.,30
"As one of the best luxury hotel chains in the world, this definitely attracts me to choose St. Regis to stay at. I am actually a frequent traveler to travel to Macau due to the reason of the food are so good and it is very relaxing as a travel destination and also it is very near to my hometown. Normally I used to stay at Wynn Macau, Venetian, or Hard rock (unfortunately it's gone), but as the reason I mentioned above, so I chose to stay at St. Regis this time. I was overwhelmed by the St. Regis unique butler service but however, I think the butler service that I experienced was the best service among the other services that I have experienced during my stay with St. Regis. When I stayed at Venetian, they proactively offered bottled water like it doesn't cost them any money, but…",30
"Stayed at the Ritz Carlton for CNY in 2016 so I thought I would try the St. Regis this year.  While the property is nice and the Sands Cotai layout is similar to the Galaxy, maybe even more convenient since it is connected to the Parisian, the Venetian the City of Dreams.  But, when it comes to the Room, the service and the culinary experience, the St. Regis is definitely not on par with the Ritz.  For example, every time you call for service, the message devotes 5 minutes reminding you in 3 languages that the conversation will be recorded.  Also, since there is no Lounge, the breakfast at the Manor seems ill prepared for the large crowd.  The food at the Manor is also average at best and selection limited. The staff is also poorly trained - they forgot to put new place mats…",30
"As a Platinum member of SPG, I had expectations whilst booking this hotel.  Those expectations were dashed as the rooms were filled up during the seasonal period and room availability for the larger rooms was tight.    It would be peculiar to give a 5 star hotel a rating of only average, but note that this is done as a direct comparison to the other Cotai Hotels in the same building link.  If I was comparing the St Regis to the one in Osaka, then it would receive 5 stars because of the pricing difference.  This wouldn't be a fair comparison.    I have stayed in all the Cotai strip Sands Group owned properties; St Regis, Conrad, Holiday Inn and Sheraton.  I have also stayed in the Venetian across the road, but I'll exclude this one from the comparison as the 4 hotel chains here…",30
"I've stayed in St Regis before and butler means butler. This hotel provides the butler service but not up to the expectation. The butler, cant remember the name, cant speak english well, cant differentiate left or right.  Also, we requested tea from different butlers all the time but a different person will come and deliver all the time. Which one should I tip then?  The concierge and bell boy were much more warm and knowledgeable.  Overall, for the price you pay at this hotel, only the room made it worth it. The facilities, swimming pool, spa etc is not up to par for a St Regis Starwood expectations.",30
"The place is relaxing but the food is not that good. They serve breakfast buffet exactly the same everyday 😔. Staff(s) are very nice and friendly especially Genevie Abuel, Francis and Enzo (st. Regis bar). ",30
"We requested for a non-smoking room on a non-smoking floor but on one occasion coming out of the lift, we have seen cigarette buds (yes, a few!) lying around several spots of the marbled lift lobby as well as the top of the trash can. I think this is probably a Macau-wide issue that high-end hotels such as St Regis or other SPG hotels have to face on a daily-basis (with the casino giving out free rooms to gamblers). The issue I have is why, after quite a few years of operations, have they not come up with a solution in addressing this kind of situation? It is very unfair to true non-smokers and families who have definitely paid more than the guests who received these rooms for free through the casinos but aren't treated with the same level of respect. Simply saying that you…",30
"Was a new property, hence the teething issues but nothing to complain about. The service was fantastic. Bellmen, Butler, Front Office were extremely efficient and courteous throughout the stay.  Had a serious ceiling leakage outside the bathroom started just after 1am on the night I stayed. The dripping noise was rather loud and caused some sleeplessness. But to the the hassle of shifting rooms, it was not brought up till the next morning, when it was promptly rectified.  No turndown service as I arrived rather late. Breakfast was average.  Overall, a rather average stay.",30
"Macau is an island to easy access of hotel and casino thanks to the complementary buses 24/7.  I was there for a hotel hop for a night in  St Regis Cotai. From the Harbour to the hotel, I managed to hop on to the Sands bus (that indicate to St Regis) but however missed the stop due to not drop off point at the lobby of St Regis. You have to drop at Conrad and walk into the narrow path to the side of the hotel check in counter.  The check in is fast and smooth and within 5 minutes I could able to get my room card and check in procedure done. The Butler introduced himself and was usher to the room.  The room was simplify, cosy, spacious yet luxury and the view was beautiful, able to see hard rock hotel and far view of Macau main island.   The breakfast was kinda limited choice…",30
"I saw an opening special for the hotel of $1,888 and decided to take advantage of it as opening specials are usually excellent.  I secured a room months in advance but was disappointed to watch promotions come up which continued to drop below the price I paid and then have extras thrown in also.  I felt penalized for being so committed and organized to trying out this hotel!  The spa was difficult to book at.  I saw an ad on facebook and couldn't for the life of me find the contact phone number on the ad or spa webpage. I rang the hotel and asked to be put through to the spa.  It seemed I was put through to the bar instead and they tried to again transfer me to the spa but no one answered.  I continued to call back later that day.  I would have preferred to have made a request…",30
"Service throughout especially on food and beverage side has great scope of development. Meal quality and choices can be improved. I stayed in a room looking out onto the outdoor pool of Hard Rock Hotel and was bombarded by their hard rock music from late afternoon till late evening. There's no where in the hotel to go for escape from this serious pollution.  The main entrance is on the side; so private that no taxi would come even on call! Of course I'm an ordinary tourist not wanting the luxury of going to Cotai ferry terminal on a chauffeur driven limousine. No shuttle either. I ended up getting a taxi from the hotel next door! Fortunately, l travelled light. There is no survey received after my stay. I've always enjoyed St. Regis hotels such as the ones in Bankok and…",30
Stayed in this hotel with family. Absolutely stunning!!. Personalised service ensured by the butler service. Good veiw of Cotai from the room. Special care taken to ensure that guests enjoy every moment of their stay in this wonderful city,30
"The St Regis macau is a very new hotel in Cotai area, location is great and very convenient, the room and facility is great and beautiful, I'd say service to be improved, it is not bad but not good enough, I will come back to stay again and hope it'll gets better.",30
"There are many  excellent things about the hotel but I think there are a variety of teething problems.   Lights in the room are all or nothing, it seems impossible to get pleasant low lighting. The room looks unfinished in a way; they are large but seem empty, as if some items are not yet in the room. Furnishings are bright and not really to my personal taste, it looks less classy than I would expect for the price. The lack of a desk despite having so much space seems strange, as does keeping the hairdryer in the living room rather than the dressing room. Using the shower head in the bath is very difficult as it just springs back to it's holder constantly. Water pressure in the shower is a bit variable.    Service is very friendly indeed - Stella and the team in the bar in…",30
"The room is very nice.  The butlers are very helpful.  The spa is wonderful.  However, there were several things I did not like.  The fitness centre is very small.  There are 8 techno gym machines, 8 cardio machines, a smith machine, and dumbells.  As far as hotel gyms go, I would rate this as below average.   The one plus is that it was fairly empty.   I had great difficulty communicating with the room service staff.  There English was not good and they had great difficulty taking my order.  Housekeeping was very late.  When I left at 9 in the morning, my butler asked me if I wanted my room cleaned then.  I said yes.  When I returned at 5pm, it was not cleaned and I had to call and ask for it to be cleaned.  And no, the do not disturb sign was not on.  After it was cleaned, I…",30
"was at St Regis Macau for a couple of nights for a company offsite, overall was a decent experience especially after reading all the negative reviews, did not expect too much.  Overall we were happy with the stay at the hotel, the staff seem a bit new and maybe just settling in, but overall attitude was very nice and overall very friendly.   rooms and food: The rooms were nice enough but quality of the furnishing not necessarily St Regis’ standard.  I.E. not sure if it was just a matter of taste but I thought the round table in the room looked rather cheap.  The knob to go from handshower to rainshower was broken and staff forgot to replenish the vanity material in the bathroom.    I ate two dinners the first night, 1st at the Tasting Room (two Michelin stars) and just across…",30
"  New, clean and good interior. Although you would expect a bit more for a St. Regis standard.    Checking in was alright, though took a bit of time for the process. Upon checking out and before we had our breakfast, we had informed the receptionist to prepare our luggage to be carried down to the lobby. However, luggage was still in the room even after we had our meal. Even so, after being informed the second time, it took them awhile to bring down our luggage. Understand that we had to catch a cab then a ferry, before our flight.     Most importantly, breakfast at The Manor was very very limited with choices, and service was not ok. Need to seriously retrain their service to a St. Regis worldwide standard. Somehow service felt like as if dining in some casual 24 hr diner-…",30
"Stayed over the late December and had a couple of observations.   1) Their one restaurant ""The Manor"" is woefully understaffed.  Staff were also woefully under trained. They should have poached top talent from surrounding properties but looks like all the got were the leftovers.  2) Check-in was also a 30 minute ordeal.  No SPG Elite priority check-in available.  3) Rooms were very nice, bed was great. Amenities were nice (Remede toiletries and complimentary Evian for Suites).  4) Plumbing fixtures were already malfunctioning.  Handshower to Rainshower lever was broken. Shower was leaking into the toilet area. etc etc.  Every one from the room butler to the front office were very courteous but there were many teething issues. I think they rushed the opening a little on this…",30
"因為新業的問題, 所以很多房間都沒有開放使用。 而員工因為還未熟悉工作流程所以 check-in 以及check-out 速度很慢。 但為我 check in 的 Kim (應該是韓國人) 小姐很好笑容, 她也不好意思一直對抱歉。  今次入住的是 Suite, 分開一 living room and bed room, 還有 衣房, 可是設計在 bed room 跟 bathroom 中間, 這樣很不方便。  首先講講 Bathroom, WC用的是 TOTO, 可是最普通的款, 以為 suite 會有 Neorest 或是 Washlet。 Basin 的牌子 Decolav 。MIXER就是用 Hansgrohe。洗手間用的是白雲石感覺。很簡潔, 但最敗北是 shower room 開門的方向, 很不方便拿台上的東西。  Bedroom 方面, 床頭都準備了 USB 孔, 以及 B&O bluetooth speaker. 電視用了 LG。 床是用了甚麼牌子? 忘了, 感覺還好。窗簾是用電制開關, 這方面比其他的 St. Regis 有點 low class, 電制還有點損傷 (新開張)。  Living room 部份有客廁, 有 table, 有 tea table 有 sofa, 有 LG, 有 minibar, 有咖啡機完... 十分簡陋的設計。完全不達 St. Regis 級數。是仿 St. Regis !?  房外的指示牌也十分混亂, 我想去個 Gym Room 也得花上了半天才找到。  是次入住的失望感太強大",30
"Lucky enough to have stayed in a few St Regis around the world. As I sit here, in a perfectly nice room, with great connectivity and a number of charge points. I reflect upon comparisons with my other experiences.   The Macau St Regis is the newest hotel on Cotai sands, which also house a Sheraton, Conrad and Holiday Inn. The main entrance is on the side of the resort, so if you catch the free shuttle bus, you need to walk a couple of minutes and enter via Holiday Inn entrance. Entering reception a bell boy takes your bags, and shows you to a seat whilst you wait for a receptionist. We booked via a hotel website, so as usual, no points, on Starwood card, but my issue with this, is that they don't know who you are, your preferences or loyalty level. Checked on a rollaway bed for…",30
