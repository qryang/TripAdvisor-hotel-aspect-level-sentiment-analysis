According to her,only \"VIP\" card members can ride the shuttle bus. She even forced me to get off in the bus when there is no one except me. I was totally dissapointed with this lady named (YAN) 李美雁. And last thing,she didn't even apologize for what she'd done. I have used many shuttle buses before and never get such a bad experience!

Front Desk TM they looked like they’re not familiar about their job description.   21-Sep-2020 We made a booking through online but unfortunately, we didn’t make it successfully, so we decided to go directly at Altira 38 floor and explained that we didn’t make it successfully but we still want to make a booking and it took 30 minutes then suddenly they told me that the promotion that I was trying to get is already fully booked. Staff didn’t know what to do, I suggested them that I can actually pay the cash for the charge. She seek her supervisor assistance and finally what I suggested is the same as what her superior advised to her but because it took a lot of time to wait, and the room that I want to book is fully</span><span class=\"_1M-1YYJt\"> booked, then they offered another promotion approximately amount $1900, then I decided to book it. The payment has been paid amounting -$2800 using my ATM card.  02-Oct-2020 at 10AM We check out at 10AM , we approached the counter at 38th floor with the service of TM 07317 and start calculating the bill, then he suddenly told me that the receipt I got is not deducted to my card and ask me to pay my bill amounting $2012.4. I explained to him that it’s already deducted to my bank account then he ask for bank approval statement  and I show him my message statement that the transaction was approved the day that I settle the bill during the booking. He voided the first transaction with amount $2800 and he says it will transfer to my bank account but didn’t received yet and  I made another payment for the actual bill amounting $2012.4 using my ATM card.</span><span>…</span></q></div><div class=\"_36B4Vw6t\"><div class=\"XUVJZtom\" data-test-target=\"expand-review\"><span class=\"_3maEfNCR\">Read more</span><span class=\"ui_icon caret-down _3aUwQbpX\"></span></div></div></div><div class=\"_1O8E5N17\"><span class=\"_34Xs-BQm\"><span class=\"_355y0nZn\">Date of stay:</span> October 2020</span><span class=\"_1xJceS3A\"><span class=\"_2bVY3aT5\"><span class=\"trip_type_label\">Trip type: </span>Traveled with family</span></span></div><div class=\"_3d_mZXGr\"><span class=\"_3UnecFwl\"></span><div class=\"_3SZRHJHk\"><span class=\"_2lqOQqh3 _2n7CCN6U\"><span class=\"ui_icon thumbs-up Ak8Bi3Zf\"></span><span class=\"ui_link _1Dl3N9MC\">Helpful</span></span><span class=\"_331VZDkq\"><div><span><div class=\"_1k12Q93K _1k54sSqX\"><span><span class=\"ui_icon share _3g9oGli4 hu8pNNlN\"></span><span class=\"ui_link _3p1vOjv8 socialCTA\">Share<!-- --> </span></span></div></span></div></span></div></div><div class=\"XPYR1502\"><span class=\"_3x5_awTA ui_social_avatar small inline _3T1fhtvF\"><span class=\"ui_icon member-fill\"></span></span><div class=\"_204cKjWJ\"><div class=\"_1LYjNSEu\"><div class=\"overflow\"><span class=\"_3-zQ1eyd _3LR9XvrV\"><span class=\"_35pfga6W _2HBN-k68 _3LkX-HIr\"></span></span></div><span class=\"_3V8URHDq\"></span></div>Response from Hotel Management Alitra Macau, Other at Altira Macau<div class=\"_2lY-Jowi\" title=\"2020-10-03\">Responded 2 weeks ago</div></div><div class=\"_2f_ruteS _1bona3Pu _2WrHxPE9 _2uD5bLZZ\"><div class=\"cPQsENeY\" style=\"max-height:20px\"><span class=\"sT5TMxg3\"><span>Dear guest,  Thank you for taking time to share the experience of your recent stay at Altira Macau.

The hotel has multiple Michelin and Forbes recognized restaurant but we only hit the lounge on 38th floor. It is beautifully decorated, you feel like you are in the movie! They serve yummy cocktails, live music, and you could even play pool there. Really relaxing atmosphere and a grand view towards Macao over the bay.

The rooms overlooking Macao are very nice, large, having a cozy seating area, big bathroom and overall luxury bath supplies and amenities. And they stock many complimentary water bottles in a room so you never get thirsty. You also get a fresh fruit and complimentary soda drinks/beer from the in-room bar. The hotel has multiple Michelin and Forbes recognized restaurant but we only hit the lounge on 38th floor. It is beautifully decorated, you feel like you are in the movie! They serve yummy cocktails, live music, and you could even play pool there. Really relaxing atmosphere and a grand view towards Macao over the bay. The service is also very attentive, they literally walked us from the check-in counter to the room</span><span class=\"location-review-review-list-parts-ExpandableReview__cutReviewText--Y-gas\"> and have shown all the room amenities. Our first room smelled like someone smoked in there so they have apologized and switched our room immediately. BTW, the hotel of course has a casino and VIP lounge area. Almost forgot - we checked out their infinity pool , it is indoors and very clean and relaxing with some seating area outdoors and you could even order a fresh juice or smoothie on the spot :-) The only downside the hotel is standalone so you have to take a shuttle to Galaxy or City of Dreams (or take a taxi) in order to get closer to action. On the other hand, you could watch fireworks from the hotel or even walk to the public fireworks area where you could light your own firecrackers/fireworks for CNY!</span><span>…</span></q></div><div class=\"_36B4Vw6t\"><div class=\"location-review-review-list-parts-ExpandableReview__ctaLine--24Qlb\" data-test-target=\"expand-review\"><span class=\"location-review-review-list-parts-ExpandableReview__cta--2mR2g\">Read more</span><span class=\"ui_icon caret-down location-review-review-list-parts-ExpandableReview__caret--3Ud_i\"></span></div></div></div><div class=\"hotels-community-tab-reviews-ReviewsTabContent__footer--2FHIK\"><span class=\"location-review-review-list-parts-EventDate__event_date--1epHa\"><span class=\"location-review-review-list-parts-EventDate__bold--3b3PE\">Date of stay:</span> January 2020</span><span class=\"hotels-community-tab-reviews-ReviewsTabContent__hiddenReviewContent--FCrPr\"><div class=\"location-review-review-list-parts-AdditionalRatings__ratings--hIt-r\"><div class=\"location-review-review-list-parts-AdditionalRatings__rating--1_G5W location-review-review-list-parts-AdditionalRatings__large--IOg2u\"><span class=\"location-review-review-list-parts-AdditionalRatings__bubbleRating--2eoRT\"><span class=\"ui_bubble_rating bubble_50\"></span></span><span>Value</span></div><div class=\"location-review-review-list-parts-AdditionalRatings__rating--1_G5W location-review-review-list-parts-AdditionalRatings__large--IOg2u\"><span class=\"location-review-review-list-parts-AdditionalRatings__bubbleRating--2eoRT\"><span class=\"ui_bubble_rating bubble_50\"></span></span><span>Service</span></div><div class=\"location-review-review-list-parts-AdditionalRatings__rating--1_G5W location-review-review-list-parts-AdditionalRatings__large--IOg2u\"><span class=\"location-review-review-list-parts-AdditionalRatings__bubbleRating--2eoRT\"><span class=\"ui_bubble_rating bubble_50\"></span></span><span>Sleep Quality</span></div></div></span></div><div class=\"location-review-social-bar-SocialBar__bar--3YwG5\"><span class=\"social-statistics-bar-SocialStatisticsBar__bar--L8RDK social-statistics-bar-SocialStatisticsBar__brand_refresh--BBQf3\"></span><div class=\"social-actions-SocialActionBar__social_action_bar--2_j8Y\"><span class=\"social-actions-SocialAction__social_action--1RrZ- social-actions-SocialAction__cx_brand_refresh_phase2--oQHOH\"><span class=\"ui_icon thumbs-up-fill social-actions-SocialAction__icon--2WCF0\"></span><span class=\"ui_link social-actions-SocialAction__text--1yJuk\">Helpful</span></span><span class=\"social-actions-NestedSocialAction__nested_social_action--2mhpU\"><div><span><div class=\"public-share-cta-ShareCta__social_action--2yJtr public-share-cta-ShareCta__dark_icons--3I87q\"><span><span class=\"ui_icon share public-share-cta-ShareCta__icon--1Bvb0 public-share-cta-ShareCta__cx_brand_refresh_phase2--23uHd\"></span><span class=\"ui_link public-share-cta-ShareCta__text--1tWKH socialCTA\">Share<!-- --> </span></span></div></span></div></span></div></div><div class=\"location-review-review-list-parts-OwnerResponse__containerStyles--1wv-S\"><span class=\"styleguide-avatar-Avatar__avatar--2NStU ui_social_avatar small inline location-review-review-list-parts-OwnerResponse__ownerAvatar--3bb01\"><span class=\"ui_icon member-fill\"></span></span><div class=\"location-review-review-list-parts-OwnerResponse__header--2jRig\"><div class=\"location-review-review-list-parts-OwnerResponse__floatingMenu--20iPV\"><div class=\"overflow\"><span class=\"_3-zQ1eyd _3LR9XvrV\"><span class=\"_35pfga6W _2HBN-k68\"></span></span></div><span class=\"social-section-overflow-SectionOverflowMenu__float--3mJ5J\"></span></div>Response from Altira_Macau, Hotel Management  at Altira Macau<div class=\"location-review-review-list-parts-OwnerResponse__responseDate--4i8wE\" title=\"2020-02-06\">Responded Feb 5, 2020</div></div><div class=\"_2f_ruteS _1bona3Pu location-review-review-list-parts-OwnerResponse__responseReadMore--eB9_V _2uD5bLZZ\"><div class=\"cPQsENeY\" style=\"max-height:20px\"><span class=\"location-review-review-list-parts-OwnerResponse__reviewText--108-V\"><span>Dear guest,   Thank you very much for your comments.

The well-appointed connecting rooms were both spacious and stocked with kids\\' amenities (even a Xbox!) at the kid\\'s side. As far as I know this is the only hotel that offered a kid-themed family room and that would be the perfect choice for family with kids - except you may need to\", \\'…\\'', 'annotations': [], 'meta': {}, 'annotation_approver': None}\n",
