"I would like to commend some of your staff namely, Karmen from FO and Sophia & Claire from GR for the excellent service they have provided prior and during our stay. Since my husband was celebrating his birthday, they have upgraded our room to a corner suite with a very nice resort view and have arranged a birthday cake for him. Totally appreciate this warm gesture and looking forward to staying in this hotel again in the future. We love every bit of our stay!",50
"Which provided from a clerk at front desk her name is Tiffany. Tiffany warm welcome us with a big smile that mask cant hide it. During check in she explain everything clearly and answer all of our questions also introduce and book restaurant for us. In the middle of check in, my kids was shouting and crying because he is hungry, I almost lost all my patience, Tiffany realize and talk with my kid the most amazing is my kids stop crying and started to talk with Tiffany! After the smooth and profession check in she walk out from the station and escort us where the elevator  is, she also find out that we had too many bags to carry and ask for a bellman to assist us. the bellman who assist us were super nice as well (can‚Äôt remember his name). NOT ONLY THAT, after dinner back to room we find out a handwriting welcome card from Tiffany, on the card she remind us again of the reservation for the next day lunch and with some sweet gift! Thank you for providing this awesome service, after this experience JW Marriott Macau will be our choice for all future family trip to Macau!‚Ä¶",50
"It‚Äôs our second time staying in this hotel. Last stay was not pleasant because the whole time there was the construction on the same floor not far from our suite and the chemical smell went to our room. This time we wanted to go for the swimming pool so we accepted the kind gesture from hotel, being upgraded to executive floor. But again an unpleasant experience... For the executive lounge experience: We arrived 5minutes before the breakfast would be closed. So the staff arranged us at the outside seating not the bfst/dinning area, which we accepted and totally understood with no question. But after they started the breakfast clean up, so they closed the partition in between these two areas, there‚Äôs no staff AT ALL in our area that we could reach or see. The entire time (about one hour), only one staff showed up twice but disappeared very quickly...even worse, there were mosquitos in our Danish pastry, but no one was around(except two cleaning staff using vacuum cleanser to clean the carpet around us when we were eating, seriously? In JW Marriott executive lounge!!? Even this is the routine, at least a staff would show up and apologize or explain, shouldn‚Äôt it??!). However, in the afternoon same situation, we Came back from outside and ordered the afternoon tea set, once it‚Äôs served, no service staff around anymore....a while after, mosquitos flying around again, in kid‚Äôs apple juice, on the pastries, in the dippings...we had to return the juice to the staff to change to warm milk (luckily she showed up then...). By the way, the food quality is really not up to the standard of a JW Marriott hotel.  It‚Äôs so far the worse executive lounge experience ever. The Executive floor suite: coffee capsule was used when we checked in; the second day after housekeeping cleaning, still no one found and replace...the welcome cake was a disaster that we didn‚Äôt even touch... Don‚Äôt want to come back again... The only good experience was the particular Housekeeping staff (sorry we didn‚Äôt notice his name). When we just entered the suite after check-in and requested special beddings for the kid, he was very helpful and thoughtful. He created a dream bed for our kid!‚Ä¶",20
"This is my second time visiting Galaxy JW Marriott, and once again I was impressed by the staff‚Äôs phenomenal service. As soon as we entered the lobby, Ilee from the front desk greeted us, and she didn‚Äôt hesitate to explain everything we needed to know in detail. She even went out of her way to guide us to the elevator when she noticed we didn‚Äôt know where to go.  The hotel room was no doubt, stunning. Everything about it was beautiful, but weirdly, my favourite part was the toilet. Since it‚Äôs my first time seeing a toilet that‚Äôs transparent, then turns opaque as soon as you click the switch. The food was also one of the best-tasting hotel foods I‚Äôve ever had. We ordered Western cuisines, and the portions were perfect for us.  The pool was amazing. There was so much to do and to explore. We spent hours on each of the pool rides. The most relaxing was the ‚Äúriver pool‚Äù. All you have to do is sit on a floaty and relax, since you‚Äôll flow endlessly with the water. The ‚Äúwater slides‚Äù were thrilling. I loved the fact that there were several levels, so that both the daredevils and people who aren‚Äôt that brave or children could enjoy the slides. My favourite part was the ‚Äúwave pool‚Äù. It was the most exciting ride I‚Äôve ever ridden in a long while, especially for a pool. I could tell everyone enjoyed it as well, since everyone was excitedly shouting whenever the wave levels rose. My mouth hurt from laughter, as I watched my sister and my mom struggle to hold unto us, and they were pushed and dragged by the wave. The lifeguards then gave us suggestions on how to make the ride more enjoyable. The wave pool was what all of us enjoyed the most, and it‚Äôs certainly the most memorable, along with the staff‚Äôs amazing treatment toward us. The view was also breath-taking, giving a feeling of solace, so you could just sightsee if you don‚Äôt enjoy swimming, although that would defeat the purpose of going there in the first place. The only thing that I didn‚Äôt enjoy much was the map. It was confusing to read, so at times, we‚Äôd get lost. Thankfully, the staff was kind enough to point us to the right direction every time.  The last place we visited was my favourite. I said that I‚Äôd visit it again during my last visit, and I‚Äôm glad I did. The ‚ÄúPool Bar‚Äù, as always, had mouth-watering food. Fara, Ron, Wang Yin, Daniel and Robin, once again, as expected, made us laugh and entertained us as we were eating. The staff made our stay way better than it already is, so I‚Äôm certainly coming back!  I highly recommend! ~‚Ä¶",50

Also a call-out to operator and housekeeping for their speedy response whenever we asked for assistance. All in all, they should deserve a round of applause.

It wasn‚Äôt anything as big as a total power loss or sth, but every 10/15 min or so, the electricity offering in my room would drop off for a split second. Saying that wasn‚Äôt that big of a problem was because the outcome was seemingly the lights had brief flash - but that‚Äôs the entire room and it happened quite frequently throughout my stay.

The suite has a kitchen sink and a guest washroom.  The kitchen sink is good for families with young children or babies, I found it awkward sometimes to go to the bathroom and wash a milk bottle.

Living locally in Macau, and staying here through COVID-19 - I needed a mental escape, and JW Marriott Macau provided that. From the moment we entered the hotel until we checked out, luxury was around every corner.   Upon check in, the staff was ensuring a safe and clean experience. Our room was perfectly sanitized with everything in order. A few times we called to the front desk and had them bring some extra towels, ice, etc....  and each time it was done quickly and with wonderfully kind staff.  Each staff member was going above and beyond their duties to make sure each area of the hotel was extremely clean. I felt so safe around the resort - from the main lobby to restaurants, it was safe and clean‚Ä¶",50

The service we received from Ronniel in housekeeping was outstanding. I also made a special request and Emnan at the concierge desk made it happen! I was so impressed! The one complaint I have is that if your children are 12 or older they are not allowed to swim at the resort deck unless you pay $500 MOP per child. For families, if you really want to make the stay memorable, you should include this in the room fee. We still made the best of it and the stay overall was awesome!",50
Everything was perfect from the start with accommodating staff named Tiffany from the front desk followed by awesome guest services named Chloe Look. We had an upgrade our our room to get the best view of the pool and the sweet surprise from our room the next day. Thank you also to the staff that cleaned out room. Looking forward for more booking.,50
Everything about my stay was superb. I was lucky enough to be upgraded and my kids and their friends had a fantastic time. There were many special touches added such as little teddies with robes with the kids names on them. A simple touch with big impact. Wine for me :0) Macroons and snacks for the kids.  It was great providing the individually wrapped facemasks and hand sanitisers. The room was spotless and I was in no doubt as to its cleanliness and the efforts the staff were going to to make us feel safe suring the pandemic. My kids also loved the tent set up they slept in. Another nice touch. Service by the pool was great but it's a shame the whole pool area wasn't open. We availed of early checkin and late checkout which was great as it allowed the kids 2 full days at the‚Ä¶,50
"Staying at May, 2020 (Executive suite with resort pool view)  Staying again at the JW Marriott Macau during the city lock down period. When I arrived to the hotel, there have only 1 counter for operation and no single person queueing for check in and out this time, as well as evening time when my friend visit, I‚Äôm glad and hardly have this smoothness registration experience in this property. Ms. Salvia assigned me to the executive suite which I reserved. It was pity there have no further upgrade for the accommodation, I also tried to ask for downgrade to the Retreat studio room type that hope to enjoy jacuzzi since all the wet facilities and pools are closed, which was told all ‚Äúoccupied‚Äù. This is quite surprise the hotel is still that busy during the city lock down and COVID-19‚Ä¶",20
"It is our first wedding anniversary and decided to celebrate here in macau, since we are in a pandemic and are not allowed to go in and out of the SAR. We had an amazing honeymoon at the Executive suite of jw marriott macau. Tiffany welcomed us and help us have that exquisite room with a Jaw dropping view.it was located in the 31st floor in is just a few steps from the lift room 31256. We were presented with some fruits and that pink beautiful cake. Whenever we booked a hotel, we always make sure to experience the bathtub,and that tub inside our room is so stylish and so comfy, we love it. Amidst this pandemic, People still go out of their way to ensure that hotel guest like us will have an unforgettable stay. I also commend chris and claire for the quick and easy check out. We‚Ä¶",50
"This place is amazing with wonderful staff especially Manager Ana Payot who accommodates our needs and prepared everything last minute and responds to our email immediately. Thank you for the warm welcome of Front Office Alexa, helpful and flexible In-room dining staff Anna. My friends had a wonderful celebrate and we got a relaxing stay. We'll definitely be back.",50
Another great hotel. Stayed there because I liked the location. The only thing I didn't like was the weird bathroom glass which you can turn opaque / transparent with a switch! Blinds or Curtains preferred.,40
"Obviously I was attracted by the wonderful Grand Resort Deck, being one of the spectacular facilities that JW Marriott Macau offered, being champion within Asia.  The modernised and grandeur amenities which the hotel guests enjoyed also ranked my choice highly.    I was very lucky being served by a highly professional guest relations team of the hotel, during my first stay.   I remembered Claire Huang the most, as I was hugely impressed by her unique & customerized greeting and caring during my stay.  Her team leader, Sergio Chan also assisted to provide me the best memorable and enjoyable stay in Galaxy Macau.  All in all, looking forward to staying in JW Marriott Macau again the Covid-19 situation settled.",50
"There are various so called 5 stars hotel in macau. Similar to Las Vegas, patrons came over to gamble.   I stayed here for two nights. It‚Äôs only an average hotel, and there is nothing interesting to write home praising it.  But, the room is reasonably clean, and the services are acceptable.  Let me give you a booking tip, please do not book it through booking.com or those devious apps, because the ‚Äúextra‚Äù charges are steep while the listing price is insanely expensive. You should book it through the local Macanese travel agent, and it will be nearly half of the price.  Don‚Äôt be an idiot. Be smart.",30
"We were assigned a lovely room on points and I was very impressed with the size of the room, the view and the luxurious bathroom.  Check-in wait was not bad despite a long line.  Joy at check-in counter was friendly and made me feel like a valued customer.  When she asked me what the occasion of my visit was and I replied birthday celebration, she noted on my passport that it was indeed my birthday.  Much to my surprise, when we got back to the room in the evening, there was a lovely birthday cake and some fruits waiting for us and a handwritten note from Joy.  I was definitely impressed with the service and the thoughtful touch to delight the customer.  I will be back!",50
"My boyfriend and I had a wonderful stay here. Every last detail of this hotel has been carefully thought through which has amounted to a slick, well lit, and aromatic interior.  Check-in was a breeze having arrived just after 3pm. We were welcomed by Alex at the check-in area who very kindly upgraded us to a resort view on the 22nd floor. Our room was spacious, stylish, and meticulously clean. The bathroom is ridiculously luxurious with a japanese toilet, sit down shower, and separate bath.  There is currently some building work ongoing on the Galaxy plot with two further hotel casinos being constructed, but this did not impact on our stay at all. There was no noise, and by the time we got back to the hotel each evening we could only see the beautiful lighting (and light shows)‚Ä¶",50
"This is not the 1st time I visit JW Marriott, we did celebrate our 10th Wedding Anniverary in Macau. But I did made the booking mistakes before, however the reservation agent is really helpful to solve my problem out, and attentive to my every need. I was pleasantly surprised, let we have a unforgetable memories. On this time I wanna give a compliment to Reservation Agent - Mr. Robbins Ng. He provides a warm, professional service this time I come, he‚Äôs knowledge makes me appreciate!  We had our dinner buffet at Urban Kitchen, the food and wine was perfect. At the last, we have a special arrangement the cake to celebrate our Special Day, And I also want to thank Mr. Aman and the rest of the staffs for their warm and excellent service.",50
"The gym in this hotel is modern and well equipped. However, the human touch makes it perfect. Must give a credit to the great Gym Manager, Justin, who proactively and nicely introduced me to the fascinating stretching machine.",50
"We had our snack at JW Marriott Executive Lounge and it was great! The food was perfect, especially the burger. And I also want to thank Mr. Billy, Laarni or Lanie and the rest of the staffs for their warm and excellent service. We were all catered well. I'm giving them two thumbs up!",50
"This is not the first time I visit JW Marriott, and this time I wanna give a compliment to Front Desk staff Nina. She provides a warm, professional service this time I come, she‚Äôs knowledge makes me appreciate! She is the best star",50
"Ritz Carlton never failed my expectation, this is one of my favourite one. During my stay, the front office guy is very helpful, I called to ask for medicine as I got headache after a long flight, he sent a warm lemon tea to my room right after. Definitely recommend this hotel and wish I could stay one more night.",50
"Unbelievable service and staff at reception, Urban Kitchen restaurant, business lounge and service desk do their best to meet all the needs and in most cases during my stay, did before i asked. Clean rooms with all amenities, free wifi and 24/7 quick in-house service to fix anything we asked for. Probably the only 5 Star family type hotel that has no in-house casino which makes it perfect with many pool areas and a lazy river to enjoy. This hotel is now my 2nd favorite next to Four Season in Serengeti.",50
"Very good feeling as JW Marriott, nice service and good facility. And good us a good view to see as night. Everything was perfect while staying in JW Marriott Hotel. The room is super clean and modernized, and spacious.",50
"Everything was perfect while staying in JW Marriott Hotel. The room is super clean and modernized, and spacious. The swimming pool is also super nice. Especially, the staff (Karmen) working in the Front desk is extremely kind and friendly. I'd like to stay again when I visit Macau next time.",50
"It's a nice resort and they have very large property with different pools for adults/family, etc.   Pros:  - spacious, modern, clean room - nice pool/resort good for family/adults, etc - casino property - connected to the rest of the galaxy hotels - solid quality food selection at the restaurant - Glamorous lobby- overall nice well maintained facility - Friendly staff   Cons:  - not much",50
"Our stay was generally good with the atmosphere and hardware. However, we were surprised with some points. First, the room facilities had some technical issues. The television on the bathroom mirror got some noises and the mirror was shaking. Also, the toilet bidet was non-stop splashing and we felt embarrassed to call the staff because we could not stand up, then we found our way. Second, we got too many reminders about check-out time even before the requested time. We felt unwelcome and like being kicked out as soon as possible. Third, after check-out, we thought we forgot our money in the room. We went back to ask if there was anything left. The staff was so upset and responded that they always return our guests whenever they left something! We were just asking, but at the‚Ä¶",20
Amazing experience and hospitality. Staffs were very friendly and efficient. The room is spacious and so comfortable. Convenient and easy excess to everywhere in Macau. Surrounded by retail shops.  Highly recommended!,50
Receptionist staffs were very polite when check in and the buffet dinner is good with many varieties. Room is clean and comfortable. Bathroom amenities are very completely. Due to Christmas is coming and hotel has many beautiful decoration. ,40
I think most of the visitors would be impressed by its water park resort. It shares the water park with some other hotels and retains its own pool facility. You can‚Äôt imagine how perfect it is until you get there in person.  The hotel itself is also doing the best among the Galaxy Resort. I love the lobby design. It really feel privacy and comfort.  The room is large and luxurious. Only complain is the bath room. The main door of my bath room cannot be closed properly. I think the lock component of the door has a problem. Housekeeping team should take better maintenance for its property.,40
"Macau has a huge offer of hotels.  This one is new and facilities are very impressive, specially the swimmingpool and water games (which are shared with other hotels nearby), but I felt nothing special if I compare with others.  I am a memeber for Marriott Bonvoy and the staff did not make me feel like I was, no special offers for nothing and not complimentary extras.  Gym is small and there also lack of quality at the sauna and steam room.  Maybe it¬¥s OK for the customers that spend 90% at the Casino, but if your are also a tourist that goes for enjoy facilities and the room, my choice will be other.",30
The corner suite room with its spacious leaving room and the adjoining room for our friends had an ideal lay out. The view of the endless pools and another beach- like pool were so inviting and a delight to the eyes. The spectacular view of the other amazing hotels were likewise awesome... most especially at night. Food was highly satisfactory at the buffet and the Executive Lounge. A 2-3 day staycation  in this beautiful and elegant hotel is ideal for people like us whose country is only less than 2 hours away by plane.,50
The JW Marriott is truly a wonderful hotel experience. We had a Clu room option which I think is essential to make the stay more fulfilling.  We were greeted warmly and discretely and while it obviously exists to make profits they didn't focus on extracerting money from us but rather that we had a lovely experience. The hotel just exudes class. There is marble and gold everywhere.  We had 2 glorious nights there. We got to Macau on the new road which is very impressive with its bridges and tunnels. The access to this way is easier from the airport side of HK. The bed and room were very comfortable while the lounge serves food:and drinks throughout the day  I have added some photos of the hotel. We would not hesitate to visit this beautiful again. I enjoyed the Casino in the‚Ä¶,50
Stayed for a night on 11 December and everything was excellent. Check in was very friendly and efficient and the guest relations team came and welcomed me and showed me to the exec lounge and gave some tips on what to do.  I was upgraded to the chairman suite on the 29 floor and which was amazing. The suite was huge and had the most beautiful living room and also a separate cinema room. Bed was comfortable and bathroom big and luxurious and with a sauna. The view of the pool was great.  The exec lounge evening food was of a high quality and there was a good variety. The only downside is that the evening food finishes early at 1930 but I just made (drinks are until 2130). Breakfast again was high quality and with a chef making eggs to order. Everyone was friendly and welcoming‚Ä¶,50
"The hotel fulfilled my Suite Night Award upgrade request to an executive suite prior to my arrival. The check-in agents were probably the single best ones I've ever interacted with. They were so passionate and helpful. I was offered plenty of advices and recommendations, from different amenities throughout the property, to how to maximize my experience in Macau. They were apologetic that my suite was located at the far end from the elevator, which I actually appreciate, because it would mean that it was going to be free from traffic and would be quiet.  The suite was pleasantly spacious with decent decorations. The bathroom alone was probably about the size as the Courtyard room I stayed in Taipei. The water pressure was of course very good. As for the breakfast buffet, it was‚Ä¶",50

The wines served are of good quality. In addition it has a full gym and a very nice pool area with water slides and ‚Äúrapid‚Äù river to float in.

What i enjoyed the most is the service. Very great service from Alex from front office, he is professional, friendly and took initiative to ask for our needs. He even introduced the 3/F pool and asked us if we would like to lock the mini bar if we not gonna use it. Very attentive!  I had dinner and breakfast at urban kitchen. Food quality for dinner buffet is excellent. From seafood to steak to dessert. All great! Abalone soup rice and peking duck are the big highlight! Manager and my station staff provided exceptional service! Service of a male and a female staff worked in the bar were not good‚Ä¶",50

The grand resort deck area was huge with many pools with different activities - it's a must for kids, an extra plus for their own heated pool. At last it's also a plus for the breakfast, because I'm a Chinese and it's rare that I find the Chinese food section to be delicious.",50

Just came back from the JW Macau.  It‚Äôs our third time there and we plan on coming back.  There was some misunderstanding from the message chat but things always were solved in a timely manner.  Service and facilities were top notch.  I appreciated the 24 hour gym and the kids loved the lagoon pool and water slides.  The food at breeze cafe was good and reasonably  priced especially for a hotel of this caliber.  Thank you to everyone at the JW Macau and we look forward to returning there.,50

Being a member, the application on my iPhone tells me the room is ready for check-in around 2pm. After a quick lunch from a local Cantonese place in the old town, we headed up to the room.

The resort is spectacular with the world's largest pool on a deck, much larger than those in Las Vegas. Shopping and food are superb, with wide selections and different price points. Last but not least, service is exceptional/phenomenal.  We have stayed at numerous 5-star resorts, but nothing can even compare to this property.  I strongly suggest that you try this hotel should you visit Macau.",50
"Our check in was smooth even if there was a lot of people checking in. Sofia and Edel showed a professional service and they went out of their way to make sure that my kids would enjoy their stay. Thank you,Ms.Liz for all the room amenity that you‚Äôve prepared especially the personalised towels - my kids loved it. Lastly,I‚Äôd like to to thank the in room dining staff for their wonderful service - thank you Joana,Mick,Tonya, Vincent & Ace for excellent service.",50
"Today after staying Macau 1 week, I decide to try Marriott hotel lunch buffet ; at first ,I surprised about price is much cheaper than other country nearly 40 % , second , I wonder their many diffident kinds of delicious high quality dish like Peking duck , lamb rack , beef stew , etc , the taste can compare with high quality Michelin resteraunt ; especially the service , since we walk into the resteraunt the staff Mr Brayan help us and take care of every needs until the time we finished our entire lunch time , details of service were outstanding , like frequently clean our table , refill water , hot tea , ask our any special needs and give wet tissue and as member check for our special discount and  reward points benefit ; so I will definitely come back as regular customers .

"We stayed 2 nights in the Marriott hotel in Macau, part of the Galaxy complex. What a great hotel! We had a huge suite overlooking the gardens and swimming pools. In night time the light show from all the hotels together. A fairytale. We had dinner in the Urban Kitchen, delicious buffet, great atmosphere. And in the Chinese restaurant Man ho. The best tender lamb chops we ever had. Every morning also in the Urban Kitchen a fantastic breakfast buffet. All cooked and organized very well by professional staff. Shops everywhere, all brand names but also less expensive things to buy. We want to thank the management for the Woman Club Phuket vouchers and also the supervisors Eoel from the Executive Office and Brian from the food and beverage department.

"Formerly I‚Äôve heard that marriott Macau is famous for its friendly staffs and excellent facilities.  We stayed 3 nights in 3 suites with 9 families and it was a fantastic stay.  Especially friendly, Joan, Cedrick, and Mark always listened to me and tried to solve difficult problems. Their help had allowed many families to make a healthy and enjoyable trip to Macau.    The food in the lounge was a bit insufficient, but the overall service was excellent.  MGR of marriott tried to give us the rooms on the same floor and two of them had very nice view.    Marriott Macau lacks facilities and services for babies. It was difficult to warm baby meals and there was no food for babies at meals. The baby high chair was good, but the vanity stair was low.

"Spent one night here with the company for retreat and meetings. Upon arrival I was surprised it does not have the ‚Äútackiness‚Äù of many hotels in Macau. The buffet lunch was crowded but the food was of high quality. The room was huge and very nicely designed, overlooking the sprawling pool area shared with four other hotels in the complex. Of course if gambling is for you, then the massive casino hall downstairs will be of interest, or some may enjoy the vast shopping centre that links up all the hotel properties. I would love to return with my family some day to enjoy the pool and activities. ",50
"Stayed in JWM  Macau for couple of nights. Pros: Quite Stunning, especially with the pools shared by neighbor resort hotels. Stayed in executive club ... Which was great view n good service. Cons: club lounge was quite dirty, seems no housekeepers cleaning up bread crumbs n other leftovers on floor. Uncertain these were housekeeping or club service officer issue. Bath Room floor was cracked n scratched my boy foot.  ",40
I went on Thursday with my boyfriend to celebrate his birthday. The food is delicious and with a wide range of choices. I love the dish of Indian flavour. The sauce are provided in many choices.

The receptionist's politeness and friendliness as well as the guest room's being tidy and commodious made great contributions to our comfortable and joyful experience. Besides, it's worth mentioning that I enjoyed myself to a large extent at the gym, where Christian offered professional guidance and coached me in basketball skills.

Location, waterpark etc We were there on business and I needed to cater food for my international flight. I had the pleasure in meeting and dealing with the hotel‚Äôs Room Service Manager Mrs Cyril Angeles. Her and her team did an amazing job in providing the necessary food, well presented and packaged to transport to the airport.

We then spent the rest of the weekend enjoying the Marriott/Galaxy pools, the hotel restaurants (best food we have had in Macau) and the wonderful Executive Lounge, where the staff constantly made my family feel welcome. Thanks to everyone at the JW Marriott Macau - we look forward to returning soon..",50
"This is my third consecutive year to stay here. The suite is amazing, clean, nice resort view. Thanks to Guest Services Manager Samantha and Ana. Best of the best employees especially Samantha. However, it was the worst experience at The Lounge (restaurant) at the ground floor. We are sad and angry. Been waiting the food for over 30mins and there are ONLY 3 TABLES only!! yet the food is cold and bad services from the foreign waitress.  Should go to Ritz Carlton Cafe at first. Anyway, we are huge fan of this hotel but this experience as minor as it still affect out loyalty.",30

The pool was amazing especially the grand deck resort. Our favorite was the ""lazy river"". Thank you to all amazing staff for making this another memorable trip. Shout out to Joanne, Rhialyn, Jeff and Cedric who made our stay extra special. We will definitely go back again.",50

"Hello!~ I am one of big fans of Marriott. And I love to stay at all Marriott hotels. But, This experience of check-in at the executive lounge .... hmm,,,, I was really disappointed.  My wife did check-in instead of me at the lounge. Because unluckily I was really busy.  I should have been there with my wife. My wife had to spend almost 1 hour for checking in there.  Above all, my wife felt bad and sad at the lounge.   If you are a platimum member,  I think it is better to check in at the frontdesk instead of the lounge.   I have booked 3 rooms for all my family members.  But, I have regretted I should have booked other hotels for my family. And one room was ready. But the other two rooms were not ready.

So far,JW Marriot Hotel Macau gives me the best experience I've ever had. They upgraded the room to executive and provides AWESOME service. Sharon from the reception during the check in moment really proves that first impression lasts. It was followed by the room attendant who delivered extra bed and another attendant who delivered anniversary surprise for my parents.. If the rating is 1 to 5, five being the highest, I will give 8 for this awesome hotel...for the aaawwweeesssomme experience of a lifetime!",50

Wincy‚Äôs customer service deserves recognition.   We booked an executive room with executive lounge access. The room itself was great as expected from a 5 star hotel. We had a lovely view of the resort and pool. When housekeeping cleaned our room, they tied up all our phone cables neatly and even left a bookmark on my new book. This attention to detail is much appreciated!

Regarding the land bridge, we took the HK MTR to the Disneyland stop (if I remember correctly), and then took a public bus to the airport terminal.  From there, we cleared Immigration easily, and boarded the shuttle bus which took 45 minutes to reach Macau.   At Macau immigration, we had to take another bus to Taipa terminal, where the hotel shuttle bus was waiting for us.   A bit cumbersome, but we wanted to experience it.

"We travel to Macau on a monthly basis and have been to many different hotels. This trip we decided to give the JW Marriott a shot, and the spontaneous decision blew our minds away.  The JW Marriott is located amongst Galaxy, so not a part of the Sands complex area where most casinos, shopping malls and all the buzz are. This means you are nicely protected from all the noise and tourists and shouting and yelling. They have casinos and shops at Galaxy too, but the way it is designed is you have to actually walk out of the hotel (but you stay indoors, the casinos the malls and the hotels are all interconnected) into the long Galaxy mall area to get to the casinos and shops.

Our room itself was excellent, beautiful furnishings and on the top (31st) floor. Check in easy and friendly, quality of hotel excellent, right next door to the Ritz (try the bar on 51st floor) and the Galaxy Casino was gorgeous (we didn‚Äôt gamble, commenting on the materials).   An no smoking anywhere, love it! Great choice for us and reasonable at $500 per night considering what we got. ",50
"This is my second time and my mom's first.  Check in was okay and our package comes with afternoon tea, evening cocktail and buffet breakfast. Food was good and sufficient. Hotel room is very beautiful with resort view. Bathroom is also spacious and very nice especially the heated toilet bowl. There's Nespresso machine but will appreciate if there's more coffee. Bed was big but pillows were too soft for me. Grand Deck resort is still close but this place never cease to amaze me. I will definitely go back again and again to this place.",50
"The hotel had a great location with buses leaving every ten minutes to go pretty much anywhere in town. Great access to all good shops and restaurants needed in the complex, Galaxy (which the hotel is located in). The hotel is clean and fresh. The staff is excellent, especially Melody who helped us with everything.  The room was beautiful however it was very cold in the room even though the temperature was at the highest. The view was incredible.  The breakfast was okay but did not feel fully continental.",40
"I visited JW last weekend and it was a great experience. First the room rate is reasonable and the room is luxury.  The room also has a great view with the other two hotels nearby. There were very good amenities and facilities in the room. Excellent service from reception host Felix and make me a very comfortable stay. He had provided me useful information and warm welcome. Also hotel provide shuttle bus from pier or other hotels which save my time.  Location of JW Macau is nice, with lots of shops and restaurants nearby  Definitely will visit again;)",40
"I have just stayed in JW Marriott with my wife to celebrate our engagement anniversary. I could only say that everything I have experienced is the best in Macau! As my wife is a Platinum membrr, we were upgraded to an executive suite and the room is huge! The executive lounge (Bonvoy) has a good selection of food for evening cocktail and the breakfast on 2/F couldn't be better too! When we went to the gym, Tony had a very detailed demonstration of the stretching machine and we had a wonderful time for a workout! I would surely visit them again! ",50
"The FO staff - Steven, Health Club - Christian are professional and provided excellent services to guests.  Moreover, the room is clean and comfortable. The food in Man Ho Chinese restaurant is good. Overall experience is good.   However, there is defect in the minibar that we cannot open.",40
"This was my very first time visiting Macau and I picked JW Marriott based on its great reviews online, and it turned out to be a GREAT choice! I was first greeted by the check-in staff named Yasmine. She was super nice and friendly, excellent language skills, and she gave me very detailed directions to navigate thru the Galaxy complex, as well as local places to visit. We were able to get a free upgrade to a room with pool view which made our stay much more pleasant. Our room was clean and spacious, I LOVE the bathroom and its modern design. I had such a pleasant stay and would definitely come back.",50
"It was an exceptional service of Mr. Brayan..He is so much helpful and accomodating to us..He gave us a luxury service that we felt so much welcome and comfortable.Urban Kitchen ! hooray. you can find the buffet restaurant at JW Marriott Hotel 1st floor, Taipa Macau.",50
"I got a nice pool view which is fantastic! it seems a wonderful graduation gift for my son. Excellent room, breakfast and the use of the pool deck! my son my 12 yrs old and he loved it!  Kudos to Guest Service team for the wonderful service!  I would like to commend on their Senior staff (he's a Filipino male - my memory is so poor, i forgot his name) at the Urban kitchen. He definitely took care of us. He was very friendly and attentive at all times. As I observed his working style, he made sure that all section in the whole restaurant are manned).  He even remembered us when we came back for breakfast the next day.",50
"I was here on 02/01/2019 with my brother and his wife. Our rooms number were 26276 and 26218. Out of all the hotels we had resided in Macau over the years, JW Marriott was definitely the best. The rooms were sparkingly clean, we had an excellent view. Service was prompt and attentive. All in all, we had an amazing time in this hotel. Thank you. ",50
"Location is good. Room is spacious and good service. Breakfast at club lounge, sumptuous buffet breakfast, fresh salad, eggs, noodle bar and congee. Cant imagine club lounge has variety choices. Walk to the mall in few minutes, many shops around there.   ",50

Overall room is great with all the modern decoration and facilities.   We especially like the shower unit where is the water pressure is super high for a outstanding bathing experience like no normal hotels.  We meet a lot of great friendly staffs including Ms Amy Guo who helped us checked in and Joanna from the fitness club area.  They are both very friendly and helped made our stay unforgettable.  Thanks Amy n Joanna!,50
"Stayed for two nights, and we haven't been Macau JW Marriott for a long time. Wincy from receptionist check me in and upgrade my room order, and very kind for the children. Had a breakfast at the Urban Kitchen. Everyone who worked in the hotel are very nice and we are so relax there. I want to try the SPA in the hotel but we haven't enough time. Maybe I will try it next time. I will choice this hotel when I go to Macau again, hope my friends can try it.",50
"I have stayed at this hotel several times but it just keeps getting better.  I had business in Hong Kong but all flights were full so I flew thru Macau.  Hotel was quick to confirm my reservation and reserved a car to meet me at the airport.  Fantastic service from the moment I arrived until I left.  Amy and Stella checked me in and asked if I had any special needs.  I informed then that I had business in Hong Kong and wanted to know the best way to travel, turbo jet boat or bus on new bridge.  They recommended the Turbo Jet because it was quicker and comfortable.  The first class ticket was printed and in my hand in 15 minutes.... so fast.  The rooms are beautiful, great walk in shower with plenty of water pressure.  Bed is soft and comfortable.  I special thank you to Inga, so‚Ä¶",50
"We ended a business trip in China with a weekend in Macau.  The hotel is beautiful and they upgraded us to a suite.  It‚Äôs part of the Galaxy complex.  There is a large mall, many restaurants and a great lazy river/waterslide pool complex (you pay extra for it)",50
"Stayed for two nights, was upgraded to a suite due to my platinum elite status. Edel from guest relations check me in and showed me my room, background information of the hotel and suggested meals option since it was my first time staying at this hotel. Was impressed with the executive lounge and the offering. Had a breakfast at the Urban Kitchen, I was spoiled for choice. Will definitely stay here again should I visit Macau. I must say it‚Äôs one of the Best JW in this part of the world with more than a 1000 guest room. Attached photo is view from my room. ",50
"I paid 5 times the normal hotel price elsewhere but got 0 in value.   Everything was just plain average. Around the hotel shops and restaurants were expensive,  Room was average, amenities were normal, service was average, food was average,  Everything was average except the ultra high cost of the room.",10
"I have finished a one night stay at JW this Monday. We were upgraded to a suits from my platinum status. I have stayed in many suits in Asia , so far this one is the best and look more like a president suite to me. The guest services Amy at executive lounge take really great care of us and being helpful in many way.  Last the happy hour btw 5:30-7:30pm has so many quality food that really can make it a super. We have to restrain ourselves from having too much coz we have dinner plan.  We hope to stay longer next time in future ",50
Although it‚Äôs January.   The hotel outdoor swimming pool is still open with warm temperature water.    As a platinum member Mr. Edel Ibarra upgrade me to an executive suite with perfect view.  My wife and my son are very exited about this staying.  It‚Äôs a very good hotel.  Clean and good service.  I will come back for sure.

"I had a short getaway with my girlfriend in JW Marriott Macau and got us the Executive Room. Room is extremely clean and perfect. Urban kitchen & executive lounge both have great food! Access to shuttle is easy - JW Marriott lobby, Opal & Diamond lobby. You can see some shows around too! Thanks to JW Marriott Macau, my girlfrind likes it very much, especially the night view from the room, and the Italian food in executive lounge! Shoutout to Alex and all, thanks for all helps and services.",50
"The view and the rooms from the hotel were amazing, but what was really outstanding was the staff at the gym.   I had a trainer named Christian who helped me formulate warm-up exercises and taught me a lot about importance of excercise and other life lessons, all out of the kindness of his heart.   If you're looking for a friendly gym trainer I would highly recommend Christian!   P. T-k",50
"We stayed here for 3 nights in an Executive Room with Lounge access. The room was large and comfortable for a family of 3 with an extra bed. The hotel is one of 5 in the resort and is huge (the walk from the elevator to the room was a bit of a trek). The Executive lounge was good (shout out to Inga who was v friendly) and to Chloe the GSM. The housekeeping staff were friendly as well which made our stay pleasant. Whilst most things were within walking distance from the Galaxy and there was ample bus services, it was slightly away from where most of the Macau attractions were which resulted in it losing the ""atmosphere"" that was around the Venetian, Parisian,etc. We did note that there was development over the road from the resort which once completed may improve the overall‚Ä¶",40
My stay at the marriott was made excellent by my man christian in the gym. I had never worked out and he gave me his complete attention. He helped design a workout that I still use to this day! ]  peace and love,50
"We were at The JW Marriott for a series of business meetings. Needed to do some last min printing. The Ladies (Amy You, Inga and Riah) were very helpful. Perfect English and very professional. Thank you ladies for your hospitality!!  We will definitely be back! ",50
"I decided to take a day off after a long business trip in Australia and SE Asia, and had never been to Macau before. From check-in to departure the staff including Stella and especially Inga in the Exec Lounge were so helpful and supportive. Thank you!",50
"As a frequent business traveler to Vegas in the past with countless experience of average service in their top luxury brand hotels, it is only natural that I had zero expectation at first for my stay at JW Marriott Macau, thinking that it is just another casino city hotel.  However, it turned out that one pleasant surprise followed the other throughout my stay and I was quite blown away in the end.    Superb hardware: The overall d√©cor is contemporary but sophisticated with a very generous use of space in the public area.  You can tell they did put a hefty investment into the overall facilities to make a great first impression.  Marriott Rewards status recognition: This is the first time that I was able to indeed receive a suite upgrade as a Platinum member.  Thumbs up. ‚Ä¶",50
"Me and my gf spent a night at the JW Marriot in the Galaxy complex. We were upgraded to the top floor and it was amazing. Service is always polite and friendly. The breakfast was good with a wide range of food, but the best thing there was the seafood congee. Lots of Western choices, too. Overall, it  is a great hotel. It was a too cold to swim in the waterpark, though. That was a disappointment! Otherwise, I believe the Galaxy hotel complex is the best in Macau, whichever hotel you choose in that complex.",50
"I stayed again  five nights December 2018, I was upgraded to a very nice room with nice view. The hotel has a very nice facilities. The best in J W is the service, the Executive Lounge is really luxery, comfortable and huge. Executive Lounge is plenty of delicious food and drink. I would like to say all staffs are excellent, mention Amy, Joan, Inga , Victory, Bella, Silvia and the others I can't remember names. Also mention Edel guest relations, He helped me a lot with certain situations. The lobby is very nice and service was excellent as well. Concierge teams were great , thanks for getting the courier parcel, mention Simon, Kumar, Roselle, karrie, David and other teamates.",50
"Okay, for Platinum Premier Elite members, don't you just hate it when you of all people, feel that you are the most loyal customers of Marriott, should deserve suites from time to time, but got a response of ""sorry, we are fully booked""? Well, the good news is, this will most likely NOT happen at this hotel! I have finally found a hotel (after reaching Platinum Premier Elite for 2 months and over 13 different hotels between Taiwan, Hong Kong, China, Japan, and Seoul) that actually TREAT PP members accordingly!  My first suite had a heavy smoke smell to it, and to my surprise, after a call to the front desk, Edel from guest relations personally called me to apologize and offer my friend's room also be upgraded to a suite!

"Stayed in the JW Marriott hotel, Macau for one night. The hotel shares a complex with the galaxy, banyan tree, ritz Carlton, and the okura hotels. The check in process was v smooth, the staff asked if I wished to wait a bit longer, in order to get a room nearer the elevator. I said it was not necessary. I didn‚Äôt mind the slightly longer walk to the lift lobby. The room was nice and big, with a view overlooking the pool area. The tv was v big, with a wide selection of channels. The beds were large and comfortable - the light switches were easy to control. The bathroom was awesome, the toilet seat was pre warmed, with electric functions just like one would find in japan.  I didn‚Äôt have breakfast included in the room rate, so I cannot comment on the food there. The cleaning ladies‚Ä¶",50
"JW Marriott Macau, I have stayed here second time.  Lobby is neat, tidy and quiet.  Front desk staff is efficient and nice.  Melody, one of the front desk staff, will listen to you and try to arrange the best for you.  I absolutely will stay in this hotel here again.",50
"I stayed on November 28th, the hotel front desk lady - alada (I don't know if I remember correctly) is very polite and has a good smile, which makes me feel comfortable before I stay. Arranged a super nice garden view room, and fruit delivery, very satisfied with this stay. Although the weather is very cold, you must go to Grand Resort Deck to swim.Must stay again next time.",50
"Cant fault this hotel - 5 stars for room (upgraded and luxury), housekeeping and breakfast (great service from urban kitchen-very engaging staffs). The loss of the 2 stars (unfortunately) were from reception and concierge. Reception was unsure of upselling prices of breakfast - replies were ‚Äúchild breakfast cost 80 something‚Äù. Would expect an accurate amount. On our last day, we were taking the shuttle to the ferry terminal. Was sure that it was macau taipa terminal but the concierge told us that it should be macau outer terminal since we are taking turbojet. Glad we followed our own instinct..else will have missed our ferry. ",30
"Our stay at the JW Marriott Macau was beyond our expectations! We were upgraded to a most incredible suite ever at the top floor. Special thanks to Amy and her team at the lounge  for the beautiful decorations and munchies they send us to our room. As a platinum member, we were given a choice of breakfast at either the lounge or at Urban Kitchen. The spread at Urban Kitchen was amazing! Dinner at the club lounge provided truly outstanding food and service. A special recognition to Chef Gina and Jeff.  Would also like to thank Wendy, our room attendant. Thank you Mr Derrick Siew for running such a fine operation.",50
"Check in was a breeze and is very pleased to be upgraded to their executive suite on the top floor (31/F) by the 2 beautiful ladies, Wincy & Stella, the front office manager. Stella has been very helpful & friendly, introducing their hotel to us. We were being informed that this is the largest JW Marriot in Asia Pacific with over a thousand rooms.   The room itself is spacious and tastefully designed with a blend of contemporary with some oriental values. The bed is comfortable and the room is very quiet which is very important for light sleepers. The view is spectacular overlooking the pools area of the whole galaxy hotels. The bathroom has double vanity and a good tub to soak in, with a separate spacious shower. The living area is separated from the bedroom with pocket doors‚Ä¶",50
I went to Macau and chose to stay in JW for 3d2n when my daughter finished her exam.  Check in counter was smooth. Staff were very helpful and polite. Room was clean and tidy. The kid club was ok. Really worth to try. Highly recommended!,50
" We were visiting Macau on our anniversary and we had a great experience at the hotel. I sincerely appreciate the whole team of this wonderful hotel. Through my experience I would like to tell everyone that how wonderful a hotel it is. Its location is also very convenient to explore the wonders in the historical Taipa and Coloane area with one of the best hotels in the world with shopping and casino area Cotai.  Customer service was excellent and terrific.  We were very pleased that all of the staff spoke English very well. Cleanliness of the room,pillows and bed was very comfortable and was top notch.

"It was a pleasure to be in this Hotel. The chech-in service at arrival was excellent, the taste of food at buffet(urban kitchen) was very good, and the window  view towards outside was fantastic. Furhermore,  the  Galaxy Pool complex was wonderful,  and the hotel's own pool within this complex was also superb.",50
"It is always a pleasure to be in this Hotel and the last time was no exception. The Club was as brilliant as ever, and we could enjoy the last of the summer seasonal sunshine at the superb Galaxy Pool complex. The hotel's own pool within this complex is also superb. Cannot wait to visit the Marriott again someday.",50
"Had the privilege of staying at the JW Marriot Macau recently and was most impressed with the service that was received. The rooms are well appointed and the amenities are of a high quality. Highly recommend upgrading to have the Executive Lounge access as the team there are amazing. I had encountered great service from a few individual in particular that made my stay with the hotel. Special thanks to Joan, Sophia, Elsa, Kumar and Jason. Will definitely return here for future stays in Macau.",50
"Hotel is nice and spacious.  Room is clean and nice.  However, FO staff is not well trained.  Not attentive and welcoming.   No strong sense of hospitality.  Should provide constant and professional training to frontline staff to enhance their service quality.",40

JW in it is a high quality hotel, front desk staffs are very helpful. I arrived at 11 but the check-in time slot is 3, the nice staff saw I come with a baby, she arranged early check-in at 12 and late check out at 12 for us, so I can give my boy milk before check out!   Room clean and big, the garden view is wonderful. Unfortunately Macau become cold now, we cannot enjoy the grand resort deck too long with my family, so see you next summer!  ",50
"This place is GREAT.   A striking hotel from the outside (part of the Galaxy Macau hotel resort), amazing service, fantastic pool (great for kids) and a beautiful hotel inside.  Make sure to book a room with resort view, waking up or going to sleep to that view is mesmerising. We were on floor 25 and the view was immense.  The hotel resort is equipped with hundreds of shops and places to eat. Although they are expensive (McDonald‚Äôs is more than twice the std price).  A must place to stay in Macau.",50
"Nice hotel that worth us visited 3 times recently whenever we decided to go to Macau.  Much appreciated for the professional, sincere and customer orientated assistance and services from Steven over our stays!",50
"Four nights with my daughter. As the hotel is connected with Galaxy Macau shopping complex, very convenient for food and shopping. The hotel is also connected to Broadw ay Macau. Main attraction of Macau Broadway is the food street. Hotel room is spacious and service is good. The biggest fun is of course the water park and the very famous dinner buffet is super gratifying.  But we think the breakfast buffet is of highest value as we are offered 40% discount upon hotel check in. Both menus are similar but dinner menu is certainly more elaborate than breakfast!    Tips: Make reservation for the dinner buffet as soon as you check in the hotel as it is always fully booked. ",50
"JW Marriott is never inexpensive but what you pay is what you get.  Rooms are large (we stayed in normal rooms, no upgrade), the bathroom is my favourite part.  Other than that, no surprise, no disappointment.   If I must pick one thing to criticize, it's the Chinese Restaurant, it's so ordinary and not the best value.",40
"The hotel is very nice. The staff (Alex) helping me to check-in is excellent too, polite and helpful and efficient. The room is great and facing the hotel pool / water park. We mainly stay in JW for the water park, which is very good especially for my son.",50
"We had three club rooms at the Marriott. We were on the 20th floor. The room was big, well lighted and beds were very comfortable. The bathroom was great with a tub and shower. The view from the room of the galaxy property was very nice. The breakfast layout was nice and spoiled for choices. We had breakfast in the main restaurant which was nice. The club lounge was comfortable and they accommodated our request as we were vegetarians. You have a choice of swimming pools. The lazy river is fantastic. One of biggest I guess. JW Marriott has maintained standards here. I will recommend others and would want to be there again. The restaurant near pool side can be better. We had to look for waiters by the pool and go in the restaurant to request. Usually you would have waiters walking‚Ä¶",50
"This was our second visit to the J.W. Marriott - Macau, the first time being November 2017 for our 30th anniversary, and most recently this September on my 70th birthday.  A month prior, my wife asked me where I wanted to spend my 70th birthday, and to the forefront of my mind, the J.W. Marriott - Macau popped up.   I am a member of the Marriott Hotel chain's frequent guest program, but regularly stay in other hotels when they are situated closer to where we must be.  But we prefer J.W. Marriott Hotels due to their higher level of service.  Well, having stayed at J.W. Marriott Hotels in Europe, the Americas and Asia, I now rank this specific J.W. Marriott hotel as my favorite, for their higher level of professional, but personalized and gracious service and hospitality; as well‚Ä¶",50
Highly recommended to everyone!  We were lucky enough as they were able to upgrade us to resort room view on the higher floors. The room was big and comfortable!  The room was spotless clean and staff was friendly!  WE WILL BE BACK!,50
I discovered this property just over a year ago and now have visited 3 times with future plans in January and April. My wife came with me on the last trip being her first time to Macau. She loved it. The executive lounge is excellent and the staff is very pleasant. Upgraded into 1200sqft room sure was nice!,50

"We went this past weekend as a group with our kids. Upon check in, the room wasn't ready so we opted to grab lunch in the Galaxy mall complex.   We returned around 3 to check into our rooms with an amazing view of the resort deck and spent most of our time either near the shallow toddler pool or along the lazy river on the Grand Resort deck.   We loved our dinner and our breakfast at Urban Kitchen. Special shout out to Gloria who was so friendly and hospitable especially as our two kids were getting quite unruly. She also remembered my baby liked croissants and made sure he had a few extras to snack on.   As we had an 11 month old and a 3 year old with staggered nap times, housekeeping was unable to get to our room until much later the next day. Rowena was so sweet and‚Ä¶",50

But what empress me the most was how smooth and easy everything from reservation in the marriot app to the check in the front desk until the in room services everything was done perfectly and exceeds my expectation.

"This is my second time to live JW Marriott!  Their environment and facilities are good! The bedroom is big with good view, feeling comfortable!  I was impressed this time because I met the good fitness trainer, Christian. He is so great and professional ! From him, I got more workouts and stretching ! He helped me more ! Thank you very much!

"I stayed twice in this hotel which is part of the Galaxy complex on the Cotai Strip. The complex offers stunning other hotels such as The Galaxy, Hotel Okura, Banyan Tree Hotel, The Ritz I guess and the JW Marriott. The highlight of our stay and the most fun was the Wave pool and artificial beach. It‚Äôs the most fun that kids would ever experience ever. My kids spent most of their time in Wave Pool and the Lazy River pool to the point that we had to drag them out of the pool by force to be able to do other fun stuff. ",50
This gym offers state of the art equipment and I was really impressed by the fitness instructors here especially Tony. Tony shared with me a lot of his professional knowledge on fitness and push me to another level of body building. He prepared workout plan for me everyday and monitor my progress as well as correcting my form. Will definitely come back here again.,50
"The staff Don works at the counter gave us serious of useful informations, and helped us resolve the traffic problem. Further, the restaurant is awesome, we had  a nice and unforgettable holiday here.  Grand resort desk is suitable for all family members, it is convient to access Grand resort desk . And the bathroom there is clean, unlike some hotels are humid and make people dizzy.  To dine in Marriot is easy, too. You can find restaurant, or if you just want to grab something ,just go downstairs  and you can find food vendors. Marriot is a fancy place! It must take into priority! Obviously  I will recommend my friends ! thanks",50
"We had heard from numerous friends that JW Macau was quite kid friendly so we chose to stay here before our children's summer vacation ended.  We were glad we took their advice since the Kid's Club was a good play area for them and the hotel pool was sufficient.  Our kids enjoyed the slides at the Club as well as the pool.  For the price we paid, we were fortunate they upgraded us to a King Suite.  The kids loved it as they were able to run around the spacious room and bathe in the big bath tub.  The suite was very spacious and could fit a family of 5.  Breakfast at the Executive Lounge was great since it was more quiet and less jam packed.   I must commend the staff at the lounge for their hospitality & great service, but it wouldn't be fair if I didn't include everyone as‚Ä¶",50

"This is a very special Marriott, it is the height of luxury with attentive staff. The management is obviously tight and a credit to executive staff. I wish Marriott could replicate this in other locations",50
"My whole family enjoyed a lot for the one-day stay, especially the Grand Resort Deck. Special thanks to Iris Lam, one of the excellent staff, for her sincere service which made our stay so perfect. With the room upgraded and a fruit platter plus a hand written card as welcoming gift, she had given us the best first-time-visit experience ever. It‚Äôs definitely worth visiting again. Thanks for such a great summer break, JW Marriot.",50
"I live in room 25256 and i have tried the swimming facilities and also the kids club which are very good experience for me. Besides, the food quality of the buffet is great. My wife and daughter are surprised when we got the secret birthday cake and present. It is wonderful time for us.",50
"This is one of our best experience at JW Marriot Hotel in Macau. We got upgraded to presidential suite room with karaoke, Sauna and entertainment room. The rooms quality are exceptional. Lunch and dinner buffet are are very exceptional.  This hotel is a must stay if you come to Macau. You also get access to the Lazy River at Galaxy.  Kids club at JW Marriot is also exceptional and must go if you have small kids.",50
"2-Days-1-Night Trip in Macau again. We traveled with our 5 years old kid. 3 in total. We have stayed in various hotels in Macau and this is the 1st time we stay in JW Marriott. It is so-called 5 stars hotel and the largest JW Marriott in Asia and that's why we would like to have a try.  Pros: 1. Fast Check-in service  2. Excellent facilities in the room, including coffee maker, switchable window, electronic curtain, good toiletries, etc.  3. Good swimming pools and the water park resort.  Cons: 1. We especially noted to the hotel that we would come with our 5 years old kid but there is NOTHING prepared for our kid, no toothbrush, no slippers, no bathrobe...We called the Guest Service to ask for them but after 15 minutes of the call, the lady replied that the bathrobe is out of‚Ä¶",30
"To whom it may concern,   I had a pleasant stay at JW Marriott Macau for the second time. I would like to make a compliment on Guest Services Manager, Ana and Samantha for arranging a good experience for us to celebrate the birthday. And thanks to Joan at executive lounge for remembering me after a year.  Please kindly and definitely deliver the above compliment message to higher superior and show support to the mentioned employees.  Best, Ho",50
We had a wonderful trip to macau especially the hotel service. Alex at reception desk helped us a lot. We got a very nice room with pool view. Staff are very friendly and helpful. We enjoyed the swimming facilities very much as well.,50
"Love to stay as the room style are very nice and cozy.  Travel with infant, baby cot setup in room upon arrival was great! The Water Park are stunning, really enjoy and have in the last river! Breakfast buffer are amazing, too many selections and yummy. Lobby lounge burger super juicy, and super good deal happy hour.",50
Thank you Mr Steven Diep for providing us a nice room.   The view was nice and clean. Facilities were well equipped and sufficient. Swimming pool was big and clean with brilliant food. Food charges were affordable and waiter was so friendly. It would be great if the door connected to Galaxy swimming pool could open until 8pm. Currently 6:30pm was too early.,50
"We stayed in JW Marriott Hotel Macau as a family and booked two Premier Rooms with Resort view for two nights.  We requested for interconnecting rooms so I could look after my two kids staying in the other room and the staff (Ciccy and Sabrina) were very helpful in arranging this for us.  Hotel rooms are very spacious, modern and clean.  Beds are very comfortable.  We loved our breakfast at Urban Kitchen as it has lots of selection.  Access to the lazy river and water slides is easy on level 3 and we enjoyed our time there. Overall I highly recommend this hotel in Macau and we'd return to this hotel when we go to Macau again.",50
I was here for a short visit to macau and decided for a night stay (28th June) at this hotel. I was surprised that the front desk personnel named Adela allowed us for an early check in! Me and my friend managed to check in about 12 pm. She even upgraded our rooms to face the very beautiful view of the water park. The service was really good! 5 stars indeed! Keep it up! ,50
"after my stay last year my family and I chose to stay again so we can enjoy the water facilities. there are a number of hotels in the Galaxy Macau complex but it is always the JW Marriott to be THE ONE! The service from Front desk/ Club lounge and the room setup and cleanliness have been fabulous. we were WOWED again by the beautiful balloon decoration for my two children. and all the additional setup to accommodate my needs for 2 children were very thoughtful. Despite the weather wasn't up to our expectation, we still enjoyed most of our stay here with the upgrade to a suite due to my platinum status!!!   Lastly I want to Express my gratitude to Inga and Sophie (hope I got the names right!) Who checked us in and explained in detail about my stay. The housekeeping who set up my‚Ä¶",50
"the room condition was great, decoration and setup was nice. we were in a slightly bigger room, so it's spacious - both in room and at toilet.  TV was big, and you have USB charging right next to the desk. the wardrobe was accessible from both the room and toilet. we can tell the design was very careful and considerate.  this will definitely be our hotel choice again if to visit Macau again.",40
"The Room is very clean, good and convenient. Staffs are kind as well. Swimm pool is good, but in case of waving pool  if the time of use was extended, it is much better. If I went to Macau, I will go to JW Marriot again!",50
"Brilliant experience at the hotel. Spacious and clean room. Very clean and hygienic. There was live streaming of the FIFA World Cup!   The bathroom was huge... A shower, a bathtub, very spacious dressing area, two sinks, comfy slippers and bathrobes.   Felt like a queen staying in the room, with a coffee machine, two TVs, 3 sofas and a king size bed... Couldn't ask for more! ",50
"The JW Marriott Macau is an elegant hotel with memorable service. From the moment I arrived I knew I was in for a good time.  The room offered views of the surrounding area including the non-stop construction. Nonetheless the room was quiet and stylish. With two bathrooms, a large shower, and a separate tub, the accommodations were extremely comfortable.   Making the stay even better, the JW Marriott Macau concierge lounge took it up a notch. The service was impeccable and the food and drinks offered for breakfast and dinner were also world-class.  The JW Marriott Macau is one of four hotels that are part of the casino resort Galaxy Macau. The other hotels include: Hotel Okura, Banyan Tree Macau, and The Ritz-Carlton Macau. Two additional hotels are under construction nearby.  ‚Ä¶",50
"We stayed here for 3 nights n experienced with a warm greeting from front desk colleague Mr Alex Lam, he is very intimate n attentive, he upgraded our room n with a view facing water park that makes my kid love it so so much and also late check out for his noon nap, which is so important n shows much caring for kids.   Reservation colleague Amber n Gloria from Urban Kitchen also very helpful and nice to us !   Only one little suggestion is that the water park stamp procedure could be done at the same place we registered for JW swimming  pool, so that we don‚Äôt need to bring our room card to water park for stamp purpose n go back to JW locker.  We had a lovely stay and would stay here again with our next trip in Macau !",40
"We stayed recently at JW Marriott while in Macau. Beautiful facility, part of the Galaxy resort. We arrived on the Galaxy shuttle from the ferry terminal from Hong Kong. The hotel is situated in a complex of hotels, casino, etc.  Our room was large and luxurious on the 26th floor. Beautifully appointed and comfortable. The bathroom was wonderful, lots of glass, a lovely shower and separate soaking tub. All the bells and whistles, although the only thing to improve was the towels, as they were not super plush. The staff was great, polished, professional. Brayan in Urban Kitchen, Roselle at concierge desk, Anita the hostess at Urban Kitchen, all went above and beyond to ensure a happy experience for us. Great hotel in Macau. We will be back!",50
"The room is spacious, particularly the bathroom. The dinner buffet is really value for money and they also allocate a very good table for us after knowing the party has elderly and a toddler. The water park facilities are also very fun.",50
JW Marriott is part of the Galaxy complex. With access to the shopping mall and water park. We‚Äôve stayed there twice and enjoyed both times with family and children. The rooms are spacious with very comfortable beds. Breakfast buffet has endless choices of international selections. ,50
"Overall: 4.3/5 Value: 4/5, weighted 30% Location: 4/5, weighted 30% Service: 5/5, weighted 30% Design: 4/5, weighted 10%  The JW Marriott is part of huge complex of hotels/resort/entertainment in the Cotai strip, part of the Galaxy Casino.  Right next to the Ritz Carlton, other hotels in the same complex include the Banyan Tree, and the Okura.  The room rate was reasonable compared to the other hotels in the same complex.  On the Cotai strip, the hotel runs free shuttle to other casinos and entertainment venues as well as a free shuttle to the pier for the ferries to Hong Kong.  The hotel staff are very friendly and professional.  The club lounge at this JW Marriott is one of the nicest I have seen.",40
"Upon arrival at Macau, we firstly enjoyed their famous lunch buffet in variety at Urban Kitchen.  We're most impressed by the lady-manager Gloria who was just helpful and cheerful to serve us in ways of professionalism.  She could be a real asset to achieve hotel's reputable customer satisfaction.  Thank you Gloria! The 2nd staff I would appraise was Tony who did present to be an excellent Fitness guide to share with us the best knowledge of some physical machines in which we focus on for interest and practice.  Besides he often gave us reminders, very caring staff to customer needs.  We wish be there again in future holiday planning, Marriott never let us down in quality services.  Many thanks.",50
"Earlier this month I treated myself a little getaway to Macau and stayed at the prestigious JW Marriott Hotel Macau. It was my first time here for stay (I did come before with family for their restaurants) and the overall experience this time was pleasant. I absolutely love the room- spacious, comfortable, and quite a standard JW Marriott style- lavish yet not over the top kind of feel. Putting that in colours, it's quite 'champagne gold' but not bright shiny kind of gold. Staff was friendly and food was decent too! Worth a comeback!",50
"Stayed here for vacation for two days. The exec lounge is one of the best I've been in, and offered a quality arrangement of food.  My room was upgraded to the top floor suite, and had an exceptional view of the waterpark below.  Staff was very helpful and nice throughout the stay. ",50
"This was my third or fourth stay at the JW Marriott Macau since it opened in 2015.  Every time, I'm most impressed by the facilities, look/feel/design, but most of all the staff.  We had a big presentation, and I had been upgraded to a suite, and Sophia and her team were most accommodating.  The engineering, the IT support - can't say enough good things about them!   Also, Inga in the executive lounge is wonderful and even remembers me, since returning back from maternity leave.  That's true service!  I'm giving it a 4 based on my recent stay, only because it seems their overnight/early morning crew seems to suffer a bit in the consistency department.  Where as the day and night teams truly seem to shine, this team seems to lag a bit....... I asked for help with luggage from my‚Ä¶",40
"We stayed at the JW Marriott Macau for two nights.  The airport shuttle was very convenient, the location was perfect, the waterpark was alot of fun, the room was very clean, and the service was great.  Our only complaint was with the firmness of the bed.  It was very hard which made it difficult to sleep.  Over all, it was a great stay.",40
"Not the first to stay in this hotel, but every time when we have a short break to Macau,  JW Marriott is the only choice. With good service, nicely designed room and relatively quite environment than the nearby hotels, it‚Äôs the best place to stay in Macau. There are huge swimming facilities, plenty of restaurants and shops, and huge casino in Galaxy Macau. You can just stay in the resort without going anywhere to spend your vacation.  I especially appreciate the reception staff called Don who assisted us with our check-in. He upgraded our room with the resort view which made our stay a lot more pleasant. Also, his smile and good attitude towards customers was highly appreciated.",50
"We initially booked a deluxe king room but upon check in, they were able to upgrade us to resort room view on floor 22. We had an excellent view of the resort. The room was big and new. Very bright which I loved and cleanliness was immaculate with housekeep. Hotel corridors was bright n wide, which made it very easy for us to find our room. The only thing I didn't like about the room was the pillow on the bed. The bed was extremely comfortable however the pillow was extremely soft and offered no support to the neck. Overall, the hotel is very convenient to other shops at the promenade which offered an assortment of food and it was a street across to cun ha street which offered alot of different restaurants. Our stay was very pleasant. Hotel staff was friendly & helpful and I‚Ä¶",50
Very nice staff at front desk who helped us to check in early. Room is big with very a comfy bed and we got fruit from the staff later in the evening. We also got a nice handwritten postcard from the lady in the front desk which made you feel welcome. Big pool and easy walk to the bigger pool area which is shared with other hotels. High tea included and super good breakfast. I can really recommend JW Marriott and will definitely book this hotel when I‚Äôm back in Macau next time.,50
This hotel is at the top of the list of favorite hotels I have stayed at.  The attention to detail is mind blowinf.  The staff at the lounge where amazing and very informative.  The suit was gigantic and had the mist amazing views ever.,50
"The hotel did a great job. They knows it's my first time to stay overnight here and arranged me a room with pool view. It was so sweet. The room is really good, it is tidy, clean and comfortable for 2 pax. All facilities are complete and the location is very convenient that you can walk to Taipa Guan Ye Street. There is a shuttle bus outside the hotel and you can take it to Ferry Terminal / International Airport directly.",50
This hotel is absolutely breathtaking! My room was on the 22nd floor and the views are one of a kind. Very good service and nice hotel staff. Would definitely recommend to visit the health center - very knowledgeable and helpful staff especially Rafael. It feels like you get a personal training on top! I hope I get the chance to come back ,50
"JW always my first choice to stay at hotel, I have been to Hongkong, Shenzhen, Beijing and Shanghai. Unfortunlety macau one not the good as want I want. No greeting, no smiling, and I need to take care my luggage. The room facility was still ok. But it always come from noise during mid night.",20
"From the shuttle bus service st the airport , checkin , bellboy service , room , breakfast , housekeeping staff the pool deck everything was excellent .   These guys made my family trip a happy memory & would always savour it .  The grand pool deck is icing on the cake & is fabulous & not to be missed if ur traveling with young kids ,mine were 7 & 1 year old. They loved the deck .   Also the room interiors are fab , sleek & modern my wife loved it .   I don‚Äôt remember the names but thanks to entire staff of J W Macau !!",50
"I have stayed at many of the Macau Casinos, but this was my first stay at the Galaxy complex and we chose the JW Marriott. From the check-in onwards, the staff were very pleasant and helpful. We were upgraded to the Executive Level and given lounge access due to my Ritz Carlton membership. We were also allowed to check-in early and were offered a late check out although this was not required. The room was spacious with great views over the Galaxy pool deck towards Taipa. There was good work space and a Nespresso machine in the room. The bathroom was large and had a bath, separate shower and Japanese style toilet.

"After two decades of not visiting Macau, a concert  finally brought us back here over the weekend.  Upon arrival at the hotel, there seemed to be no one in sight to get our luggage as we alighted from the van. I was starting to feel disappointed, but a very attentive concierge, Khumar, saw us and was quick to help us.  We were then led up to the 2nd floor where the executive club was also located for check in.  The place was bigger than the usual executive club. The ambiance was very pleasant. We were warmly greeted by the friendly staff at the front desk and was swiftly checked in by Gem. We had our daily breakfast at the lounge. And from time to time came for afternoon tea and hors d‚Äôouevres. There was a very good selection of international dishes.  Many thanks to Joanne, Ria,‚Ä¶",50
"Great staff, amazing hotel! I am a silver member and manager Anthony helped us with an early check-in around 11 am and it was really kind. We liked the Galaxy resort pools and whole infrastructure, all in all amazing experience.",50
"I had a WONDERFUL (5 STAR) stay with my family at the JW Marriott Macau. Starting from the check-in experience with Anthony, who I would rate provided 10/10 service, his attentiveness, speed, and attitude couldn‚Äôt have been any better. Every person, from house cleaning, to security, to maintenance staff, pool staff, greeted us with a smile and a great attitude that made us feel like our vacation was truly relaxing and that we were welcomed and respected guest.  Obviously JW. Marriott knows how to train and make its staff feel proud of working for the hotel.  The downside to this was that when we visited other hotels and places in Macau we had a less pleasant time because the people weren‚Äôt as attentive and nice as JW.

"The Galaxy complex is the most amazing hotel facility I‚Äôve ever seen. Amazing room with super views , shopping complex over 1.3km of them  Then walk outside to the most amazing pool/ wave pool/ river pool system. Incredible  Life guards every 20 m making sure all the kids are safe. plus the place is so clean it‚Äôs a credit to the Management and staff and everybody is so friendly   You will not be disappointed if you go as a family or with your partner Oh plus if you gamble your in luck 3 football (soccer) fields of tables etc, not for me but looked impressive ",50
"Stayed here for quick one day (early check in and check out same day). I called to check if I can check in early since I have a late night flight, guest service manager Sergio assured me that the room will be ready for me which I am very grateful. The room is very specious, clean, and very modern. Love the pool view, and room is equipped with world class amenity.   But what made my stay was the staffs, from the check in lady (who was fantastic, sorry didn‚Äôt get your name) to the club lounge staffs. They were all superb! Will come and stay here again when I come back to Macau :)",50
"Located in the large Galaxy compound, JW Marriott is a large hotel with good facilities. I was impressed with the very spacious and well laid out room (got an upgrade) and good service by staffs. It was a short visit so I didn‚Äôt manage to try the facilities, but it‚Äôs a place I would like to go back to. ",50

"We have 2 young children below 7 and had organised late for a Easter trip, Macau seemed to be the only holiday that was not astronomical in price.   We ordinarily wouldn‚Äôt stay at the Galaxy complex - more expensive than others at the Cotai strip - but we‚Äôd thought we try something new for a night.  Which was a great decision.   The JW Marriott is a very nice hotel the rooms were big and done very nice, with the good staff and service, and without the crowds of other hotels in Macau. It managed to feel boutique (for Macau anyway).   The absolute highlight being the massive pool area which involved man made waves into both a massive man made beach and a river rapids area with a number of smaller wading and lap pools scattered about. For our kids this was as good as any beach‚Ä¶",50
"I would rate this as one of my favorite property thus far.  I am a Gold Elite and was advised to check in at the executive lounge instead. Jisu who checked me in was very good and upgraded me to a Premier which is basically a higher floor with the resort view which was nice. I was offered complimentary breakfast in either lounge or main restaurant(this is a plus and I wish more Marriott properties adopt this instead of forcing everyone to squeeze in the executive lounge and limited to a small range although our perk technically entitles us to only continental breakfast), I was proactively offered a late check out at 4pm which is not required as I had a ferry to catch but I appreciated the offer.  JW Marriott Macau opened about two years ago, rooms are modern and well maintained‚Ä¶",50
"One of six hotels within the Galaxy casino complex, this hotel has spacious rooms with spectacular view of the city and the multiple swimming pools and lazy river recreation area.  Special thumbs up to the tremendous bathroom, which as a TV imbedded inside the bathroom mirror so that one can soak in the bath tub and watch TV at the same time. The glass that separates the bathroom and the bedroom is a clear glass window, but with the flip of a switch the glass becomes opaque providing instant privacy.  What a hotel ?",50

"Stayed in quite a few hotels in Macau, I would highly recommend JW Marriott.  All the staff seemed to be nice and helpful.  The check-in was fast.  Also, I personally would like to thank Mr. Edel at the front desk.  He was very friendly and professional.  Room was great, didn't expect they upgraded without asking.  The Grand Resort Deck was cool.  Dinning was nice too, courteous service.",50
"Room: large with good view Washroom: large and clean. Warm toilet seat. Service: good in general, Ciccy in the front desk was nice. She gave us 2 hours of extension so we can check out at 1pm. Breakfast: a good variety of food. no teaspoon next to yogurt, not enough manpower in the bar. Table not so clean. Gym: Rafael was excellent. He took care of the gym equipments as well as cleanliness of the gym. He also taught us how to use the equipments as well as teaching us tricks for stretching. ",40
"A stay in one of the luxury suites is a very new experience.

"Top quality hotel. The room was large and had a great view over the Galaxy Complex, swimming pools, gardens etc. We could not have chosen a better hotel. It is wonderfully opulent and a great value. Service is outstanding. Breakfast at the Urban restaurant was, one could say, a highpoint.",50
"While I was traveling Phuket, I stayed in Macau with my wife and took a break. It was a place that was much more attractive than you would think, with its luxurious interior, shopping malls, and much more to look at. Especially, the view from inside the room through the window was so beautiful. Thank you, Soomin, Joyce and Sharon for their kindness and help us stay relaxed and comfortable. Dear Miss Soomin, thank you very much for caring and helping my wife who is poor at English.",50
"This hotel was a great choice to stay in Macau. Hotel is connected with the shopping mall which is very convenient and also offers free shuttle buses to take you to the casinos such as the Venetian. The reception staff was kind and helpful, very polite. Room was nice and clean and bed was comfortable too. I would stay here again when I come to Macau.",50
The JW marriott is a hotel par excellence. I think its better than the over rated properties like Venetian and the Parisian. The hotel is full of warmth and comfort with ultra modern luxurious gadgets what one could possibly offer in the room. The feather in the cap is the pool area which is far far more better than any of the best water parks. one can say luxury is another name for JW Marriott.,50
"I spent an morning here gym, learnt so much from friendly instructors Fisher and Rafaal.  I see them teaching the experienced, the young and the elderly with professional care and attention.  The gym opens 24 hours, and largely quiet whilst I was here, with many equipment and spa next to it.",50
"I'd like to give a special thank you and gratitude to Christian at the Fitness room, for taking such good care of my mum Liana who is a frequent visitor at the hotel, together with my dad. They absolutely raved about Christian and how good his service is. Thank you for making their stay extra special! ",50
"We booked two rooms during Chinese New Year.  The standard room was spacious enough for family with kids, it was also well appointed.  We had very good lunch buffet in Urban Kitchen.  More restaurants are available in Galaxy Casino, and there are also  shops and cinemas to hang around inside the casino if you are not into gambling.  The problem I encountered is I found my Marriott Rewards points were missing after check-out.  I called the hotel in about a week, the staff told me the relevant personnel who could help me was busy, but she would pass my details and write back to me by email.

(splurge for the first class ticket it is well worth it, we actually got lucky and they had a 30% discount making it very affordable). Anyway you arrive at the Taipai Ferry terminal. From there catch the free Galaxy resort buses. They take you directly to the JW.   Well now lets talk about this fantastic property. The JW Marriott is a 5 star resort.

I went to the gym first where I was helped by Rafael. He introduced me to the Kinesis machine. Not only did he show me how to properly use the machine, but he recommended a nice workout routine to help start my day. I appreciate him checking in from time to time. Afterwards, he recommended the sauna to me. I had a wonderful experience thanks to him. Rafael definitely represented what I expected from a Marriott resort.",50

The lounge  staff are always  helpful and deal with customers with courtesy this time.  I especially appreciate the meticulous service from the duty manager MOJ.  He is so caring to my family and give superior advice and assistance to us throughout my 4-day stay in the hotel.  With this kind of wonderful experience, am sure we will stay with this hotel next time .    Moreover , the staff working in the swimming pool such as Louisa are very pleasant and always shows a welcoming smile to everyone ",50
"I am so sorry to say we only spent two nights at this resort-I kept joking that I wanted to live there permanently.  We are Marriott Platinum level and we were given an executive corner room on the 21st floor!  When we walked into our suite the view was amazing-the whole Galazy complex was right in front of us.  We had a living room, 2 bathrooms and a hugh master bedroom.  Windows in two directions.  Check-in process was exceptionally easy.  Edel and another young lady were there to help us and answer any questions and to explain the layout of this hugh resort.  The lounge was amazing.  Breakfast buffet- omelettes cooked to order; afternoon tea and then dinner buffet-  when we were there lambchops was served one night and sirloin steak the other night.  No need to go out for‚Ä¶",50
"We stayed at this hotel during Chinese New Year.  Even during one of the most busy seasons of the year, JW Marriott did not disappoint.   Our most memorable aspect of this hotel is our check-in experience, which was incredible.  We were welcomed by Karen at concierge who carried a smile throughout our check-in process and was able to answer all our questions.  When we informed her that one of us was celebrating his birthday during our stay, she immediately arranged for a free cake to be delivered to him at a time of our choice.  She was also very polite and apologised several times for arranging a room further from the elevator lobby.  Karen's amazing hospitality made our first impression of this hotel remarkable.   Re location - this hotel is located within the Galaxy Macau‚Ä¶",40
"Thank you for giving me this wonderful 2 nights stay in your Hotel. This was not my first time to Macau, but this was my first time to stay at your Hotel.   This trip I went with my girlfriend. After the stay, both of us think that JW Marriott Macau is a excellent 5 stars hotel with good location.  Moreover, the setup of the room was perfect, clear and tiny, we could find everything we need easily.  The check in was incredibly fast. I think the whole check in process was around 5 mins. The staff in the check in counter was the first staff I met during the stay and they had given me a excellent impression.  One staff I have to mention here to show my special appreciation is Mathew. I do not know his title, I just know he works at the lounge at 2 floor. He is a super nice person.‚Ä¶",50
JW Marriot is a relatively quiet hotel located within the larger Galaxy Macao complex. Decoration wise it is rather basic but service is good and most staff speaks good English unlike the majority of most other hotel staff who speaks only local Cantonese and Mandarin. It is rather strange and annoying as these staff seem to have little tolerance if you speak to them in English and are generally very unfriendly and unhelpful. These hotels will turn away tourists who do not speak Cantonese or Mandarin. Good luck to them ,30
"This is a very ""Classy"" GRANDE Hotel quite near [a 10-15 minute walk] Macau's ""old Village""-- and its many fine/interesting restaurants and shops!!  The rooms have many interesting features-- like a ""commode with lights"", and ample room, and wonderful ""fluffy"" Bath Robes...  The Hotel can be easily reached from the Ferry Terminal by the (free) Galaxy shuttle.  The Urban Kitchen Restaurant serves remarkable breakfasts with delicious ""Asian"" as well as ""Western"" favourites!!  Perhaps the best feature is the ""professionalism"", helpfulness and knowledge of the staff.  The Hotel can also be a bit ""flexible"" in terms if check out times.  If one can get access to the ""Executive Lounge""-- the services are nothing short of wonderful!!",50
"I want to thank the ff who made our stay comfortable: Stella at the front desk for a smooth,friendly and personalized check-in. Echo did a great job for a quick and smooth check-out process. The concierge team for taking care of our luggage. Lastly the entire recreation team, special mention Nicole,Anton,Joana and other local staffs (forgot their names) who went out of their way to make sure we‚Äôre comfortable and their service is beyond compare and exemplary. The overall guest experienced was exceptional and at par. The service is personalized and exemplary.",50
My family and I (a 9-year-old girl) stayed at JW Marriott Hotel for 2 nights. The service was excellent. At first we thought that the bed was too small for three people. The serviceman who guided us to the room offered us an extra foldable bed. He was very helpful. He also gave us a lot of suggestions for sightseeing.                                                                       ,50
"Stayed with JW Marriott Macau numerous times and always liked it for how classy and  grand it is. A lot of privileges being a platinum elite member- upgraded suites, breakfast included, snacks and drinks in the evening, there‚Äôs nothing to complain about. It‚Äôs a rather long walk from the lift lobby to the suite which is located at the end of the building though.",50
"I have stayed in a lot of Marriott hotels in recent years so far and being a Marriott gold member, I can guarantee JW Marriott Macau is the best of the best. They have responsive caring staffs, amazing facilities and spacious clean elegant room with an awesome resort view.  I went to Urban Kitchen for breakfast, and their breakfast buffet is amazing! You get a wide selections of traditional Asian and western breakfast. I have to say out of all hotels in Macau this is the best breakfast place!  The rest of the hotel and the Galaxy Complex is an experience in itself and the 500 meter long lazy river was amazing! The location of the hotel is only 12 mins walk to the old Taipa village where there are many local shops and restaurants.  The staff is extremely helpful and kind, their‚Ä¶",50
"The check in was quick. The card sensor in some escalators didn‚Äôt work properly. My room was spacious, modern and had a great view of the Venetian Hotel and the swimming pools. The toilet bowl got a light that will turn on when the room light is off - the first hotel I came across this. With this light there was no need to turn on any light when going to toilet in the middle of the night. The bed was comfortable, the water pressure was good, the toiletry, slipper, etc., were of good quality. The curtain between the bathroom and the living room was an electronic one, it ‚Äòopened‚Äô with a touch of the button. There was USB charging port besides the writing desk, and electricity socket besides the bed. The breakfast was average. I had two night of good sleep there.",50
"Staying at the JW Marriott Macau is always a guarantee that everything will be on point. From the warm welcome to the attentive service and the beautiful confortable rooms.  The girls of the Executive Lounge are always amazing, thank you so much for the kind attention and your excellent customer care. A special thanks too to Rovita, from Housekeeping department, who surprised me with lots of small details in my suite that showed that she really cares.  Thank you!",50
"Easy transportation from the Macau Port with the Galaxy Macau shuttle service. First impression wasn't that great when we first arrived and had to stand there waiting while the receptionist all seemed busy looking down rather than noticing guests around, until Karen assisted us with the check-in procedure, which was very quick and smooth. Huge appreciation when she could arrange a room for us right away before the standard check-in time. The room was spacious and well-maintained. Very nice, open view from my window, unless you look down... since Galaxy Macau is expanding to Phase 3 and my room oversees the entire construction site across the street, and they started pounding around 08:30am, not very ideal if you plan to sleep in. Waited quite long for a ice bucket (around 20‚Ä¶",40
"This place was great , I could not fault it. From the moment we checked in the staff were fantastic , oh and the breakfast - please can I move in and have that breakfast everyday. The rooms were really big , really really big and had all the modern touches expected from a 5 star hotel. The location was also good and we utilised the shuttle bus service which was also great.",50
"JW Marriott Hotel Macau was truly stupendous. It's tough to say not impressed with these all. Well, let's start from the simple thing like the welcome service. It looks simple, but delivering a welcome through the TV screen inside the room was sometimes very sweet and warm for the guests. Simple but memorable.  There is no doubt that they have top-level staff. From the start of the staff at the pick-up point of the shuttle bus service to the staff inside the hotel area, they were all the best. Especially to Cookie (if I'm not mistaken in remembering her name) one of the female staff on duty at the front desk and the executive lounge, she was really helpful and knowledgeable. She explained all the things I needed to know without being missed at all. She also gave me a late‚Ä¶",50
"It's not the first time to visit Macau but it's the first time to visit JW Marriott The location is near Rua do Cunha(ÂÆò‰πüË°ó) with 10 mins walking distance which is very  convenient!  Rooms in Macau are always bigger than in HK. This room we had was facing the hotel facilities like the outdoor swimming pool, the view was nice in day and night time! Everything in the room was perfect except we couldn't find the mini bar and fridge?! Highlight for the bathroom amenities (body lotion and conditioner)  Thanks Wincy for the express check-in, she was pretty friendly and efficient. To compare with Concierge, we appreciated the service from them bell service. They are more helpful!!  Breakfast on the 1/F was amazing!

"JW is situated in Galaxy, Macau, a pretty new property, just next to Ritz-Carlton. The lobby looks great! The room is much bigger than the average 5-star hotels in Hongkong. In general, the front desk services are very good. A minor misunderstanding happened in the beginning but was resolved immediately and effectively by Mr. Thomas Li, Director of Front Office, to our utmost satisfaction. I would say Mr. Li is the best personnel of the entire Marriott group, whom I've ever met since 2012.   The club lounge can offer both excellent services and food. We went to Urban Kitchen for breakfast.  We're welcomed by the extremely well trained employees there in every respect. Among them, I want to mention at least a few:Narlen, Brayan, Catherine and Lina.",50
"After few business trip to Macau, I choose JW Marriott hotel on my last business trip. Receptionist known that I was first try on JW Marriott, he serve me very well and arrange a wonderful room with excellent view for me. Great services and quality among other 5 stars hotel that I had stayed so far in Macau.  Special thanks to Receptionist Andrew for his great arrangement and service. I had a wonderful business trip with JW Marriott team.",50
"I dont usually write on tripadvisor, however, my stay was not pleasant somehow. I just wanted to comment on the shampoo and body wash that gave me itchy skin and hair scalp for days and I only used those shampoo and body wash once during my stay! The brand is AROMATHERAPY ASSOCIATES which is a UK brand that I love, but I think this made in china ones are quite different than the ones I normally buy in store which is made in UK. If you are staying at this hotel and you dont want to take the risk, bring your own shampoo and body wash.",10
We loved our stay here. From the moment we checked in with Alex we experienced the wonderful hospitality of the JW.  We had to change rooms because our non smoking room smelled of stale smoke but the staff were helpful in this regard.  The food at breakfast and dinner was wonderful in the Urban Kitchen and the serving staff including David and Bryan were extremely friendly and helpful.  We were slightly disappointed with the cost of the children‚Äôs play room (kids club) as we felt it was a bit steep for hotel guests. We also had to pay a ‚Äòservice charge‚Äô for the use of this playroom which I thought was a bit cheeky as we couldn‚Äôt even leave our child there as he was under 3 so not exactly sure what this additional service charge was for as he was accompanied by a parent the whole‚Ä¶,40
"JW Marriott Macau is a product like you'd expect of any other JW properties - elegant, spacious and with a touch of luxe.   Unlike the other popular hotels in Macau, the JW Marriott Macau seems a little less busy and congested in the public spaces - which is so great for hotel residents.  My room afforded me clear views of the surrounding integrated resorts. Spectacular in the day but at night they glow so bright that I must draw the curtains to keep the lights out.  The hotel is connected to a mall with shops and restaurants and also to the other hotels in the Galaxy Macau complex.",50
"The hotel and surrounding its 5 star but that where it stops.  There was no service at the pool, no service pretty much every where except the restaurants.  I want to like this hotel because the water park and the connection to the mall makes sense to us since we have two boys and the hotel it's really nice but the service or no service per se...hmm I'm not coming back. There is just so much hotel to choose from in Macau.",40
"This hotel is wonderful; from their lobby up to the room. The hotel room I stayed in had a private outdoor hot tub and it was perfect for the weather. We tried the in room dining and it was worth it. The servings were really big and the service was perfect. They returned after lunch with goodies for my daughter and it sure made her day. It surely surpassed my expectations. With a place where there is a 5 star hotel every corner the test comes to service, and this hotel sure did pass it. The staffs they have for in room dining were really helpful and nice. Top notch service in the perfect location. It is all worth your money, you won't even find anything bad to say about them.",50
"Everything in the hotel is great, esp. the club lounge which serves fabulous food at happy hours. The breakfast at Urban Kitchen is also full of choice. People are nice and speak good English, which is a surprise because I thought most of the staff should be from Mainland China and speaking Chinglish :p However, be careful if you take a taxi. Those lining up outside the hotel are mostly bad! Suggest you take the free shuttle bus. There are many routs as it serves the whole big area of Galaxy. I'm not allow to share the link here but you may easily google ""Galaxy Macau shuttle bus""",50
This hotel was beyond spectacular.  The service was amazing.  Honestly have nothing bad to say.  The breakfast at the urban kitchen was worth every penny.  Bryan at the restaurant was especially kind and helpful.  Love this place.   Such a wonderful hotel and staff.  Worth every penny.,50
"We stayed here one night with young kids and wish we had stayed here longer.   Being a gold member, we got an upgrade.  The rooms are spacious and the decor very tasteful.   The facilities are just amazing. The hotel is part of a large facility and has a lovely heated pool, fantastic gym and a lazy river as part of it. There is also a paid kids club, which should've been free for the gold and platinum members at least. Breakfast spread is great just what one comes to expect from a JW.   It is the largest JW Marriott in Asia and it superb.   We are surely coming back. ",50

Their service is great and they reacted promptly to resolve any issue. This round front desk staff Icey try her best to give us all 3 rooms pool view and arrange for same level room and connected room as we have young children and elderly. I was allocated the end room so quite a bit of walk towards lift area and my corner room had a couple of power trips, they are fast to react and resolved asap. We like the geographical position as it is walking distance to Taipa villa, convenient shuttle services and their surrounding connected pool play.",50

Hence, it wins our return for this trip.  I would like to say the staff here are impeccable, in terms of service and their professionalism. This stay was full of surprise and unforgettable moments for me. Despite being proposed by my loved one, without the wonderful set-up and hard work of the team, I believe it won't turn up so perfect.   The room was spacious, very clean and with nice view. Special thanks to Maple, Henrique and Julius for making our stay a wonderful one. It's definitely a five stars for you guys.",50

"The J.W. Marriott is the best hotel experience I've ever had, and I've stayed in a lot of hotels.   Let me begin with the Urban Kitchen restaurant where we celebrated my son's birthday this evening.   The buffet was excellent, great choice of dishes, delicious, and the service....wow!  Special kudos to Shekhar who looked after us this evening and saw to it that our glasses were never empty (because we ordered the free-flow wine with our meal), and dirty plates disappeared almost immediately.   He was so gracious and welcoming.    Outstanding service!    Yes, the food was terrific too, great choice, and the buffet items were always replenished quickly.  (Although the 3 oyster limit each time was a bit unnecessary; it just meant you had to keep going back and use more plates!)  ‚Ä¶",50

She even ensure my stay were comfortable and everything were ok, she makes me feels like I‚Äôm home which this were my first time here in Macau. Kudos to MAPLE and team.  Hence, other than that breakfast was not included in my room and I did not realize and upon check in front desk didn‚Äôt even mention about my breakfast , nor the hostess in the restaurant.

But one thing can be improved. I requested the birthday cake that can send to our room at 22:00 via email before arrival date.

"This is my second visit to Macau JW Marriott , surprisingly some of the staff still able to recognize me since my last stay a year ago.  The hotel has way more customers than previous years. Food at the executive floor is not as top notch as last year but still able to maintain the good quality and standard for JW level.  I tried the breakfast at the restaurant and was exceptionally pleased by their wide variety selection of food with high quality. Staff are friendly and helpful which shows they are under good management. Special thanks to Latie, Joan and Inga for their great services at different posts.",50
Stayed in JW Macau for one night. The room is super great and comfy with big jacuzzi. GSM Sergio did in room checkin for us and did a complete introduction of hotel and  recommended us some outside restaurants. Restaurant food are also nice. A lot of choices in buffet breakfast. And Man Ho Chinese restaurant provides decent Cantonese food. Strongly recommend. Hotel location good too. Convenient to go to shopping mall and casino. Definitely will come again!,50

Hurried back to the hotel where I boarded the taxi to see if there was ANY way in hell i would be able to get my phone back! Two of the staff, Yu Rong Yuan and  Shane Sham immediately did everything in their power with lighting speed to assist me.  They quickly obtained the license plate of the taxi I boarded. While at the police station filling out a report, the phone shows up(also thanks to a good samaritan)!!! Stress level:back to ZERO  The staff would not even accept my cash tip. I sincerely thank the staff, the samaritan, as well as those who assisted me at the Macau police station! Happy Thanksgiving! Forgot to mention, he facility is top notch as well!",50
"My wife and I were upgraded to the executive suite room (Marriott Platinum Member) and had a wonderful check-in experience at the 2nd floor executive lounge. The hotel is superbly maintained and the staff (except for the lounge breakfast chefs) are very professional and friendly. There are 3 areas of improvement that I would recommend to the managers of the Galaxy Resort.  1) Everything was great until I found out that I could only withdraw HKD$3,000 per 24 hours from any ATM. I called my bank (Bank of America) and was told that the ATM companies in Macau have placed this limit and is outside of their control. This was extremely frustrating as HKD$3,000 is only about USD$380 and the minimum bets at the casino are HKD$300 which is about uSD$38... so roughly 10 hands at a table‚Ä¶",50
"Arrived the hotel at 1400, we can check in already. It supposes to be after 1500. It do a great favour for us as we can settle down all the thing earlier. When we approach the front desk, reception calls Claire who is really nice to us. She explain all the detail to us, and recommend us the hotel facility. She even arrange a room for us with the best view of the hotel. We like the view so much. Not to mention, the room condition is up to 5 star hotel standard. Really recommend this hotel and we definitely come back. ",50

"The Marriott experience in Macau was akin to being in Paradise for both myself and my wife. From beginning to end, the standard of service shone brightly. The Club Lounge on the second floor was perfection itself. Inga and Felix, the warm-hearted hoists on the Lounge's Front Desk made sure that our every need was attended to with inimitably discreet yet impeccable service, which also managed to go the extra mile. For example, my wife had to arrive later on the Saturday afternoon but the staff kept a sharp, observant look out in order to intercept her and convey her to our suite. The suite itself on the Hotel's top 31st Floor was divine; very spacious, very well-appointed and with bay picture windows looking out onto the Swimming pool complex below.

Since all the rooms were fully booked the night before, the receptionist (Joy) was very kind to help us pre-check in and arranging for the earliest available room so we won't have to queue again. Thanks to Joy, we managed to get our room @ 130pm. Another compliment to our housekeeper (Ashdk) for the great effort in cleaning up our dirty room as well as arranging our belongings/laundries during our stay. Besides cleaning up my computer desk, Ashdk also replaced my ""A4 paper mousepad"" with a proper mousepad! It's all these small little details that made our stay even sweeter, and that's what great services are all about. Definitely will be staying with them again for my next trip!",50

Use of the executive lounge turns the stay into an all inclusive. Breakfast, afternoon tea, evening wine and cocktails are all amongst the best Marriott offer worldwide.

Very impressed by the Vietnamese Front Desk staff. He was very skillful and careful to keep my privacy during my roon registration which was sometimes mistakingly interrupted by other customers.

"To Mr. Arne Sorenson, CEO JW Marriott Hotels We wish to congratulate you for the superb service and wonderful stay we just experienced at JW-M Macau. Every staff we encountered made us feel like VIPs, or their best friends. They included Aaron at Concierge, Steven of Guest Relations, Anita and Gloria at Urban Kitchen. Even an un-named staff whom I witnessed carefully and diligently rearranging cushions and resetting seats in the open lounge area opposite reception counters as soon as some guests walked away. All these told us one thing.... JW-M has trained their staff well and thoroughly from the ground up and from the top down.

"We stayed at the JWM Macau for one night, Travelling with two young children is not easy but the JWM staff made it very enjoyable for us. I had requested a cot and bed guards for the children and these were already put in place in the room on our arrival. From our previous experience at many 5* hotels, I have to chase room service to do this. In particular, Edel and Sergio were very helpful and accomodating. Edel met us in the queue at check in and knew which family we were immediately and had prepared everything in advance for our arrival.   We will definitely be staying here again!",50

Oysters, red shrimp sashimi, lobster......all are good quality. I want to recommend the abalone rice in soup. The taste of the soup base is nice, I can't help finishing the whole bowl of rice.

JW Marriott was situated in the complex of Galaxy Macau, with access to a huge shopping mall, a huge swimming area to be shared among residents in the whole complex. Shuttle service was also available to access other parts of Macau as well - for free!   A Premier Room with a resort view was reserved initially.

And the only thing which needs serious improvement is their room service they hardly have options and my mother being a vegetarian had no options to be honest, also they take a while to deliver your food like a long while.

Honestly I would like to stay in St Regis too!!  The executive lounge is full of people and we have to wait for a while to check in. Staff is sincere and friendly. They also apologise for letting us wait so long. But actually we are fine.   Lounge staff Christina is especially helpful. We understand she may not be fluent in Cantonese but she tried her best to communicate in our language. She is also helpful enough to arrange an extra bed, despite the fact I have mistakenly booked the King-bed-room.   The overall check in experience is good. The drawback is that we have assigned a room which is in the far end of the‚Ä¶",50
"This hotel is amazing. The room was very comfortable and clean, I really love the design of the bathroom, it gives the room an elegant touch. There is a private JW Marriott swimming pool and a big pool desk shared with the other hotels, we had a lot of fun in the pools. The staff was very kind and helpful. I definetly recomend it.",50
Booked a room directly using Mariott Rewards membership.  Check in was trouble free and Venessa was very helpful with our requests.  We had great fun at the Grand  Resort Deck 2 days in a row and weather was great for water activities. Rooms are comfortable and we enjoyed great meals in the Galaxy complex.,50
"This is my second time staying at the JWM Macau.  Excellent pool, staff, room, restaurants, location and overall facility. I love the fact that you have your private JWM pool and access to the Galaxy water park.  Free shuttle to the ferry terminal and other attractions. In addition, Steven Diep at the check-in counter provided excellent and speedy service.  Steven also went above and beyond and arranged a little surprise for my wife and I as we were celebrating our anniversary.    Thank you Steven!   We look forward to stay at this property again!",50
"Amazing hotel with great location and outstanding hospitality. Stayed with my family and received warm personalised check in. Rooms, food, service, pool everything is amazing. Highly recommended. Staying here will make your entire experience absolutely memorable. ",50
"JW Marriott's service and staff really impressed me. For every request we made, and we made many, e.g. delivery of baby cot, extra towels, bottles water, etc, staff would follow up with a call to make sure we got what we asked for. Even the staff delivering those items were very friendly and made an extra effort to make our stay comfortable as we were travelling with a toddler and a baby. We borrowed a cot, bottle steriliser and step stool.  The baby amenities pack wasn't available when I asked. I didn't bring baby body wash as I read in other travellers reviews that they supply amenities, though it is a minor issue. Room service food we ordered came quickly.  The room itself was really nice and grand, and we had a lovely view overlooking the resort. I wrote a review seperately‚Ä¶",50
"Part of the Galaxy hotel complex (buses collect from the airport and ferry terminals), the JW Marriott is a really excellent hotel.  The staff are exceptional (especially in the exec lounge) and nothing is too much trouble for them.  The rooms are large, extremely well equipped, comfortable etc  The facilities in terms of gym, pools, access to the resort facilities, shopping mall/casino (as part of the Galaxy complex) are all first class.  The exec lounge is one of the best I have visited with extensive food and beverage service (compared to others)  Overall cannot recommend highly enough!",50
"I checked in on 14 July and check out on 16 July.  My room # is 26266.  All staffs are very helpful especially Executive lounge staff ( Christina, Inga & Rhialyn).  They are very polite with lovely smile.  So comfortable as home.   Thank you for your good service.   For sure I will come back.",50
Luxury lobbyÔºå nice hotel room and view.  It is convenient to go to casino and shopping area.   The swimming pool is really nice- safe and wth different choices. Kids had good mentory in this hotel.  The breakfast in 2F restaurant is very good.   I will choice this hotel for next trip to Macao.,50
"As others have said, if you have kids or are a kid at heart, you will thoroughly enjoy all of the pool choices on the Grand Deck...even for those who can't swim...life jackets are readily available in adult sizes as well.  If you get bored in one section, simply move on to another area.  Two or more hours at a time will simply fly by.  We're non-gamblers, and we had a great time.  We just spent our money on other things in the complex and outside.    Cici checked us in at the main check-in area  While I'm a Marriott Gold member, I didn't have to wait or go up the Executive Club, i was escorted to her counter.

"I am glad that I choose JW Marriott as my 5 days 4 nights Macau trip's hotel (17 April to 21 April). We really enjoyed the moments spent in JW. The service, food (breakfast & dinner),facilities and everything are almost perfect. Buffet breakfast and buffet dinner are one of the best in all my trips too. I will definitely visit Macau again for this hotel!",50
"The staff, Alex at the front desk was very kind and helpful. He tried his best when he knew we are coming with kids. With his help, we had a room with great view!  The buffet was one of the best I ever had. Variety of great quality of foods. Probably one of the best in Macau too.",50
"We live in Hong Kong and took our 2-year-old daughter to the resort by Marriott point redemption.  The service at reception was great and the room was in very good condition.  The resort facilities, especially the mini water park, were very good for kids to play as well.  Worth staying!",50
"I stayed in JW Marriott Macau with my family in June for a weekend.  It's the best choice for family trip with kids particularly if you would like to try the Grand Resort Deck.  Each room offer 4 free entry to the Grand Resort Deck (2 adults, 2 kids below 12).  Highly recommend people to get there early if you want to try the Grand Resort Deck as the hotel will allow you to enter the Grand Resort Deck even before the check in time (3pm).   I have booked two rooms and the hotel has kindly offered me two connecting rooms with Resort View!  The two kids (one six years old and one two years old) really enjoyed their stay particularly we can fulfill all our needs there.

"We made a short trip to Macau just to see what it's all about. Booked the JW as an after thought since we are platinum members. We were totally blown away. The hotel quickly became one of our favorite JW's worldwide. The staff is fantastic and very friendly. The English speaking level is impressive. (Helen at the pool restaurant is delightful and Matthew in the concierge lounge ensured we had everything we could need.)  We had a top level suite with all the amenities we could ever need - large seating area, make up table, walk in closet, shower big enough for two people, etc etc. The design and fixtures were to the level of a Ritz Carlton.   The recreational activities are just as grand. The Marriott has a nice pool of its own with a good restaurant attached. Guests also have‚Ä¶",50

The exclusive lounge is pretty good.I like the swimming pool, the water is smooth. I had a very good experience staying with JW Marriott Hotel Macau. ",50
"the hotel is fabulous but some of the problems need to be paid more attention.  we arrived the hotel at 3pm last Sunday and supposed we could get our rooms on time, after 10 more mins checking, the front desk staff persuaded us to come back after swimming then he could arrange us 3 rooms to be in the same floor.  as i knew some facilities would be closed at 6:30pm, we wanted to have our rooms first and didn't mind if our rooms were on diff floors.  then he checked for few mins again, my room was still unavailable and he told me my room could be checked out lately at 1pm the next day. he told me I could have my room card at 3/F, so i didn't need to go to the lobby after swimming at the 3/F.    First I was told the delivery service wasn't available when I was in the pool entrance.‚Ä¶",30

"Of all the hotels in Galaxy Macau, apart from Ritz Carlton, JW Marriott and Banyan Tree are close seconds. But the service and staff at JW is outstanding and the room is simply luxurious. I book a room there during the early season of summer and the hotel was pretty full. When I checked in, the concierge (Steven Diep) ask if I wanted to join Marriotts Rewards for free. I thought why not and got a few of my friends to join. When Steven saw how enthusiastic we were to become members and the hotel has a lot of guests that day, he upgraded my room to executive suite. Can't thank him enough as I had a wonderful stay there. The facilities are also excellent seeing this is the Galaxy and JW!",50
"We arrived early (10am) after an overnight flight from Rome, our 4 year old daughter was extremely tired and fell asleep in the lobby, staff member Hugeos was excellent - tried to get us into a room early but there wasn't one available - allowed us to head up to the executive club and wait until our room was ready. The executive club staff were excellent and aware of our situation we were given a room at 12:30. Our room was on the 20th floor and beautifully appointed - the bathroom was lovely with a huge rain shower, large bath and big vanity.

"My husband booked this hotel for my birthday celebration. It was a double bed room. Room is beautifully designed (modern , warm with a bit of classy taste). I like the settings of the bathroom.  Amenities are high grade quality. The lotion is made from natural essential oils and I like the smell very much ( Lavender n Ylang Ylang). We got a spectacular view overlooking The Galaxy hotel, the lazy river and also the Zhuhai-Macau bridge. The front desk staff was exceptionally pleasant, cheerful, very detailed in explaining the usage of sharing the pool with the Galaxy Hotel. Service is very good.

I do not know how much time and effort the housekeeping staff have spent but when I stepped in my room, me and my family was completely WOWED! By then I realized why we were asked to wait for a bit at the lounge because they were anticipating my arrival!  As an SPG gold member I was able to tier-matched and became an instant Gold member with Marriott too, the hotel really recognized their members as I received an upgrade to a suite with beautiful view overlooking the pool deck of the whole Galaxy Macau complex. We had to thank few staffs such as Felix at check in providing friendly service, Ellen from Housekeeping who proactively assisted‚Ä¶",50
I have been staying with my family several times and JW Marriott Macau never give me disappointment.  They recently added JBL horizon which give me a bit surprised. The wifi and factuality in bath room is working great!  The lunch buffet is simply awesome even the crab can be better.  The beach pool is probably one of the best in Hong Kong and Macau.  It would be good if they can add Apple TV for airplay in future.,50
We stayed there for 2 nights in June 2017 in an executive suite with club lounge access. The room was amazing and hugh. It was on the top (31st) floor and had a great view out of the windows. Every member of the staff we encountered were very helpful and eager to please.  The swimming pools and surrounding areas cater well for families and adults alike. I could find no fault in anything.,50
"The hotel  all are very helpful. I went there to celebrate my birthday and they gave me a surprise with a birthday cake and reserve me a room with stunning view.  Thanks Cat and you are deserved a full mark 10/10.  My sister got a serious flu on the second day, though we have checked out already, they still provided us the wheel chair and offered us the nearest hospital information and showed us how to get there.   Sorry that I can't remember the name of the floor manager who was on duty on 26/6 in the afternoon (around 2-3pm), he's very helpful and assisting us to get the wheel chair. Much appreciated.    The pool facilities are perfect and the most exciting part is the water slide.   Everything is perfect except the attitude of the staff in the food court of the Galaxy hotel.‚Ä¶",50
"The best experience we have had so far. The staff was very courteous - and upgraded to 28th Floor and a fantastic pool view. A spectacular view from the 28th floor and room was magnificent. The staff treated us so well. From front office to urban kitchen, concierge, security, every person we met were so wonderful, we fell in love with the place and people. If you are reading this, we are loss of words to explain the wonderful experience we have had. We will surely go there again and again.  We are vegetarians and for us we have had very little choice. The hotel provides free bus shuttle facility to the city center, airport and to the ferry. Ambience of the hotel interiors superb.",50

We glad we did and the kiddos had a whale of time playing in the Asia longest, biggest water park. Room was big and very spacious including the toilet. Family of 4 can book a room that comes with two double beds, more than enough to accommodate. We had a fantastic view of the massive waterpark right in our room. Breakfast was great with plenty options to choose from. Hotel is located within a shopping mall with plenty of eaterys and also a Cineplex . For those looking to gamble, there is a big casino too. Shuttle buses are conveniently located just outside the entrance to various hotels too. Will definitely stay here again if I'm back in‚Ä¶",50

"When we visited, the hotel wasn't open for very long and you can tell. Rooms were beautifully designed, very spacious. Hotel manages to retain its brand and look and feel in the lobby although it is connected to the mall/casino.  We also been to the hotel Okura, but the JW is slightly better in our opinion.  Btw, the slippers are THE BEST SLIPPERS :) ",50

Upon arrival, I was whisked off straight away to the Executive Club on the second Floor in order to check in... and really, what a treat the whole Executive Club experience proved to be! At the cocktail hour, genuine accompanying food is served, such as succulent lamb chops. Both the cuisine and the service in the Club were exquisite. i loved my 26th Floor Corner Suite room as well. It was spacious and luxurious. I have to return soon, and the next time-with my wife.",50
JW Marriott was kind enough to upgrade us to a room with the resort view and offer us a delicious birthday cake when noticing that we are celebrating birthday during the trip! We arrived at the hotel at 11 am. The check in time was 3 pm originally but we were offered to check in the room at once without waiting. How considerate! The view of the room is wonderful! The room is spacious! We also went to the water world on the third floor and we enjoyed ourselves very much! ,50

"Heard thousands of good things about JW Marriott and decided to bring my 2 year-old son over and visit for a quick one-night staycation.    Got to say that everything went soo well.    Rooms were spacious enough and well designed.  Large TVs, deep bathtubs, strong showerheads, etc.  Special thanks to wonderful lady who've checked us in Jisu who went her way to have a nice room already prepared for us earlier and a birthday cake arranged for my son who just turned two.  Her sincerity towards guests definitely lived up to the Marriott brand.  Will definitely come back again.  May consider staying in a Suite next time!  ",50

The driver is smooth and helpful, as soon as we arrived, we were greeted by the conceirge and staff. They took us to the room and we were greeted with fruits, petite fours, and wine. We were lucky to be treated with the pool side suite and connected room. The rooms are modernly decorated and spacious. The swimming pool is small but perfect for a family to gather around during summer time as a mini retreat. The bathroom amenities were adequately stocked with Aromatherapy Associates which is one of my favourite brands. Service is flawless and the staff are caring and you can tell by the effort‚Ä¶",50

As soon as we arrived staff were extremely friendly and welcoming and they also upgraded our room. I believe it was the premier room? on the 18th floor. The room was gorgeous, view was great and we really enjoyed staying here. If we decide to return to Macau we will definitely be staying here again!",50
"There're so many hotels in Macau and of course I've stayed at lots of them. JW Marriott Hotel Macau is always my 1st choice and the reason is quite simple. Back to January last year, I've stayed there with my mom and it was the 1st time I stayed there. I used the express check-out box since we were in a rush. After a month, I didn't received the deposit so I went there in person since I was still around South China. Mr. Norman Yaranon helped me to check it and gave me his name card. The issue finally solved after few emails. I always recommend my friends and family to stay there after that. It might be a little bit late but I would like to write a review here to thank Mr. Yaranon for everything.",50
"Was there over the weekend for some good vocation time. Everything was great, the room, the facilities, the service. More surprisingly, during my stay I had the chance to workout out at its gym, and I would have to say, it was well equipped and its staff/personal trainer was amazing. Christian was able to spot me and giving me tips during the workout as well as add in few new workouts for me to do. It was a great experience overall and will definitely visit again.",50
"My family and I stayed for two nights and can't say enough good things about our weekend getaway. We were in Macau for our daughter's birthday and in her words, ""This was the BEST birthday ever."" The staff from the point of reception at check-in to the Executive lounge and at the facilities including health club and pool were all extremely attentive and caring. Raffy in the health club was very helpful during my morning workouts. He provided exercises to maximise the use of the equipment without being intrusive. He remembered us at the pool as well and was very kind to my daughter. She was filled with joy when he wished her the best for her birthday. The rooms and facilities are modern, clean and definitely 5 star. We will return for sure.",50

Most large properties are well appointed with quality amenities but it was always the service level that left us disappointed.

I was so impressed by this experience that I brought my wife there for a short vacation in May 2017.

The service staff is accommodating and able to speak in English, Cantonese and Mandarin. I have no issue in communicating in another of these languages with them. Breakfast at Urban Kitchen is good especially for the porridge, ham, bread and eggs items. The dim sum is off the mark as compared to Hong Kong standards. A word of caution, do go early to avoid the crowds throttling in around 9ish am on weekends.

"Excellent hotel with very large and comfortable room. The beds are also very comfortable, and the air conditioning was extremely silent. The bathroom is also very large with a separate bathtub and shower and remarkably transparent glass between it and the room that can be darkened. The hotel is part of the Galaxy Resort and guests have free access to the Grand Resort Deck - a large amusement park on the roof of the casino between the 5 hotel complexes. There are two swimming pools with waves and beaches, as well as several regular pools, as well as a lot of fun for children.

We arrived from Hong Kong airport with a ferry to the Cotai pier and took the Galaxy shuttle bus to the hotel. The shuttle takes apx. 10-15 minutes to reach the hotel, after stopping at several other hotels of the huge Galaxy complex.  Upon entering the hotel, one cannot escape the beauty of the lobby, with its glitzy (yet not over-the-top) design, and just how freezing the a/c is.

Our meals were taken at the Executive lounge were we found great food with high quality and neat presentation. The staff was very helpful and flexible since we were a family with 3 children...

During the booking process I was not so happy as I could not find a place to remark a special request on their official booking website. I tried their international customer service and they told me it is best to call the hotel directly for any special request. It was not so convenient to make an international call so I didn't, but fortunately they did forward my request to the hotel and we got a birthday cake at our arrival.  The hotel has its own swimming pool which is very nice. I especially recommend the outdoor Jaccuzi. When the weather was too cool for swimming you can still enjoy a hot bath in their relatively large Jaccuzi pool. In the changing room there are also sauna room and steam room though‚Ä¶",50

It's worth the extra for the executive stay with a great choice for breakfast, afternoon tea, and evening snacks or meal included (basically a full board).

Rooms and washroom smell great and it really feels like housekeeping take great pride in taking care of the rooms. Ask for a pool view.   A small negative would be how they are pretty stingy with the check-in & check-out times. Maybe they treat you better if you are a ranked Marriott Rewards member or high-roller which unfortunately I am neither. Check-in is at 3pm and they could not give me the room earlier.

While it has not altered my perception towards apartment rentals, JW Macau has proven that hotels too are able to provide very thoughtful service when all functions and teams of the hotel are aligned in their commitment towards ensuring the best possible stay for their guests.  It is an understatement to stay that JW Macau far exceeded our expectations in every possible way, and as another reviewer mentioned, I would also give them 15 stars if I could.  Most of all, all of the services rendered were never once requested by us, which is a testament to‚Ä¶",50
"We arrived hotel earlier than the check in time. So the customer service rep Cat advised us to take the lunch in the shopping mall first. And she also gave us some dining coupons. She was really nice with sincere service attitude. After lunch, we were served by another staff - Hugues. He was very helpful and proactive to offer assistant to find a higher floor's room.    As a Marriott Rewards member, the hotel has upgraded our room with the waterpark  view. We appreciated it. The view was great and the room was very spacious and comfortable. And we love the waterpark. It'as great fun. Strongly recommend people to stay in this hotel.",50
"I stayed at JW Marriott Macau for a conference. It was just fantastic!  The room was the best 'hotel room' I ever had, great size, floor to ceiling window overlooking the Galaxy complex, amazing bathroom, comfortable bed. Turndown service was excellent and I got a small hand written card from the room attendant called Hem (he was from Nepal, I believe) saying that he also noticed my early morning coffee habits and that he wished me a great stay, I was touched.  Leading up to the stay the help of their Guest Services, namely here Samantha, with the ferry ticket from HK airport, took away so much worry from me, absolutely great, thank you! Plus, the ever present and professional Rosamond Lau was amazing!  Thank you all, I had a great stay!",50

"We, a couple, stayed one night in JW Marriott. The hotel is, as all hotels in this area, huge...however except during the rush hours of breakfast, we didn't feel the crowds in the hotel. The rooms were well designed and very spacious. Service and cleanliness was superb. From. The hotel you can reach all major attractions (Cotai area) by foot.  Hotel provides free ferry port and airport transfers to and from.  ",50
"This is our second visit to JW Marriott Macau and it just gets better every time! The service and the room design is at its peak. The rooms and bathrooms are so big, you just won't want to leave it. In addition to the Grand Resort Desk, JW has there own private swimming pool and fully heated jaccuzi. The pool side food and drinks are also amazing and reasonably priced for a 5 star hotel. We have tried many different hotels in Macau cotai but JW is by far the best! ",50

"Stayed here with my family (2 boys, ages 13 and 8, plus husband) in an Executive Lounge room. You pay much more for an Executive room, compared to the standard room rate, but the Executive room gives you complimentary access to a buffet breakfast, afternoon tea, and a buffet dinner (they don't call it dinner, but there is so much food you could easily make it dinner). Unfortunately the room is the same as any other standard room... you are paying for access to the lounge and the buffets.  Pros: Pool access. This is really the only ""pro"" given the high price. The Grand Resort Deck is shared by all the hotels that surround it, but you have an amazing lazy river, 3 huge water slides, a wave pool, and the hotel pool itself. Kids love it. Would be nice if there was more lounge‚Ä¶",30

Also, Hotel provided full set of amenities which were lovely to me.  On the other hand, I have some comment to the front desk staff who checked in for me, I knew every hotel has their own check in procedure or target which including up-selling & member application. I actually not really interested in those program so I turned down the staff.  The staff was polite and helpful before the said matter, however, he scowled his face from a smile for the rest of registration and we really shocked for his reaction.

"I stayed here a few nights with my best friend. We were upgraded to a very spacious room overlooking the Galaxy Grand Deck. The fittings were excellent, and the bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept on. Toilet was fantastic with an excellent shower pressure. Towels were a bit on the thin side for such a property, I would have expected more plush towels. Working in the industry in SEA I know that housekeeping is hands down the hardest working department of any hotel, and while the general cleanliness was really really good, I did find a few pieces of old rubbish in places that no one would generally look.

One of the most incredible breakfasts I have ever eaten IN MY LIFE at Urban Kitchen was included.  Seriously indulgent.  The lounge also had afternoon tea with sandwiches and treats, then full bar with enough food for the evening reception that they set place mats and place settings expecting people to chow down, and put out enough food for it to serve as a complete dinner meal.

In between there is a large shopping mall with all the modern comforts.  Requested for early check in and late check out. Front desk mgr Eden was warm and accomondating. Supv Gloria, Urban Kitchen, was fabulous and made me feel at-home.  Why the one-star? you may ask.  After check out, I had to for my ride. Feeling tired, I sat down in the lobby and closed my eye to rest.  Let me emphasize, I was sitting upright, not snoring or sleeping.  A security personel, Tin, told me that I was not allowed to rest in the lobby.  I explained to him that I just checked out, implying I am not loitrring.

"This was a fantastic hotel in the Galaxy complex. Although it is a huge building, none of the service standards were lost. We greeted immediately upon entry and escorted to the executive lounge by a friendly face.   Our room wasn't quite ready yet but very graciously they offered to upgrade us to a suite. It was huge!! The beds were comfortable, the amenities were of a high standard, the view was gorgeous.   It is a little off the main strip but apart from that little thing I would definitely stay there again.",50

"Opt for a club level room. We stayed in a club level suite. We requested the highest floor available prior to arrival. The suite was on a high floor, 30 something at the end of the hallway. Ask for the suite at the end of the hallway that takes up both sides of the hallway. One side is the bedroom, and the other the living room, with the bathroom in the middle. The club level rooms include access to the club lounge,  breakfast is amazing, and includes both western and eastern breakfast.  The lounge is open all day and serves High Tea in the afternoon, and drinks in the evening, all complementary. Also complementary bottled water is available in the lounge all day.

You don't need to leave the Galaxy property at all. The only thing is i think its a bit overpriced compared to the others in the cotai area. But would stay here again.",40
This hotel has a very big room with all beautiful set up especially toilet that separate shower room and toilet room. Amenities were good. Location is also very good and can walk few minutes to Taipa Old Village (the tourist attraction in Macau). ,40

The supervisor miss JeN is always smiling and endlessly care to attend to any wishes.a team like this make all visitors want to be there ,50
"The hotel is a nice addition to the existing portfolio of hotels in Macau. Adjacent to its sister hotel under the same company, Ritz Carlton Macau, the hotel's design and finish somewhat similar to that of the Ritz-Carlton. The hotel's design included nice and ideal features and there was a plenty of evidence to show that the designer had given thought about what today's travelers need in a hotel room. Had lunch (buffet) at coffee shop and the food selection and service was excellent.  However I am not without criticism for the management's consideration.   1. I had a breakfast at the Executive Lounge which was just huge and looked a bit clinically cold and food selection was somewhat limited. I also used the Lounge for a drink at Happy Hour and the choice of beverages was‚Ä¶",50

And for those with an eye for quality, you‚Äôll love it. The swimming pools are amazing as is the abundance of shopping and dining opportunities. I arrived to Macau for a conference thinking it‚Äôs the Vegas of the East and I was very very wrong. The JW and indeed the adjoining Ritz Carlton are destinations unto themselves in which to indulge beautiful things. And I‚Äôm telling anyone standing still for more than a minute to go there. Thanks to all of the staff who so generously and graciously elevated my experience. Their pride is obvious and  I really can‚Äôt wait to return.",50

Kids have good fun during the 2-night stay in the hotel. Thanks Edel for upgrading us from the premier room to the executive room. We did not pay extra for the lounge access as we wanted to try out quite a lot of restaurants in Taipa.  The room is itself is spacious and the view is stunning. Our room overlooks the whole galaxy resort. The staff that we encountered are all very nice and helpful. My daughters (aged 5 and 9) love the hotel so much as they always complained for the oversized slippers and bathrobe in some other hotels. They eventually can get the right sizes of them in Marriott.  There are several swimming pools inside Marriott.

We had booked the executive lounge and so we could use the lounge facilities which included a breakfast, afternoon tea set and dinner in the lounge.   The checking in process at the lounge was a great experience as we could access a complimentary early check in by Inga who was super friendly. Thank you!  Rooms were on the 28 floor which were very spacious and consisted of 2 big double beds, a huge bathroom with a bath and shower, the complimentary toiletries were excellent and even included mouthwash & toothpaste and brush, enjoy the little things in life ;)   The lounge itself was made pleasant by the lounge team especially‚Ä¶",40

"Luxurious large sized bedrooms with advanced technologies, this was one of the nicest hotels we have ever been in Asia. Absolutely no complaint at all except for the faint smell of cigarette and funny perfume. However the Galaxy Complex is full of casinos and not a good place for young kids. They have a large (really large) water fun park on the deck level to compensate this. The shopping area was sufficient for our souvenir shopping.",40
"Large is the common theme here.  This must be the largest JW Marriott in the world.  It is part of the Galaxy complex, which also includes 4 other hotels.  There is a central casino that is connected to all the 5 hotels.  The executive suite was the largest room I've ever stayed in.  The service was outstanding, from Thomas Li, the Director of the Front Office, to Joan, assistant at the Executive Lounge, everyone worked so hard to impress.  If you have time, check out the lazy river and rapids in the large pool area.  It is like the Mandalay Bay on steroids.",50

We were upgraded at checkin - the view from the room was amazing (we have stayed at places all around the world, and this was one of the best). If you are booking - pay for the pool view.

The toilet had a heated seat (we liked that).  Reception was very friendly and eager to assist.   Our deal included 2 adult breakfasts- we paid extra for the children.

We were upgraded to an Executive Suite on the 31st floor and the room was absolutely stunning. It was simply luxury at its finest.   I would also like to mention that the Executive Lounge was the best I have ever experienced.  The evening hors d'oeuvres was more like dinner (eg roasted rack of lamb, dim sum, etc) and complimentary beer, wine and spirits. Breakfast was equally outstanding.   ",50
Just back from an excellent stay at the JW Marriott in Macau. This is our third stay here as a family and we booked the Retreat Pool suite which has over 2000 st feet of space including the pool and deck area. The communication from the staff at this hotel was outstanding especially from Sergio and Samantha from Guest relations. I was advised prior to my stay the suite was on a smoking floor (7th) which concerned me. The hotel took care of this professionally ensuring our rooms had air purifiers installed and were spotless and smoke free. There is a minor smoke smell when you exit the elevator but its hardly noticeable. With such a huge outdoor area I guessed most smokers would use this area to smoke rather than in the room. Housekeeping laid out roll out beds along with treats‚Ä¶,50
"I do not hold much confidence in staying in a casino area, generally everything is designed for gamblers. Not here, this place was a wonderful place to stay. Linen and amenities where first class, service is excellent. Internet and entertainment in the room was first class. The rooms are a great size, the bed was very comfortable and we had a great view. We visited 4 eating establishments whilst there, each one was first class, the executive lounge again was first class with a quality breakfast and afternoon teas service. In short if you appreciate quality and service, stay here.",50
"We stayed here over the Easter weekend with 2 other families. A special thanks to Sergio, Mabel and Inga for arranging everything, ensuring a hassle free and very relaxing stay! I would highly recommend the executive lounge, especially for families with children. We also enjoyed the world class outdoor pool facilities...everyone a great time!",50
We fell in love with this hotel! The check in/ housekeeping/ concierge staff were very helpful and friendly. We had a view of the Galaxy wave pool and it's an awesome view to see day or night. We had a two queen-bed room (believe it's called a Premiere room) and it was spacious and quite comfortable (family of 4). We got upgraded both with view and type of room - thank you! Small issues - squeaky bathroom door and a clicking sound from the a/c vents on and off during the night. Only heard these late at night when rest of family was asleep otherwise am sure JW could've fixed them.,50

Just to clarify (as I could not find this information beforehand) the lounge is on the second floor of the hotel, overlooking the lobby.

This time we stayed at the JW Marriott and we were very pleasantly surprised by how much we enjoyed the stay.  Some highlights: a)  my wife and I don't gamble and would like to stay as far away from the casino floor as possible, and the layout of this hotel easily allows this illusion - in fact unless you went searching for it, you wouldn't come across the casino at all which was great for us.   b)  we had a room on the 22nd floor with a view of the hotel pools and it was great.

Numerous slides and a lazy river that must go on close to 1KM... My kids did not join me on this trip but I stopped by the kids club anyway and it was great also.

This hotel is everything a JW stands for and so much more! I am not sure if there is one bad comment I could make. The rooms are spacious and luxurious while the pools are relaxing and tranquil.

We arrived in time for afternoon tea at the executive lounge, and the service was excellent. I'd like to acknowledge Giselle at the lounge, she was very friendly and hospitable. The afternoon tea food was good, but not outstanding; the dinner buffet was better, there's sushi, Chinese, some western items, and an open bar. The hotel is situated conveniently connected to the galaxy promenade and casino where there are plenty of shops and restaurants. It's also a very close 15-20 minute walk to the Venetian. We mostly enjoyed the hotel and the lounge as our stay in Macau was short. ",50
"Went there last week for anniversary celebration but I was pretty much disappointed with the service. I've encountered with some unexpected problems with some special requests before arrival. Although everything was fixed but still the explanation from their side was unacceptable. Besides, I asked for a turn down service and some amenities before I went out during my stay and I went back to my room more than an hour later to found that everything was not done and things were not delivered. This was pretty disappointed tho as I have to called again to have the things delivered and turn down service done when I'm inside the room. However, there's one staff at the front desk, Ms. Ciccy who help me with the check in procedure. She was very friendly and arranged a room with excellent‚Ä¶",40
"The entire staff at both food areas, the urban kitchen and the executive lounge were amazing in their care and knowledge and anticipation of our needs. Specifically I would like to mention Gina the cook, the best tasting food.  Jessel, Jen, Qing, Mom, Joan, Forest (Forshung), Jeffery from UK and so many others and zings in EL .    Also Adel in the checking in area. I love the hotel and the rates are reasonable . All desk staff in the EL.   Excellent in all respects ",50
"I stayed at the hotel for 3 nights with my 2 young daughters (5 and 7) before heading to Hong Kong Disneyland Hotel.  Wife was busy and I had to handle two of them by myself.  What a feat for me!  I have previously reviewed this hotel in May 2016 during my business trip and the stay was not very pleasant.  However, the stay this time round with my daughters was much better.  I stayed in the twin room located on one of the higher floors facing the pool. The children were impressed with the view from the room and they like to sit at the window ledge looking at people swimming in the rain.  I wondered why the children don‚Äôt look at people swim when they are at home when there is a pool downstairs as well. Ha ha.  The bad weather during our stay at hotel meant that the children were‚Ä¶",40
"I cannot praise this hotel highly enough. The journey from port to hotel was seamless using the free shuttle bus service. The staff throughout the hotel could not have been more helpful. The room (executive suite) was fantastic with great views over the Galaxy pool deck.   The executive lounge was the best I have been in. The food was varied and fresh with plenty of space to relax and drink. The staff here went the extra mile to make sure our stay was a great one. The Marriott pool and galaxy deck was brilliant with a really long lazy river, massive beach with wave pool and 3 flumes (I actually thought the mildest slide was the most thrilling). There are also plenty of restaurants to drink in or grab a snack. Whilst we were there we watched a show at the broadway theatre which‚Ä¶",50
"We stayed for 4 nights in JW Marriott Macau and every night is beyond wonderful. The hotel staffs are very hospitable, assisting us from our shuttle to food to even shopping needs. They say mainlaind chinese people can be curt and rough but i found NONE in this hotel.   I highly recommend this hotel for family as they do not have casino situated inside the JW Marriott hotel. Upon request, they will even provide special amenities for our children aged 4 and 6. They have everything from kids-friendly shampoo and soap to hotel slippers and even kids' bath robe. Our children absolutely love staying there! And their pools are amazing, it is absolutely beyond words. Many selections of pool, from rapid water, wave pool, heated pool, slides etc.  I have just left the hotel but i cannot‚Ä¶",50
"Second stay in JW Marriott Hotel Macau and the staff at the Executive Lounge still kept up with my expectations of being one of the best in service, with special mention to Inga, Matthew and Felix.  And of course not to mention the well maintained rooms that keep you wanting to stay inside, chill out and relax but eventually have to peel away from it just to be out exploring the mix of new and old of Macau.",50
I got another stays with my parents at JW Marriott Macau in January 2017. We meet Ms Joan again and she still provided a excellent service to us. Deeply thanks for her again.  Our room located at the top floor of the hotel. Everything inside the room are perfect. We love it!  My Parent's room was on 21/F facing the pool with a nice view!   Thanks again for hotel's arrangement as we are all satisfied with our stay in JW Marriott Macau  We will certainly come back again,50
The Marriott is in the Galaxy hotels. There are free shuttles which we could use to get to the airport and other casinos.   The rooms were very luxurious. The bathrooms were very clean. They had a TV in the mirror which you can watch while brushing!!  The hotel is connected to the galaxy casino and shopping mall. So there was a large selection of restaurants too.   The breakfast had a lot of varieties and the taste was good... but nothing I would miss when I get home...  The most memorable thing about my stay was the service.. it was excellent. Everyone always stops for a chat. They were very attentive. Always ready to help.. The waiters at the breakfast were great. Housekeeping staff did a good job too.. ,50
"A luxury hotel with top service .  This hotel is one of the six hotels in the Galaxy Casino complex. The convenience of being close to high end restaurants, shops, food court and cinema without stepping out of the complex is an extra bonus on top of the very friendly service of all members of the staff in particular the staff at the Executive Lounge.",50
"Sorry for our late review here! Me and husband spent a wonderful time in JW Marriot Macau. It was my 30th birthday celebration + the first birthday after our marriage + our honeymoon!!!  Check in was quite busy but they gave us a welcome drink! Receptionist Icey checked us in and she was so kind to upgrade our room to a suite! We got so excited with our room (also on a very high floor too!) It was massive and very comfortable! They arranged me a birthday cake (even mentioned it was my 30th birthday!!) I just loved it! We joined the hotel package which was MOP 400 per pax for tea set, early dinner, happy hour and breakfast. We found it very valuable. I do have to highlight the breakfast. Brayan served us and he made sure we got what we needed. He was so energetic and always‚Ä¶",50
"We stayed 3 nights at JW Marriott Macau. I can say it was one of the best hotels I've ever stayed.They upgraded our booking to a higher floor room with resort view and the room was quite big with excelent room service , they provided everything we needed in a few minutes. The best part was breakfast at the Urban kitchen with wide variety of food and super superfriendly staff , many thanks to Gloria and Brayan at urban kitchen , they really tried their best to make our stay much more enjoyable. The gym was well equipped , Also the pool and resort area were clean and beautiful. As the weather was rainy and a bit cold , we were able to use the waterpark only for one day but it was great overall.  Generally , I highly recommend this hotel and will definitely choose this hotel again‚Ä¶",50
"I liaised with Melody, Samantha and Maisie a week before i check in by email and telephone in relation to my special request and order in-room dinner. Their prompt responses and kind attitude impress me so much! Ivy is the staff who serviced us at check-in counter, she saw the remark and helped me to keep secret of the surprise to my husband and helped us to upgrade the guest room! Antonio and Nick sent in-room dinner to us and keep singing birthday song and being so cheerful. I thank you all for this delightful memory.",50
"Stayed from March 13th to 15th and had an excellent vacation. We were pleasantly surprised by an upgrade to an executive suite room with connecting doors to our second room, a very luxurious treat!   We traveled with two nine year old girls and enjoyed the fabulous pools in the Galaxy complex, both delighted when given mini robes and slippers for their use. The Kids Club was also very handy for the rainy day that unfortunately kept us away from the pools.   All hotel staff were very helpful and pleasant, always willing to help with a smile! We would love to come back to have another perfect vacation at the Marriott Galaxy at Macau.",50
I came on Friday.  Room charge is reasonable. Room is very spacious for 2 people. Great view and room is clean too. Make sure you are in a room of even number which is with better view.  Only thing I don't like is the hotel is too big. Like those in Las Vegas.,40

"This is my first time visit Macau. It was really bad experience when I deal with the taxi driver when we just landing. He tried to get the wrong direction and charge triple price. When we finally arrive to the hotel. I asked the door man help us to call the police, after few seconds I guess the hotel security lady Ms. Rong come out and try to help us to talk to the taxi driver. After all we still pay for two times more than the original price. So watch out everyone in the future don't trust the taxi driver! After all these drama we walk in to the hotel and try check in our luggages first and Andrew was the one help us. Andrew heard what just happened he try to apologize first. I'm very surprise it's not his fault at all. But he just want people who first time come visit here‚Ä¶",50
"It is my first time staying at JW Marriott. I was very impressed by the staff here. They are very nice. The lady at check-in counter was very patient. I like her smily face and her professional and polite attitude. She provided a lot of useful information of the hotel and malls, latest promotions and transport to other tourist spots. The room we are staying at is executive room which is so great in terms of bath room facilities, room size the view! I just like JW Marriott this brand and will definitely choose it next time!",50
"First off, the rooms in JW Marriott Macau was very nice. However, the experience we had in our 2-day stay in this hotel very not good at all.   This is a booking for our 10 year anniversary celebrations with our friends and families, we have booked 4 rooms and one of them being the retreat pool suite connecting with the Jacuzzi studio suite. We originally wanted to book Presidential Suite as it gives more space but reservation suggested that since we have less than 15 people, the sizes of both suites together that we booked will meet our needs of having a gathering, and she was right, it was good size and had what we originally wanted.   Prior to checking in the room, I still want to know the presidential suite offered rate and expected to have a better offer upon the day of‚Ä¶",10

"The hotel was a welcomed sanctuary from the maddening crowds and long queues at the Macau airport.  On arrival, we were immediately helped with our bags and whisked to the Executive Lounge where we were offered drinks while we waited to check-in. As a Platinum member, we were grateful to Joan for arranging the suite upgrade and the efforts she made to fulfill our various requests, including securing a shower chair for us when none was available. We also wish to commend Jun, and especially Grace and Rommel of the Housekeeping team who did a wonderful job keeping our suite spotless and ensuring that we had fresh fruit and amenities every day.  We also liked the little notes and greetings that they left for us after they had serviced the room, a first for us in all of our hotel‚Ä¶",50
"The JW Marriott Macau has remained to be one of the best hotels I have stayed in the world, for one reason, Mr. Norman Yanon.  Norman has once again exceeded my expectation comparing to any other hotels I have stayed in.   On the day of my check in, Norman was off duty.  I left a message with the switchboard, not expecting anyone to give me a ring back.  Norman made the initiative to make contact with me with me during his time outside of work (totally unexpected).  When he has contacted me, he already knew I was going to arrive and looked into my booking, anticipating all my needs before I even said a word. . Having stayed at the hotel multiple times, Norman is the reason what makes JW Marriott Macau such as exception hotel.  I would have no hesitation in recommending the JW‚Ä¶",50

The hotel is gorgeous.  The food was great.  The staff were so gracious. Everything you need is on the Galaxy property.  The room upgrade was amazing - corner suite with a view.  The bathroom alone was spa like.  The weather wasn't great so we didn't visit the pool.  Will definitely be back next time we are in the Macau/ Hong Kong area.,50
"I spent the last weekend with family by booking an executive floor room. Out of our disappointment, both the service and hardware of the hotel are deteriorating:-  1. The hotel has a Japanese type of flushing toilet but it didn't work. When you presses the button, it made the sound but no water came out and it simply didn't work.  2. The room is non-smoking one but it smelled second hand smoke. We were with our child and it irritated us.   3. When we asked for an extra blanket for the night, the answer was no. They only had a big towel and either you like it or leave it.  4. During the morning breakfast, the table was not set and when you asked for a knife and fork, you were being ignored by 2-3 different staff and finally after persistently raised my hand and walked up to a‚Ä¶",20

"The front desk service was friendly and professional. Our room was on 17th floor with a beautiful view. The room was very spacious and clean. The hotel location is convenient. Walking distance to the restaurants, coffee shops and stores. This hotel offers free shuttle bus from/to the airport.",50
Would recommend for those who wants to enjoy gambling... casinos are just on the ground floor. Lots of good restaurants in the neighborhood... 10 minutes by taxi to the nice center of Macau. Convenient also to take ferry to Shenzhen (and Hong Kong). ,50
"The best hotel I have ever stayed in and I have stayed in many. Could not get more helpful staff especially Darryl from the gym who was so helpful in showing us around and explaining the hotel facilities. The hotel is so grand in every way. Could not get any better. Best kids club, the kids won't want to leave. It even has a kids hairdressing salon. Wonderful staff in there.",50
"The hotel provided friendly services and nice breakfast quality ,the interior is also very creative and marvelous .but the room which i stayed is not that clean enough to be a luxury hotel ,i saw the food and water  remaining leisions on the mini bar table ,on the table of washbasin and also the shower room.",50
"In city that can lack style,  the Marriott just impressed.  The staff seemed genuinely helpful,  the room,  food and service exceptional and I wanted for nothing on my short stay. Fair rates and my first choice when back in Taipa. ",50
"I suppose JW Marriott will be a nice hotel providing friendly service and the room hotel restaurants would be nice also. It seems that this hotel services was under JW Marriott service quality as the staff was not care about handing customers who were not following the queue for check in. Also, since it is a large hotel offering a lot of room, their check in counter was extremely small which resulted a long queue for checking in and out. Well, I hope Marriott could consider adding some portable counter to handing check in or check out request during rush hour. Thank You",30

I'll give a special mention to some people -  Steven who checked us in - He was great with his suggestions and he made us smile with his charming personality.  I'll look forward to hopefully being checked in with him again. Hugo and Kumar also assisted us at Concierge desk and saved us time by giving us the best suggestions.  We will be back , 10/10!",50

I received an email from Joan in the concierge lounge asking if we had any special requests. During our conversations, she sent me a picture of the airport courtesy coach that we should catch when we arrived.

"I'm amazed at all the positive reviews - yes the service and hotel design is nice but this is not enough for an ""excellent"" review. I've stayed in many JW Marriott's across the globe and this is the worst. The food is simply terrible! Limited breakfast choice and not even good quality. One night the hotel dropped something to my room at midnight - WTF! My apology was an $11 bottle of wine that went down the toilet. The Chinese restaurant is so so but limited typical Cantonese style that westerners would eat. Slow check in process but good shops located near by and free wifi. With so many choices I would stay elsewhere!  Very disappointed ",10
"Having stayed in a number of hotels in Macau, Marriott has become my newfound favourite for its elegant room design and personal service.  Pros:  - Spacious room and bathroom; tastefully decorated. TV in the bathroom is a nice touch - Comfortable bed and pillows - No casino on the premises which is a great plus for travelers who are not into gaming - SUPERB personal service: all staff are super friendly. Alex at the reception was swift, super-helpful, offered me a room upgrade, and ensured my needs are met (great job Alex); same for Billy at the lobby lounge who went beyond his call of duty to fix an issue with the afternoon tea set I ordered.

"After staying at the JW Marriott in Macau, it will be quite difficult to stay at any other hotels because the staff here have set the standards so high! As soon as I arrived, I was taken to the executive lounge where we were helped by Matthew. We were very impressed by his professionalism as he went above and beyond to ensure our stay was smooth and comfortable. For instance, while we were waiting to check into our room, he offered us with afternoon tea and explanation around the area.   Other staff at the lounge were equally as friendly and helpful. My fianc√©e and I will make sure we stay here everytime we visit! ",50

As we are Marriott Platinum Elite members, we had complimentary use of the Executive Lounge, which is definitely a perk with complimentary breakfast, afternoon tea, and evening canapes and cocktails.   The staff at the Exeutive Lounge were amazing, very attentive and far exceeded ""regular"" Marriott standards with their 6-star service.",50

Starting off great service was given when we arrived with a free shuttle bus to the hotel directly from the ferry terminal in Macau. From there staff at the hotel were kind and told us about the breakfast, lunch and diner options, told us about wifi and how to get around.  Up to the room and the corridors are very large and the bedroom is very very big. With great views looking over the rest of the resort.   The bedroom came with plenty of water around 4 just for the bedroom and 2 in the bathroom. Alongside this free Nespresso's in the bedroom.

We did not take up the offer of the use of the Lounge as it was nothing impressive.  The room was clean and well equipped. We had a room view of the resort and also Hengqin (part of China).

Unfortunately, the same issue seems to happen every time regardless of the feedbacks (and I did so in a nice and polite way) given.

Every time I stayed here, I asked for two double beds in a non-smoking room and reconfirmed multiple times to ensure the booking is correct.  However, at the most recent stay, they once again made the same mistake and gave me a smoking room with king-size bed.

I wanted to buy the glutinous rice cake from JW Marriott. Ms Elsie tried to help me. However, there was no stock anymore. I looked very disappointed, so she tried to comfort me. I felt very touched and warm.  Ms Elsie was very attentive to our needs. My friend and I could feel very welcome when dining in The Lounge.

Their kind and helpful recommendations were so appreciated and they were simply wonderful people to meet",50
"The hotel is situated in a group of hotels in Cotai, Macau. It could be said to be a residential area rather than a hotel. In the room, the hotel provides all sort of amentities you can think of that you would not find anything you were lacking.   For the environment, the room I stayed is facing the swimming facilities of the group of hotels. In addition, I could have the view of the newly developed WangKum on the opposite side of the river. The view is marvellous.  Since the hotels are on top of a really large shopping arcade that linking up more than five hotels, it is a paradise for shoppers. If you want to have some gaming, there are more than 3 big casinos nearby.  One thing I would like to mentioned is that as my Marriott Rewards account was having problem to access, I‚Ä¶",50
The staff was was incredibly gracious and professional. They were so helpful and accommodating.. Vincent ( Room Service) and Joan ( from Concierge) were FABULOUS!!! Thank you so much for all your help!!!,50
"Absolutely spacious room, modern and new. Hotel located in the best casino in Macau. Executive lounge food can almost pass for dinner, albeit a lack of main dishes. Highly recommended hotel. In winter, the enormous outside pool area is closed, but the indoor pool is good and the gym great. No need to get hotel breakfast (if you do not have club lounge access). The adjacent shopping mall has 2 great breakfast places within 2 minutes walking distance: A high-end bakery and a Starbucks.",50
"The hotel has a great view of the Cotai Macau. It is connected with the GALAXY Mall. The room is spacious, modern feel, and warm ambiance. Bathroom is large, easy to move around.  The room is equipped with at least 4x USB ports for charging in total. The TV is perfectly situated against the bed/s.   Wifi is free, though there is an available cable for wired connection.   Large check-in counter.  overall, it always provides me a great experience and will definitely continue to stay.",50
Just a short review..  Its a wow hotel with grand resort..  Recommendly..  I have assisted with lovely filipino.  Rafael from bell..  Thanks for familiarization to this very beautiful venue..  Im very satisfied with check in.  And very accommodate..  The room is v clean. And the view is superb..  ,50
"As expected of the new Cotai Strip a big glitzy 5 star hotel, however the wonderfully warm individual service was a standout. Traveling alone with 2 children was a breeze in this hotel, wonderful buffet breakfast, excellent large clean rooms with outstanding bathroom. The outdoor pools are heated and we swam on both days in mid winter.. I especially loved the attitude of restaurant supervisor in the evening, who when my 2 yo look very tired, suggested I ordered the pizza that my son wanted and she would arrange it to be deliveree to the room, even though pizza is not standard on the in room dining menu... little touches that make a big difference... thank you.. we will return when the large Galaxy Swimming rapids are open.. looks like a lot of fun!",50
"By far one of the best Marriotts I've ever stayed in.  The executive lounge at this hotel tops any Ive ever experienced.  As a platinum member I stay at a lot of Marriotts.   The staff from the lounge made this trip amazing  When we arrived at the ferry terminal there was a gentleman waiting with our name on a sign.  He took my luggage and walked us to the bus which went straight to Galaxy    (Don't bother with a taxi or private driver - the bus was perfect).  He told us to wait for the 3rd stop which was the JW Marriott and Ritz Carlton.     When we arrived 2 gentlemen from the Executive lounge were waiting for us at the door and took us directly to our rooms.  There were 5 of us so I reserved 2 rooms.  One for my husband, son and I and the other for my mother and daughter.  As‚Ä¶",50
"JW Marriott always provide execllent service. Nice room, nice people, nice food. I can see how strictly they control the service quality. Comparing the Marriott Hong Kong, JW Marriott Macau could provide better experience for me.",50
"Booked JW marriott macao this time, the official rate is much higher than other agencies, so I apply for a claim on BRG and was replied within 24hrs with a successful approval. Good start.  Checked-in in the members counter (gold member) and was greeted sincerely. Agent is prompt and responsive. Get pre-upgraded to executive suite! What a surprise! But the floor level is relatively low. (16/f) which is nearly the lowest of the hotel. Anyway, it is fine and not to grumble much as we are already upgraded.  Suite was spacious with separated living room and bedroom. Guest toilet is also available in the room entrance foyer. The view is overlooking the grand deck resort however, it is close because of the winter season.   Nespresso coffee machine is also available. Overall amenities‚Ä¶",50
"It's my first time to stay in JW Marriott Hotel Macau. Staff were efficient & polite in Concierge during check in & check out . They also offered  me late check out at 12pm. The room was clean & nice . However an hour after we entered the room , a man came & wanted to check the mini bar . Arround 1 hour later , a lady came & wanted to checked the mini bar again ! On the day we checked out , at arround 11:30 , a lady ""pang ""on our room door & yelled. She said she want to make up our room. She did not know the concierge had offered us to checked out at 12:00 pm. The most unacceptable was she yelled at me in such an impolite way . I had made a complaint in the concierge with my email left for them but no reply! There are so many new 5 star hotel in Macau, its not worth to stay in‚Ä¶",10
"Situated at the Galaxy complex this hotel is within walking distance to the old Cotai village. So there is a convenience to explore outside casinos, good food, shopping and entertainment.  The hotel is slightly over one year old, so it is new fairly new. Service is good. I like the buffet restaurant too.",50
"An absolutely fabulous weekend!! It was beyond our expectations. Before the stay, I asked about the special setup the hotel could do for stay with children and the hotel emailed back saying they'd try their best to accomplish. When we checked in, served by this Front Desk Officer, Edel (a very happy smiley guy) greeted us and confirmed it was all set up. My children were thrilled to have this tent in the room and they had so much fun. The room view was spectacular and amenities were all set (have to say the slippers were so comfortable!), and the only minor thing was not having a rubbish bin in the bathroom which didn't seem to make sense. The room decor was not very Marriott (rather Mainland Chinese like) - gold and grand and flashy. Children had a great time at the kids club‚Ä¶",50
"Brand new Hotel, amazing rooms and view. Relaxing poolarea and casino.  Very clean and top management.  The executive club service is amazing. You get all you need, they book all you tickets, flights, ferry, etc.  A little overpriced for Macau.",50
"Seriously the best hotel in Macau, stayed in quite a number of hotels here but JW Marriott is always excellent. Rooms are super clean, amenities are top notch and the service is always super good. Quaint and quiet within the hotel but excellent range of cafes and shops just around the corner. This is easily my favorite hotel. Had a mix-up in my in-room dinner dining and the staff were very apologetic and offered a complimentary fruit platter. Excellent service.",50
Booked a room for less than $90 and this place is pretty new so that's a steal.   Rooms are super spacious and clean. Only problem was that they had a fridge but you can't use it freely. It's locked. I have no clue why too. Kind of weird. I called and asked and they told me they can come and unlock it though but still weird.   It's connected to another casino. You should probably head that side if you want something to eat. There's an eating area perfect for anyone who doesn't want to go far. ,50
"The staffs are very nice and the view is wonderful, bad thing was hard to get a taxi ..The grand duck is very nice, We really liked the room, it was well equipped, neat and very clean. We have an excellent view facing the pool side.",50
I was upgraded to the suite floor which was fabulous. In addition the lounge was spectacular with excellent food and beverage choices. We received excellent service from Jem Gadi among others. No  detail was too small for the entire staff.,50
"from December 7th through December 12th. Once again we were greeted warmly at check-in by the same concierge who greeted us on our prior visit in August 2016. Recognizing us, he immediately whisked us up to the 2nd floor where we were checked in at the Executive Level, by-passing the line up at the ground level, while we waited, we were served a delectable afternoon tea by your delightful servers. For the life of us we can't remember his name except for the fact that he is Filipino, this person is outstanding and thoroughly professional.   During our stay my wife and I received exemplary service from Inga, Joan and Eunice in the executive lounge. This went on day after day, we came to realize why we enjoy visiting here so much, it's the incredibly warm people who work here who‚Ä¶",50
"Overall a good JW Marriott experience at a relatively new property. This a good choice for families that would like to enjoy a stay in Macau that provides the conveniences of a casino-hotel but without a very hardcore gaming environment.  The hardware and service are certainly up to the JW standard, and rooms are still considerably clean and unpolluted (read: not cigarette-scented from years of smoker clientele who have little regard for rules). During the warmer months, the huge swimming facility includes a 'lazy river' that children would get thrilled over.  There is a children's room as well as a hair salon for children that we were very happy with. What we found unusual though was that the children's area was pay-to-play even for staying guests, and an adjacent video arcade‚Ä¶",40
"Excellent hotel. Upgraded to a suite due to my SPG membership. Check in was a bit difficult as one staff member said the room would be ready in 45mins (early checkin 10am I notified the hotel in advance) , however we were not able to check in until 3pm (regular time) after another staff member said there was some mistake.   The only other issue is the limited variety of food at the executive lounge. Its the same food everyday there. However the service was great and hotel was very nice, up to JW standard.",50
"We got upgraded to executive floor, the room is huge and has very nice amenities.  Friendly & helpful service.  The environment is nice & quiet since there is no casino in this hotel. Free shuttle from the ferry, very convenient.",50
"Well, this is a five star hotel will I recommend to others. There is a free shuttle bus and staff is very helpful. The room is luxurious and the pool view from 28th floor was amazing. Food from room service is great from a budget price but service is awesome.   A lot of helpful staff will greet you at the lobby but one is of that staff named Rafael from lobby host make a mark from me i want to thank him for helping us to save my time, during my stay all the information from hotel and facilities that will save our time. From our luggage to depart. Very Friendly staff.  Check in and check out is very smooth mangers from the lobby help us",50
"My wife and our four year old stayed for two days during 2016 Christmas and had absolutely fabulous time because of excellent guest services given by JW staff, special mention to Cliff and Moj, who treated us like family and took care of all our needs (specially being Vegetarians we had strict food requirements). JW Macau is 10/10 for us and we would love to come back to enjoy the pool services that we couldn't due to winter time... love you guys!!!",50
"The service since we checked in ; our stay and check out is very impressive.  The relationship manager ; staff especially Mr.Kumar has made our stay very pleasant . They all show care and ready to serve. The room is very good , clean and spacy . We will certainly come back . ",50
"Check in was a swift. The room's design was ok, but I was surprised that the bathroom's door could not be properly closed - likely that it wasn't installed properly and creates sharp noises and causes a deep scratch on the marble floor. This happened to both rooms I have booked.   Furniture was with relatively sharp edges so beware if you're staying with kids. Breakfast is at the restaurant which connects to the mall and offers typical buffet breakfast of a 5-star hotel but nothing special.  Our room had the view of the water fountain of Galaxy Complex which was nice :)  I stayed at Ritz-Carlton next to JW Marriott the night before moving to JW Marriott and it was during Chinese New Year so the prices were equally expensive, Ritz was slightly more expensive but it wasn't a big‚Ä¶",30
"I love this restaurant very much. Honestly, there are lots of good restaurants in Macau but Urban kitchen is the only one that I will come back very soon. Other than the quality of food, the service of the staffs are excellent. Especially Jeffery. He is so kind and cheerful that makes everyone enjoy the good time during the beverage. ",50
"I love this property. It's grouped with other luxe hotels at a major recreational site in Macau. It's easy to reach from the airport or ferry terminal and offers free shuttles to all of the casino facilities.   My stay was nothing short of fantastic. I was awed by the bright, golden entrance and after riding 30+ floors to my suite, my eyes widened greater still. The well appointed suite with 65"" flat panel TVs, spacious living and sleeping quarters, and one of the best bathrooms I've experienced in years of travel combine for an unparalleled experience. Noteworthy was the tub for a relaxing soak.  A nearly full room service menu until the late hours is also a desirable feature. ",50
"What a great experience.  We had a 2 day 1 night trip from Hong Kong to visit Macau, and it was amazing.  I am a gold member and got a big upgrade and was treated like royalty.  Simply amazing.  I really wish I knew it was going to be that good before, we would have stayed much longer.  Thanks again!",50
"1st time stayed here and overall we were very pleased with the hotel.  I travel as monthly basis so it is very important for me to have a hotel feel like home.     The room is great and my family especially enjoyed the pools very very much.    Executive lounge is great too and special shout out to the staff there, they are extremely helpful while we had some issues about my husband's passport.   This hotel is definitely a very good choice for Macau!  ",50
"Luxurious, clean, great location! The staff were all friendly and hospitable - particularly Saurav who went out of his way to learn our needs/interests and to ensure that our stay was enjoyable and our time was maximised. Will definitely return.",50
"This hotel is withing the galaxy hotel complex. The standard rooms are spacious! Complete with the standard 5stars amenities given. The pools are great, it has a kids pool with a slide. However the pools are not connected to the pools at the Galaxy hotel. Family friendly hotel with a good kids club provided. Breakfast spread is good and delicious. Withing walking distance to the Venetian. ",50
"The hotel ambience, amenities and rooms are definitely of a 5-star hotel standard, however, the staff need to be more attentive and service-oriented to their guests, especially those at concierge, bell service and doormen. Their demeanour show no interest in serving guests and are unenthused with working at the hotel, by not greeting guests with a happy smile, and a simple warm greeting is hard come by.  Their service is lacklustre, as we had dropped by the Hard Rock Hotel as a visitor and were assisted very well by the doormen there, who helped us tell the taxi driver where we wanted to go in mandarin, where the doormen at JW Marriott couldn't even open the taxi door for us when we left or arrived.  Breakfast spread remained the same each morning we were there, where most‚Ä¶",30

The counter staff (Lynn) is very kind and helpful that she arrange a room to us quickly and we can go up to our room earlier.  The room is very big with pool view, the wifi is free of charge in galaxy shopping mall and also in the guest room. The kids club is amazing and not very expensive in weekday and my kids are very happy in there.   The hotel location is good as it is close to taipa old town and boardway food street, you will never feel hungry as there are plenty of restaurant nearby.   ",50
"Second visit to this property, returned because of great experience for the first one.   First thumbs up must be given to Galaxy Macau which fits all free shuttle buses with free wifi, a very nice touch I must say.   Arrived at the hotel check in where a queue was present but it was our turn in no time. Was told by the check in staff that the rooms were not ready yet, but they offered to check us in for now and told us we could return later to retrieve the room keys without having to queue again, plus they prompted us to leave our bags at the left-luggage area.

So needless to say, the trip started off amazingly and only got better.  Extremely friendly / professional staff.  The folks in the executive club were outstanding, took care of all of our needs, to include getting our rooms ready for an early check in.  Additionally, one of the housekeepers noticed my son in a super-man outfit and left a nighttime towel animal and personalized note to ""baby super-man""....just goes to show their attention to detail and caring attitude.

We had a minor issue during check-in because of a system problem and were invited to their executive lounge while waiting for our room to be ready. As a Marriott Elite Member, we were upgraded to the Executive Room. The room is really huge and provided us with one of the most luxurious stay! Breakfast was included at the Urban Kitchen and we really enjoyed the great hospitalities that were accorded. We had the most memorable stay and we'll definitely be back...",50

"This is a stunning hotel that offers excellent service, modern decor and comfortable facilities. The rooms are luxurious and spacious,  with very comfortable beds which makes for a great nights sleep. The hotel is self sufficient and just as well because Macau is a very soulless place in my opinion.The Hotel boasts ample restaurants, pools, and shops are attached to the J W Marriot. In reality there is not a lot to do unless you like to gamble and for my money Vegas has more to offer. If it wasn't for my positive experience at the hotel it would have been a strange couple of days.

It's a part of the Galaxy Macau complex, where the Galaxy casino is accessible through the mall that connects it with the JW. For the most part, it's a quiet, modern and polished hotel that doesn't try to be a fake Venice or a fake Paris. I find those hotels to be really artificial and tired. The JW is also non-smoking. I'd add another star to the rating if i could.  My family and I stayed here for a quick vacation last weekend. Right from the start, we  were treated with the 5-star service you'd expect to find from a hotel of this calibre.

The bathroom was also spacious with a separate shower and bath tub, with the wc in a separate glass cubicle. Only minor gripe was that the door was heavy and the lock a bit clunky. I used the gym facilities. The equipment was all new and there was just enough space to do floor exercises. It's shared between the Ritz Carlton and the Marriott hotel. Unfortunately I wasn't able to try out the outdoor pool as‚Ä¶",50
"First time to stay in JW Marriott Macau, this is more than my expectation, all are very excellent and the staff are very nicely and very warm greetings, especially: Ms. Joan, before I am loyalty of Hilton Hotel, and always stay at Conrad hotel Macau, now I change my mind, Marriott is much better!",50
"We stayed at the JW Marriott Macau during the week for a short trip to Macau from Hong Kong.  We were picked up at the Taipa ferry terminal by the Galaxy Macau tour buses.  Interestingly the buses have free wifi as do the entire Galaxy property which includes the JW Marriott.  Very useful for a short trip.  The JW is the last stop for the Galaxy bus.  We arrived relatively quickly and went to the Executive Check In.  The check in was friendly and efficient and we were in our room very quickly.  We had a water view King bedroom.  Very large room with a nice sitting area, desk and king bed.  The large wall mounted TV greeted us upon arrival.  The rooms are very nicely appointed and spacious as noted before.  The bathroom has a water closet, nice shower and large soaker tub.  The‚Ä¶",50
"We stayed at JW Mariott last weekend with kid, we have booked two rooms.  The surrounding and room conditions are impressive.  The staff is nice, especially great courtesy from the Manager Henry. My kid just loves the 3rd floor playhouse. It is spacious & clean, it's definitely a good children place and it would be better if they would offer 2 days entries pass. I have found most in-room facilities are edged with round corners and henceforth the kids are kinda safe in running around the room. I will definitely come back again in my future Macau visits.",50
"First time to stay in JW Marriott Macau but we were already expecting pretty high on the stay here. However, it is still exceeding my expectation!  Being gold elite members, we are having check-in, check-out and dining in the lounge. All the staff here can remember us and provide warm services like sending a birthday cake to my room for my kid's birthday and even sang birthday song with another birthday cake during the second day morning's breakfast. Thanks to all staff in executive lounge! We will be back later",50
"JW Marriott is part of the Galaxy resort complex [Galaxy's own hotel, Banyan Tree, Ritz Carlton, Hotel Okura, and JW Marriott], We choose this hotet because of its location, far away from the casino, not so noisy in the lobby and other public area. It is definitely one of the most beautiful Marriotts, and I was told it is the largest in Asia. The room is spacious, clean. I like the round corner sofa. Bed and pillows were comfy.  During my check in, though it takes longer time than other hotels, the lady explained clearly that it is because my travel agent made the booking separately for two consecutive nights. Check out is quick and professional.  From my room, we could see a fabulous pool, and a resort river area. This time, we do not have enough time to enjoy it, let us try‚Ä¶",50
"We checked into the JW Marriott Macau on November 29, 2016 and it was our first trip to the property.  When we arrived, the staff at the lobby promptly greeted us and helped us with our luggage.  We checked in at the Executive Club.  Yourick T'Gilde helped us with our check-in and he took us to the room to show us the various functions at the room.  He really gave us the warm and welcoming feeling, a rare for hotels in Macau due to the casinos. The property was beautiful, one of the best I have stayed.  We had two suites.  The d√©cor was warm, the amenities was high standard and the bed was very comfortable. We had breakfast on the first floor Urban Kitchen.  The staffs and the Manager made us feel at home.  Great varieties, tasted great, especially the HK style milk tea.  We‚Ä¶",50
"Part of the Galaxy resort complex which houses Galaxy's own hotel, Banyan Tree, Ritz Carlton, Hotel Okura, and JW Marriott.  We opted for the Marriott since we are part of the Marriott rewards program.  It is definitely one of the most beautiful Marriotts we've ever stayed at.  The rooms are spacious, clean.  Bathroom has rain-shower heads, self opening bidets, soaking tub.  Bed was comfy as well.  Only complaint was that the room reeked of cigarette even though it was a non smoking floor.  But having stayed at Wynn Macau, we experienced the same problem, a lot of mainlander patrons that don't follow the non-smoking policies, so I'm guessing that all the rooms have smokey smells.  Besides that negative, all other aspects were great.  The customer service was excellent, we‚Ä¶",50
"Once again, the JW Marriott had exceeded my expectations.  I was thoroughly satisfied with all aspects of my visit.  The staff greeted me numerous times and they recognized me as soon as I walked in the door.  Because of my Platinum status, they immediately escorted me to the Executive Lounge for check in.  I love the attention to detail!  From there, the Executive Lounge staff continued to give me wonderful service throughout the service.  I would like to point out the Service I received from people like Jayson, Inga, Gem, and my buddy from Nepal Moj.  They made sure my stay was relaxing and they were very accommodating!    The rooms are fantastic!  Clean, big, and in a perfect location.  It is NOT as crowded as those hotels at Cotai.  It is SO MUCH better to stay at Galaxy and‚Ä¶",50

Our room was facing the pool and 2 large blocks of galaxy, the bed is quite comfortable, I love it very much, it's like silicon stick my body didn't want to leave bed. Great facilities at fitness center and top class pool, the fitness center shared with Ritz-Carlton, the staff beyond friendly and helpful, one of staff was help me last time I stay at Ritz-Carlton too, Mr.Warren is, he is very nice, very professional teacher for the each position work with the muscles in a different way, words can hardly express my gratitude to him, he got express verbally, professional skills and knowledge of Gym, actually I am a professional trainer too, all right, I hand it to him, he made me felt‚Ä¶",50
"I travel to Macau for leisure 1-2 times per year and this is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed so far.  I was upgraded from Deluxe Room to Premier Room during check-in.  From the website, the main difference between the two room types is the view from the room.  Indeed the view from Premier Room is very impressive that you can look at the entire resort from top.  The room is very spacious, well equipped with all the facilities you need.  The design of the bathroom has deeply impressed me.  They save the space of the bathroom door which it can be hidden in the wall as a mirror.  Just a tiny disappointment from the poor network of the TV.  There was no signal for the TV for every channel for the whole night... :(   All in all, JW Marriott Hotel Macau is definitely a well‚Ä¶",50
"If you need a hotel for your wife and kids to stay occupied for the whole day with the hotel facilities while you go gambling, then this is the hotel to be with the great family friendly pool and other facilities, plus the shopping and the extremely helpful and friendly staff at the Executive Lounge.",50
"What's not to like?  A JW Marriott with access to all the galaxy pools and shuttles to just about everywhere.    The most memorable part of the stay was Cliff, the executive lounge manager, and how he reassured my son that everyone in the hotel's food service areas were aware of his allergy to nuts.  Upon arrival he introduced himself to our son, who like most with severe allergies is very anxious about new places, and set outlined how he had spoken with the team and how he assured him he would be safe.  He even suggested restaurants off property and called the management to let them know we were coming.  Outstanding place and even better staff.",50
"This is the second stay in JW Marriott for me within 30 days. We chose to come back because the package ""stay the way you like"" is such a good deal. We came back here to celebrate our anniversary and we picked the perks: upgrade to executive room and lunch at man ho.  We strongly recommend you to choose the executive room with lounge access. The staff there were super friendly and went out of their way to make your stay an enjoyable one. We had tea (tea set style), dinner (buffet style with decent food  and serve with glasses of bubbly) and breakfast (buffet style with egg station) . We chose the executive lounge because the ambience was good and you never have to eat with a crowd ( sometimes in Macau it is super crazy, especially in the popular restaurant) You can enjoy decent‚Ä¶",50
"I stayed here for a night and they gave me a hotel room with the nice view of the two towers of galaxy and Marriot view. I booked double room but the reception said that they can only give me a king size but since I insisted that I need the double room and that's what I really booked by expedia, so she just offered me and extra bed for free and I thank her for that. The breakfast was amazing but the staff there not so courteous and approachable but the breakfast is good.The pool is amazing and the hotel is fabulous.",40
"We stayed 2 nights there and are satisfied with the room cleanliness, staff service, and resort facilities. Our room is on high level with nice resort view. You can find nearly everything you need from food to shopping within walking distance. ",50
"We traveled with a 4 year old and 18 months toddler. The rooms are very well kept and house keeping is prompt and efficient. The private pools and its own children beach and pools were impeccable (heated at 28 degrees) and there are so many life guards, life vests for kids, it feels wonderfully safe. The breakfast at Urban Kitchen is as good as every other review has mentioned. Special mention to Waitress Gloria who serviced us at breakfast and was specially attentive to our over energetic daughter, even taking the time to draw with her while we can have five minutes of peaceful meal time!  This is one of the most relaxing visit for me and for a very large part due to the calm atmosphere at the Marriott. We have stayed at the Okura and the Galaxy but we love the Marriott by far.‚Ä¶",50
"Hotel is very luxury and it is at the good place as well.  I like the live performance show which is going on in hotel lobby. The services is also very good and staff too. I love to stay more than my official trip, but surely I will visit again. ",50
This hotel is huge with over 1000 rooms. It is of a high quality and backs onto a huge mall. We wandered outside across the road to another complex to take a look and sampled another huge mall al massive casino. We stayed in Macao for a bit of fun on the way back from China to HK airport because you can catch the ferry all the way from the ferry port to the terminal and transfer straight to your flight. We even checked our luggage at the ferry terminal all the way to Singapore.,50
"Best services when I arrived hotel for check in. The Staff is very helpful, she help me a lot. And the room services are very good. This is my 2nd time visit, I'm surely I will visit JW Marriott Macao again. ",40
I celebrate my husband birthday here. Check in took too long.  Receptionist was barely smile and not helpful. Room was nice and functional. Specially like the long sofa in the room very comfortable. The highlight of this hotel is the swimming pool. I had fun and good time.,50
"This is the perfect hotel to be in because there's a lazy river. Staff is friendly. If you're in Elite member, the perks of the executive lounge is nice. Complimentary food and drinks. The executive suite room is amazing. It's high tech with lit and heated toilet with bidet, a TV on the mirror and special light privacy window with a click of a button, an amazing view of the lazy river pools below. There's a light show of the towers and looks at night.   The only thing missing is a jacuzzi instead of a tub. Now that would be nice!  ",50
"I was torn between this hotel and the Venetian,  but was so glad to choose this one in the end. It's just of excellent value. For the price I paid, JW Marriott Macau exceeded my expectation on luxury and fun.   The hotel room is clean, spacious and luxurious. The facility at the hotel, such as the water park and the kids club, is great for family traveling with young children. Honestly, the water park is simply brilliant! My bub had so much fun there, and so did us. The Galaxy complex is one giant shopping mall, with all the shops and restaurants that you would need for your stay.   Breakfast at urban kitchen was fabulous, as the buffet was filled with high quality choices and with a spread of both Asian and western cuisines.

"The JW Marriott Macau is a great choice for your Macau visit, prices are very competitive and in the Galaxy complex you have access to a host of facilities including the Grand Resort deck. Living in Hong Kong we usually have visitors and normally like to take them to Macau for one day, my last visit was the 4th visit to the JW Marriott and it won't be my last! I've stayed in many different room types from an executive room to the Presidential suite (wow!) and each one has been clean and well maintained.   What I love about this hotel is that you have various room types with outdoor pools/jacuzzis, the outdoor whirlpool is fantastic and it would make a great choice for the winter months.

The staff of Joan, Madelyn, Inga, and Cliff are just the perfect compliment for a guest like myself in Macau for the first time for a solo vacation.   The rooms and room service are also a great highlight of this property.  I stayed in a cozy corner Executive suite with a great view of the Galaxy property.  The room was spacious with all the amenities necessary to keep me fulfilled for the few moments I happen to be indoors.

Grand Resort Deck has the Longest Skytop Rapids, serval slides and wave pool. This deck is great for family and friends.",50
"A great business hotel in the Galaxy complex with comfortable large rooms, good food and all the latest amenities.  The staff is very courteous and helpful.  As it is connected to Galaxy and Ritz Carlton hotels through the lobbies you can just walk down to multiple facilities in both these hotels too.  The Galaxy casino is just a couple of minutes walk through the lobbies and there are numerous eating joints and shops within the complex itself.  The swimming pool is also fabulous.  The only drawback I found was that although the washroom was very clean when I got the room,  it was not regularly cleaned in my 3 nights stay.",40
I stay over 200 nights per year with Marriott and can say that this is the nicest Marriott in the world. The executive lounge is far batter than any other with a full dinner buffet and top shelf liquor.  ,50

The property is new and has all new modern amenities. The access to common mall & Casino with Galaxy is very convenient. Staff is very cooperative and helpful. It is little far from the Cotai Strip around 10-15 minutes walk.,50
"We have stayed at the Marriott twice in the past month. Both stays have been excellent.   Although not the cheapest hotel it is very good value as the rooms are extremely spacious and the fixtures and fittings luxurious. The resort pool deck (slides, lazy river, sand and kids area) available for free to all hotels in the Galaxy complex is the best on offer in Macau.   The staff really go the extra mile. In particular, Aaron from the Front Desk recognized me and welcomed me back to the hotel. The reason this was impressive was that I did not see him when we stayed a month earlier but rather he served me a year ago when I asked to borrow a stroller as the Galaxy (where we were staying) did not have any available. Excellent memory and fantastic service.   I would also like to‚Ä¶",50

Great new 5 ***** modern hotel in Macau.  The room we reserved was only a Deluxe room but we had an amazing view on level 25 facing Galaxy and the pool. This included breakfast at Urban Kitchen in the morning from 7:30am - 10:30am which is very handy for those that don't like to think about what to eat for breakfast. Overall the hotel felt very clean from the min you walk into the hotel lobby and has a very nice resort feeling unlike the other bigger chain hotels which have the casinos inside. It was still busy but less chaotic like a market compared to (eg The Venetian). The King bed was extremely comfortable also and all amenities were pleasant as well as feeling quite spacious of 40+ sqm.

Me and my wife got a very nice upgraded room with fantasic view, maybe that's a little treat to us because of my wife's birthday and we were appreciated.  However, we realised that we left 2 phone charger in the hotel room on our way to the ferry terminal. Luckily, we still had time so we decided to go back. We first checked with Concierge and took us 15mins waiting for a negative result which was not possible. We checked again with a foreign front desk officer, after another 15mins waiting finally they found my chargers.

Cliff was all ready to make me feel at home and experience the excellence service of his team  The room was very good too. Beautiful view of the galaxy properties.  I will be back to enjoy the super service.,50
"I REALLY like JW Marriott hotels so it‚Äôs a bit strange for me to say that I probably wouldn't want to come back to this one in particular.  I think giving this an average grade is very harsh but I'm a big believer in the statement that people make a hotel not necessarily the building.    First of all the positives!!  The pool (as per the other reviews) is amazing!!  If you have kids - go here for this.  They will play here for hours and for smaller kids a very nice play area.  The rooms are well equipped and decorated with a lovely art deco theme which is very pleasing to the eye.  All the good stuff like subtle and elegant lighting, comfortable beds as well as all the gizmos and gadgets.  These include a tv screen built into the bathroom mirror, remote controlled toilet seat as‚Ä¶",30

I subsequently mislaid my glasses and the ambassador representative spotted me an hour later in reception who had found and returned them. On booking into reception for our room, Stephen Diep handled our booking in a professional and friendly manner. He managed to upgrade us with a beautiful view over the complex and the river. In addition we were looking to secure a dinner appointment in Urban Kitchen which was fully booked and Stephen managed to secure a dinner reservation. Overall experience is wonderful with a superior service. Thanks for a great time, Emma",50
"Usually I like to write long reviews, however this place doesn't deserve it.  I asked on check in how long their holds are put on credit cards and I was told it would be released straight away.   At check out, I asked and they then told me 14 days but ""as a favour"" they could do it in 7 days. I asked them to do a miscellaneous charge (which hotels can do and have done in the past) so that I could take cash instead which I was told they do not do and would have to wait a minimum of 7 days.  Pay cash for your incidental deposit if you stay here.",10
"Good hotel,  well located to Taipa.   Everything is here.  The pools are a feature that are worth taking advantage of.  Service was excellent,  food wasn't quite as good as others but perfectly acceptable nevertheless.  Quiet,  comfortable,  easy to enjoy and relax. ",50
"We had a really good time and we came here with our 6 and 7 year old for a short stay, 3 days and 2 nights. Hotel is close to everything with a lovely pool within the galaxy group.  We spent most of our time near the pool with the kids and you feel very safe because there are life guards everywhere. My kids love the pool and the slides and they have fun baby water play area too. The only reason why it is not getting a 5 star is that we were quite disappointed with the food at the lounge area as it was very pricey and the food didn't taste like 5 star. Our bill came up to around 1500 for 2 bolognese, 2 steak and fries set, and 4 won ton noodles...  ",40
Galaxy swimming pool is amazing kids love it! Hardware is very good but I think they can improve on software and cleanness of the room. When we check into our room I suspect that the lady who made the bed must be in a hurry. At least they offer us early check in!! ,40
"Superior personalized service is a hallmark of this hotel within the Galaxy Macau complex.  From the check-in desk we were chaperoned to the Executive lounge for a drink while our check-in was completed. The suite assigned to us was very large and luxurious (see pictures).   The pampering continued for the duration of our stay with excellent breakfasts in the Executive lounge.   Being in the Galaxy Macau complex, there are many dining options available, though I would recommend the Man Ho Chinese restaurant in the hotel.  Would likely stay at this hotel again on future visits to Macau.",50
"It's a huge hotel, lots of people staying. There are lines for checking in/out. But the counters are fast and you can tell they are trying their best. They gave me an expired coupon for return ferry (which was included in my room pkg), but they quickly resolved the issue, and the concierge Sumar (?) was wonderful, pleasant, helpful and works very hard for every customer.   Marriott rooms are large, bright, well designed. The Marriott only pool is a nice addition to the Galaxy water park.   We enjoyed our stay at Marriott, compare to the other Galaxy complex hotels, we felt Marriott is the best choice in terms of price/value/service.",40
"We visited Macau on a whirlwind vacation of China! From Hong Kong, its an easy and quite pleasant ferry ride. The JW also offers a very convenient shuttle that you can catch right outside of the ferry that stops at other Marriott properties (about a 20 minute ride with all of the stops) which are very close together. We checked into the JW on the executive level, they greeted us by name. Although, you will see very FEW Americans there:) The Executive level is very affordable, and the ""offerings"" make it so very worthwhile! We had the pleasure of meeting ""Jem"" in the lounge...

"Absolutely LOVED our stay at the JW. Rooms are gorgeous (very similar in style to the Galaxy next door) but the hotel is quite low key (less of the Macau bling).  The property has a lovely pool and then shares the 'Sky deck' with all the Galaxy properties. This is so much fun for kids with water slides, wave pool, lazy river etc.  Didn't eat there, had a quick breakfast at 'Passion' in the connecting mall and a fabulous dinner at Cafe Litoral in Taipa old town. Would definitely stay at the JW again.",50
"I usually drag about staying at big casino hotels in Macau. My wife made the reservation this time and she pick a good one.  Check-in: Very fast. But one must aware rooms are not available until 3PM. So no matter when you check in before 3PM and no matter how tired you are and even if they have rooms available, the hotel will not make any effort to put you in the room. As such there is room for improvement. Rigidity is not good service in the service industry. Room: Spacious, well supplied and good decoration. Relatively clean. Not enough drawers though.  Restaurant: We visited the buffet restaurant for both lunch and breakfast. Excellent service. Good variety of food.  All in all, not bad.   ",40
"  My group of friends and family spent our weekend at JW mainly to enjoy their renowned water park facilities.   We did have our great fun time floating along the drifting river, the water slides, the sand beach with big waves......Good choice for family holidays.   We booked 3 deluxe rooms. The rooms are very spacious with nice view of the pool areas.  However, as it is a large hotel with lots of guests. We need queue up all the times, long queue for check in and check out , for entry to the pools and for  breakfast as well. Also, I would not consider the reception staff as customer friendly and efficient with the check in process.  We booked 3 twin rooms via those hotel booking website. We checked in at the Hotel around 2:50pm, however, only one twin room is available for us. ‚Ä¶",40
"Wow what a spectacular hotel. They property is brand new and feels like a palace. The rooms are incredible and nothing short of perfection. The Executive Lounge was superb and Cliff, Jason are going to ensure you have a great time. The service is the best and the positive energy and warm smiles make you never want to leave. I also have to include the beautiful and helpful young lady that was the manager of Room Service dinning, we needed a very complex and detailed take away catering order that she and her kitchen staff produced and delivered to perfection. I would strongly recommend any and all business travelers to stay at this luxurious 5 Star hotel, you will not be disappointed.   ",50
"The rooms are very spacious with some great mod cons (including an electronic loo), breakfast is extensive beyond your expectations with just about everything available. The Spa is excellent with really good treatments. We didn't get to use the swimming pools as there was a typhoon but they look amazing.  The place is massive and so is the complex. Great free shuttle busses both into town and the airport/ferries- very very well organised. ",50
"Cliff from the executive lounge and Rio from the pool bar were both offering exceptional service, so friendly and just making sure that everything was to our expectations at all times. We can't wait to return and see them again!",50
"We stayed at the JW for 1 night and wished we could have stayed longer.  The pick up at the Macau ferry terminal was great.  Dropped us off right at the front door of the hotel (several other hotels in the same complex).  Check in took about an hour waiting in line, which could have been quicker with more staff.  Our room was a deluxe on the 25th floor.  High room, floor to ceiling windows, large bathroom with shower and separate whirlpool tub.  Staff was very friendly and helpful.  The pool/aquatic center is shared with the other hotels, but not overly crowded in the late afternoon.  The lazy river was nice, beware that it can get some high waves in one area.  Direct access to the shopping and casino is nice, you never have to go outside.",50

Quality people to making the stay enjoyable The bedroom is excellent size and service in room also first class, clean neat and perfect place to relax",50
"My wife and I visited Macau earlier this week and we stayed at JW Marriott.  The services offered at the Executive Lounge was magnificent.  We enjoyed the good food (drinks, snacks and breakfast) which was all included in the room rate.  The dim sum lunch at the Chinese restaurant was superb.  There is no doubt that we would be visiting Marriott again soon.",50
Last minute birthday trip away and we got a pretty good deal. On arrival check in was fast. We got upgraded to an executive room from standard which was really lovely. Giving drinks vouchers and the most delicious birthday cake for free.  Room was great. Comfortable bed. Great bathroom and shower was excellent. Great pressure. Bathroom amenities were nice too.  Really like that they have their own set of pools as it's less crowded but you can also use the resort deck which is actually quite fun but busier.  Would definitely come back. ,50
We stayed one night  to celebrate my hubby's birthday. The hotel offered us a delicious birthday cake which is the best cake I tasted in Macau. I would like to express my gratitude to Mr Steven Diep who is so kind to upgrade our room that overlooking the superb view of grand resort deck and Galaxy hotel. The room is spotless clean and spacious. The hotel location is very convenient no matter to the resort deck or Taipa Village(old town). I highly recommend JW Marriott Hotel Macau and will definitely stay more nights next time.,50
Superb environment. We called operator 3 times and every time someone arrive the room within 5 minutes. Check in counter efficient and friendly. 5 star indeed.  The pool side buffet was also at High quality. We had Korean BBQ buffet and we left well fed and happy. ,50
Stayed for one night with my wife and son. There was a long queue for check in at the lobby as it is summer holiday. Don't miss their buffet. It valued the money! Their pool area is excellent. Cannot find better one in Macau.  I will stay at this hotel again! üëçüèª,40

The room was very clean and spacious, even with the king size bed and baby crib there was lots of running room for the little one. The view was gorgeous (we were on 26/f) overlooking the galaxy complex including the pools etc.  We ordered room service on 2 occasions and the staff were very attentive, food was decent and price was reasonable.   Executive lounge offered 3 time slots of food- breakfast, tea and evening tea. They had a good breakfast selection, evening tea was light but if u just want to eat (nothing fancy) you can make a dinner meal out of it. They have alcohol at night time including wine, beer, spirits and cocktails (only 3 types fo choose). The service could be better,‚Ä¶",50
The room and hotel itself are very nice and I know it is newly built so it was to be expected. The room and bathroom was very well designed with plenty of smart and clever features. Our room was very bright and spacious and the bed and couch were very comfortable and spacious. It really seemed like there was fine attention to detail in the finishes of the room and the service in general provided excellent attention to detail from check in to check out.   The resort deck with lazy river was a fantastic experience and well worth experiencing. The one caveat was the swarms of people in the pool and on the lazy river with you but it can't be helped and it didn't take away from the fun.  I would thoroughly recommend staying here.,40
"My wife and I recently stayed at the JW Marriott in Macau (at Galaxy) and it was truly an experience.  First, we were quickly greeted at the lobby and escorted to an effortless check in at the club lounge.  All the staff greeted us warmly and by the second day, by name. We were also escorted to lounges and restaurants within the hotel when we asked for directions.    The room was extremely clean and had magnificent views.  It also had easy access to all of the Galaxy amenities, which were surprisingly abundant.    We surely recommend the property and will return ourselves.  Also, a special call out to Cliff in the executive lounge for amazing personal service and touches that made the stay much more memorable.  ",50
We stayed at this great hotel with our two sons aged 10 and 8. The rooms are really spacious and had plenty of space for a family.  We used the executive lounge which was good but not the best the JW has ever created but the staff were excellent.  The pool area is great and the location for Taipa village and visiting some of the other hotel and casino areas is excellent.  A great place to stay....fantastic JW service ,50
The hotel is nice and has access to the resort deck which is nice.   Staff are excellent and friendly.  It compares very unfavourably to the ritz Carlton next door though and for a suite the ritz is around the same price.     The food and drinks in the ritz lounge is so much better and feels more like a restaurant.  If you are with a family just go next door,30
"Not a pleasant stay at all,  we would like to request to have quick look at swimming pool at 6pm as we just checked in and staff insisted cannot as pool is closed.  But then allow two foreigners to go in. We requested for late check out to 1pm but the reception lady said sorry you will need to pay for 1000hkd if check out at 1pm. Thank you,  there are many hotels in macau and you are not the only one. I just stayed at studio city during mid autumn festival,  they allowed us late check out at 1pm with very nice smile,, by the way much bigger room!!!",10
"The friendly welcome received from Sergio upon arrival was better than we could have expected.  The room was posh, modern, clean and comfortable.  The location is convenient and both shopping and gambling are steps away.  The only negative is an odor the hotel seems to intentionally infuse in the common areas that we found unappealing.  Overall, we would stay again and can recommend.",40
"This hotel is quite new in the Galaxy area in Macau.  Morden design.  Not too ""gold"" compare with other other in Macau.   Hotel upgrade us to a garden view room.  Room is big and nice.  Very clean and we'll equipped. ",50
"This is our second visit to Macau in the past three months.  Last time, we stayed at Ritz Carlton.  To try something new, we stayed at JW Marriot this time.  The room is well designed, the decoration is nice.  For my own preference, the bed mattress is not soft enough.  The breakfast is good and we are particularly pleased with the service of the male captain at Urban Kitchen.",40
Loved this hotel. The entire hotel is gorgeous and very clean. The pool and pool area is amazing  there is a very long refreshing lazy river. The casino is not in the hotel. Instead there is a shared casino by hotels in one large enclosed area. ,50
"My family of 4 adults took a trip in September 2016 and stayed in this hotel.  The rooms and facilities were fine.  However, the check-in and check-out services were not user-friendly.  Only two or three counters were opened at one time to serve two or three queues of customers. The queues were given different names like check-in, check-out, etc.  Customers got quite confused because not everyone followed the rule and just lined up where there were fewer people.    Also, a deposit of $2,000 was required for each room when checked in.  When I checked out, I was told that the hotel would check later if extra charge was required due to consumption of snacks or beverage, etc.  I asked if there was dispute over the additional charges, how it could be settled.  The hotel personnel‚Ä¶",40
"From stepping off the ferry this experience was great and a first timer for us.  The meet and greet at the Ferry terminal was well done we were on to the free shuttle within minutes and on our way to Galaxy and J W Marriot.  We were on a morning ferry so did not expect any accommodation to be available as check in is 3pm. however once registration was completed we were given a temporary card that gave us access to all hotel facilities and our bags were duly stored in the hotel left luggage area.  Hugues Simonin was very attentive during the registration process and gave us lots of information we didn't really Appreciate as this was our first visit to Macau and the whole J.W experience.  The entire Galaxy complex is amazing, we walked right round the ground floor level of the‚Ä¶",50
"Just spent two days at the hotel and had a wonderful experience.  Probably didn't hurt that I have status with Marriott--so was upgraded to a corner room suite.  That said it was a very modern hotel that was clean and everything in good working condition.  The grounds are family friendly with the water park and various swimming pools.  Oh yeah, there is also a casino but I don't gamble so never made it inside.  Probably the only downside (even though only slight) was the coffee shop (Urban) for breakfast--it was ok/good but not as good as the executive lounge.  The surprise was no business center currently available--guess most come to gamble and not need a business center.  I needed something printed and then scanned.  The executive lounge had a printer and later made a special‚Ä¶",50
"Hotel is grand. I have always enjoyed my stays ever since this JW opened in 2015. Especially with Marriott Rewards Gold or Platinum status, check-in and check-out at the executive lounge on 2nd Floor is a breeze. Inga, who works there, has provided seamless and excellent service everytime we are there.",50
"I have justa stayed 03 nights at this excellent hotel, it was my first time in Macau and I didn't know what to expect. We where received by Mr. Hughes Simonin who made our selves feel like home, never been treated so well in a hotel like this. The staff at the executive lounge also where great and specially Jayson (i think he was the staff responsible) always asking if we needed something else to drink or eat. So thank you very much and hope to see you soon.",50
"My family just returned home from our stay in JW Marriott for 3 days in Macau.   Pros: Very spacious hotel room and very nice decoration  Cons: It is very obvious the staff in the hotel are not properly trained with very serious management issue.  From the service at the restaurant to room service (like the waiter was chewing gums while servicing customers in Urban Kitchen in the morning), water were not refilled on time, room service were not finished till 4pm despite our reminder in the morning.   We have stayed in many Marriott in the world but this is obviously the one with the worst customer service we have ever encountered",20
"We got a room facing the grand resort deck, which is definitely a plus in the hotel in summer. The room is clean and the TV is big with many channels to choose from. Bathroom is the highlight of the room, enormous with nice tub and a tv over the sink. We are entitled to the executive lounge which provide excellent customer services and every staff in there are friendly and approachable. The waitress called Gem was very friendly and made us cocktails which is very good. Overall it's a all rounded excellent hotel.",50
"My family just arrived home from our second trip to the JW Marriott Hotel. The hotel is super family friendly. With a lazy river with women dressed as Mermaids who swam with my daughter were great. There is a playground with water toys and a water slide. Plus a kids club and a sand beach. The hotel is very nice and the staff were amazing, I would highly suggest anyone thinking of gong to this hotel to book a room. Lastly the food at the pool restaurant was very good.",50
"Always a pleasure to come here on my regular business trips - great facilities, location and surroundings.  The executive lounge is a real highlight - a great place to meet or relax, not to mention the quality of the food!  A big thanks to Cliff, Ralph, Joan, Jayson and the rest of the team for being so accommodating - highly recommended!",50
"Every time when I visited Macau, I was staying at Marriott since its opening. However during a recent stay in the last weekend, I found that the service level of Marriott has been deterioted.  I used to have lunch buffet at Urban Kitchen and this time I would like to try the buffet dinner. My little daughter was so excited and pulled me to the food counter right after we sat down. When I approached the rice portridge area, I didn't recognize and misthought it was a cold cut counter. I took two abalones and was immediately stopped by a staff named Tiger. He gave me a lesson, saying that if the abalone could be eaten rightaway, it would be easily gone as every one would just take it away. I was immediately saying sorry that I've mixed it up with the cold cut. But he then ordered‚Ä¶",20

A special thanks to Felix from the lounge who was extremely helpful.Galaxy complex has everything you need [ restaurants,casino,shops etc] .Also free shuttle service to town & other hotels .",50
"Location is brilliant being part of the Galaxy Complex which comprises several other high class hotels, many excellent shops and a casino.   Rooms are large and clean and extremely comfortable. Views are excellent.  Pools are the best I have seen anywhere in the world.  We purchased the Club (executive club) extra for my wife, 5yo and 2yo. This included a full breakfast, afternoon tea, snack and drinks all day long and dinner. It was great value. The staff continually went out of their way to make sure we had everything that we wanted.   The Kids Club is awesome, including lots of games for the kids to play... even arcade games.

I am a platinum member and this place alone is a good reason to stay loyal with Marriott.  Forget all you know about the lounges in the US.  This one has amazing service, food and drinks.  Here you can actually have a Scotch 'on the house'.  Many if you want ;-)  The food and snacks ar also amazing.  But wait until you meed the coffee maker they have there.  Incredible capuccino !  Now the unexpected... the hotel is kids friendly!  Kids club and pools.",50

"Our firm arranged an offsite in Macau.  It was our third offsite there, but the first in this hotel. The rooms were quite simply spectacular. Spanking clean, generously appointed, first rate amenities and great views. Exceptionally thoughtfully laid out. Excellent housekeeping. Good F and B outlets. Didn't feel like the usual Marriott fare I'm used to. Macau might not be everyone's cup of tea but hotels of this quality make it all very bearable. ",50
"Never again stay anywhere els but in this greatest hotel in the world. I had not imagined that any hotel company in Mscau, which's 7 times the size of Las Vegas, would even think of families and absolute kids entertainment until i stayed in this hotel!  Ladies and gentleman ever since I returned home, and my kids never stopped talking about the world's biggest pool park located in and shared in this amazing Galaxy complex!   Most hotel there think about nothing but gambling and shopping, and rightly so with the world strongest economy of the Chinese. Not this hotel complex. They're rely geared towards kids fun and entertainment. You even need not leave the hotel!   Have fun every one!",50
Great view and amenities....had so much fun at the Grand Resort Deck as well as to the JW Marriot's pool...I just forgot her name she is a front desk executive and had done all the check in processes well in few minutes.,50

Every one of the hundreds of staff members we have encountered has been friendly and smiley, and all went out of the way to make my wife, daughter, and me feel special. Jeaselle, Cliff, Inga, and Rochelle are some of the satff members who stand out as having treated us so well. A truly great place to stay!",50

Free shuttle from the taipa or macau outer terminal station . The hotel guest enjoy free access to the water playground and have spa, gym and kids club at discounted price for hotel guest. It's always a good stay in Marriott.",40

I also enjoy the breakfast buffet in JW Marriott and I would like to said that the buffet is excellent! The omelette is cooked when you place the order and you could choose the ingredient as you like. It is the most impressive for my breakfast.  I am greatly appreciate with the overall service in JW Marriott. No matter the room, the meal and also the custom service, JW Marriott would be a good choice for you if you visit Macau and definitely you would not be disappointed.",50
"First time staying at JWMarriott and loved it!  We mainly came here for the water park. Stayed at St Regis, and Galaxy before, but I must stay JW Marriott topped the chart in terms of quality.  Room - spacious, bright, the amenities were of really really good quality, marble here and there, great design, very sleek and with excellent finishing.  They have you usual tea/coffee etc..  We traveled with a baby and had a baby cot, plus some Medela baby cleaning products.   Service - very efficient, and staff were pleasant.  We had access to the Executive Lounge on the 2nd floor and this was very worthwhile.  It comes with drinks throughout the day, nice big buffet style breakfast, afternoon tea from 2.30pm, then hors d'oeuvres from 5.30pm -- plenty to refuel after a day at the pool. ‚Ä¶",50

All necessities of home are provided.  The staff are friendly, hospitable and courteous.  I would strongly recommend my friends to stay in this hotel in Macau.",50

"We always favour Marriott as a Hotel brand but will definitely have a second thought after our poor experience with Marriott Macau.   We have stayed with the hotel for one night a week ago. When we did our booking, we thought we have paid to upgraded our room to executive package with access to lounge and free breakfast. However, this turned out to be a total disaster!   Everything was fine when we first arrived, check-in was ok and room was great! The main issue was with the executive lounge - Instead of a warm welcome,we encountered a very bad attitude staff (Cliff) who was terribly rude. He could not find our room (or name) on the executive list via their system and since, have dealt the issue with extreme bad manner! I have then asked to deal with his management and‚Ä¶",20
"Just returned from a 3 day trip with my husband and our 4 year old grand daughter. This is her first trip away from Hong Kong and needless to say we wanted to give her a fantastic experience. We booked our room online and made a call to the hotel to request for a theme room for kids. They confirmed that they will set up a tent inside our room to give her this special experience. As we are gold card members, we were delighted that upon check in, we learnt that we have been upgraded. When we enter our room, everything is as requested. The room, not only luxuriously decorated, is clean, tidy roomy and has a great resort view. During our 3 days stay, we found all the Marriott staff, from the bell boy, to the receptionist, housekeeper, server at the restaurants, the security guards‚Ä¶",50

I will definitely stay here again . ",50
"Stayed here with 3 girlfriends on my first trip to Macau. We were blown away from check in to check out! My husband is Marriott platinum and I am gold so we were invited to the executive lounge to check in where we were given champagne and snacks while being processed. We got 2 rooms on the 28th floor. The view of the hotel complex, water park and pools was stunning. Breakfast buffet in the first floor restaurant was the best I have ever had, and that is saying something because Asian locations really know how to do breakfast! This plus afternoon tea and dinner with open bar in the executive lounge were included, making this a very reasonable stay for the money. The hotel complex offers free shuttles to most of Macau, which is very convenient. When I returned for a 2nd stay,‚Ä¶",50

I was totally blown away by the hotel and all the amenities available to kids. They have a seriously amazing water park, great kids club, and staff that are just genuinely nice to kids. Overall it was a great experience from arrival to departure. We had originally planned to stay just one night and within hours of arriving we decided to add an extra night. Can't say enough about the gorgeous hotel and the great staff ",50

What bugs me was the lifts that require a tutorial to operate. It took me 2 trips in the queue at the reception before a staff walked me to the lift and taught me that I've to press both the card and the button simultaneously to work. One of the lifts still refuse to operate in this manner though. The male gym weighing machine was also out of order.",40

I reserved 4 double bed type rooms, the staff give me 4 king bed type rooms instead when I check-in, and told me (hotel booking site) reserved ""4 king bed"" and hotel was full book, so they can't help us to change to ""double bed"", the staff said ""this is your mistake with xxxx.com, you better to contact them.. it's none of our business"" I am 100% sure won't make this mistake (4 rooms!!!), so I check all my record, it's turn out my first email record remark ""double bed"". obviously, they went out ""double bed"" room and shirk their responsibilities to fix this issue. It's not acceptable! finally, we gave him a ""solution"" to ""add bed"" in each room and without charge. my advice is....keep all your record! ;)",50

Guest of any hotel group like Marriott/ Ritz/Galaxy can move and use common activities complimentary.  Love‚Ä¶,50
"It's been a while since I am so impressed with every aspect of a hotel.   From the view, the food, the room, the entertainment to the service of all staffs, it is really reflecting the value of the brand.  The room is very spacious with great amenities.  Staffs are very responsive and provide you with solution quickly.  Hotel itself has shuttle bus around town.  Since this hotel is actually in a complex of other hotels, they are all connected through shopping mall and walkways.  I like this hotel being less crowded and not as touristy as others.",50

The hotel is new, the rooms looked fantastic, especially the bathroom, really liked the bronze color design. With access to both JW's own swimming pools and the water park (which was really quite fun for both young and old (my daughter 4 years-old, my father-in-law over 65)).

It is very close (15 mins) to the Taipa Ferry Terminal and Macau Airport.  This JW Marriott is large, new and well-staffed. Rooms are clean and modern, and the facilities are state-of-the-art. I especially like how housekeeping staff came by after we went for a swim to see if we needed additional amenities or towels.  The breakfast buffet is extremely good. I especially enjoyed the selection of fresh fruit juices. There is a large variety of food, from pastries to omelettes to yoghurt to salad. High standards, just like every other JW Marriott.

Appreciated they have upgraded our room as it was my friend's birthday with a little complimentary cake even! The view of the room was stunning, the bed is huge and the toilet was clean and tidy without any weird smell.    The most impressive area was their swimming and aquatic play area! Tho they share the same area with few hotels but still not too crowd to play around! I would definitely stay in this hotel again!  The only problem of this hotel was the front desk staff and check in time.  The staffs was not too friendly and the queuing time took almost 1hr! probably you could choose some non-peak time to check in to speed up the process.",50
"This hotel is built as part of the Galaxy Casino complex. There are plenty of activities for all ages without having to leave the complex.

We booked this hotel because of the swimming pool/ artificial beach/ river where my kids enjoyed so much.  I actually enjoyed as well.  We paid double the price Four seasons offered. We always stay at the four seasons whenever we visit Macau but due to our recent bad experience with four seasons Chiang Mai, we decided to try the Marriott. We made a good choice. The service, the breakfast, the room, the check in check out experience are all fantastic.  Note the executive rooms has separate check in and lounge. I see there is long line up for standard rooms so not sure what the experience would have been for guests‚Ä¶",50

What a relaxing and thoroughly enjoyable weekend! It was the Lazy River and other water activities that attracted us, but the rooms, the service, and the hotel itself were all charming. Special note must be made of the staff, from Kristine in The Lounge and her ""Happy Anniversary"" sweet gift to the friendly and helpful bellhop who took our bags, to the smiling, lovely housekeeping staff in the hallways, everybody asked how our stay was going, was their anything they could do for us? Truly world class service! Our connecting rooms on the 16th floor had a fantastic view of the pool and‚Ä¶",50
"This was a very special reunion with elderly family - Tremendous thanks to Inga in the Exec lounge, who really treated the elderly parents with tons of warmth and recognition.   The other lounge staff often seemed overwhelmed though, perhaps need more help as that place can get quite busy during breakfast.    We're platinum members and often have many choices when travel for work - we'll always choose Marriott after this experience - other brands just don't measure up.",50
I have been traveling for 40 plus years and this is the finest hotel I've been to. From the check-in process with the acapella singing bell hops on the Grand stair case to the Concierge level suite was lavish with fine breakfasts both European and traditional Chinese delights. Penthouse suite was somewhere I could retire to !,50
"We moved to the JW Marriott after staying 2 nights at Studio City just around the block.  The room was smaller but the whole experience was better. The shopping mall downstairs had more relevant stuff. We walked next door to Broadway and the outside market and the food available was amazing. The swimming pool and the river didn't feel crowded at all, the loopy slide was crazy. I really felt like I was on holiday when I went into the restaurant within the pool area for lunch. They had specials everywhere so you don't feel like you are being ripped off all the time. Must try the all you can eat at the Chinese Restaurant Man Ho. That was the highlight of my trip. I remembered our 2 families managed to order every thing on the menu and managed to finish them all.",50
"The JW Marriott in Macau is an outstanding property with excellent service. I stayed for a short two night stay and arrived well past midnight due to a flight delay. The hotel staff was extremely prepared and made the check in process go smoothly. As a platinum member, I was upgraded to a beautiful suite that was spacious and highly functional. The rooms are styled like most casino hotels, and featured modern and luxurious amenities. The lounge was outstanding with accommodating and courteous staff.   The hotel is situated in the Galaxy complex, which features premium shopping, many restaurants, and a large casino. It is very close to the airport on the Cotai side. Many of the sites in Macau are a short trip across the bridge.  Overall, would highly recommend.",50
The J W Marriott in Macau is a beautiful hotel with amazing facilities. The rooms are large with comfortable bed & luxurious bathrooms. The staff are all very friendly & happy to help in any way. The pool area is beautiful with an added bonus free access to water park. Highly recommend.,50
"This JW resort along with the Ritz Carlton forms one of three large hotels in the complex known as the Galaxy Resort. Located on the small island linked to Macau, called Taipa. When going to this island from H.k use the Cotai water jet service (blue one). Buses to the Vegas style resorts provide free transportation to and from the terminal and from the large bus station in the Galaxy complex. The short journey to,Macau and other areas, again free of charge. This hotel is spacious,spotlessly clean, staff are attentive,helpful and knowledgeable. For such a large and busy hotel ,check in was quick and straightforward.

"I booked this last minute after being unable to get availability at the Banyan Tree and I'm so glad I did! I got a great deal through my rewards membership and decided to splash out and upgraded to an Executive suite. This hotel only opened last year so it's lovely and new and contemporary. The entrance lobby and grand staircase are breathtaking! We were visiting for my hubby's 50th birthday and Guest Relations were really helpful in organising a complimentary cake and arranging special decor for the room on arrival.  Our room was probably one of the most stunning I have ever stayed in, enormous and luxurious with fabulous views. They promised me a nice room and we were put at the very top on the 35th floor.  We had a dressing room, enormous bath tub and huge spacious living‚Ä¶",50

"This is my first time staying at this hotel. Great service with passionate staff. I particularly love the body wash from aromatherapy! So relaxing!  And, we got one more credit - got upgraded to the executive room and that room was so spacious with fantastic view!  Will stay there again if I visit Macau next time.",50
"I stayed here on a weekend, and being a Marriott Rewards member, I did not have to queue with most other guests checking in. My stay started at the Taipa Ferry Terminal where I boarded the free shuttle bus. Marriott and Ritz were the last stops along the shuttle's route The driver couldn't understand Marriott when I asked if he was going there since I was the only one left on the bus at that point, but we managed to communicate when I showed him the hotel logo.  Check-in was smooth and easy with the front-desk staff explaining that my room was upgraded and where to go for the buffet breakfast included in my stay the next morning.  The room had an absolutely amazing view of the Galaxy complex. The curtains were open and I spent the first 10 minutes alternately staring and taking‚Ä¶",50
"We have visited this hotel before when it was new, the rooms are excellent and well appointed, the executive club is very good (thanks Cliff and Joan) and the pools are great for families.  Booking a connecting room for us and our small children however seemed to be one step too far for the central reservations, being unable to confirm a connecting room until we payed for the two rooms and actually arrived in Macau.  Seriously!!  (too bad if the answer was no when we arrived!!)  Many phone calls and emails to fix something so simple.  Not everyone who visits this hotel is from a one child family, Marriott.  Also, the beds had an unpleasant odour when sat on initially, a room change clearly not an option after the ordeal getting the connecting suites in the first place!  So a‚Ä¶",30
"The room I stayed in was a suite and was one of the nicest rooms I've ever been able to stay at. This view of the room looked directly over the pool area and could see the other hotels in the Galaxy area.   However, with very little to no control of the hotel management, my stay had a few minor annoyances that were solely because of other tourists.   In the hallways, I would hear children running and screaming as if the hallway was their own playground. Additionally, loud noises of children playing with the door handles repeatedly affected my stay as well.   I did not complain to the front desk as it was something I felt left the staff in a tough situation but please be aware that these things seem to be common when travelling in China despite staying at a prestigious hotel like‚Ä¶",50
This is one of the finest and a very new property at Galaxy along with a group of best hotels like ritz Carlton. The rooms are very spacious and especially the bathrooms are masterpieces by itself with the quality of interior chosen the fittings and the complete auto closet with washer to dryer üëçüèª . The food at the URBAN KITCHEN is one of the best you can get in Macau (if u r a sea food lover) .,50
"I have been travelled to Macau many times and I found this hotel is pretty satisfy my need. I like their jacuzzi at the balcony. I did spend my night soaking in the jacuzzi, enjoy the beautiful garden view. It's really good!!  Really enjoy to stay at this new and comfortable hotel!  ",50
"We book the room at 3pm and was told and promised that the room will be available at 4pm. By the time we are back to the hotel at 7pm, we were told that the room will be available in about 30 minutes later. At that time, my family were all wet and cold after finished swimming. We had to borrow my friends' room to get change. Finally we got the room at around 8pm. Next day, the manager apologized for letting us use the Executive Lounge and promised that everything will be well arranged, we can just go there in the afternoon. When we were at the Executive Lounge, our names is not on the list and they were not informed. Again, we were totally disappointed about the services we got. This is the worst 5 Stars hotel that I had ever stay.",10

This is my 3rd time stayed there. Really impressive with their excellent hotel service and modern-style decoration. The suite we stayed this time is very nice and spacious.   Hotel offered a birthday cake for surprising my husband. My children also enjoyed much for the swimming facilities. So convenience having our meal in the hotel arcade even on rainy day. Buffet at Urban Kitchen is very nice. Wide variety of shuttle buses we can take to the places around Macau. Good for family trip!   We all had a good time in JW. Planned to stay at JW again for my wedding anniversary in next month.,50

Got upgraded as Platinum Elite member to a really nice Executive Corner Suite with stunning views over Galaxy pool deck area! The service in the Club Lounge is top notch! All the staffs special Cliff the Manager and Jem is fantastic and know how to have a good conversation with the guests.  The hotel is perfect and new in all the ways. From the beautiful lobby, amazing huge rooms with marble bathroom and the super comfy Marriott beds or the huge pool area. I can't stay nothing bad about this hotel the only thing that we had to check out after one night! Stayed at the Conrad Cotai before but the service here is better. Very easy to get a taxi outside and staffs and concierge are very helpful Can't wait‚Ä¶",50
"The JW Marriott Macau is one if not the most magnificent hotels we have ever stayed in.   The service was exceptional, the staff were brilliant and the food and facilities were incredible.  I could not recommend this hotel more highly. 10 out of 10.  We stayed in stunning well appointment suite over looking the expansive pools and lazy river which the children loved.  The Executive Lounge was available for breakfast, afternoon tea and dinner and it was sensational - all included. High Tea is a must!  So much for the children and adults to experience!!!!!  Special mention to Liz (Director of Services) and Cliff (Executive Lounge). They both made our stay so incredibly memorable. ‚ù§Ô∏è  I want to go back.... now.  Book your stay.. It will not disappoint.  ",50
"Very new one, has got a great fitness centre.  But the service attitude of staff was just-so-so might be due to there were lots of clients in summer time... Anyway, I like the executive lounge's service provided, the food and drinks there were excellent!",40
"Went to newly opened JW Marriott in Macau. Booked 2 rooms there with executive club access. Rooms are huge, big and luxury. Comfortable beds and linen, all hardware are exceed Marriott standard (as I am a big fan of Marriott hotels). View from rooms are amazing, you can overlook other 2 buildings of Galaxy and the pools.   Executive club offers afternoon tea, evening cocktail and breakfast. Missed the chance of having tea and cocktail. Breakfast was good, lots of choices with egg station. More than enough for us. Staff are high service level.   Great to stay there and I look forward to stay in the summer time as the pools and outdoor activities are looking fun.",50
Slightly a victim of its location and being the largest of the JW Marriott's in Asia - so serving a lot of people- breakfast is broad ranging but can be a bit if a scrum compared to the more genteel and slightly more sophisticated Marriott in HK.  A good hotel to stay in Macau but beware the shuttle buses which can take longer than walking.  Rooms are great - big and well furnished-as is service. Location in Galaxy complex affords access to the Galaxy Deck which our teenagers certainly enjoyed,40
"I stayed in J.W. Marriot with my husband and daughter for one night during a busy weekend. The location is good and easy to access. We appreciated our room was being upgraded to Premier room, the views of our room is magnificent. We really enjoyed our stay in the hotel especially the swimming pool facilities. Our stay is too short so that we didn‚Äôt have chance to try the cuisine offer by hotel. Overall it was good to stay with JW and the front desk staff, Steven Diep is friendly. He provide the efficient and timely services to fit our needs.  We hope to stay here again in the nearly future.",50

Just a few of the individuals who made our family stay a lifetime memory: Cliff, Inga, Vincent, Jayson and Rhialyn. Their professionalism and attention to detail are truly World Class, and helped to make this the single most exceptional hotel experience we've ever had - and that is saying something!  As a Marriott Rewards member, my family and I were invited to use the JW Marriott Club - an experience I highly recommend. Full cooked breakfast, Afternoon Tea and dinner are included, and the attention of the staff is white-glove level.

I called beforehand to ask to check in a bit earlier cos I have a little kid and a baby. Luckily they let me and there were rooms avail. Housekeeping was very helpful. Jw is really trying with their customer service, staff are courteous and with a manager standing by reception makes it professional.   Cons The food could be a whole lot better. Breakfast and lunch at the urban kitchen. Room service food could improve. The wontons were raw inside. Room service itself was great and on time. (Pool bar food is awesome though.)

From when we got there - the service was exceptional..  Ralph/Jason/Matthew in the executive lounge - nothing was too difficult - even searching for that glass/bottle of sparkling wine. You must visit the Pool Bar .. the friendliness, quality and service was just woow. From the first drink through to the many others - it was a place we wanted to go back too each day.

"My wife and I stayed at JW Marriott for one night on last Saturday (July 2nd).  Overall impressive was good. Since it was a long weekend, we already expected the number of guests there would be, and we tried to avoid the line ups as much as possible.    First, we checked in at 4:00pm for the executive room.  No waiting for all.  Smooth and quick.  Since the check in time starts at 3:00pm and there are more than 1,000 rooms, it is best not to go at 3:00pm and wait for 30+mins.    The executive room comes with complimentary afternoon tea and breakfast at the lounge.  We enjoyed the afternoon tea which provided delighted sandwiches and cakes.

Finally, I have to look for the busy duty manager but he/she was too busy to take my call. Then, the reception guy said he could help to send me the invoice at once. What kind of this customer service which require so much effort. I would expect way better service by JW Marriott, or it's just poor management of whoever the owner is.

"The JW Marriott Hotel Macau is located as part of the Galaxy Macau and next to Ritz-Carlton hotel. I stayed here for 2 nights back in December 2015. The stay in this hotel is one of the best experience from the services, the room, the views, and the amenities. I arrived in Macau via Hong Kong with a Cotai jet ferry. There was a free shuttle bus from the ferry to the hotel. The bus pass thru couple hotels located at the Galaxy Macau.   As I entered the hotel, the view of the lobby was fabulous. There are special lane for an elite member. As a platinum elite, there is a special check-in place which is at the executive lounge located on the 3rd floor.

Lounge offerings were good but... no sparking wine anymore; choices were less than the last visit; dishes were not re-filled in the last 30-60mins.  Apparently, the lounge was understaffed during peak hour when tea/coffee could not be served until breakfast was almost finished.  The pool was great and fun - a must visit if you are travelling with family and kids.  Stayed in July 2016, travelled with kids.",40
"Stayed at JW Marriott Macau for 2 nights. While the hotel is new with great swimming pools, the crowds are astonishing. You are in constant race to get a table, find a chair at the pool, and line up for various things. This is not what a holiday is supposed to be. In addition, because most of the hotels are very large (easily 1000 rooms), staff are only trained to handle the masses of customers, and there is no service to speak about.",10
"It was my first time staying at the JW Marriott Hotel in Macau.  I've stayed at the Studio City Hotel in Macau when I visited Macau back in March 2016.  I have to say that Marriott definitely lives up to its reputation.  From the time we checked in at the executive lounge on the 2nd floor to the time when we checked out, I have nothing but praise for their top-notched customer service (especially Matthew, Marvis and the Dutch gentleman at the check in desk, as well as Jason and the Filipino lady with glasses in the executive lounge).  I feel being valued as an elite member.    The upgraded room was very spacious and comfortable.  The hotel is connected to the big ""water park"" in the Galaxy complex which is free for hotel guests.  So, it's fun to take your kids to the water park.‚Ä¶",50

My wife, my daughter and I went to executive club for breakfast, hi-tea, snacks and drinks. It's really worth to upgrade it! Staff were very nice there even a housekeeper. Smiling faces everywhere.

Being a vivid traveler to and from Macau I appreciated the lush service, limo pick up, and booking of my airport ferry tickets directly to the Hong Kong Airport for myself and my girlfriend. The Vice President of Operations for both properties of the Ritz Carlton and JW Marriott, Mr Rauf Mailk, definitely has placed the largest JW Marriott on the world on top for sure.

We arrived at 3:40pm and the lobby was packed.  Every single seat was occupied with over hundred of people waiting.  We proceed to the check in counter and the queue was so long.  We were told by one of the staff that the minimum waiting time is 45 minutues!  My husband said we would like to go to the pool and the lady staff helped us to get the access card and when the lift landed on 3/F, we already saw over 30 people queuing to just enter the pool.

The rooms are very spacious with nice view of the pool areas.  However, as it is a large hotel with lots of guests. We need queue up all the times, long queue for check in and check out , for entry to the pools and for  breakfast as well. Also, I would not consider the reception staff as customer friendly and efficient with the check in process.  We booked 3 twin rooms via those hotel booking website.

The reason I booked this hotel was for the grand resort deck and I had so much fun there. Breakfast was included in my rate and it had a wide variety of food to eat.

"I hardy write a review but Marriott really need to step up on their service!!! Came here to celebrate Father's Day over the weekend with family and friends and had to wait over ridiculous 50 mins standing at check in counter to check-in 5 rooms. The staff was staring at the screen all the time and at least 30 mins he was just gone. Seriously understaff and the staffs were clueless. We only got 4 rooms.   Previously requested non smoking floor, with two cots and none were noted. One room smells very very smoky- eventhough on non smoking floor.   We didn't get our last room until 1:15am as we expect the keys to arrive at the room we requested. We waited until 6:15pm and went out for dinner and it never came when we got back.   The night manager came out trying to ""do"" something by‚Ä¶",10
On arrival we was quickly escorted to the room for check in. Service was impeccable and rooms cosy and extremely modern. Mirror built in TV in the bathroom and impressive TOTO new generation self cleaning toilets. Checkout was smooth and quick.,50
"JW Macau is a great hotel with wonderful leisure facilities. Excellent room with comfortable bed, mini sofa, large bathroom with fancy toilet. Nice comfortable desk if you need to do some work. Good TV with plenty of channels including BBC World. The leisure facilities are very good with access to the largest waterpark in Macau with around a river ride and lots of different pools to suit everyone from babies, young kids, adults and serious swimmers. Well equipped gym and there's a steamroom. Dinner buffet average  Breakfast buffet average  Staff through out the hotel exceptional and polite. ",50
"The hotel is very nice that can connect to a couple of other hotels' .  Hotel staff are friendly with decent buffet and a Chinese restaurant. The only thing is that our room is full of second hand smoke smells despite it is a non smoking hotel. We enjoyed the wide selections of international cuisine available in the Urban Kitchen buffet breakfast during our stay. We are very impressed by the warm services provided by Gloria who looked after us in the two mornings. She is cheerful and attentive to details. Compared to the other staff,",50
"We do really enjoy the birthday trip by staying in Jw Marriott Hotel. The staffs are very friendly and helpful, especially Inga, she had arranged a birthday cake to me and invited us to enjoy drinks at the lounge, this is very impressive to enjoy my birthday with beloved one. We hope to celebrate our special days again in JW Marriott Macau.",50
The hotel is very nice that can connect to a couple of other hotels' swimming pools. It fun to stay a whole day there just for swimming and water games.

"We come here for the wave pool!! This hotel is the one nearest to the wave pool ! And the outdoor swimming pool of jW Marriott itself is cool too ! It allows us to get to use the facilities before the official check in time , which we can fully utilize the limited time we stay in Macau .  The room is big , clean and new. We stayed in Galaxy hotel last year which we found Marriott is more tasteful . What's more , each room allows three adults to use the pool or two adults plus two children , it seems more flexible !

"We stayed in this beautiful hotel from June 9 to June 11 2016. Check-in went smoothly,with no problems. The service at the front desk was impeccable!Thank you Maj for the introduction to the room and all the facilities. Whereever we went,we found excellent service and smiles. The rooms are very nice and had a huge window with a view of the resort.The beds are extra comfortable and I slept like a dream. The curtains were a nice touch!  The bathroom was very nice with amenities from the Aromatherapy Associates spa range.The toilet was something quite out of this world.The bathtub was wonderful and I could soak for hours.

"Me and my husband checked-in at JWM Macau for 2 nights to celebrate my birthday. I didn't expect a big surprise from him because I was already ecstatic just to stay there.   Overall experience during our stay was awesome. From the breathtaking view on the 27th floor, the romantic room set up (which by the way looks like a honeymoon suite üíïüíïüíï), the cake, flowers and presents waiting for me, dining in Executive Lounge, Man Ho, Pool Bar and Urban Kitchen is amazing (food was really good!), and of course swimming in the trademark of Galaxy Group of Hotels --- JWM pool, Grand Resort Deck and Wave Pool.

"Went there for 1 night just to celebrate my wife's birthday in June 2016. The grand resort deck was awesome. The room is spacious. The hotel was offering us to use the executive lounge as we are the Marriott reward membership and the experience of that was nice!   But we found a few hair on the bathtub and the TV was only fixated to one channel and the staff came to check would not take off his shoes.  Apart from the above, this is an awesome hotel.",40
"This is the third time I stayed at this hotel.  I still love it. Big room, clean, good service, nice view. I would say it's the best within its price range in the Galaxy groups.  I will definitely stay here again, if not Ritz in the same hotel group. ",50
"This is a truly 5-star hotel located in the Galaxy cluster of hotels and casinos.  It is attached to a mall and gives you access to resort-level facilities, including a lazy river and several water slides.  Was not crowded at all when we stayed from a Wednesday to a Friday.  Stayed in a club room with a bestie and the value we got was amazing. As soon as we got off the complimentary airport shuttle, we were escorted to the executive lounge for check-in by a bell hop and an usher.  The food at the lounge was so good that we only ate out to dine at iconic restaurants.  The ESpa it shares with the Ritz-Carlton is fantastic.  Check-out was a breeze and the lounge attendant Rhialyn took care of our limo transfers so that we were brought to a specialty off-site restaurant and picked‚Ä¶",50

"We comment here to give our special thanks to Manager Norman. Actually, We had small problem during check-in and we resorted to the help from Norman. Finally the problem was solved quickly and we stayed pleasantly during the three days trip. The excellent services leave good memory to our family. The facilities are also 5-star graded!",50
"I stayed in JW Marriott in Dec 2015 for one night with my husband.  The hotel was new and not crowded, hence check in process was smooth.  The room was spacious, clean and comfortable with separate sofa area.  The bathroom was huge and with modern facilities.  We celebrated my husband birthday and the receptionist at the check in counter offered a complimentary birthday cake which was very delicious.  Breakfast in their cafe was good as well, with varieties of choices and  food quality was good.  Being a SPG member the check out process was quick and efficient as well.  Since we purchased package via Shun Tak travel, the price was competitive and hence I would say you could have a luxury accommodation at an affordable price.  I would certainly stay in this hotel again for next‚Ä¶",40

Very nice view in the room that overlooks the swimming pools and the other Galaxy Macau buildings. The Price is very affordable and comes with free breakfast all for under $150USD! !

"There's no better place to come back to after a day out shopping and sightseeing. Our room at this Marriott is extremely large with a very spacious bathroom. The staff, starting from the doorman to the bellhop and reception are more than willing to go the extra mile. Special mention to Sonam and Kumar at Concierge who extended extra assistance for our baggage, wheelchair issue and dinner reservations. I also love that they have free shuttle service to everywhere in Macau including Senado Square. This is the only place to stay in Macau. Will definitely be back! ",50
"JW Marriott is one of the 5 hotels in the Galaxy Resorts. We booked a premium room for 2 nights, breakfast included at the Urban Kitchen with super friendly and accomodating staff, variety of food is good and orange juice was super delicious plus the health drink that the staffs are offering (we had celery and green apple which was delicious). Hotel Rate was quite reasonable and the check in was fast if you are a member of the Marriott Club or else you will be spending may be an hour or more just to check in. It is also advisable to use credit card as deposit so you wont have to spend some time checking out.  You just need to drop the room keys in one of the express check out boxes in the lobby.

"I stayed at this hotel for over a week for business.  The room is relatively new and the bed is comfortable. View from the room is good as it was facing the pool and the 2 large blocks of Galaxy Macau.  TV channel lineup was pathetic as there is no HBO, Disney Junior and English Premier League (they were showing Serie A / German League). I rationalise that as this hotel was attached to a casino, maybe they wanted us to go gamble instead of staying in the room watching TV. Ha ha. I previously stayed in Venetian a few years back and I thought their TV selection wasn't as bad as this.  I stayed on a non-smoking floor, but the lift lobby at a non-smoking floor had cigarette butts littered around and the foul stench of cigarette smoke permeating the entire floor.

"This hotel is about a year old and therefore is extremely clean with very modern facilities in the room. The most exceptional feature was the attentiveness of the staff. All spoke excellent English and were extremely polite and friendly.  The rooms are modern and well equipped. The rooms at the front of the hotel look over a cleared building site and a golf course. Not the best view in the world.The rooms on the back look over the Galaxy Complex, the pools etc. Therefore probably preferable.  The hotel has extremely good pool facilities with poolside bar and is part of the Galaxy complex so all the facilities of the complex including the longest lazy river in the world are available.

There are casinos in the complex if that is your thing but once you step into the hotel you know you are back in a beautiful Marriott with very friendly staff and sheltered from the gambling mostly.  Room was very comfortable and there are lots of shops also in the building, which is shared with other hotels.  The breakfast was very good and extensive but the restaurant a little hard to find. Everything very positive.",50

I do definately suggest this hotel to anyone.",50
"Came expecting great but turned out to be fabulous! New hotel, so all amenities are modern and up to date. Got upgraded to a splendidly large room with amazing views of the city.

Starting check in, the reception counter staff Sophia impressed us to be professional and skilful for which she could read our needs almost immediately and located us to a non-smoking room with a gorgeous scenery at an upper level floor.  Her colleague Brandy did even better.  At the reception counter, she clearly explained to us the whereabouts of our located room and personally went up to the allocated room to conduct a concise inspection to ensure good condition before handing over the room to us.

"The property is very luxurious. The lobby has an attractive staircase and great photo opportunity. The checkin process was quite efficient. The hotel was kind enough to provide complimentary access to executive lounge.   The room was fantabulous. The kids loved the bathroom window which was transparent but could go frosty with a switch. The size of room and bathroom was spacious. The bathtub, shower area, etc was a great experience. The bed was comfortable and so were the pillows.   The checkout process was a non-event.

As a Platinum I had access to the executive lounge which is beautiful and the staff goes above and beyond.  Because I needed a double room, I did not receive an suite upgrade, but the room was gorgeous.

We planned to go grass sliding which is near to airport, she suggested different methods of going and what if we could not get taxi back... She even provided more activity to go with kids.

Overall the property is very nice but the check in was a mess. As a club member I couldn't find out where to check in and with all the mainland Chinese people checking in it was very confusing. The rooms are great and I would like to know who the interior designer was as they did a very nice job. Very spacious and well appointed.  The executive area is nice but too small if you want to have your breakfast there as very few tables.,40

Easily the best Marriott I've ever stayed at worldwide and would absolutely do it again.  If not for the ferry ride I would choose this lodging over Hong Kong on my next business trip and commute daily.  This will be my first and only choice on future trips to Macau.

There is also 3 waterslides (the fast one was really fast!) and a man made beach.  Would also recommend the buffet at Urban Kitchen downstairs. The peking duck is awesome!",50

Yes, it is five star and the amenities and property are absolutely divine, but it's the staff that truly makes JW a five-star experience. They are exquisitely attentive and pay attention to even the smallest of details.They even welcomed me with a surprise birthday cheesecake. And the Executive Club Lounge was absolutely amazing. I can't believe the meals that are prepared there. And again the staff was absolutely amazing, especially Jayson. Far more than I ever expected. From breakfast to high tea to cocktails and ""snacks"" in the evening, I was left completely satisfied. And the water complex on the property has something for every adult. I will definitely be back and will also do a‚Ä¶",50
"Just returned after a great overnight stay in Macau with my nephew. I am a regular to Macau and a friend recommended the JW. I have stayed at many Marriotts in the USA but this was a first in Asia. Well, form the minute we arrived the service was excellent. The check in was fairly busy but very fast and pleasant, it was my best check in experience in Macau and the lobby was very pleasing to the eye. We were guided to the lift and when we arrived in our twin room, we were blown away by the view of the pool and recreation area. Fabulous view and beautiful rooms with every amenity you could ask for. The quality of the bed linen, towels and drapes are of the highest standard. It was real five star luxury and you can not always say that in Macau and even Asia. We then headed onto the‚Ä¶",50
Stayed at the new JW Marriott at Galaxy Macau for a conference.  It is what you would expect from a 5 star hotel - great rooms and good service.  Small hiccup with he meeting arrangements on our first day but other than that everything was great.  The hotel is somewhat separate from the casino with I prefer so that you don't need to go through the gaming areas all the time.  ,40

Heavy deposit money: MOP3,000(will not be paid actually, thou) 4. Shuttle bus is not good 5. Hard to get a taxi late at night 6. Smokers are all around the hotel, even it's prohibited.",50
"I am a regular guest of lobby lodge and the ambience is perfect with my friends with nice cocktails. Twice a week and more we or sometime sit and enjoy my one and only cocktail. But suddenly yesterday I got a big traumatic experience with my favorite cocktails. they serve me a funny taste of my cocktails. one sip is enough and never again. the new bartender mix a wrong alcohol to my cocktail and it cause me a allergy to difficultly to breath, right after from lobby to my room. even my friends drinks taste funny. and today also we try to go back to our favorite place. the lobby lodge but we never go in and sit because same new bartender standing at bar I will not take a risk again for my health.. so we decided to go to other venue....

"JW deliver's what it promises. Facilities are simply great and in that sense it truly meets the standards of JW, however, in some small instances the service and the overall appearance isn't truly consistent and perhaps lacks some attention on detail. Nevertheless, I'd highly recommend this hotel in Macau and despite those minor remarks, JW is simply great!",40
"Long queue at reception, customer service manager calculated wrong bill three times and delayed our check in for an hour and was extremely arrogant and rude, the pool boys were unhelpful and threw our personal belongings on the ground. The whole experience was horrible given that this is a five stars branded hotel. Mind you, the waterfall slide was extremely dangerous when swimmers exited, just be careful. Good that there was a lifeguard there who acted quickly and saved my dad's life!",10
"Stayed for a weekend in the executive suite for my gf's birthday.  Really excellent experience and she thought she was a ""Princess in a Palace"" for the whole time.  Cannot recommend this place enough.  GM Brian Tong  is  mastering the art of the seamless experience in this super comfortable five star plus plus hotel.",50
We arrived late that night. The staff is really friendly and helpful. The room is cozy and clean. It's quite a pity I didn't experience the cool swimming pool because of the bad weather.

There was a huge selection of food! I particularly enjoyed the amazing service from our server, Catherine, she was very friendly and helpful! Would defiantly come back to this hotel and recommend it to others.",50
Nice room. good service thou took a bit long to check in! Club lounge is exclusive and with good food & drinks! Employee include the chef  is very nice to talk to!  The waiter and waitress provide very good service and I will come back again for my next trip definitely !,50
Get all the plush pampering together with the fun of a resort for everyone in the family.  Stayed two nights here. Marriott membership has its perks. Right from check in I was guided to a separate counter away from the long queue and was upgraded to a beautiful corner room with a view.  The member app was synced to room service and concierge once in are in the room and connected to the wifi.  Tip: sign up as a member and start accumulating points.,40
"Spent two weeknight at this hotel. Rooms are spacious, clean and new Mattress: excellent Pillow: Excellent Pool: very good pool and the ""lazy river"" is great of kids especially during weekdays when there are much less people Restaurant around the facilities including the adjacent ritz is great especially Otto 8 ¬Ω Staff were very friendly especially at the lobby lounge",50
"if you want to relax  and enjoy purely the hotel services, i will suggest this for you. the room rate will include the club service including breakfast, tea time, so called cold cut time but i think you can treat it as dinner and drink time. if you buy seperately this service, it will cost MOP$600+ the food variety is quite ok and sufficient. of course it would not be like a formal buffet. the main concern is the food quality is fine.  if you like drinking some wine there. the variety is quite big and you can enjoy and spend the whole evening there. staff service is ok but not perfert. but they show they are happy to help. a few weakness point are : 1- we have four person staying there by 2 rooms. when we go tea time there, they only serve 3pcs each of the snack in a set? how‚Ä¶",40
"Booked a 1 bed roomed Executive suite as the pool suites were not available. We arrived quite late but no one to show us to the room as I would expect in a suite of a 5-star hotel. Suite was stunning. Large and well equipped. Great views over the Galaxy complex.  Turndown service was inconsistent and the one occasion we called ""at your service"" for ice, it never came. Bed is great, bathroom is great. Really positive experience in the suite. The service let us down a little when trying to arrange transport to HK airport. Concierge and Exec Lounge charge an extra 10% to book this so we did it ourselves. No big issue but I think of this as a basic.

"Stayed 2 nights here in the second week of April, our 2 kids had a great time.  Hotel just opened last year, and rooms are big and the place still feels new.  They have a great pool and a big (hot) jacuzzi, and you also get direct access to the Galaxy Grand Resort Deck, which has even more water attractions (google it for a full description and pictures - kids will have fun!). You do have to check when Resort Deck reopens, as they are closed during the winter.  It was quite cool side when we were there (22c), but hardly any people around, so we had the water park all to ourselves.  I can see this place getting more crowded during the summer.  Staff are all very friendly and helpful, from the time you check-in, housekeeping, at the lounge and all the way to check out.  Very‚Ä¶",50

"I booked four nights and rang and sent a message via booking.com that I had booked four nights however would be arriving the next day around 12pm. My reason being so that we could have our room immediately on arrival instead of waiting for 3 pm checkin. Anyway, we arrived (husband and I)...after an 11 hour flight and a 5 hour wait at Hong Kong airport for the ferry to Macau. We were told we have bad news and good news ...Bad news ...our booking had been cancelled as we did not arrive the day the booking commenced. Good news .... We can give you a room but you will still have to pay for the night you weren't here. That was fine by us as we were tired and in need of showers. And just what I didn't want....we had to wait for a room to be ready...two and a half hours. Not a good‚Ä¶",50
"The hotel is impressive when you first walk in: high ceilings, large chandeliers, modern furnishings and a huge lobby.  The room was beautifully decorated.  It had that modern, new vibe combined with the business hotel feel that most JW‚Äôs have.  Sadly though, it‚Äôs the service and room that was disappointing.  When we made our reservations we told them we required a connecting room.  That was the reason we stayed there as they said they would confirm this.  When we arrived they said they only had one connecting room and it was at the end of the hall.  We got there and were upset that the connecting room where our kids were sleeping smelled like cigarettes ‚Äì despite this being a non-smoking floor  We requested a change in room or upgrade but they said neither was possible.

The only issue we had was the lack of communication. The staff did not speak enough English to understand our request.   We booked 2 rooms and stayed here for 2 nights with my parents and our 3 year old son. When we arrived I requested a single bed to be placed into our room as outlined on our online booking.  The bed did not arrive and it was getting late but eventually a cot turned up while we were not in the room. Being late we decided to try and have my son sleep in the cot. We had sleepless night as the cot was just too small and inappropriate.   After many (4) failed attempts to have the cot removed and replaced with a single bed it finally arrived but very costly.   Great location in terms of the casinos and Coloane. The swimming pool area is fantastic for kids with a‚Ä¶,50
"We stayed here over the Easter break. The hotel is wonderful (great room, breakfast buffet, member lounge, and truly amazing pool, tubing river, Jacuzzi outdoor set up). We were a party of 3 families (yes, 6 kids, 6 adults) and check out was made bearable thanks to the effort of Rafael from the Concierge desk who not only stored our baggage but when it came time to move our luggage to the shuttle bus at the Crystal lobby of the Galaxy complex. He offered to take our luggage - all of our luggage - to the shuttle bus area. He saved us at least 10-15 minutes and this allowed us to make the bus and thus, our ferry. Very many thanks!",40
"Stayed one night in Retreat Pool Suite with 1 King Bed and a grande living room.  Room is clean and gorgeous but the room service have to be improved.  By the way, many thanks for the great arrangement from Ms Brandy (Front desk), she provided professional service.  Will stay again with no doubt.  ",40

The room had a smoking smell although it was a non smoking room and it was very bad,  but at the moment I complained about it,  we were moved to a different room.  The hotel has a big casino if you like to gamble.  Enjoy your trip to Macao.  S",40
Brilliant hotel! I absolutely loved my stay here. The room is big and very clean.

"Husband and I spent one night there during Chinese New Year, the double room was stylish, spacious, spotlessly clean....basically had everything one could ask for! Very enjoyable stay and staff were very helpful and efficient. The hotel is located at the newer side of the Galaxy casino complex, within walking distance to downtown Taipa which was very convenient indeed!",50
"Last time we can to Macau was seven years ago sans kids. We were excited to try this brand new hotel and resort complex.   We booked the Family special for a quick 2 day/1 night visit during our vacation in HK. We were upgraded from a regular room to an Executive room. The room is awesome. Plenty big to accommodate a stowaway for our 4 year old. The bathroom is state of the art as expected from a luxury hotel less than a year old: tv in the mirror, Japanese style heated toilet with night light, bidet cleaning options, etc. But the coolest feature is the window that faces the room. There's a switch to make the glass opaque for privacy or clear to see the view. Awesome! We've been to many resorts usually they had louvered sliding panels but this glass window is takes the cake! ‚Ä¶",50

I am a platinum elite member and had a wonderful experience at this hotel.  The staff was extremely friendly and the service was outstanding.  We were given a complimentary  upgrade to a King Suite and the room was breath taking!  It had every amenity you could ask for and was very large.  Very lavish.  The view was also grand.  We would definitely consider staying here again.,50
"Such a beautiful hotel and great addition to the Galaxy complex, I had a wonderful week stay to kick off my honeymoon. Our suite was beautiful with a huge balcony overseeing the resort with our own pool. Room service left us a beautiful cake congratulation us on our wedding. The food and service throughout the hotel was perfect from the executive club to the restaurant urban kitchen. ",50
Again another new hotel (opened in mid. 2015 I think?) by Marriott. The entire Galaxy complex is huge with shopping center / restaurants / entertainments all connected to each other. Our kids liked the lazy river and the kids beach the most they would not leave for two hours. I think we might be coming back again pretty soon since this time was only a short two nights stay.,50
"This hotel was recommended by a good friend and I booked it for a one night stay in Macau. It is very new and spick and span.happy to say rooms are very spacious.  Very reasonable rates too for such a beautiful property - unfortunately because it is so new - it seemed to have some teething problem - bathroom wash sink was clogged , television channels had problems with reception etc.  Service was good efficient and polite but as I only stayed one night and had to rush back to Hong Kong island early the next day , I had no chance to try out the restaurants or explore other facilities in the hotel besides the gym which was large and well-equipped.  This hotel is adjacent to the suites only Ritz Carlton - do go over next door for a look around !",30
Service was fantastic by the staffs named Rio and Marlon! Very friendly and professional service. As for the atmosphere it was superb with the view. Food can be improved wish to see variety of food on the menu as for price it's value for money. On the other hand beverages were very good. Would definitely come back here and recommend this to people that would like to relax and have a fun day especially with their family since there are swimming pool for the kids to swim in.,50
"So far the best hotel I ever stay in Macau.  The first step I walked into the lobby, I was welcome by everyone who works there!  The check in process was quick and efficient.  The room is clean and big.  They even prepare child slippers for my two kids.  We stayed at the hotel for three nights.  We are all recharged after the good night sleeps (the bedding is awesome!)  Restaurant and shopping are all in walking distance.  Kids and adults will never feel bored.  I definitely will go back again!",50
"I was impressed about the professional welcome and service during check in. Ms. Inga at the executive check in did an excellent job and I felt home with the first minute. The room was very clean and unbelievable good. If you looking for a good place to stay with an excellent service, my recommendation is to check in at JW Marriott Macau",50
"This is one of the newest hotels in Macau this year and I thought a new hotel will perform far better than all others, having learnt from the mistakes of all existing competitors. But no, there is this huge long line up at reception just for check in, even though we have requested online for early check in. The staffs are new and not fluent with the service standard of Marriotts. A disappointment! Would not stay here again! ",20
"This is a true 5 star hotel, room was quiet and clean with a great view, there's an espresso machine and a bluetooth speaker in room, and a huge flatscreen TV!  Free WiFi, and great breakfast!   Hotel is connected a big mall with shops, cafes, and restaurants in it, very convenient.",50
"We visited in March 2016 and were delighted when we walked through the door. It's as grand and beautiful as you would expect a 5* hotel. We had the Deluxe room (The cheapest) and found that very luxurious!   The only downside was that the check in process was slow - they couldn't locate our records even though we had a printed confirmation with us. Other than that minor hiccup, everything was fine and great for a couple of nights stay in Macau!  As with most of the big chain hotels in Macau, there is a free shuttle service which takes you from the airport/ferry port to the hotel, and then around to the other big hotel also so that was very convenient!",40
"I have stayed at multiple JW Marriotts across the world and this was by far my most memorable experience. Check in was a breeze, staff were very friendly and the decor was architecturally phenomenal. My suite was above and beyond my expectations exuding luxury and comfort. Location was great and it was part of an incredible mall. Would definitely recommend this and will certainly come back here if I'm ever in Macau again.",50
"I stayed at a Deluxe room for 1 night at the end of March 2016. As many other reviewers said, the design is excellent, an absolute 5star grade. But the credit goes to the designer. The facilities and service are both less than that.  While checking in, the staff, holding my ID and credit card, didn't seem to be able to locate my record. He asked in what way I booked my room, and I said on the site of a travel agency. He phoned someone and finally, he found it. It doesn't take very long, but, as a 5star hotel, it looks like their guest records are a bit messy.  Regarding facilities in the room, everything looks fine on surface. Yet, as you use them, problems may come out.  1.	The water would not drain in the water basin! It took me some time to find where the control is located‚Ä¶",20
"Coz it is part of Galaxy, it is quite convenience with shuttle service to pier and city. Inside the Galaxy, it has its own shopping mall, food court, cinema and casino.  Room size are big compare to Galaxy Hotel.  With a sofa corner, bath tub, writing desk. All this hotel has swimming pool facilities.  I have booked a non-smoking room and I go checkin at 6pm, they told me no more non-smoking room so i have to stay in a smoking room.  But the air quality in the smoking room is acceptable.  Maybe coz it is new and just built up around 1 year.  I have also stayed in Okura Hotel and Galaxy Hotel before, Okura is the best and JW Marriot should be the second in comfort, service and quality.  But compare in room price, JW Marriot should be better.  Sorry for my poor English and hope‚Ä¶",40
"We had an early check in that morning since we were switching hotel from galaxy.  I think there must be a system problem overall in their chexk in process.  We had to wait for long time already for the morning check in as we insisted to check in first since we like to just pick up the keys as we had a bad experience checking in from galaxy.   We just wanted to pick up the keys later in the day.   Again. . Just to pick up the keys, we have to wait for 15 mins and then the process is another 10 mins.   This seems ridiculous to me if it's claimed to be a 5 stars hotel.   It seems like no one understand what to do. .the hotel overall is facility is nice though with many nice features such as tv in the bathroom. .. you turn on a switch to turn the blinds. .. etc... but the wait tone‚Ä¶",30
"We chose the hotel based on the other reviews on Tripadvisor, especially those that mentioned exceptional service.   We didn't want to stay at a big hotel in Macau with the long check in queues and impersonal service (Venetian/Galaxy). And having done the near perfect but no complex attached Mandarin Oriental, we wanted a hotel that had great service but would allow easy access to shops and food. We had hoped that the Marriott would be the answer. Sadly, we were mistaken.   Rooms are modern, fantastic. Check in at Easter was a fiasco. Long queues, messy and impersonal. Further annoyed by a man standing too close at the check in line picking his nose. (OK. That was neither here nor there) Room was clean but in housekeeping's hurry, they had left some rubbish on the counter in the‚Ä¶",30

We booked two rooms and one was upgraded to a suite due to my husbands elite status. The swimming pool was a great hit and we had so much fun.",50

"From check-in to lounge service, I was very pleased with the service here.  I normally stay at the Sheraton, but my first visit to the JW has made me a convert.  Platinum is treated as it should be (upgrade occurred with no fuss).  And, nice amenity/gift in room which is a nice touch for Platinum.  Also, I found the service in the lounge to be superb, whether at afternoon tea or breakfast.  It was raining during my visit, but look forward to trying the outdoor pools the next time I'm there.    Friends ask whether it's useful to have top tier in a membership program with a hotel ... I can say that here, it certainly is!",50
"Service:  I suppose since this is a huge hotel, the communication system and staff knowledge have yet to improve. Service delivery tends to take longer, however no worries, they would be done for sure. The staffs are extremely enthusiastic, friendly and hospitable. I feel like they are all born with a heart to serve, with full of humbleness.   Special thanks to be given to Lindsay for the premier room arrangement and effective communication.   Executive Lounge for executive room customer:  Wow the staffs there are really great, they are surely experts at restaurant serving.

We had dinner at he urban kitchen and again the staff were attentive, courteous and wonderful. Special mention should be given to Gloria. she looked after us in the restaurant and she was fantastic! Her vibrant personality and thoughtfulness are some of the great qualities that are found in the people that work at this establishment. It is people like her that create such a memorable experience at the JW Marriott and why we enjoy staying there when we travel.  It was a fantastic hotel and I would definitely stay there again!",50
"We were on a short break and had a super experience from check in to check out and everything in between. The weather was poor but it didn't take from the phenomenal professional service with exemplary attention to every detail. The executive lounge, the pools, the design detail of the room and hotel are faultless. But what makes this hotel unique is without doubt it's staff. From Stephen on check in, Moj who helped us to our room, Francesca and Jeff in the lounge, the concierge Kase  and others, were all without exception, excellent. ",50
Where do I begin... From beginning to end my family and I really enjoyed our stay at JW Marriott Macau.  At check in we were upgraded to a premium suite that overlooked the pools - we were definitely spoilt.  The kids club on level 3 was fantastic - our two boys aged 8 and 5 loved this experience.  The pools were out of this world.  The Marriott greets you with a pleasant signature smell - it was nice.  We also had our room made up twice a day - my room always felt super clean and fresh.  I love the automatic and heated toilet.  The staff at the Marriott make you feel extra comfortable.  If I ever return to Macau - I will be staying here.  I have stayed in many hotels but this one is my all time favorite. ,50

If you are busy and do not want to take the time to go out for your meal, the room service here is better than any of the restaurants I have been to in Macau.  The staff (Larie) is very professional and arranges the food beautifully when they deliver it.  No need to go out when stay here.  Eat in and enjoy!  Delicious!",50
I am very please JW marriott lounge staffs team did a excellent job to take care my families during 3 days family reunion get away event in Macau as their team provide one of best services.  Hotel itself is only half year old locate inside casino complex but this hotel is design for family or business stay.  It offer a huge pools for kids and also very good foods selection in their elite lounge.,50
"Hotel staff are friendly. For example, I arrived Macau last Thurs at 1pm , they will advise me to register in the lobby first and pick up hotel key at 3pm.  Therefore, I can enjoy buffet lunch in urban kitchen. I love the intelligent toilet because I can stick there to get warm in cooler weather. I love the super large shower and I can sit and shower. I also like the crystal white bed sheets so that I can enjoy my sleeping for 8 hours.  The curtains is high tech that press the button to open or close the curtains.  I highly recommend JW Marriott hotel because the service and quality of hotel is worth 5 star hotel.  Hotel staff is so detailed about customers. I also love the buffet lunch in Urban Kitchen. I like the indoor interior",40
"I booked a deluxe room but since I was a Marriot Rewards Gold Card member and it was my first time to stay there I was upgraded to a suite. Was just here for one night so I felt bad because I didn't get to maximize the room. It was awesome. Has a separate living room with large LCD TV, mini ""kitchen"" and desk. Bathroom had a nice tub with separate shower and walk in closet.  The view was of the pool which is quite nice. At the ground level you have a mini shopping mall before you hit the Casino with lot of restaurants and a cinema which was showing western movies.",50
Very nice hotel and the most impressive thing is their staffs. I would like to say thank you here to Elaine & Lynn in the reception as I can't sleep if any smell of smoke but all their standard non smoking rooms are book out at that time. Elaine and Lynn try their best and find me a room :))),50
We were very excited to get check in and find out I made huge mistake.üò® I was booked  wrong date.!!!  I have to  rebooked for day we arrived. It was nightmere and I can't forgive myself such stupid mistake what I made.  My family were waiting for over 4 hours for my travel ageny confirmation.  After all White Angel(she wewring white uniform )Lindsay serve us it makes everything better than before extremely quality customer service and support it makes complete my holiday happy ending.  And save my marriage. üò• BIG THANK YOU FOR Lindsay for your sincerely customers service.  I love staying Macau and JW merriott  hotel because of her.,50
"The hotel itself was impeccable.  New, spacious, clean and comfortable.  Concierge staff friendly and helpful.   Breakfast was also good with many choices.   But the Marriott service leaves so much to be desired.    I had booked 3 rooms for my family and want non-smoking, twin-bedded rooms all on the same floor.  But as I could not find a way to contact the Macau Marriott, I logged into the Marriott's central website as a member and emailed the group through the so-called Marriott Rewards Customer Service to state my requests.  But to my dismay, Marriott returned my email saying that as I made the reservation through a travel agency, they would not entertain my request and suggested that I make future reservations with them if I want to be heard.  I was furious.  I wrote back‚Ä¶",50
"This is my second time staying at this hotel. I would like to show my greatest gratitude to the guest services manger Mr. Norman Yaranon.  The story should get back to the first time when I stayed here early in January. I booked a room with one king size bed, but upon my checking in the front desk said only rooms with two twin beds were available. I got the room, went inside, yet felt creepy to stay alone with two beds inside the room. So I went downstairs to the front desk again then there I met Norman.   I clearly delivered my request. ""No problems, leave it to me."" He said   After I got from my dinner my room had been changed to the exact type I want.  An month later, I returned to the hotel again. Just right upon my approaching to the front desk for my check in, Mr. Norman‚Ä¶",50
"At the quieter end of the Galaxy complex, so much more upmarket.  Welcome drink at the lobby lounge was a nice touch  From check-in to check-out it was a very relaxed experience, unlike some hotels of the same class in Macau.  Room was very new and cleaned twice a day while we were there.  Excellent service from the housekeeping staff.  Asked for kid's slippers, they delivered and then a follow up call to ask if we needed anything more.  Wow.",50

"I stayed here for just one night with my travel buddy to decompress mid-way through our Asia adventure and both of us were just in awe at how beautiful and decadent this property was. The staff were beyond courteous and made you feel as if any request you had wasn't an imposition and was handled promptly. The rooms were very large and the beds plush as usual. The best part of the rooms though are A. The view and B. The bathroom. The view we had (shown somewhere here lol) was just gorgeous and the bathroom featured a large soaking tub, large rain shower, a Japanese smart toilet, and a television to catch up on the news while you groom or have a bath.

He also made our stayed memorable with sweet kindness! We were so impressed by the room! It was more awesome with a very clean and thoughtful details to consider guests' needs. Such as, Aromatherapy association toiletries and cushiony slippers! The toilet has a heated seat, automatic controls of covers. The hair dryer that was already plugged in, it was nice touch.

"Stayed there for 2 nights and got upgrade to suite with lounge access.  New hotel with usual modern Marriott setting.  Lounge offerings were good with plenty of choices during happy hour. In fact, it was more like mini-dinner which offered noodle, curry, and even lobster, on top of cold cut, cheese and desserts.  Breakfast selection was above usual lounge standard. There was a lot more choices in the main restaurant.  Did not have a chance to use the pool as a big part was closed for maintenance that time. However, it looks fun and will return with family in later part of the year.",50

"This is a great new hotel that opened in May of 2015.  It is part of the Galaxy Complex which contains additional hotels, a casino, restaurants & shopping.  The staff in the executive lounge was great - Inga & Vincent.  They helped me book a ferry to Hong Kong.  When you entered they called you by name & made you feel welcome.  Nice gym facility with dumbbells & machines - nice equipment.  The food in the executive lounge is very good.  Many people made a meal out of the evening food offered which was quite extensive.  Great breakfast food as well with made to order omelets.  The bathroom mirror contained a TV which was pretty cool.",50
"Stayed for 1 night with parents. Staff at the executive lounge was great, accommodated us very well even though the hotel just opened for less than 2 months and it is running at full occupancy. Buffet breakfast was really good. The Premier Room we stayed in had fantastic views of the resort and was spacious even for the 3 of us, with a rollaway bed added. Loved the bathroom.  Will be back again in a day's time, looking forward to it.",50

"My wife and I recently stayed 2 nights at this fantastic hotel, our first time in Macau, to see the Russell Peters show at the nearby Studio City.  The service was good, even if the doormen were a little tip-hungry, everyone else we encountered made the experience special.  The offerings in the executive lounge for Breakfast was vast and fresh.  Having the club on the 2nd floor instead of the top floor meant that the primary kitchen was close at hand and everything was well stocked and quickly refilled.  In the evenings we forwent supper as the club offered a complete buffet to dine on and a full bar to mix cocktails.

I think it might be a training center for the top staff everyone is soooo friendly!!  As a Marriott gold we had access to the executive lounge.

"Located in the Galaxy complex on Cotai Island easily reached by the Cotai Water Jet ferry from Hong Kong Airport. Opened in May of 2015, we found the room to be on the ""spectacular"" side. Huge bathroom with big shower, huge window (wall size), electric curtain, etc. Casino shuttle buses make it easy to get around to the various casinos and also to downtown Machau.  The Cotai Jet Ferry is easily accessible from inside the HKG. Look for E2, and be sure to get your ticket from Cotai Jet Ferry. The Turbojet Ferry will take to downtown Macau and you'll need a taxi. If you take Cotai Jet Ferry they will take your luggage claim tickets, collect you luggage for you, and you pick it up at Customs at the pier on Cotai Island. Walk out of the ferry terminal and look for the Galaxy shuttle‚Ä¶",50
"Located in Galaxy Macau complex, JW Marriott is in a very convenience location. Like most of the hotels in Macau, shuttle bus service connected everywhere.  Staffs were very nice and helpful, it took us about 5 mins to check in. Our room was in 22th floor and the view is super! Room was clean and tidy, facilities are quite new and wifi was free in the whole Galaxy.  Highly recommended.",50
"Stayed at JW Marriott Macau for one night in February. As with most hotels in the area, it‚Äôs easy to get to and fro via complimentary shuttles that run regularly from all ports and major locations. Located as one of the crowning jewels of the Galaxy Macau complex, the JW Marriott is set on the doorstep to a huge upscale and spacious shopping mall, gaming area and a simply huge grand resort deck. Compared to some of the other locations on Cotai it seemed to harbor a quieter refuge from screaming kids and noisy tour groups, and on that front it‚Äôs already a step ahead of the rest. Galaxy Macau provides up to 12 different complimentary shuttle bus lines to the ports, Macau centre and other popular destinations including The Venetian and City of Dreams, making it easy to get around‚Ä¶",40

When I reach my floor, once the elevator door opened, a very strong cigarette smell is all over the lobby and the hall way. And my room has the same smell too.

"I am not sure I can write anything too constructive here because I am still flying high from our amazing couple of days at the JW. I can be a pretty high maintenance hotel guest but I have been singing the JW's praises as it definitely ranks up there with any of our favorite hotels (Intercontinental in Danang, the Prince de Galles in Paris, and The Carneros Inn in Sonoma). The JW really sets itself apart from others by two categories: the room and their service.   Having never stayed at a JW before I had no idea what to expect but I was so impressed by the room. It was beautifully appointed and it just exuded sophistication. I loved the Aromatherapy Associates toiletries and the big fluffy white towels that felt like a hug when I used them. I also liked the cushiony slippers.‚Ä¶",50

Special feature from bathroom were full function electric toilet and atomized glass which we loved about. Will definitely come again in summer time with my 6 years old daughter as there is a huge kids‚Äô club and swimming pool which kids will be crazy about them.",50

Nice room,the most intimate is the innermost closet door is  activity, you can walk into the bathroom from the closet, is actually easy after the bath can directly open the closet door to take a bathrobe to wear. But if let children know that this feature will be a very fun place, especially if you have two children of similar age.

"This new property is part of the Galaxy phase two development and the largest JWM in Asia. Therefore it has easy access to the huge Galaxy complex with lots of shops and f&b, as well as the inevitable casino. The Galaxy complex is one of the ""friendlier"" malls in Macau ~ meaning that there are shops and restaurants ranging from local chemists to Chanel; from Starbucks and McDonald's to 5* steakhoses and Michelin recommended restaurants, instead of the usual luxury-only malls.  As expected of a JWM the hotel is designed with taste. The reception is grand, yet with individual checkin stands offered some extra privacy when checking in, which is a definite plus.

The rooms are wonderful with the exception that they are extremely cold at this time of year and the maintenance seems to be lacking, for example the very expensive Japanese style toilet doesn't do half the wonderful things its meant to and there is no point attempting to explain it to the management as in general English ability is near zero over the phone.  The real killer is the service, rooms are not serviced until late afternoon (today after 6 and only after a complaint), the amenities are not restocked even after requests, nor is the minibar restocked, which while not a major issue does cost the hotel money.

For us, we prefer to spend some more time in the hotel, then that may not be the prefect place. They do not have indoor swimming pool, the service is still at their slow movement speed. The communication is still a problem, I ask for a ""paper bag"" at the check-in counter ( at that moment, it is not busy), I had to speak to 2 ladies at the counter, then I get a A4 paper in return.

Love the Aromatheropy bath amenities - and it was a nice touch providing bath salt. Extra points goes to nespresso machine in the room too. I loved the bed although the pillow was too soft and flat so i didnt' sleep that well. The location was great~ i can easily access to casino and shopping malls.

There was nothing we could complain about. Everything is clean, staff is professional and nothing was in our way to have a fun stay in Macau.   The hotel is super convenient if you want to explore the new part of Macau. To get to the older part of Macau you need to get a taxi but that was very cheap and fast.",50

This was a disappointment but the rest of the stay was fantastic. The food is superb! We ordered a fair bit of room service especially the burger and the berries platter... SUPERB!   Being a fairly new hotel it was expected that there would be some loop holes in housekeeping and guest services/concierge. The staff need some training as they consistently gave wrong information about the pool. The steam room was under maintenance and the sauna was not hot enough.

My only disappointment was that we could not swim at night when the pools were lit with colored lights, but it was amazing to see from our room.  In fact, the whole complex has a light show at night. The Galaxy complex had great food options and a wonderful high-end shopping mall - so don't lose all your money in the casino!  During our stay a typhoon warning was issued and the staff was very informative about what we should do & not do to ensure our safety. Bus service provides round trip service from the ferry to the resort. Once at the resort bus‚Ä¶",50
"Unbelievable hotel.  It was like being in Vegas at the best hotel there.  The staff greeted us at the door and personally escorted us to the Executive lounge for check-in.  They seemed to have created a profile of us before we even arrived, so they were genuinely interested in how our trip was going.  We received an upgrade on the room which was fabulous.  Biggest room I have ever been in.  It was a room for a movie star it seemed.  The views were breathe-taking and service outstanding.  Staff helped us at the concierge as well with direction on transportation to other hotels and local sites.  Would recommend this hotel for any visit to Macau.",50
"This hotel is quieter and more sedate than the other Macau hotels.  The mable lined shopping center and casino are opulent and elegant.  Much nicer than the Cotai Central hotels (Conrad, Sheraton, Holiday Inn).  There isn't much of a theme.    The rooms are large and luxurious with good beds and floor to ceiling windows offering views of the pools and other hotels in Galaxy resort.  The only but major fault is that there is a window between the bedroom and bathroom so anyone using the toilet at night may wake up the other person in the room.  There is a switch that darkens the shade in the window but it isn't dark enough.   If the light is on in the toilet, it will illuminate the entire bedroom very brightly.  This seems to be a fault of some of the newer Marriott hotels and‚Ä¶",40
"Came back from a recent trip to China and now it is time to sit down and write some reviews. JW Marriott Hotel in Macau was the first hotel we stayed for a couple of nights in our trip. It was the best hotel we stayed in. The room is spacious and clean.  We even got a personal welcome message on the screen of the TV when we first turned on the TV. Their service were superb. Whenever we were wandering in the lobby or the corridor, someone always showed up politely and show us the way. The view from our room is gorgeous. We got the full view of the whole Galaxy complex as well as the Old Town. The Hotel is located within 5 minutes walk to the Old Town. We strolled down the Old Town one afternoon and enjoyed the traditional Portuguese food and see the traditional Portuguese‚Ä¶",50
The hotel lobby is very luxury. The staffs are all very nice. I booked a deluxe room but they gave me a surprise! They upgraded my room into an executive room! The room was very amazing especially the ÈúßÂåñÁéªÁíÉ. The room view is very good too. The air is very fresh there. It's very BRIGHT THERE SO I LOVE IT! The bathroom's TV is big. JW Marriott Hotel Macau is my most favourite hotel. ,50
"The hotel was recently built and rooms have nice modern features such as motorized blinds etc. The room was very clean and spacious with nice views of the pool. However, the check in process was little slow for a hotel of this category.",50
"Hotel was chosen by my husband for my birthday celebration.  It was definitely a great hotel and was newly opened this year.  I had stayed in quite a number of hotels in Macau before, such as Venetian, MGM, Hard Rock, new Lisboa, Ponte 16, Hyatt etc..  In comparison with all others, u definitely will choose to stay in this one again next time.  It's conveniently connected with a few shopping malls in which you can get all the brand stuffs, nice restaurants and if you prefer for a quick bite, food court is available.  It's also a walking distance to the ""walking street"" where you can have local Portuguese food and shark fin meals; and other local shops too.  As a platinum member of Marriott, we can have access to their lounge.  This is one of the greatest lounge we have ever been‚Ä¶",50
"Went with my partner for a 2 day 1 night short getaway. The hotel is quite new, the rooms are tidy with a modern vibe. We stayed on the 23rd floor with a nice view of the rest of the Galaxy area which was quite nice. The hotel is a 10 minute walk from the Venetian Mall, if not, they also provide shuttle buses to and from the Venetian in the Galaxy area. Overall the stay was good, but not excellent. One thing that put me off was the quality of the room service breakfast, we ordered nutella pancakes, but the quality was disappointing. And we were also disturbed by staff's door bell ringing during early hours for no reason. But other than that, it was a nice place to stay at for a good price and good room. ",40
"We stayed for two nights in a truly beautiful suite which was huge in size.  A problem with the safe was resolved within two hours of our phone call.  Night manager, Norman, was excellent.  We had access to the Executive Lounge and this is where our experience was outstanding.  We had a beautiful afternoon tea there on our first day. The staff there were thoroughly professional and exceptionally helpful (especially Jem, Rhyalin and Mathew) and the food and drinks served in the Executive Lounge were excellent.   Best Executive Lounge I have come across in my travels!  We ate at Urban Kitchen on our first night and I have written a separate review for the restaurant, because the variety at the buffet restaurant was excellent.  The second night, we ate at the Executive Lounge and‚Ä¶",50
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this fantastic resort. The rooms are very modern with all of the bells in whistles.  The bathroom toilet has 6 different settings alone : ).  The staff was outstanding and knew my entire family by name.  If you are looking for a GREAT hotel with outstanding service in Macau look no further ,50
"Although we only stayed here for the one night, the breakfast was very a good experience. The food was quite well as there was a wide variety of different kinds of food. Everybody there knew at least Chinese and english so the waitresses were able to cater to just about any of the customers. The waiters there not only did their best in fulfilling the wishes of their customers but also did a good job on making connections with and making them feel at home. It was quite the magnificent experience and I highly recommend it to all.",50
"As a AAA member, this hotel beats all the  Marriott hotels in Macau /Hong Kong.  Curtains remotely open as we entered the Premier room, Jun at the member's counter upgraded me to a premier room with two queen sized beds with a  COTAI view. Humongous bathroom with TV welcoming me.  Toto toilet with heated seats and selections for spray options like a  mini bidet.  Huge bathtub with bath salts made it super relaxing.  Nespresso machine and the closet between the bathroom and entrance has robes available inside closet. Room fit for 2 queens.  Only a 5 min.  Walk over to  old taipa village. connected to galaxy hotel and Ritz Carlton, and shops are open until  midnight.  Must try once.  Please indulge as we did.  ",50
I love their River pool ride that shared with other group hotels that nearby. the executive floor room is super luxury and great value$... and their excellent service provided by the executive lounge club. and the buffet that served on mezzanine floor in the hotel is excellent in service and good food serving all the time. I will  go again when my next trip in Macau,50
"The hotel is stunning. Rooms are lovely and bright.The service is more 'serviced apartments' than hotel. The hotel checkin process is long and disgraceful. We have stayed twice. On our first occasion we were told that we can only pre register to checkin after 12 30, we arrived at 12.. Fine. Then was told by the helpful Guest Relations that we could pre register earlier. She asked who had given us this information and I pointed the person out. To my disgust both of them were arguing with her that this was not the case. Appalling. This is JW Marriot, a supposedly 5 Star hotel. We than checked in on another date and this ordeal lasted 30 mins of trying to find our confirmed and paid for booking through a 3rd party. Same ordeal at check in. We had to ask for the manager as we were‚Ä¶",20
"Stayed here for a night in October after a night at the Four Seasons. Would say the JW Marriott is better for recreation, but the FS has better service quality.   Positives: - Booking process (initially on website and subsequent changes through email) was efficient, and made me look forward to the stay. - We got a premier room as part of the family package, which was very good - modern facilities and nice view.  - The kids club was great - our 5 year-old had a good time there. In the future it would be nice to have some supervised activities for young kids.  - Breakfast at Urban Kitchen had good variety of food/ drinks. Quality was ok.  - The swimming pools were great (good variety and size), with average food/ drinks options at the pool bar. - Staff were polite and helpful at‚Ä¶",40
The hotel is very good and feel relax to stay in especially room that have private pool. The price is reasonable cheap compare to facility. Service is fine. The location is convenience staying in the Promenade of Galaxy. I might recommend people to stay here for vacation which it make you feel like resort than hotel.,50
"If anyone would like first class treatment then you must stay at jw marriott macau. I have stayed at many marriott before and this tops the list. From the front door leader mohan to the reception people, everone made our stay top rate and enjoyable!!!!  The rooms were impecable with a great view to the enormous pool area. It is a 6 star hotel if there is such a thing. ",50
Stay there 14 dec to 17 dec. Booked 3 rooms and Stayed 3 nights with sister families. The doors lock come with high tech security . One of our room door 17206 batter was flat and could not be open . The house keeping did not clean our room the previous day probably because of that but they did not feedback . This morning I was stuck outside of my room. They made me went down to concierge twice and waited for more than one hour before they sent someone to change the lock. I went to the hotel manager to feedback on this event and they just told me that they were sorry that this happen.,30
"This was my second time to stay in JW Marriott Macao.  First time in Jun during their opening, I would comment that the hotel was excellent.   The first time I went there in Jun during their opening, I would comment that their staff was not ready, lots of problems but I don't want to give in details (the hotel made a special offer to me to stay again in JW Macao, to experience their normal standard service ~ it showed their efforts to retain a single customer, highly appreciate), and in fact, it was  wonderful and seamless (from the Executive Suite room itself and staff services) for my second stay in Oct.  Their buffet breakfast was wonderful as well.  ",50
"Surprised to have meet a dutch national over there called Ralph Griffioen whom have the excellent service provide to Marriott's valuable client. The other personnels are friendly and helpful too, and is glad that Marriott's operation team is really doing some hard work to promote Marriott's image in the Asia Pacific Region.",50
"I registered the mailing list and JW Marriot's offer I booked was irresistable. 2 nights for the price of one, I paid only HKD 1,800 for two nights. With the offer in mind, I expected a normal room, with no complaint. When I visited the receptionist, I was surprised that I was upgraded without request to a suite for two nights! When I stepped my feet into the room, it was mindblowing. At the 32th floor, the view is amazing and the deco is classy and advanced. Even the mirror of the washroom screen has a tv in it. It is impeccably clean and the furnishing is startling bright. Their is a ceiling chandelier which hooked my eyes for minutes. I was speechless. No doubt, 5 stars rating for sure. Checking in and out was smooth, most probably because of the lesser crowd. With the offer‚Ä¶",50

Convenient shuttle free shuttle bus to the Cotai ferry terminals. 5 minutes bus ride to the Chinese and 15 minutes to cross the border into China - HeQingZhen which is very close to ZhuHai. Within the Galaxy Casino Complex, there are many boutique shops, food courts, restaurants and cinemas. Fellow travellers beware the world outside of this complex is completely different - old fashioned and ugly. The pool is great but except it closed too early. Nonetheless, it is a modern hotel with all the necessary elements for a magnificent hotel.",50

"Nice hotel in the Galaxy gambling center. Spacious rooms without any special vies.  Easy access to the luxury shops and casino directly from the hotel.  Galaxy is higher end gaming vs. at least the down town older casino hotels and other premises.  Complex too is spacious and rather quiet, maybe because of lack of mainland tourists after Xi Jingping's cut off the gambling of government money.  There are two ferry terminals in Macau; Taipa and Macau Maritime terminals. Taipa is closer to JV Marriot so you should take your ferry in Hong Kong Sheung Wan (in connection with the same name subway station) to Taipa.

The baggage service was great and allow us to store our bags there before we got our rooms. We got free drinks when signed up for membership. We stayed on 27th floor and the view of our room is beautiful facing the pool area. My parents' room was facing the open land which was not very nice. The toilet seat was heated!

My wife returned to the room by herself at about 8:30pm. When she opened the room, she saw the curtains opening automatically. She was frightened by this strange and sudden movement and rushed down to the lobby. She was shocking and told the front desk staff what had happened.

Anna was very helpful and offered to escort me somewhere else for check in which I declined.  Kumar was a great concierge,  he recommended places to visit and activities to do.  Both were great in their hospitality.  We had a chance to have some of our meals at the executive Lounge and everyone pampered us.

The Executive Lounge staff, particularly Inga from Mongolia, were outstanding!  From A to Z, an excellent visit!",50
"Our room was facing the other 2 towers in Galaxy and the view is superb especially at night. The executive club lounge serves us well with  breakfast, tea and dinner. The staffs are friendly and detail. The whole environment just made us so comfortable that a 2 nights stay are not enough. Overall, it's a wonderful stay experience for our short trip.",50
"Our visit to Macau was an ad hoc side trip when visiting Hong Kong. Decided to play safe and chose Marriott Hotel. It turned out to be the highlight of our vacation. Magnificent design, beautiful grounds, pools, lazy river, cabanas, casinos and all you can think in terms of shopping.   Marriott staff as always supreme, tended to all our needs.  I wish we had more time to stay longer.",50
"Pros: 1) Free shuttle from Outer Harbour Ferry Terminal to hotel door.  There are free shuttles from some other destinations.  Not sure whether it is easy to get out from the hotel by free shuttle.  2)  Generally the room is clean and the view was fine  However, the hotel guide book was vandalized by some previous customers.  3)  The technician who visited my room twice at 4 to 5 a.m. was helpful and in good manner.  4)  The buffet dinner at the hotel restaurant is reasonably priced with good variety of food.  Cons: 1) I need to sleep in total darkness but this hotel could not offer me so.  The night lights under the bed and under the toilet sink could not be switched off during my stay.

I cannot do it justice by just describing it nor posting pictures of it. (But do go on a virtual tour of the hotel to get an idea).  Our experience with the staff was very personalized. We had hassle-free check-in with the hotel associates. Our daily morning breakfast started our day wonderfully thanks to the manager (Boney) and his team.

This hotel is only 5 months old but everything feels settled and running smoothly. We stayed in an executive suite on the 31st floor. It was beautifully finished and comfortable. The executive lounge was first class. 'Cliff' the manager there was more than helpful. Loves his job. One comment..not a criticism but I don't understand why designers don't provide more hanging space and drawers. We were a couple on an extended trip and staying in the hotel for 5 nights.We wanted to unpack. In a very large suite there were NO drawers to allow us to unpack? There was space for only one suit case on the rack.I don't get it?,50

The staff is extremely helpful and kind, although some small details still need to be ironed out, their good attitude and approach are truly remarkable. I was throughly impressed by the warm and genuine care of the employees working at the Executive Lounge and by the lovely lady ¬®Gloria¬®, from the Philippines, working at the Urban Kitchen Restaurant.",50

The rooms are large and have all the features you will ever wanted, including heated toilet seats.  A real testimony to modern technology and comfort!   The breakfast location is also very good. One of the better offering in Macau.  I have tried most of them.  The best part is the use of the ritz offering, including the Ritz bar in the sky lobby.  Finally!!! A little of Vegas in Macau!!  The ritz cafe in the mall is also very good but very heavy.  True French cooking.   All in all, a real welcome addition to Macau.

What won us over was the staff. Starting at the reception with Ana who answered all our questions and was most gracious, the warm hugs of Gloria in Urban Ladder or the effusive help of Kase from the concierge desk not to forget our bell boy and the pool attendants at the lazy river. It became a home away from home. Will definitely want to revist.",40

The ultra long lazy river and the large wave pool (with a small artificial beach) are superb.  There are lots of choices with regard to restaurants at the complex itself.  Shuttlebuses are available to/from both ferry piers, the airport and central macau (starworld hotel). Also there is a shuttle bus which just circles the complex.  A tip for the evenings is also the broadway Macau at the other side of the street (reachable by covered walkway) where you can enjoy live music outside. provided it isn't too hot of course....",50
We went to Macau for a one night to celebrate my daughter's 10th birthday. Top tips and observations: 1.  Book your ferry ticket from HK beforehand - surprisingly our preferred time was fully booked. 2. The hotel is amazing !! The normal check in is at 3 pm but see if they have an early check-in available. 3. Get the galaxy hotel shuttle - it leaves every 10 minutes and is convenient. 4. Go to the Kids club its fantastic (for kids) Well run. 5. The Spaghetti house for dinner was brilliant  - a cool show with the pizza chef was a welcome surprise! 6. Breakfast - 10 / 10 - really worth it. 7. The water park outside was brilliant ! Note - The kids water park has a on and off button on the floor which is impossible to find but if you press it the play ground kicks into life. ,50
"Comparing to that in Hong Kong, hotels in Macau especially Cotai are much bigger. This Marriott hotel is spacious, no matter its room size, public srea, restaurants, club lounge or pool facilities. Room design is simple and modern, yet fully equipped with anything you may need. I love its wardrobe which can be opened from the bathroom but the door is 'invisible'. The recreation facilities such as spa, gym, kids club and different types of pool are another selling point. Services are excellent and warm with a higher proportion of English speaking staff.

Last month  My mom and I went macau had a tea set in JW it was great and a lot of choices.I like the style of the spinning tea set the good thing is they have the promotion discount.I admired the friendliness and the service of the staff in the lobby especially Farah thank you.we will definitely come back.,50
"We were treated with royalty during our recent short but sweet stay at this luxury hotel. Staff were always helpful and provided excellent guest services. Many thanks to Jayson, Angel, Kim, Owen, Cliff and the entire team.",50
"This hotel is recently opened and located at the Galaxy Resort Second Phase, Cotai, Macau.  There are several hotels belonging to the same group located nearby and you can have a variety to choose from cheap to expensive one.  JW Marriott has built up as with brand for high class.  The room is spacious, comfortable and facilities are excellent.  The hotel provides free WiFi which is very stable and convenient.  The price is not as high as I suppose it should be.  I consider it a value-for-money hotel to stay in for holiday. The staff are helpful and hospital.  The check-in process is considered quick and efficient. But I think the hotel management may need to devise a better way for queuing as customers naturally go to the reception counter directly without knowing in fact there‚Ä¶",50
"Room 26256, beautiful 180 view of Galaxy, pools and waterways. The amenities are first rate, but the personalized service is even better. From Lauro Hildebrandt who took a personal interest during my fianc√©'s illness to the staff serving breakfast at Urban Kitchen who greeted us by name and worked to exceed our expectations. The Front Desk and Concierge staff were excellent. Finally, Mohan who helped us with our bags to the bus upon our departure was open to inquiry, offered every assistance, addressed our every question and provided us with a comfort level to embark on the next leg of our journey. Kudos!",50
We did not stay in the hotel but we went to urban kitchen for brunch buffet and Gloria served us and she just make the whole experience even better being so friendly and helpful. Thank you Gloria We will definitely come back and stay in the hotel,50
"We were absolutely stunned by the personal service at this property! We felt genuinely welcomed by everyone and felt like we were being ""included in the family"" here. We were greeted by name at every occasion and the staff took a keen interest in getting to know us, and letting us get to know them. In particular, Inga was such a help, going above and beyond on more than one occasion! What an absolute delight! We looked forward to seeing her every day and felt sad to leave our new friend on our last night. Cliff, who spent so much time with us helping plan our Hong Kong day trip, shared with us such wonderful stories and was always there to lend a hand! Mavis, Kumar and Francesca - all so wonderful and genuine! And everyone from the housekeeping staff and I'm sure I'm forgetting‚Ä¶",50

"JW Marriot is one of the hotels in the Galaxy Macau Resort destination. The room was huge and luxurious. It's probably the only Marriot that offers free wifi, no doubt curtesy of the casino. The shuttle terminal is quite impressive - with over 10 routes to various hotels and ports.",50
"While we were checking in, a lady was giving out the welcome drink. That was a sweet touch. A lady called Peewee, in black suit. She checked us in, she was super helpful and nice. Very professional. Really good impression for our first time visit.  The room is really nice with the pool view. Very spacious. Kids friendly, as im travelling with my 16months boy. Breakfast is delicious, with alot of variety.  The only bad comment is, the life guard at jw marriot pool. He is rude and not welcoming. I was with my boy swimming, and wanted to take the jw towel up to the room. And he said its not allowed. Oh really, inside has air con. And my boy is expected to go in the hotel, dripping water to go back to the hotel.  Apart from this, my stay had been wonderful. One last thing is, they‚Ä¶",50
"We traveled to Macau for a short weekend away and stayed at JW Marriot. In the past, I stayed at the Okura and really enjoyed it but JW Marriot proved to be even better. Let me start with the positives:  Pros - Rooms - when we arrived, we were told that they could not provide a non-smoking twin room and we were then asked if we would mind a smoking room on the 7th floor that had a jacuzzi. The person said that its still a premier room and that it was not the room with a whirlpool. The jacuzzi was a really nice touch and the view was simply amazing.   - Breakfast - The selection at breakfast was good but i wanted to mention breakfast because of the bread station. Every single thing we had from the bread station was really good - even the waffles that were cold tasted really good!‚Ä¶",40
"Me and my girlfriend stayed at the JW Marriott for a staycation coming over from the Hong Kong side for 2 days just to celebrate our 2nd year anniversary. This hotel is beautiful with amazing price-quality. Everybody is so friendly and helpful, always ready to reach out a helping hand in need of assistance.  We would like to give out our sincere thanks to Aaron at the Front Office who has checked us in. Although the hotel has not received our e-mail stating that we are celebrating our anniversary, Aaron took immediate action and showed his genuine care as he upgraded us to a Premier Executive Suite for one night.  On a small note, what would have made our stay even more amazing would have been music speakers in the room or perhaps more radio channels on the TV. We found 3 radio‚Ä¶",40
"The Galaxy Macau , houses 5-6 hotels, one of them is the JW Marriott , we had a lovely stay , the room came with a beautiful view of the complete galaxy resort , and the fantastic pool area activities. the breakfast spread was amazing and so was the service   everywhere in the hotel.",40
"What a fantastic stay.  First off, getting to the hotel is easy.  Take the Galaxy shuttle from Macau Ferry Terminal and the hotel is the 3rd stop (the shuttle assistant will advise as such).  Upon arrival, check-in was quick and personable.  The suite assigned to me was outstanding both in comfort and quality of fixtures and amenities.  The Executive Lounge is possibly the best that I have experienced in all Marriotts and many Ritz Carlton's.  It is staffed with an efficient and kind staff.  There is tons of seating and selection of F&B items was superb.  The hotel has a wonderful and relaxing complex of pools and hot tub.  Additionally, there is access at the pool area to the lazy river water pool - terrific!  The pool is a quiet retreat amid the exciting ambiance of Galaxy‚Ä¶",50
"Stayed in this hotel for 2 nights in our 6 nights vacation in Macau.  After the pampering that we got from Sheraton Macau I am expecting the same or even more as the rate of JW Marriott is much higher.  We stayed in a high floor.  The view of the room was really amazing.  It is overlooking the lazy river, pools of JW Marriott, Ritz Carlton as well as the wave pool of the Galaxy Macau.  Such a beautiful sight specially at night.   I was able to use the resort pool the next day and it was cool and fun place.  The room has a modern minimalist design with push button curtains, coffee machine, high tech toilet. I find the room lacking enough cabinets and drawers though.  Service of the front desk in the lounge was warm and friendly.  I liked their set up of tea time in the afternoon.‚Ä¶",50
"I was staying at the corner room with huge windows both sides.  This JW Marriott in Macau deliver the perfect balance of luxury and classy hip modern, as usual the buffet breakfast provide a good variety of food, but not only food, surprisingly they also provide a good selection of drinks.   Staying at JW Marriott, you can also gain the access to the main water park with wave pool, kids pool, and lazy river etc.. very very well done.",50
I am a frequent traveler staying at hotel over 120 nights annually.  I have stay at many hotels in Macau over the past 10+ years and my experience at JW Marriott is definitely the best one in the recent years.  Excellent services from check-in to departure.  The staff at check-in counter was warm and friendly.  Another staff walked me to my room so I don‚Äôt get lost in the massive size hotel and showed me the facility in my room.  This new hotel is furnished with what you expect out of a 5 start hotel.  The food at Urban Kitchen was tasty and full of choices.  Definitely coming back here next time.,50
"this hotel is part of the Galaxy expansion along with Ritz Carlton. the room is very confortable and offers a nice view on the central part of Galaxy pools / lagoon.  everything is quite high tech in the room. curtains are automatic, the japanese style toilets has a control plannel with 10 buttons to operate ... there is the mandatory nespresso machine that most high end hotel have now.  Check in was very efficient, i even met a fellow frenchman who was very helpful and dedicated to assist.  The casino was fine as they recently added Poker to their list of games, it might attract more westerners, as games such as Baccarat or Sick Bo aren't so popular in the western world.  Galaxy has some drawbacks, it doesn't have any fine dinings options like Grand Lisboa does (last i checked‚Ä¶",40
"I stayed at this hotel one week after it was opened, and it was one of the worst experiences I have experienced. It was not one isolated incident, nor one incident of a magnitude that would warrant a single star on a stand alone basis, rather in aggregate the issues, and more specifically the handling of relatively small issues was my issue.  After I sent a note and wrote a response on trip advisor, the general manager contacted me. We discussed at length on the phone some of the issues and I did get the feeling this was not pampering, rather was sincer in addressing and despite the hotel only being open a week, was very upset at how the issues were handled.  Last weekend we decided to return to the hotel to give another shot, and we were amazed. The breakfast was still one of‚Ä¶",50
"The hotel itself was nice. Checked in by Hughes who took good care of us while we were waiting for our room. The room was big and met all my requests, good room assignment!     Housekeeping was also polite,fast and greeted us every morning with smiles. The negative side was about the shuttle service, drivers seemed to be rude as one of the passengers getting off at the last stop carrying a baby requested some help with the luggages, the driver simply said ""go get it yourself"" and closed the door. What made it funny was, he actually got off the driver seat few mins before that to chat with a female colleague. I mean you could at least ask other staffs to help if you really cant ""get off"" from your driver seat?",40
"JW Marriott Macau is new, room is very spacious and fully equipped. The mini bar is terrific too. Their buffet breakfast in Urban Kichen is also very good and famous with very good service . In there  we met one of their good staff ,Gloria, whom is so helpful and friendly.  We really look forward to staying and enjoy breakfast in this hotel again in the future! Awesome!",50
"This is my second time here! AS usual, it's good!   My family visit Macau frequently, I recommend JW Marriott to them, and they love it!   This hotel is kids friendly, and because Galaxy group, Marriott has amazing waterpark and water activity.  Also, on 3F, there is a playground for kids.     Good vacation gateway for parents to consider",50
"Excellence screams from every experience that we had here right from the rooms to the dining,shopping and the casino. Great attention to detail and all of the staff are extremely warm and friendly. True Asian hospitality personified. Special mentions for some staff starting with Ana at the front office for her welcoming smile and patience, Gloria at Urban Ladder for her warmth and making sure we were well fed, Kase at the concierge for being so patient and going the extra mile and Pawan the bellboy. Thankyou for making our trip extremely special",50

Both of whom clearly showed personal attention to our needs par excellence .the pool attendants at the winding pool even the casino attendants were professionally flawless wonderful vacation and I highly recommend this hotel",50
"So far the best 5-star hotel in Macau.  Staff are friendly, helpful and with attention to detail.  Great facilities in the pool and the gym.  Thanks to the team in the cafe (Urban Kitchen) for the hearty breakfast, esp. Gloria for taking care of our boy.  Definitely will come back again.",50
"We have stayed in a lot of Marriott hotels in recent years but we have never experienced a service and welcoming feeling as we did in our stay at the 5 star JW Marriott Macau Hotel.  From the minute we arrived until we checked out of the hotel three days later everyone was very attentive and making sure that we didn't miss a thing.  We had booked an executive floor room with access to the Executive Club on the second floor - what an experience. We arrived early after a flight from Europe and our room wasn't ready. However, The manager of the executive lounge, Cliff made us feel very welcome and ensured that the process of getting the room ready was quickened so we only had to wait about 10 minutes while he served us snacks and drinks.

"This hotel is a very splendidly decorated. The check in counter comprises of illuminated tables which is very chic. It is strange that there is a notice on it saying the checkout time is 11am, etc. The room is also nice. The bathroom door design is quite special, that it attaches to the wall when open and it contains a big mirror. The room contains a large TV , may be >46 inch, which is quite rare in other hotels. I wonder if there is heated swimming pool as the weather is getting cool. There is a wide variety of food choices at the Buffet breakfast. However, I find the beef sausage delicious.",40
This is a huge hotel property with a glamorous feel.  Kudos to Cliff Hamer who helps manage the executive lounge.  Cliff and his staff have perfected customer service.  Thanks for making all guest feel special.  The pool area is great.  The rooms are stylish. Look forward to another visit.,50
"Had a short trip with other families so the kids can play together at the water park. Turned out the water park is world class and didn't let us down, and the newly opened hotel is pretty good too. The room and hotel facilities are 5 star, service is 4 star, still pretty good in Macau standard. What surprised me is that there are lots of staff who can speak decent English. While I got my room around 2pm, one of my friends who arrived in the morning didn't get their room until 5pm. Each of the hotels in the Galaxy complex has their own private pools, and all share a common water park. Hotel also has a pretty good and large kids play room. Overall we all had a good time with this kids friendly hotel.",40
"I suppose enough would have been said by other reviewers about the top class quality of the room and services provided by the staff of this hotel which I agree without much needed to be added.  Just wish to highlight 2 points other than the quality of the amenities and services of the hotel which gave rise to the title of this review:  1. it gives almost the nearest access (so I was told) to the water park at the Galaxy resort project. There is no need for my wife and me to walk long distance in order to bring our young children to the pools and facilities.  2. it (together with other hotels at the Galaxy resort project) allows a walking distance access to the ""old town"" of Taipa, making it extremely convenient for the family to dine out and shop for souvenirs around that area‚Ä¶",50
We stayed at the JW with our 18 month old daughter.  The staff were so friendly and helpful. They all went above and beyond to make our stay wonderful and easy.  The rooms are spacious and for the most part child friendly.  I highly recommend the kids club ( staff were so caring) and a day spent at the pool with your little one.    The rooms were super clean and comfortable and and the cot supplied was new and clean.  The cleaners are understanding and can clean the room around your babies nap times.  Turn down service is also such a treat!  If you are looking for attentive staff and a child friendly hotel then this is the spot for you.  Thanks again JW for the great family getaway.  We will be back!,50
"At arrival you are greeted by very nice staff. The checking was smooth and efficient. We got a room high up with a nice view over the ""Waterland"". The 2 single beds was Queen size. The room was large and was smelling very nice. The hotel is located in the GALAXY area. This is a huge complex. A family with children can spend a whole day in the ""Waterland"". There are plenty of restaurants with different price level. There are plenty of shops, something for everybody. The Casino is huge. There are something for everybody. The ""Clubfloor"" is for business people. The breakfast was GREAT, everything was fresh.",50
"No wonder JW offers 5 stars service. Specious room with great room service, nothing is beatable. Large bed and soft pillow which is very comfy, I feel like home during my stay.The pool was fun and exciting, my kid enjoyed it so much. I wanna extend my stay in Macau because of it and hopefully I will be back very soon!!!",50
"We stayed at the JW Marriott in Macau in early August 2015, and truly enjoyed it as a weekend family getaway from Hong Kong.  The hotel is new and facilities look that way -- clean and sparkling all around.  The service was wonderful, with friendly and efficient check in and smiles and greetings from everyone.  The room was huge, with plenty of space for my husband and I and our three children (a rollaway bed fit beside the two double beds easily), and the Marriott beds are always very comfortable.  Large bathroom with a great tub, separate shower and toilet with all kinds of bells and whistles to amuse the kids to no end.  The height of our stay was the staff in the Executive Lounge.

"The rooms and facilities of the hotel itself is really good. But then the poor services from check-in to security ... dramatically down graded the hotel. I am not saying all staffs are poor but if you happened to bump into more than 5 poor staffs in a 5 star hotel.... that's not a good percentage!  At the check-in counter, there were two different lines for check-in; there's no sign or what so ever to distinguish their differences. We picked a shorter one and a friendly staff came immediately to ask if we have the booking document printed out. We had our hotel voucher printed out before so we said yes. If fact, we found out later on that it was totally another thing, it's a ticket that was printed out from another counter....  so we go all the way to line up again....  The room‚Ä¶",20

In addition, there was plenty of space for your luggage and clothes.  Room had impressive view of the Galaxy complex including the water resort, all the swimming pools and fun activity pools.

Super tidy, you can't even find a trace of dust or soap residue from previous guests at the bathroom (kudos, housekeepers you really did a great job!)  One little thing though,  -we requested an additional coffee and it arrived like after an hour, and I personally think that they could still improve the response time. -hotel guests, just a friendly reminder, ALWAYS, always check the minibar, there might be few stuffs missing that they forgot to replace - I‚Ä¶",40

"We stayed at JW Marriott last weekend with our 2 children Mr 8 and Miss 6 to celebrate my husbands birthday and we loved every minute of it. From the moment we checked in the service from the friendly staff was excellent! We enjoyed all day at the pool, the kids (and us!) loved the lazy river and slides. We ate dinner at the BBQ by the pool area, it was a beautiful setting and had a DJ playing great music. The staff were able to arrange a birthday cake for my husband and all sang ""happy birthday"" to him as well.  I would recommend JW Marriott to all my family and friends.",50
Recommend this new hotel. It is stylish and value for money. We also enjoyed the buffet lunch in urban kitchen restaurant. Crazy river is a must try within the complex. It was fun and exciting. Will stay again,50

I went to Urban Kitchen for breakfast, there was a long queue when I arrived but I only waited for 10 min to be seated. Their breakfast buffet is amazing! You get a wide selections of traditional Asian and western breakfast. I have to say out of all hotels in Macau this is the best breakfast place!  The location of the hotel is only 10 min walk to the old Taipa village where there are many local goodies and restaurants.  Overall I love this hotel and will for sure be back very soon.

The rooms and at least JW Marriott Standard and everywhere You can expect excellent Service. The surrounding area is Luxus and Entertainment, unfortunately there is nothing like old City etc.",50
"The new JW Marriott is part of a huge complex of hotels and gaming areas, cinemas and leisure activities. You can check in and literally not step out for the rest of your short stay. The rooms are large and spacious, the view facing the sea and the lazy river and the pool park is awesome. The thoughtful gestures of an MP3 player and Nespresso machine in the room are much appreciated. A word of warning though for the ladies: the corridors are endless and the marble floors not very forgiving of high heels!!! The Urban Kitchen restaurant is world class and has surprising delicacies all day long",40
"To be honest, I originally wanted to stay at Ritz Carlton but it was full, so I booked JW instead. I think I made the right decision!  - Staff (almost everyone, especially Ms Princess at check-in counter and other people at information counter) were very friendly, helpful and patient - I was holding a lot of things and the guy at lobby actually ran to me and asked if I needed help - free wifi within Galaxy area - usual check-in time is 3pm but our room was already ready at 1:30pm - Room was spacious and decent - free bath salt (which I didn't expect) - free shuttle bus to/from pier, main tourist spots - breakfast buffet was a feast!

Common theme: both have excellent lazy rivers, very fun for the whole family.  There's also a kids zone where you can pay ~$15 USD for two hours of supervised play (big bonus for parents).  If you are not traveling as a family but as a couple, this hotel is also for you.

One doesn't really need to talk about the Galaxy complex - huge shopping complex with restaurants galore ( for various budgets) and good choice of shopping if you really want to part with your cash. Its probably the most visited complex after the Venetian lot its lustre ( too crowded and almost 100percent mainland tourists)   It is what a new hotel is - everything looks and feels new and the decor was glitzy and gold - tying in with the ""sin city"" feel of the entire complex.

I would prefer them near the bed where I could reach easily from the bed. The staff at the concierge definitely needs more trainings. I asked a girl at the concierge what's there at the Broadway.

As the room card will only be ready by 3 pm, we just went out to our planned location.... There are quite a lot of free shuttles to popular places...but it needs to queue up.

The bathtub could have been cleaned better (just because the previous guest didn't use it doesn't mean the cleaning staff should skip it). The electronic toilet could have come with some sort of instructions, no idea how to use it for even a techie like me. Check-in time could have been moved earlier.   Otherwise, it was a fantastic stay as most of the hotel and room amenities are brand new.",40
"We booked a breakfast + Galaxy deck special package for the weekend to try the new Galaxy pool facilities....Hugely disappointing. 1. Check-in is normally at 15:00. We showed up at 14:45 and our room wasn't ready, which is disappointing but understandable. We went for late lunch and returned at 16:30. The staff informed me that all non-smoking floor rooms were already fully booked, and asked me if I could accept a smoking-floor room, although I requested a baby cot during my booking. 2. When we finally arrived at the room, a vacuum cleaner was blocking access to the door. We asked a cleaning staff if the room was ready, and he said that he didn't know. 3. After clearing the vacuum cleaner, I noticed that the magnetic lock was broken. I asked a staff and he replied that the lock‚Ä¶",20

"Attracted by the new facilities and opening hotel room package, I decided to stay at JW Marriot on my holiday on 15 August. The rate was high - $3300 per night - perhaps because it was a Saturday. However, what I got from JW Marriot was nothing comparable to the price I paid.  Firstly, this visit to JW Marriot was intended to celebrate my partner's birthday. When I made my booking months ago, I specified that this was a visit to celebrate the occasion and was asking in the remarks if there were any arrangements that could be made prior to my arrival, be they a card or a pre-ordered birthday cake. However, I was not contacted by any means and unsurprisingly, no arrangements were made. More shockingly, it was not until I had entered my hotel room when the person at the check-in‚Ä¶",20
Nice typical Marriott standard hotel. Not the greatest in Macau but sufficiently pleasant for a weekend getaway. Executive rooms offer great value with separate checkin/out and access to a lounge that serves good quality food and wine throughout the day. Cleanliness needs to improve though especially in the bathroom!,40
Staying in a deluxe room with a friend for a weekend trip. What a great pleasure to stay at JW Marriott which opened recently in May. Hotel is brand new. Room is spacious and clean. The amenities set in room is very detailed as they even provided bathing salt with lavender fragrance. What a thoughtful treat for guests going for a weekend escape. :),50
"The first thing want to say is, check in time is quite long! Counter service is good, maybe too many people check in at these same time? Step inside the room (my room is at 19/F), wa, spacious and with great view! Wonderful! Free espresso and water, what miss out is instruction on how to use the espresso machineüòÖ wifi speed is good and just love the swimming pool facilities! Remember to bring the key card with you even go inside the swimming pool! ",40
"I chose JW Marriott because it is in the new Phase II having the new lazy river and water slides.  Last year we stayed in Hotel Okura.  We stayed in a Premier room almost at the centre of the building having a resort view facing Phase I (Galaxy Hotel, Banyan Tree and Hotel Okura).  The view was stunning.    All the deco and facilities are of 6-star standard.  But unfortunately the service is not of the same standard.  Whereas this hotel has its own swimming pools, their guests can enjoy Grand Resort Deck also.  To enjoy the hotel's pools, guests need to register once at the entrance and register again at the Grand Resort Deck entrance which is a bit inconvenience.  It has a 24-hour gym.  I could use that even after dinner.  it is fully equipped with all new machines.  Everything‚Ä¶",40
"‚ÄúThis review is principally of the executive lounge. We have just checked in on 15 August and came to the executive lounge for their billed afternoon tea. The lounge decoration is modern but like an airport transit lounge and with atmosphere to match. The afternoon tea took a bit of finding as it was so small and I had to go to the reception desk with the empty bowl of cream before I could get some one to replenish it, the crockery and the cutlery.¬†  Admittedly it is a new hotel but there is much scope for improvement here.

This shows how ""well trained"" the front desk are when they encounter numerous check in at the same time and alloted rooms which are already been taken up! My family was upset and so was the other party.

I also noted huge queues for checkin/out- suggest you join rewards programme and use the dedicated booth. Use the in-room bill check facility too to help streamline the bill process in case of errors. My package was billed incorrectly, I let them know the day before, and it was sorted by check out time.

Electric blinds, Hi-tech Japanese toilet, 3 televisions, marble bathroom. Hotel lobby was luxurious and beautiful. Very convenient for Grand Resort Deck and the new water rapid and water slide attractions. Marriott has its own excellent pool and also a kids pool with slides. There is a kids club which is great too. Has a buffet restaurant which is good but pricey. lack of variety in terms of food options in hotel and Galaxy development. Either high end or low end catering for mainland Chinese clientele.",50
"We stayed here for 3 nights during our recent visit to Macau.  Pros: - Big hotel with extensive shuttle services at Galaxy Macau (and with shorter queues than Venetian) - Very new room with big luxurious bathroom - water theme park like swimming pool facilities with lazy river, wave pool and jacuzzis - walking distance from Taipa Village - very near to Macau airport - Friendly service Though we encountered a situation where the connecting door was not properly locked, it was rectified promptly.   Cons: - Food choices within Galaxy Macau are limited and expensive - Rigid check-in and check-out timings  Get a higher level and pool facing room!  ",50
"We stayed 2 nights at retreat pool suite with private pool and it was absolutely disappointing. The first pool was digusting, full of sticky moss at the bottom of pool. The condition was basically not ready for any customers. This is a big concern esp. for a family with kids. When I asked for a room change, the guy named Leo didn't know how to handle, kept saying to get someone to clean the pool with moss instead of a change, which means, I need to wait may be 3 hrs or up for them to clean up! And the funniest thing was, as I knew he was simply not capable to handle, and asked for a senior one to talk to, he rejected to provide his senior's name as well as he claimed that his senior was not responsible for this!

They did had a separate member counter for check-in & out but the speed of service is extremely slow. Even slower than the normal counter. My bad experience that when I was checking in, a mainland guy just stood next to me and watching my form. When I shout to him that these were my private information, the receptionist started to realize this and spoke to him. The room size is small, cleaning OK and nicely decorated. The price is high and not worth with the services standard provided. I should trusted the other review that the poor services here.",20

Although I must admitted we were allocated a great room facing the resort.  The breakfast items are great but it's difficult to find a table after 8:30. The most frustrating part comes with the lack of knowledge about our package purchased. We have to chase every item to see if it was included.

Special mention for Upama and Emily Jenna Smith who never fail to make a guest feel comfortable.   The rooms are airy and huge with a magnificent view of the hotel Galaxy Macau.

"We are a Japanese family, we travelled there for a short family vacation from Kyoto Japan with our 2 year old. The rooms were perfect, the restaurants lovely, the staff so pleasant and helpful, really special service. Huge pool enough to play around, superb spa, I had a treatment which were really good. The whole place is new and luxurious irradiates both excitement and relaxation. Really nice. Facility also offer Kids play room with only few charges made my 2 year old so happy. Stayed 3 nights in Hong Kong this time but definitely longer for my next trip.",50
"Everyone knows that Macau is looking to diversify away from gaming and try and attract a wider set of holiday makers.  So with the opening of the second phase of the Galaxy development, I brought the family to experience the new JW Marriott hotel.  After a lovely relaxing weekend stay, I can confirm that the visit managed to exceed my expectations in terms of the accommodation and service that I was hoping to experience.  Yes it is a new hotel, but I think that teething problems have been, in the main, ironed out.  Any outstanding issues are just as likely to be caused by the fact that the place is damned busy, especially on check in and check out.  However, this is not uncommon for any of the larger hotels in Macau to be honest.  I visited with family including 3 kids, 8-12‚Ä¶",50
Stayed at the JW hotel macau on 27 June. Convenient shuttle bus service at the Macau ferry terminal and it stopped at the hotel entrance so you could check in right away. The pools and the resort desk are excellent. Must visit and good value for money as it is included in the room. View from the room is nice with the pool view. Concierge people are very helpful.,50
"My friend and I are always like to try new hotels in Macau. Everytime when we heard about new propotities in Macau we will immediately plan to go for it. But most of the experiences are not that good except JW Marriott! We did enjoy good room services and great tasty food inside new restaurants! I especially love the atmosphere of the lobby, excellent design!",50
"Stayed at this hotel for 3 days 2 nights. The executive room we booked is modern, big and comfortable, equipped with rain shower, bathtub and big LCD TVs (in toilet as well).  The service in executive lounge is impeccable. We use the executive lounge several times for breakfast, afternoon tea (2:30-5:00 pm) and dinner (after 5:30 pm). The spread of breakfast in executive lounge is limited; there is no noodle stall, pancake, waffles in the executive lounge so I would suggest everyone to enjoy their breakfast in urban kitchen at 1/F instead if they are entitled to do so. For afternoon tea, there are not many choices. Only macron, sandwiches, fruit tarts and drinks are available. The dinner in executive lounge is in buffet style with noodle stall, lam rack, chicken, smoked salmon‚Ä¶",40
"It is new in macau, so we were excited to try. We had a room with the club lounge. However, as a 5 stars hotel, the service at the lobby and lounge need to be improved. The staff at lounge made me feel like i was having dimsum in chinese restaurant which the staff always try to ignore customers and give bad service. One female staff is friendly and helpful, but others... It is mainly how i feel about the stay this time.  Other things are very standard as in macau,  nothing surprise us. ",30
"hotel environment and room are spacious. the outdoor swimming pools facilities are nice and interesting. there are various playing zone can suit your needs. you can spend the whole afternoon there. there is a kid zone in hotel can take care your loving kids too.  however, there is not much own restaurants in hotel and the urban kitchen was fully booked (dinner buffet during my stay). the only thing that it doesn't suit me is the pillow. maybe i need to ask for change in next visit.",40
"We have been to Macau many times before and stayed at other amazing hotels but we loved the JW Marriott so I am writing a review.  The good Great service - every member of staff is friendly and helpful from Princess who helped us check in to Moj who helped us checkout. The lounge staff in particular were receptive to our requests and extremely accommodating. The hotel itself is beautiful not easy to achieve as the standards are pretty high all over COD and the hotels all look the same from outside but it's understated and classy.  The room was large, spacious and well appointed, it also had a great view and an electrically switchable glass window in the bathroom (great for a geek like me). The lounge was a great place to relax and rest which is very important when you have a six‚Ä¶",50
"People might say that spending almost HKD2000 for a night in a hotel just an hour away from home is insane yet my boyfriend and I definitely had a spectacular time at JW Marriott. First when we arrived at the hotel, the staff at the front door is already welcoming us with a warm smile and the fruity scent of the lobby just relaxed us immediately when the door is opened. Then staffs at the lobby lead us to the line for checking in and a welcoming drink is served while we are waiting. Lots of check-in counters were opened during the peak check-in hours so we did not need to wait for a long time. Then when we arrived at our room, we were more pleased to choose this hotel. The view of the whole 'Galaxy enterprise' and all the amenities... they were just made to be perfect. The bed‚Ä¶",50
"We arrived late to the hotel. The ordinary non-smoking rooms ran out so we were assigned a room of accessibility. We're fine with that as long as we are not given a cleaned smoking room. The checkin process was a bit long - faster would be good. Very elegantly and pleasantly designed entrance, corridors and public areas.  Big room, nice view and close to lift. The bed and the pillows were a bit too soft so my girlfriend and I didn't have a very good sleep. The handrail in the toilet was too big. When I'm sitting on the toilet, my left shoulder pressed against the handrail even I'm not a fat person.

Nice stay at JW Marriott Hotel Macau with family. New facilities and clean hotel room with great resort view from my room. The staff there were very nice and friendly. We also enjoy out breakfast at Urban Kitchen. The food there is delicious. ,50
"Marriott should be meticulous in providing superb service but the hotel staff of this hotel needed improvement in their tackling skills.  With the reception counter highly illuminated, I felt uncomfortable with sweat when I checked in.  I was more frustrated when I found the room was at the end of the corridor, it would mean too much for my osteroarthritis knees.  Only with the kind arrangement of the duty manager, I could be offered a room near the lift.  However, same as the previous room, the window was not washed thoroughly and it tarnished the beautiful scenery.   It already took me two hours in changing a room, therefore, I did not dare to inform the hotel staff that I could not use the bathtub because water leaked from the shower tube.  I told the hotel staff upon my‚Ä¶",40
I spend a weekend in this new hotel with family recently. Great room. It is well equipped and very spacey. Seems the hotel room also have some very advanced energy saving system. It will shut down the power when I left the room. It will automatically open the window curtain when I back to the room.  My son love the adventure river and wave pool. The adventure river is very impressive. He spend whole afternoon in the water. The pool bar is also very nice. The only draw back is some basic items such as french fries on the menu is short of supply. I also need to wait very long time to get the food.  I also like the executive lounge. It is not very big compare with some Marriott hotel I stayed before but the staff in the lounge is very nice.  It is very likely I will stay in this‚Ä¶,50
This is a brand new hotel. The Executive lounge was open but the rooms were still not ready. But the check in staff etc were friendly and efficient. The breakfast was very good with good selection. The rooms were very nicely done with an amazing bathroom.,50
"It was a complimentary stay (Friday Night, June 24) given by my friend so i was happy to try this brand new hotel! The Lobby is bright and comfortable as they have a window ceiling which is good. My bad memories start up from the elevator, it was smell and the buttons are not function right. The hallway of my floor feels like there is no AC on. The view of the room is quite nice especially in the evening. But how could you enjoy the view when the windows are muddy and full of water spot? i went down to the swimming pool in the afternoon, it was very nice, and the food from the pool side restaurant is good too. After i done with swimming, i went up to the room and when i open the door, something fell and hit on my toes, it was painful!! and that object is the lock of the door!!!‚Ä¶",30
"The hotel was newly opened in late May and we sort of expected that there would be some teething issues. Nonetheless the hardware and facilities of the hotel was excellent. Offers a spectacular view of the galaxy macau resort, spacious room that comes with Nespresso machine and huge TV. Do remember to bring your bathing suits and enjoy the water park!  The ""Do Not Disturb"" button seem to auto-off by itself as we tested on several occassions to ""On"" it before leaving our room but we returned to see the light off...There were minor hiccups due to inexperienced staff. The check-in was a tad slow despite us arriving at the lobby to see no queue (most times when we passed by the lobby they had queue forming for the check-in).

"I went to this new hotel for the MLTR concert package. Staff responsible for the check-in is a bit careless. After I gave him my credit, he walked away to collect the MLTR concert ticket, with my credit card left at the front desk. It would be nice if he could give it back to me. He also told me the wrong number of floor I stay and failed to show me the location of escalator.  I expressed my concern in check-out and requested a written feedback, they dealt with it promptly, which I appreciate. However, I expect a high standard of service in JW Marriott, it is disappointing.  The design of the hotel room is quite nice, but there is difficulty in opening the drawer/door, they are not smooth at all., my mum even get hurt because of that.  I sincerely hope that it will be improved‚Ä¶",30
"Brand new hotel in the Galaxy complex. Ultra well fitted out rooms with more features than I have ever seen in a room. Very spacious rooms and public areas. Good fitness centre and top class pool.  Club Lounge is first rate. Great cosmopolitan staff, very enthusiastic and attentive. Food and drink selection easily the best that have ever come across at any Marriott.  One or two minor teething problems that would put down to being a very new hotel. But great place to stay in Macau whether you are interested in gaming or not",50
Checked in on the 3rd day of the Grand Opening. I booked an Executive Room but it was not available of some odd reasons. Upgraded to Premiere and kept the benefits of the Executive Room.   Pros:-  1. The room is nicely decor with modern elegant touch. Very spacious and clean and with great pool view as well as the whole Galaxy property.  2. Staffs are friendly and polite.   Cons:- 1. A series of disappointing services during throughout my 2 nights stay. Even though I did expect the overall experience will not be the top since it's new.  2. 45 minutes wait for my order and food wasn't cook properly.

The staffs were very accommodating, they really attended to our needs very well, all our requests were smoothly granted as well.

Its a brand new property and everything was amazing, from the friendly staffs to the rooms itself. The check-in and check-out was very swift.

"Not the best experience, as the staff is badly organised. From the hostess at the ferry pier who could not speak english at all and made us wait in the heat with a toddler for 40 minutes as the shuttle was late to the horrible receptionist. I guess this is Marriott according to China standards. The only positive things were the skimming pool facilities and the executive lounge staff who were extremely friendly and helpful. Not worth it at all.",30
"When we visited Macau for the first time, we stayed at the Sheraton Macau hotel. However, this time we chose the JW Marriott and it was the best choice we've made. The hotel is new so the room was brand new and clean. The staff was extremely helpful both at check in and at the restaurants. Even though they were really busy, the staff kept a smile on their faces and was very helpful. I would definitely stay there again!",50
A luxury hotel with wonderful friendly staffs. It's suitable for business and family stay. The water park is fantastic for kids to spend a day. The toilet is excellent with a heated seat.  Will definitely return next time to Macau.,40

This Marriott and the JW in Dubai definitely my 2 best experience to this date. Thanks for an awesome stay ",50
"I stayed at JW Marriott Macau for 2 nights and had mostly great time except some points. Let me point out both good and bad points.  Good points 1. I love how Marriott surprises their guest with gifts and something special throughout my stay. I received cake, dessert before bed time and personal phone charger during my 2 nights stay. It was definitely a great touch for customer and surely made them feel special. 2. The bed was great! I got a great sleep. (Up to Marriott standard) 3. Lunch buffet was amazing. It has many good Chinese food such as Peking duck, Roasted pork and Chinese soup. However, some food like Dim sum can definitely be better. (Dim sum was not great) 4. The Pool is AMAZING. Period! 5. The shower room was great and had great amenities.  Rooms for improvement 1.‚Ä¶",40
"This newly opened hotel needs to improve to meet JW Marriott standard. As usual we paid extra for the executive room in our booking. Arriving at the hotel at 3:30pm on a quiet Monday, we did not get our room until 4:20pm. The executive lounge was located on 2/F without any view. Food was fair and choice was limited. After I got my room, I found out that they have many TV channels but not the important one - CNBC. My WIFI connection dropped to almost zero, then I realized that they DON'T have dedicated in-room WIFI. I was using the general public Galaxy Macau WIFI. When I  tried to dine at their restaurants, they told me that our Club Marriott card (preferred dining privilege membership) was NOT honored there, therefore, no discount at all.

Took 15 mins when it should be like 3-5 MAX. Other then this.. everything else was great.  Rooms are spacious, toilet using the Smart Glass technology, pretty cool.

Non smoking and a freshened smoking room are different!    Asked for wall street journal but they said only Macau and south china morning post.  Ok fine.  The latter.

The breakfast is superb!  Walking distance to ÂÆò‰πüË°ó (around 15 mins) where you can enjoy tons of local deciduous food.

For the price, the room is luxurious, super comfy beds, and have little touches that make all the difference *nespresso maker in particular 2. Finally, a bathroom that is modern but practical. There's a clear glass wall between the room and bathroom, but with a flick of a switch, the glass is opaque, its so cool! The toilets are very modern to with built in bidet 3.

Sara on the phone was very helpfu every time we called ""at your service"" - the button shown on the hotel phone.
