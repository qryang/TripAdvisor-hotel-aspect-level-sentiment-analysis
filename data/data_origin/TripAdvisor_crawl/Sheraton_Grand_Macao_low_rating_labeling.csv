c50000,s1,"Room is big, with a large bathroom with shower and bath tub separated"
c50000,s2,The bathroom amenities like shower gel and shampoo are poor in quality
c50000,s3,I have uploaded the TV channel list and laundry price list
c50000,s4,The router in the room provides both wired and wifi connection
c50000,s5,Two power outlets at the table and one at bedside
c50001,s1,All the filipino staves and security personnel from the hotel and in casino are all acting bossy and disrespectful
c50001,s2,"They are like waiting for a tip, and if you don‚Äôt give a tip, they will snob and make face plus laugh behind your back"
c50001,s3,They are making fun of the guests
c50001,s4,Seems like they‚Äôre not seriously doing their job
c50001,s5,They should be fired and replaced by more competent people
c50001,s6,"They act bossy like they want the guests to adjust for them, really"
c50002,s1,Would not suggest staying here at all
c50002,s2,"The rooms are below par, the service is missing and there is very little ambience or atmosphere"
c50002,s3,It is lacking in every element that a Sheraton Grand should portray
c50002,s4,Sadly can not recommend this place
c50003,s1,"Upon booking, I ordered a non-smoking room, but I was welcomed by a strong smell of cigarette when entering the room"
c50003,s2,"We called Room Service, and the staff was indeed very sorry and willing to help"
c50003,s3,The agent told me that a staff member would bring the keys to the room in a few minutes
c50003,s4,"Behold, that's when the drama starts"
c50003,s5,It was 11
c50003,s6,"45 pm when we called room service (it was indeed late by normal standards, however, in Macau, the service was still at full scale, even in late night)"
c50003,s7,"We waited for an hour, an whole hour without any staff appearance"
c50003,s8,We called again
c50003,s9,"The staff remained very polite and was very sorry for the delay, which was appreciated"
c50003,s10,"However,  the staff member did not appear in half an hour"
c50003,s11,This was already around 1
c50003,s12,20 am
c50003,s13,The staff did not brought us the‚Ä¶
c50004,s1,"Very basic stay in Macau, and as a Titanium Elite Member, I expected more than a plate of fruits in my very basic, old feeling room, which deserves some remodeling"
c50004,s2,"Unfortunately, I wasn‚Äôt upgraded to a suite as expected whenever there‚Äôs one available (and there was)"
c50004,s3,That would have made a big difference
c50004,s4,"In fact, the only good thing about my stay was Ms"
c50004,s5,"Carmela at the Club Lounge, who‚Äôs a true professional and the sweetest person"
c50004,s6,Thank you
c50005,s1,"I received an email stating I can check in at Marriott Bonvoy counter but when I wanted to step onto the steps, I was blocked by a Marriott lady staff who was very unfriendly and rude requesting me to show the print out indicating I am a Marriott member"
c50005,s2,I told her that I am a gold member but I didnt print out the check in email or downloads the apps
c50005,s3,"However, I asked her to let me in to sit on the sofa first and show her my passport"
c50005,s4,"She used her  body to block me to go in, I felt so insulted"
c50005,s5,"My husband just came in and gave her my passport, then she passed the passport to let the reception staff to check"
c50005,s6,"After checking, our booking was there"
c50005,s7,The lady did not apologize for her rudeness but just walked away
c50006,s1,"Arrive hotel at 5pm and the queue isn't very long, but the ground staff took me to 4/F club lounge but it takes around 5 mins up and down, once we get out from the lift, original I am at 2nd, other guests jump in front of me and make me into fifth"
c50006,s2,"so sad, the staff should arrange it"
c50006,s3,"In fact, I don't feel it is faster with only 2 staffs there and feel inexperience"
c50006,s4,"Finally, I can check in and the lady told me they only have double room, but what I booked is a twin room, also she said all non smoking rooms are unavailable or still tidy up, OMG"
c50006,s5,"is 5pm, I suppose everything are ready"
c50006,s6,what's a poor front desk service I never have in Sheraton group
c50006,s7,"At the end, I can get a room I booked, but it's a bit non professional the lady process my booking with talking her mobile with‚Ä¶"
c50007,s1,I was stayed at here on 21/12 until 23/12
c50007,s2,"I booked a Deluxe twin room(2547,Earth Tower) through Agoda"
c50007,s3,The hotel is crowded because there are so many people
c50007,s4,But the check in queue is very2 long
c50007,s5,Great service by concierge
c50007,s6,"Room in Earth Tower was outdated,Sky Tower could be their newer tower"
c50007,s7,Room are fairly clean but little old
c50007,s8,Cannot control the speed of shower in the bathroom
c50007,s9,They also have free shuttle buses to airport and ferry terminal
c50007,s10,"Lastly,NEED TO IMPROVE MORE ON CLEANINESS IN THE CASINO TOILET"
c50007,s11,The casino toilet was very2 dirty
c50008,s1,"It's fine if you like gambling, I guess"
c50008,s2,And shopping though the prices are twice as high for brand names than anywhere else
c50008,s3,The rooms are large and comfortable> the rest of the hotel is like being on a crowded city street
c50008,s4,No quiet lounge or coffee shop or bar
c50008,s5,They were waxing the floor in the lobby at 1 am when people are still out and about and the one coffee shop bar in the middle of the crowded lobby was already closed
c50008,s6,I guess the only thing left to do is gamble
c50009,s1,Stayed at Sheraton this November
c50009,s2,Room condition was poor
c50009,s3,Middle of the night room heater stopped working
c50009,s4,I had to change room with small kid
c50009,s5,Even after talking to the manager I was not compensated for the trouble
c50010,s1,As an Elite Bonvoy member I was really hoping to leave a more positive review
c50010,s2,"Our trip was mixed, at best"
c50010,s3,"The rooms are quite nice and comfortable, although the hotel itself is very disjointed"
c50010,s4,Service is far off what a normal Macau experience is
c50010,s5,Our check-in was very unpleasant
c50010,s6,We were invited as Bonvoy members to check in online prior to arriving
c50010,s7,Don‚Äôt bother
c50010,s8,you need to go through the entire check in process all over again when you arrive
c50010,s9,"Check in took a long time, as our attendant was working through the system"
c50010,s10,"The staff are quite pleasant and do try their best to deliver good service, but the system and the poor Organisation of the hotel work against their efforts"
c50010,s11,The lobby and elevators all smell of cigarette smoke
c50010,s12,The only positives were that our‚Ä¶
c50011,s1,Booked a double room thru agent but hotel said no record
c50011,s2,"After discussion, hotel offered smoking room with double bed"
c50011,s3,No choice but to tolerate light smoke smell
c50011,s4,Normal facilities and good size of room
c50011,s5,Avoid 2~3 pm n 5~6 pm for check in or out as many tours wld arrive n created long waiting time
c50011,s6,Drop keycard at express check out stand to avoid long queue
c50011,s7,Easy to travel by hotel coach which are new n clean
c50012,s1,Sheena has been very entertaining
c50012,s2,She take us out from a very long check in line thats why we managed our trip very well having a very fast check in
c50012,s3,She also introduce the facilities that makes us feel welcome üòä
c50013,s1,Unacceptable service
c50013,s2,I was disappointed by this hotel because I checked out at 7:30am
c50013,s3,Obviously I left my glasses already and no one from hotel gave me one single call for the whole day
c50013,s4,I had my conference in this hotel conference room till 4pm
c50013,s5,"Within all these 8 hours, no one called me"
c50013,s6,Not a single call
c50013,s7,"And if any of their staff had tried to call me, I might not need to go through all these email sending, phone call waiting"
c50013,s8,I discovered I left my glasses when I arrived Hong Kong home
c50013,s9,My friends will check out tomorrow so I asked them to call the reception to see if they found any glasses
c50013,s10,The receptionist replied them immediately saying no lost items was found
c50013,s11,"So I called the reception myself at 8:30pm, they said they would check for me, and they called back saying‚Ä¶"
c50014,s1,Bit hard to find entrance to main lobby
c50014,s2,Main lobby looks promising and that‚Äôs all
c50014,s3,Check in took a while due to scanner issue
c50014,s4,"Room at ‚ÄúEarth Tower‚Äù was outdated, Sky Tower could be their newer tower"
c50014,s5,Lamp was flickering
c50014,s6,Receptionist doesn‚Äôt have information about shuttle bus to Cotai Ferry Terminal readily available
c50014,s7,"When asked, he told us that the swimming pools are all closed until March"
c50014,s8,I could not find these information on their website
c50014,s9,Not recommended
c50015,s1,The hotel room rate is cheaper than the rest adjacent Marriott brand hotels
c50015,s2,"As a platinum member, I didn‚Äôt get any upgrade, not even a better view room"
c50015,s3,"It was a slow weekday, the hotel was not sold out"
c50015,s4,I checked in the hotel by Marriott mobile few days ago and it didn‚Äôt seem anything happen
c50015,s5,"I asked if there was any upgrade during in person check in, the check in person immediately told me no without even looking the computer"
c50015,s6,"When we got to the room, I saw a maid was cleaning the adjacent room"
c50015,s7,"I asked her if we can get extra large towel, she immediately told me no"
c50015,s8,She said she only had enough towels for the room she was cleaning
c50015,s9,We did get the free breakfast as the platinum benefit on the first floor restaurant
c50015,s10,I was surprised the servants couldn‚Äôt  speak‚Ä¶
c50016,s1,Was very disappointed with Sheraton service
c50016,s2,I am Celiac and forget about any food for gluten intolerance or if u vegan it's not a place to be
c50016,s3,service is slow
c50016,s4,Staff can't speak English
c50016,s5,"There is long wait for food ,etc"
c50016,s6,Would expect much more from Sheraton
c50017,s1,"I stay at the hotel for a company function, the food quality wasn't that good, the service"
c50017,s2,"Well, there is no service especially your claim yourself 5* hotel at the formal dinner, the staff doesn't even know what is red, white glasses, yes, it was that bad, no training at all, just randomly find someone who is available for part-time work"
c50018,s1,Spent two nights in this hotel with my wife to celebrate our wedding anniversary
c50018,s2,"Booked their suite  which the room is quite nice, clean and very spacious"
c50018,s3,"However, the room is full of cigar smell and we thought the smell will gone after some time, but when we get back at night time,  the smell is still there and we are too sleepy to ask for another room, so we spent our first night sleeping in an ashtray"
c50018,s4,"First day breakfast is very disappointed as we were asked to have our breakfast at their ballroom which everything was set up temporary, some of their hot dishes are cold"
c50018,s5,So we request to have the breakfast at the cafe in the next morning but not at the ballroom
c50018,s6,"At first the staff said the cafe is almost full and suggested we go to the ballroom again, but we insist to go‚Ä¶"
c50019,s1,Even as a premium member it took us ages to check in
c50019,s2,4 bottle white wine list with only 2 available (and as you would expect the two I didn‚Äôt like!)
c50019,s3,Corridors and room smell of stale food and the air-con didn‚Äôt work
c50019,s4,People who visit here like to cook their own food in the rooms
c50019,s5,"They did send people up to try and fix it, but frankly it shouldn‚Äôt happen in the first place"
c50019,s6,(Photo of chap deodorising)  Just generally a typical Cotai casino hotel experience - very average and best to be avoided
c50019,s7,"In fact, avoid Macau hotels in general!  I don‚Äôt apply this to Marriott/Bonvoy in general - I‚Äôm a fan - but just this (and most) Macau hotels! Stay in HK and travel over!"
c50020,s1,"After an exceptional stay at the Sheraton Nanshan, this property fell short in welcoming me as a Lifetime Titanium Elite guest"
c50020,s2,I was upgraded to a regular club room with a sad view
c50020,s3,No suite upgrade and they said I had to have breakfast in the club room or use up my welcome amenity to eat in the main breakfast area
c50020,s4,Seriously? This property made me feel like an average guest
c50020,s5,I haven't been in a regular room in years
c50020,s6,"It is very disappointing given how many rooms there are here, and that they have a designated check in for elite members"
c50020,s7,"The check in was just underwhelming, no welcome note from management with snacks in my room, and again, the view and room, as basic as can be"
c50020,s8,So disappointed! Take note from the Sheraton Nanshan and step it up!
c50021,s1,Stayed at this hotel for one night in early September 2019
c50021,s2,"This hotel is an average casino hotel, very large and very busy"
c50021,s3,Have stayed a few times but as a Marriott Titanium member have been rarely upgraded
c50021,s4,Have always been advised the hotel is very busy
c50021,s5,The rooms are quite large but do not have a stocked minibar
c50021,s6,Also the room had basic amenities unlike other Sheraton hotels in Asia
c50021,s7,As a Marriott Elite member you are able to request extra amenities on their app
c50021,s8,These were not in the room and had to make a request three times for them
c50021,s9,The club lounge is good and has an excellent Happy Hour and Breakfast
c50021,s10,Overall this hotel is average but don‚Äôt expect anything special if you are an elite member
c50022,s1,Was there a couple of years ago and I gave it a real thumbs up for service and quality
c50022,s2,"Fast forward to today, tired , poor service and dirty room"
c50022,s3,Maybe it‚Äôs because of the business or joining Marriott  Bonvoy
c50022,s4,It was my wife birthday and I wanted to get a room upgrade
c50022,s5,Before grouping together it was much easier
c50022,s6,Now points are meaner to get by just like Cathay
c50022,s7,Had similar experience in Sheraton Melbourne
c50022,s8,All I got was a 3 inch cake
c50022,s9,The cleaners also never cleaned the cups and gave us so little toiletries
c50022,s10,Had to ask all the time
c50022,s11,Highly embarrassed
c50022,s12,I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll stay in Sheraton chain again
c50022,s13,I noticed a big drop in quality after joining Marriot Bonvoy
c50023,s1,The Sheraton is a bit of a dinosaur
c50023,s2,It hasn't aged gracefully and it shows
c50023,s3,Check-in is a real pain with long lines and slow service
c50023,s4,"The layout of the hotel is truly awful as if you're staying in the Earth tower, the trip to the pool is really far"
c50023,s5,And the pool is really quite mediocre compared to the competition
c50023,s6,The taxi lines are also long and unforgiving
c50023,s7,The hotel feels like a casino first and hotel second
c50023,s8,"There are so many superior choices in Cotai that if I hadn't gone to the Galaxy afterwards, my impression of Macau would have remained rather poor"
c50024,s1,I stayed here for two nights
c50024,s2,I don‚Äôt think it is worth the price
c50024,s3,"After I checked out at noon I wanted to use the pool, which I thought was a reasonable request"
c50024,s4,The unsmiling staff told me that I would have to pay a fee to use the pool only for  a few hours until I took my cab ride to the airport
c50024,s5,"I paid the price and used the pool but what a disappointment! The burger they served was burned, literally and they charged for it too"
c50025,s1,"The worst hotel in Macao, especially the front desk and concierge, is not at all enthusiastic, the shower is broken, and waiting for long time with room change, is far worse than that next to Conrad Macao, Cotai Central"
c50026,s1,bad 1: checked in loooong quene as in photo
c50026,s2,i cant understand why there were only a few staff serving such a long Q
c50026,s3,tip: book direct with hotel next time so can use e-check in
c50026,s4,bad 2: The Sheraton is comprised of two towers
c50026,s5,Earth tower is far from swimming pool
c50026,s6,tip: to avoid the looong walkÔºåchoose sky tower if available
c50026,s7,esp if you are travelling with kids/old family members
c50026,s8,good 1: comfy bed n clean room
c50026,s9,good 2: swimming pool is big
c50026,s10,safeguard is responsible since i saw him asking 2 children who play without adults' attendance
c50026,s11,Overall: an average hotel staying experience
c50026,s12,"Did the job but surprised that there were NO staff expressing greetings, as a hotel residence, during our 2D1N stay"
c50026,s13,It's cool if you like this cold feeling
c50027,s1,"Sheraton Hotel Macau is located at the Cotai Central, inside the Sands Cotai Central - a huge resort complex"
c50027,s2,Also it known as the largest Sheraton in the world
c50027,s3,Glad to receive some pre-welcome email from the hotel before my stay
c50027,s4,One of the email mentioned they have a checkin counter - ‚ÄúMarriott Bonvoy Counter‚Äù to enhance an better arrival experience
c50027,s5,"So that I tried to process my checkin there, however, the first thing I suffer is the staff at the entrance shout to me ‚ÄúAre you our member!?‚Äù In an impolite way surely"
c50027,s6,That‚Äôs the way to enhance a better arrival experience for guest? I doubt
c50027,s7,"Haven‚Äôt meet much challenge after this during checkin, Front office mentioned to me there will be NO any Room Upgrade for all tiers elite Bonvoy member, made me guess it‚Äôs a very busy‚Ä¶"
c50028,s1,"Stayed here in June 2019 and the hotel is good, however:  1"
c50028,s2,Check in and check out is a nightmare- prepare to wait in the queue for around 35-40 minutes
c50028,s3,2
c50028,s4,You don't really feel special as a guest because it's so crowded
c50028,s5,For me it just misses that personal touch 3
c50028,s6,Rooms are quite out dated 4
c50028,s7,Room service is pricey and the food isnt good  Now for the good: The location is superb The hotel grounds is lovely
c50029,s1,Visited this hotel 5 years ago thinking that it is still one of the finest hotel in Cotai with impeccable service at the club lounge
c50029,s2,was I wrong !!!! The lounge has deteriorated into a canteen type environment with disastrous ambience
c50029,s3,people were piling up the food they cannot finish and it was like a disaster relief centre
c50029,s4,real disappointing  Room wise things are looking ‚Äútired‚Äù and towels definitely need a change
c50029,s5,housekeeping is bad too
c50029,s6,"Definitely will not return as there are many many choices in this area now with many more hotels up like MGM,Wynn,Parisian,etc just across the road from Sheraton"
c50029,s7,I suspect the management has changed hands to local management
c50030,s1,"The first thing I noticed about the Sheraton Macau, and Taipa Island in general, is the shear size and awe of everything"
c50030,s2,"Macau basically took a bunch of US buildings from Vegas, World Trade, Space Needle, and actually created better versions of them"
c50030,s3,The appointments in this hotel are what you would expect from a top tier hotel
c50030,s4,"Everything is immaculate, the staff are friendly and welcoming, and even though Macau is more tailored towards Chinese visitors, I did not feel terribly out of place"
c50030,s5,Review disclaimer: I am a US traveler and therefore my tastes may be different than others
c50030,s6,Rooms: The rooms are very well appointed and the bathrooms are gorgeous
c50030,s7,The water can be as scalding hot or as ice cold as you want it and the marble and stone work must have been expensive as‚Ä¶
c50031,s1,"I ve been trying the swimming pool the 18th of july half hour before the expected closing time, i was wearing a swimming slip of versace that was not evidently underwear, and the guys  in charged of the maintainance of the swimming pool just before to get inside the water told me in a rude way that i couldn‚Äôt get in because i was wearing underwear i show to him that it wasn‚Äôt but it kept insisting rudely, finally i could enter and a second one even more arrogant then the first told me to leave immediately the swimming pool because of i thought i was wearing underwear, i use to stay in 5 stars hotel, i never could expect a bad service and such impolite staff in a marriott hotel, is unacceptable, i lost 15 minutes that i could spent inside the water arguing with them, next time i‚Ä¶"
c50032,s1,This place is a complete zoo
c50032,s2,Attached picture is the line to get into the lounge
c50032,s3,Complete mayhem
c50032,s4,Avoid the Sheraton Cotai unless you love massive crowds and a maze of a hotel
c50032,s5,"The staff was friendly and generally wonderful, but management left them to deal with outsized crowds"
c50033,s1,"No improvement since hotel opening, the check-in problem is extremely bad, people have to queue up for an hour waiting for check-in"
c50033,s2,The hotel fixed the check-in time at 3pm but they are not consider flexible check-in time to avoid crowded in the lobby at the same time
c50033,s3,It's really bad!
c50034,s1,1
c50034,s2,"Hotel isn't clean enough, I saw some stains in the bathroom"
c50034,s3,2
c50034,s4,"This hotel is quite far from Taipa tourist area, it takes 20+ minutes walk"
c50034,s5,3
c50034,s6,"There are two towers, I was staying in the earth tower which is very far from the pool"
c50034,s7,"And the design of the pool is quite strange, there are 13+ tiny pools that I could cardly swim"
c50034,s8,4
c50034,s9,Mattress is a bit too hard for me and my mum
c50034,s10,We both couldn't sleep well
c50035,s1,The hotel might have good reviews but my first impression with this hotel was total disgust
c50035,s2,"What 5 star hotel in the modern world has you wait over an hour just to check in?  This was not even as check in first opened, but several hours later"
c50035,s3,Sheraton is a second class hotel in the United States and I guess it applies to the Macau location as well
c50035,s4,This review is just based on the check in process
c50035,s5,Pathetic
c50036,s1,We recently stayed at the Sheraton Macau from 16th June to 17th June
c50036,s2,"We had a pleasant stay in one of your very comfortable rooms, however, on the last day we had an issue that we feel wasn't handled as well as we believe it should have been"
c50036,s3,Please see the following point:  1
c50036,s4,We checked out at 13:00 and proceeded to leave our luggage with the bell service
c50036,s5,2
c50036,s6,"We returned at a little past 18:10 and collected our bag, then caught the transfer bus to the Macau Ferry"
c50036,s7,3
c50036,s8,On reaching the Macau Ferry at 18: 35¬† we discovered that we had left a personal item in our room (3144 Earth Tower)
c50036,s9,We therefore boarded a return transfer bus back to the Sheraton
c50036,s10,4
c50036,s11,"We arrived back at the Sheraton at approximately 18:50 and went straight to the concierge desk, where we informed someone‚Ä¶"
c50037,s1,First and last time staying in this mega stinky hotel
c50037,s2,The corridor at the ‚Äúnon smoking floor‚Äù stinks with cigarette stench
c50037,s3,Room and bathroom were overused
c50037,s4,You feel like a no body in here
c50037,s5,Breakfast costs a fortune with no proper service
c50037,s6,Never again
c50038,s1,Stayed here for one night on 31 May - 1 June 2019
c50038,s2,Hotel is crowded so there is no upgrade to my room which is acceptable
c50038,s3,Service of the lady at the front desk is good
c50038,s4,The room is a pretty standard 4 Star hotel room
c50038,s5,We checked out around 2 pm on 1 June 2019
c50038,s6,"Instead of the usual check out point, they asked me to check out using the self checkout on the LCD screen"
c50038,s7,Did everything correctly but till 5 June have not receive my night credit
c50038,s8,"This resulted me in missing out ""Double Take: Earn double points"" promo"
c50038,s9,"When i called them on 4 June 2019, they told me they have posted the points already"
c50039,s1,It's a resort complex but very well organized
c50039,s2,Hope you have a gold/platinum status which helps you bypass the check-in/out queue
c50039,s3,Rooms are spacious and very clean
c50039,s4,Lot's of dining and entertainment options
c50039,s5,Got a great treatment at the spa
c50040,s1,"We re staying for 2 nights at this hotel , and not a single person offer to help us with the luggages"
c50040,s2,"Then , no room service at all"
c50040,s3,"We went outside until 3 pm and come back , and still, the room is not ciean yet!!!"
c50041,s1,Let me start with the good things first
c50041,s2,"I appreciate the friendly service of gym and swimming pool staff; they were very caring, polite and helpful"
c50041,s3,I also enjoyed the the room view and hotel's facilities in general
c50041,s4,BUT
c50041,s5,The first POINT OF CONTACT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT AND IT TOTALLY RUINED MY EXPERIENCE
c50041,s6,"First, ridiculous waiting time at the check-in counter (40-50 minutes)"
c50041,s7,This I still can understand
c50041,s8,But totally unprofessional service from the staff is unacceptable in the hotel like this
c50041,s9,"Every time when I check in into hotel, I give the 100USD or 200USD CASH because I do not prefer waiting for the money transfer on the card (since I only have debit cards)"
c50041,s10,"But this time, I already paid for the room through booking"
c50041,s11,com and still were asked to give the deposit
c50041,s12,The‚Ä¶
c50042,s1,We stayed one night in this hotel
c50042,s2,Value wise for a 4/5 star hotel it is pretty reasonable on a weekend
c50042,s3,The check in was quick and they were nice enough to let me do early check in and volunteer to arrange late check out for us
c50042,s4,"The room is spacious, with relevant amenities"
c50042,s5,"As Macau is pretty humid, the room does have a bit of a smell and a bit sticky when u first went in"
c50042,s6,They should really enhance the room humidity control
c50042,s7,The bed is very comfortable
c50042,s8,The hallway needs refreshing as it looks a bit stale
c50042,s9,Please note the hotel lobby in this hotel is always busy
c50042,s10,Like a busy airport terminal
c50042,s11,The spa there is wonderful
c50042,s12,Do try their elemental herbology range of treatments
c50042,s13,It's fantastic
c50042,s14,Love my bamboo massage
c50042,s15,What makes our stay special is that their staff Mr leung‚Ä¶
c50043,s1,There's 3 types of check-in counter
c50043,s2,"One for the normal peeps, one for priority lane for kids & elderly"
c50043,s3,Another one for membership
c50043,s4,"Seriously what priority lane is this, they take about 30 mins to check in 3-4 guests"
c50044,s1,The room really smells when I first enter and the complementary snacks on the table which we had every time are all missing
c50044,s2,My son had a horrible reaction to the bedding as this time as his face was all itchy and red
c50044,s3,"I had stayed there before and had been a member of Marriott, had never experience things like this time"
c50044,s4,"The room is filthy as it smells like old room, and the bedding aren‚Äôt clean"
c50044,s5,The check in time for priority lane takes almost an hour which compare to all other hotels such as Parisian is too long and tedious
c50044,s6,There is no staff who asked us how we are as we had been waiting for the check in for a long long time
c50044,s7,In Parisian we ordered the champagne suite and the check in is also immediate and they have a little room for us to rest while check in
c50044,s8,Sheraton I‚Ä¶
c50045,s1,We are regular guests at Sheraton hotels internationally and are so dissapointed by the status of upkeep with the rooms at this hotel
c50045,s2,"A horrible smell exists in all carpetted areas, from the lift to the corridor and then the rooms, which can only be described as a mix of old smoke and bodily fluids like vomit and urine"
c50045,s3,The carpets are stained and the bathroom has grime between the tiles
c50045,s4,The only positive experience is the staff and customer service
c50045,s5,"Despite their efforts and good will, they cannot change the standard the rooms are in and therefore limited in what they can offer"
c50045,s6,Do not come to this hotel with a false pretence of a 5 star standard room
c50046,s1,"Same as previous stay, the check-in queue was extremely long this time"
c50046,s2,"Then I checked with the customer service at the entrance of check-in queue, whether I could use the check-in kiosk even I made my reservation through Expedia, and she said ""Yes"", then reminded me to have cash ready for deposit"
c50046,s3,"After spending 15 minutes to queue for the kiosk, I couldn't proceed my check-in though the customer service at kiosk scanned my ID card and retrieved my booking 5 times, and she didn't understand why it happened neither"
c50046,s4,"Then I had to spend another 50 minutes for another queue, damn"
c50046,s5,"Nevertheless, Vlad was very helpful for my check-in, my request for non-smoking twin room was granted at least"
c50047,s1,Am staying here as I type
c50047,s2,"Really difficult to contact them by email, as all the advertised emails do not work, even the email that the general manager replies to the bad reviews on here doesnt work when I used it!  Anyways the hotel is large and chaotic as expected"
c50047,s3,Can see most of the good reviews are from people who were upgraded to a deluxe suite
c50047,s4,"We paid for 2 deluxe suite rooms, and wanted them near each other, but instead got them allocated at opposite ends of the building"
c50047,s5,"They said they were giving us an upgrade at check in, however this turned out to be the same room with a higher ceiling"
c50047,s6,"Sheraton if you read this, a higher ceiling is not an upgrade!!!  Needless to say hopes were raised, and left disappointed"
c50047,s7,"The suite is very spacious, but not practical"
c50047,s8,‚Ä¶
c50048,s1,I stayed here as part of the conference that I was attending
c50048,s2,We did get a choice in terms of options and it was OK
c50048,s3,But really just OK
c50048,s4,The rooms are getting a little long in the tooth and nothing to write home about
c50048,s5,I want to be clear that I‚Äôm not really a gambling town kind of guy and this may have jaded my perspective
c50048,s6,But really sunk it for me though was the service level in the bars and restaurants
c50048,s7,This is not the place to come for a large convention
c50048,s8,They just don‚Äôt seem to have the horse power to be able to ramp up to deal with large volumes and I would say this wasn‚Äôt limited to this hotel - this was pretty much everywhere we went in Macau with a large group
c50049,s1,We recently stayed at the Grand Sheraton Macao at Sands Cotai Central and found this to be a decent property on the Cotai Strip
c50049,s2,Our stay was ok but the check-in was very poor
c50049,s3,Reservation was made through booking
c50049,s4,com
c50049,s5,No early check-in is allowed however there is luggage service that is free if you are a hotel guest
c50049,s6,Non-hotel guests - MOP30 per piece
c50049,s7,Check-in was a poor experience
c50049,s8,"In addition to no early check-in, we returned at 2"
c50049,s9,"40pm, 20 minutes before scheduled time to find a huge queue and a 40 minute wait"
c50049,s10,"Upon arriving at the check-in desk, inexperienced staff slowed things down as well and mistakenly included a double deposit hold on our credit card"
c50049,s11,Not a big deal but did little to alleviate our fatigue from such a long check-in process
c50049,s12,This is something Grand‚Ä¶
c50050,s1,I had some years not select to stay in this hotel and expected their services would be better since more competitors in the market
c50050,s2,I stayed in room 1-2306 from 24/3 to 27/3(3 nights)
c50050,s3,When we arrived the hotel lobby and noticed that there were crowded with people
c50050,s4,Long queues were waiting in the check in counter
c50050,s5,I appreciated the front desk counter staff with patient to arrange a room for us though I waited for some times
c50050,s6,"Everything seemed in normal as expected, however on 26/3, at around 1:15pm I called to request for room make up then we went to swimming pool"
c50050,s7,"When arrived the swimming pool, the poolside was noisy with some continuous engine sound"
c50050,s8,The nonstop noisy sound was annoying and we were not able to have a comfortable time at poolside
c50050,s9,"After swimming, we back to‚Ä¶"
c50051,s1,I find it hard to believe that so many people have rated this hotel excellent
c50051,s2,"Its not excellent, its good at average"
c50051,s3,The clientele of this hotel are tour bus groups
c50051,s4,The check-in line was 40 mins long (it feels like you are line to check in at the airport)
c50051,s5,The mini bar is empty; you need to call them if you want it stocked
c50051,s6,"They called us in the morning waking us up when we had not requested not it, waking us all"
c50051,s7,The room had the necessities but was nothing special
c50051,s8,There are better hotels at this price range
c50052,s1,This is my mother‚Äôs first time to choose Grand Sheraton in Macau Cotai central
c50052,s2,She needs to stay in different Hotels during her business trips in Macau for her past ten years
c50052,s3,My mum gave every hotel nearby the Cotai central a very nice feedback
c50052,s4,This time my parents and me want to experience the Five-Star hotel service in Grand Sheraton
c50052,s5,"Unfortunately, we don‚Äôt have a good experience"
c50052,s6,There‚Äôs no other hotel like Grand Sheraton has no seat area/sofa for the hotel guest unless you are their Marriott Bonvoy member
c50052,s7,It is ridiculous for a hotel to let its guest to find a seat at the 3rd floor food court and wait for the check in time until 1 pm
c50052,s8,Those arrangements made the guest don‚Äôt feel they are welcomed
c50052,s9,We sincerely hope the hotel would make a change and don‚Äôt treat its guest‚Ä¶
c50053,s1,"As a SPG member and a repeated guest, this Sheraton outlet kept disappointing us"
c50053,s2,"Check in still need to wait for more than 20 min to queue and even its your turn, the never ending typing of the Front desk staffs made the whole process up to at least 30 more mins"
c50053,s3,"Breakfast in feast restaurant gave up another round of queuing up, even to be seated, the coffee ordered will not arrive until 20-30 mins"
c50053,s4,"As a family targeted hotel, a lot of kids were running all around the buffet table with the balloons hanged out to them by the restaurant, it seemed to be dangerous and it was so full during the whole breakfast period"
c50053,s5,"All the staffs I met were very nice and working very hard, but due to such huge package of families, required services are expected to be limited or none"
c50054,s1,We booked a last minute room for staying after the concert on 16th Feb
c50054,s2,After we've checked in and got our room (no
c50054,s3,"2860), we found used slippers underneath the armchair, the safety door lock doesn't function properly and the shower drips all over the place"
c50054,s4,"We were too tired and can't be bother to ask for a different room at the time, we just want to sleep and leave first thing the next morning"
c50054,s5,"We informed the staff of the room conditions upon check out, whether they have taken actions which would be unknown to us"
c50054,s6,Probably won't choose to stay with this hotel again in the future
c50055,s1,"The staff is great, very helpful"
c50055,s2,"Rooms are clean but definitely not 5 star hotel, rooms need update especially bathroom"
c50055,s3,Bed is terrible for 5star hotel with some old bedding
c50055,s4,Check-in is also one big problem because you need to wait in so long line
c50055,s5,Check-out you have from room TV but it doesn‚Äôt work so I need to go to reception thank good the line was shorter
c50055,s6,Breakfast in their restaurant Feast OMG I went at 9:45 and it was so long line that again I need to wait with my kid to get a table
c50055,s7,But food is good and if you like european breakfast it‚Äôs good selection of food
c50055,s8,Over all an average hotel more 3
c50055,s9,5/4star than 5
c50056,s1,"Online booked and you can chose the self service machines to check in, Go early, the line is very very long in the afternoon"
c50056,s2,"Macau is getting too crowdy, waiting for lift took forever with so many ppl and the floor lift #s are a bit confusing at first"
c50056,s3,I had a slight mini Eiffel tower view and the room was quiet and clean
c50056,s4,Shavers quality was not ok
c50057,s1,4th time staying in this hotel
c50057,s2,Thank you for offering my a twins bed which my reservation should be a king bed room
c50057,s3,I don‚Äôt know is that cause of the new bonvoy app or your hotel system
c50057,s4,"(and there are preferences settings in the app,every time I book is always king size bed room,plus already informed the hotel that is a boyfriend girlfriend trip through email)  When I called to the front desk and they told me that the hotel prepared me a birthday cake and arranged a better view room to me so it‚Äôs not so convenient to swap the room and soon I asked if there was any room else is available,the gentleman in the phone answered me there was only a room in the low floor was available"
c50057,s5,(My room was on club floor) Ok fine
c50057,s6,I stayed in ‚Äúmy twins bed room which is with better view for my‚Ä¶
c50058,s1,very helpful staff Ms
c50058,s2,Manli Zhen at the Platinum member reception
c50058,s3,Appreciated her happy face compare to most of the staff had tiring and unsmilely faces
c50058,s4,Ms
c50058,s5,Zhen answered all my questions in a very professional way
c50058,s6,she is probably the best staff i met during my many stays at this hotel
c50058,s7,"During club lounge visit, the staff never greeted me"
c50058,s8,i had to ask for a bottle of sparking water and again i had to ask for a glass to come with it to
c50058,s9,"Sincerely,  CCM"
c50059,s1,We stayed for 3 nights in this hotel in January 2019
c50059,s2,These are items we enjoyed:  Location - Great if you want to explore the hotels/casinos/malls/attractions on Cotai Strip
c50059,s3,"It is very central, right in front of both The Venetian and The Parisian, and very close to CoD, MGM, and Wynn Palace"
c50059,s4,Rooms - Clean and spacious
c50059,s5,"Beds and pillows were quite comfortable, and so were the towels and bathrobes"
c50059,s6,I particularly liked the bathroom: huge and beautifully decorated
c50059,s7,Facilities - Decent bars and restaurants on the hotel premises (I particularly liked Palms Caf√© and Bar and their craft beer selection)
c50059,s8,"Beautiful swimming pools and modern gym (just visited, but didn't try them)"
c50059,s9,Several luxury stores and boutiques if you want to spend some serious money
c50059,s10,"The casino was nice,‚Ä¶"
c50060,s1,The hotel is located in the Sands City
c50060,s2,"If you aim for a quiet resort, you should stay away from this hotel"
c50060,s3,"There are two towers, the Sky Tower and Earth Tower"
c50060,s4,If you stay in Sky Tower you have to walk at least 5 minutes to the restaurant for breakfast
c50060,s5,The breakfast was very nice and provided a wide variety of food include raw honey and fresh juice
c50060,s6,The price of breakfast was expensive but the hotel provided big discount if you buy coupon during check in
c50060,s7,The pillows and blankets were of high quality
c50060,s8,If you are not a SPG member you have to queue  quite sometime for check in during the peak check in time
c50061,s1,I booked for 2 nights  stay and spends my first night with friends for a celebration
c50061,s2,"üö´Carpet in Hallway was better than carpet inside the room (So much stains) üö´as A 5star hotel I expect to refresh my rooms but my bed wasn‚Äôt changed bed sheets, water glass wasn‚Äôt wash and i go back 1am my room not in Turn down mode‚ÅâÔ∏è ‚û°Ô∏èrefer on my my photos attachedüì±üîö  My expectations not meet as I expected"
c50062,s1,2nd stay at Sheraton Macao w hubs and 9 year old child
c50062,s2,This round we stayed at the Sky tower
c50062,s3,"Hotel: A typical massive 2,000 + room hotel in Macao"
c50062,s4,Which means madness during breakfast time
c50062,s5,It‚Äôs always a long queue at the main restaurant and we always had to be ushered to another restaurant
c50062,s6,Which also explains the sour and dour breakfast line server behavior I
c50062,s7,e
c50062,s8,those working at the egg and noodle station
c50062,s9,Check-in and out however was breezy with family area
c50062,s10,"The good: Cheery cleaning crew, also with a smile and polite greetings"
c50062,s11,I also had a nice birthday surprise from the front office
c50062,s12,How nice
c50062,s13,"Overall: A decent 2nd stay and only because we couldn‚Äôt get a room at newer hotels such as The Parisian, and JW Marriot during the busy Christmas month"
c50063,s1,Macau is one of the most imaginative and stirring man-made city in Asia
c50063,s2,Undoubtedly anyone who visits this place - comes with ideas of thrill and excitement
c50063,s3,Sheraton hotel is a commercial busy outlet with poor staffing and poor regard for the time of the guests
c50063,s4,Their staff is dealing with guests like robots - one comes and one goes- nothing more
c50063,s5,It doesn't ring a bell if their check-in counters are queued up with waiting time more than half an hour
c50063,s6,There are no sofas or seats at their checkins for young children and women who have to stand up with the waiting while someone from the family does the check-in
c50063,s7,This is something that no hotel in the world does to its guests- make them stand the wait
c50063,s8,"Curiously, is this hypocrisy in the name of hospitality, even permissible‚Ä¶"
c50064,s1,"For the customer service and lady in red uniform (i don't know whats her position) ,i give them 5 stars for the service because very helpful when we trying to check in"
c50064,s2,"For the other staff,they treat customer badly,  they never smile,  doesn't have manner and ethics at all, You guys work at hotel the most important thing is service but your service so terrible, i have been to many hotels, but never get service like this at all"
c50065,s1,Not a pleasant stay
c50065,s2,I have chosen to stay with Sheraton in the late night on December 19
c50065,s3,"My booking cannot be found upon arrival for check-in, and since booking was made via travel website, I was informed that he cannot help to check-in and was told to contact the travel website even I have the email confirmation"
c50065,s4,"During the time I am seeking for help to manage my booking, I receive no active assistance by the hotel staff"
c50065,s5,"As a customer, I felt that I haven't been treated well, he was rough when he was providing service to me"
c50066,s1,Stayed here in the month of December 2018
c50066,s2,Hotel property is vast and looks amazing
c50066,s3,Rooms are bigger than usual and look very nice
c50066,s4,"But as soon as I checked-in, the toilet seat was dirty"
c50066,s5,"After complaining, obviously the management made sure it's clean and tidy"
c50066,s6,"After they left, the toilet roll holder broke and the whole stand fell upon which the plumber came and sorted the issue"
c50066,s7,"When I used the shower room, all the water was leaking out from the shower room to the bathroom and I was shocked to see everything was flooding when I came out"
c50066,s8,The whole stay was a mess
c50066,s9,Surely they cleaned everything but the problem lies on how they manage the facilities provided to the guest
c50066,s10,"I have stayed in Sheraton in other places, even 3 star properties do not have such basic issues"
c50066,s11,I stayed‚Ä¶
c50067,s1,"It‚Äôs a huge hotel, lots of elevators, somewhat difficult to navigate, have to change lifts at different floors to go from room to lounge"
c50067,s2,"Suite was large but all glass doors in bathroom area needed attention, had quite a lot of dubious marks which are not expected of a 5 star establishment"
c50067,s3,"Summer holidays with many mainland tourists, place is noisy & very commercial"
c50067,s4,That is Macau!
c50068,s1,"The Sheraton, from a 1000 night Platinum member‚Äôs prospective"
c50068,s2,What a disappointment
c50068,s3,"Well not really, I didn‚Äôt expect much to be honest"
c50068,s4,But it is Macau and things tend to run on the top side of the brand name in this town
c50068,s5,What I got was an Albany NY experience while trying to give a Beverly HIll show
c50068,s6,So its a little confusing
c50068,s7,"I should start by saying the place is fine, not good, not bad, just fine"
c50068,s8,I have stayed at 10 to 15 different places in Macau over the years and this was the worst of all
c50068,s9,But the price was on the low side of the city for my days of stay
c50068,s10,"Checkin would have been a nightmare if I wasn‚Äôt Platinum, the wait could have been 45mins to an hour"
c50068,s11,I was second in line for checkin for the elite line
c50068,s12,"The agent was super nice, but couldn‚Äôt find the‚Ä¶"
c50069,s1,I have stayed at this property twice this year and the customer service was poor to Marriott standard
c50069,s2,"Check in - even though I am a Marriott Gold member, I was asked to go to a dedicated check in counter, but when I present my passport to the front desk staff, there are a lot of people come and go by various questions, and the front desk staff continue to answer their questions by ignoring my check in process"
c50069,s3,"Eventually, it took me 20min to complete the entire process which is not acceptable"
c50069,s4,"Check out - the first time when I stayed at this hotel, I personally went to the front desk to experience the check out process"
c50069,s5,The service I encountered is quite similar to the check in process with a lot of people come and go by asking questions
c50069,s6,"Hence, I just left my key at the‚Ä¶"
c50070,s1,I stay at this hotel most times when I'm in Macau because he location and price are pretty good
c50070,s2,"They also have good facilities (pool, gym, etc"
c50070,s3,") However, the check in process is always so long and they never have enough staff"
c50070,s4,I am a Marriott rewards member and the line was still very long as there was only one person serving loyalty members
c50070,s5,"Also, they did not credit my one night stay and I tried to email them with no response"
c50070,s6,I will still stay again because of the location but I advise others to not expect too much in terms of service
c50071,s1,First time to stay in one of the Cotai hotels and have mixed feelings
c50071,s2,"The  Good:  Location is right in the middle of Cotai strip and is connected to Conrad, Holiday Inn, and walkway across the road to the Venetian"
c50071,s3,City of Dreams and Morpheus close by
c50071,s4,Studio City a bit harder to get to but walk-able
c50071,s5,Breakfast has a huge variety
c50071,s6,Often has special discounts for room rates or restaurants
c50071,s7,Staff are mostly very friendly and helpful
c50071,s8,The Bad:  Way too many guests - check-in takes a long time and it's crowded everywhere   Tip #1:  check out the SPG check-in counter as the queue is shorter and the staff are actually quite understanding during the peak / crowded hours
c50071,s9,The hotel is designed to be a single long corridor - this means noises can echo and quite loud
c50071,s10,This‚Ä¶
c50072,s1,"Guest Service pick up phone after 9 rings, there English was quite bad"
c50072,s2,The room smells so bad
c50072,s3,But the set up for the special occassion was so great and perfect
c50072,s4,I and my fiance√® really appreciate the room set up
c50072,s5,Thank you for a womderful stay
c50073,s1,"Wish to acknowledge Nello, a guest service ambassador who served us in a restaurant"
c50073,s2,"Friendly, warm, enthusiastic and knowledgable about the dishes"
c50073,s3,Great dining experience
c50073,s4,Sheraton Grand was OK but not amazing for a top class hotel
c50073,s5,Executive lounge was lovely with a good spread for breakfast but more snacks & drinks on offer in between meals would be good
c50074,s1,Booked a room for 4 pax
c50074,s2,Were super disappointed from the minute we stepped in till we check out
c50074,s3,1) SPG membership couldn‚Äôt be located in the system
c50074,s4,2) were given 2 single bed for 4 pax
c50074,s5,Toiletries (toothbrushes) were given for 2 pax instead of 4
c50074,s6,"All the whatever not (showercap x 1, towels x 2, lotions, gels etc x 1 tube each)"
c50074,s7,"3) the woman who came to give us extra 2 towels, 1 tube each - shower, shampoo, conditioner was very rude"
c50074,s8,"4) the staff, Benjamin Hung downstairs at the counter was very arrogant, unfriendly, unhelpful, rude and impatient"
c50074,s9,"5) the male staff at the shuttle bus service area (towards galaxy) was very lazy, unfriendly, unhelpful and unprofessional"
c50074,s10,Whatever u asked is being replied by I don‚Äôt know
c50074,s11,The queue wasn‚Äôt clear too
c50074,s12,Was utterly disappointed by‚Ä¶
c50075,s1,We were travelling with 7 people including 2 small children and two grandparents
c50075,s2,"We came over from Hong Kong by ferry, timed it so that we could check in after 3pm so the children could be taken straight to the room for naps and everyone else could have showers and settle in"
c50075,s3,"After standing in the check-in queue for over 45 minutes, only 1 room was ready, despite it being after check-in time and having booked weeks in advance"
c50075,s4,We were told to come back later to check if the other 2 rooms were ready
c50075,s5,We spent over an hour wandering through the shopping mall with tired children and grandparents before rooms were ready
c50075,s6,"Once we got to the rooms, 2 keycards had to be re-keyed which meant more queuing"
c50075,s7,"During our stay, there were issues with house keeping not making up a room‚Ä¶"
c50076,s1,"The room‚Äôs carpet was so dirty and the Sheraton Tower Lounge did not provide wine, tap water and hot water during dinner snacks time"
c50076,s2,The server said they were just too busy to provide any water
c50076,s3,"Comparing to other Marriott brand lounges I visited, those lounges would provide a refrigerator with different kinds of drinks"
c50076,s4,And this Sheraton hotel provided almost none
c50076,s5,"In terms of service, I didn‚Äôt felt valued as a Marriot platinum member"
c50076,s6,The St
c50076,s7,Regis hotel (opposite to the road) offers much better service for 30US more per night
c50077,s1,We had two nights at this hotel in october
c50077,s2,#NAME?
c50077,s3,Great pillows and duvet
c50077,s4,#NAME?
c50077,s5,#NAME?
c50077,s6,We got late checkout without asking
c50077,s7,#NAME?
c50077,s8,They had everything
c50077,s9,I mean everything!  - Bad service at the pool areal
c50077,s10,#NAME?
c50077,s11,We endes up at the ferry terminal and had to take a taxi
c50077,s12,#NAME?
c50077,s13,And it closes at midnight
c50078,s1,My work books this hotel for me a few times a year
c50078,s2,I've been coming here about 3 years
c50078,s3,The hotel is getting worse over time
c50078,s4,The queue to check in and out is ridiculous - my normal waiting time is about an hour
c50078,s5,"The gym removed things like combs, and the shower has been broken for at least two years now (water goes cold then boiling then cold then boiling again"
c50078,s6,) and I've told the staff about the problem numerous times
c50078,s7,This is all quite a shame because the rooms are nice (especially the suites) and it's obvious a lot of money went into the hotel
c50079,s1,The hotel is bit as spectacular as it‚Äôs close neighbours such as the Parisian and Venetian and the price reflects that significantly
c50079,s2,With that said the hotel are obviously in the money making game as they would rather have you pay a machine for a fast check in than help customers out
c50079,s3,We stood in a queue for 45 mins to check in instead
c50079,s4,With that said the rooms were nice and large and the breakfast was ok
c50080,s1,I stayed in Sheraton Macau for few times and it is a hotel never listening what the guest need
c50080,s2,I experienced noise disturbance during the stay in August
c50080,s3,After my complain I got the promised from the Duty manager that my room preferences will be updated in my profile
c50080,s4,"For this stay, I have also called to the hotel in advance and provide my SPG number to ensure all information will be on the reservation"
c50080,s5,"Upon my check in this stay, the check in lady seems did not know about my preferences"
c50080,s6,I mentioned again the I need a quiet room which is not connecting room
c50080,s7,"When passing the key to me, she double confirm with me that it is not a connecting room"
c50080,s8,"In additional, she also ignored my gold membership status which did not offer late check out for me"
c50080,s9,"When I entered the room, what‚Ä¶"
c50081,s1,"I constantly travel to Macau, and I‚Äôve been trying different hotel everytime I visit"
c50081,s2,The room condition of Standard and Junior Suite at Sheraton didn‚Äôt really impress me but their staff were amazing
c50081,s3,Staff at the front desk spoke English well enough to communicate about the requests I made and were professional with kindness
c50081,s4,I‚Äôve met a guest service staff named Josie B
c50081,s5,"who helped me get to the room with so many luggages, was very friendly and that friendly conversation made me feel welcomed"
c50081,s6,He also explained about services Sheraton provides
c50081,s7,I tried to give him service tip but he strongly refused
c50081,s8,So I made a promise that I‚Äôll write a review of his great service
c50081,s9,Thank you for your great service
c50081,s10,"I would definitely go back there and stay at Sheraton Macau again, soon!"
c50082,s1,"Service is Excellent once you enter the hotel, the only part that I was very disappointed is when trying to enquire & confirm my reservation with their reservation team, they provide me wrong information that cost me to upgrade one of my booking once I arrived the hotel, i tried to look through TA a room but before that as a fellow front office in different hotel i first enquire from the hotel if they have a connecting of suite Deluxe & Deluxe room they said ‚ÄúYes they do‚Äù but it depends to the availability if they could offer me this room so i booked this two rooms, but upon check-in i was informed that it‚Äôs impossible to have a connecting for this 2 types of room or even in same floor since suite is suppose to be in a higher floor while reqular room is in a lower floor, I even‚Ä¶"
c50083,s1,Sheraton in Macau is actually amazing - not the touristy location but the Venetian side and it has a casino downstairs
c50083,s2,"Pros: a) Room size was reasonable, comfortable bed, typical Sheraton which is good b) It is connected to Conrad and some shops downstairs"
c50083,s3,c) Walking distance to Venetian and other hotels in the area
c50083,s4,There are connecting bridges and all  Cons: a) My SPG Gold was not recognised
c50083,s5,"I asked if there is an upgrade, the check in front desk staff said no, but there are plenty of room types that are still available, including the suite"
c50083,s6,"Well, I'm not a plat so you don't need to give me suite, but there are the ones with Cotai view? Nope, not even an attempt to offer that"
c50083,s7,b) Did not offer late check out / ask if I want to
c50083,s8,It was a small matter as I have an afternoon‚Ä¶
c50084,s1,Second visit and it‚Äôs certainly gone down hill since 4 years ago
c50084,s2,Arrived at 5am and the night staff are clueless
c50084,s3,No twin room I pre ordered they only had one which was smoking which I certainly didn‚Äôt want
c50084,s4,They then suggested a double room with one bed
c50084,s5,I explained I‚Äôm on vacation with my mother and definitely didn‚Äôt want to share a bed
c50084,s6,After 15 minutes and several staff getting involved we eventually received a twin disabled room which was not ideal
c50084,s7,Stayed here as I had a fantastic experience last time but would never stay again!
c50085,s1,"My flight arrived to Macau at 10:30am and i believe its too early to check in therefore i decided to go to the city spend sometimes there and come to check in at around 3pm but when i came and waiting in check in queue for almost 20min the receptionist informed me that the room not ready and need 02 hours, and she promised me that she will offer me a free upgrade, i said that's fine i can go to the shopping mall and try to have some coffee there as i'm bit tired of walking from 10:30am and as well my kids got very tired after 02 hours again i came to check in and the gentlemen as well informed that the room not ready then i become very angry and explained to him that i will not wait anymore and my kids got very tired then started to work on his computer in a few minute the room‚Ä¶"
c50086,s1,There was a so called upgrade to a normal room with a partial view of the Venetian
c50086,s2,"Wow! After expressing my displeasure, the staff, most of all Mina Zhong (?) of the Club Lounge and Eduardo, guest service ambassador to a lesser degree, did their best to try and make up for the very, very limited recognition granted a platinum for life member"
c50086,s3,I also got an extremely long apologizing email from management that offered no compensation other than a number to call the next time I come
c50086,s4,That same person should have been able to do something on my last stay!
c50087,s1,My friends and I are travelling to Hong Kong for the first time from Canada at the end of October
c50087,s2,We excitingly booked our stay at Sheraton Macau for 4 nights at a non-refundable rate
c50087,s3,"However, a couple minutes after pressing book we realized our flight to Japan leaves at 10 am from the Hong Kong airport the next day"
c50087,s4,The first ferry from Macau to Hong Kong leaves at 7:15 am plus added time from the ferry terminal to the airport which is not a feasible amount of time to get the airport especially as international visitors
c50087,s5,We called Expedia and Sheraton Macau immediately after booking
c50087,s6,An agent at Sheraton Macau told us to have Expedia send in our flight itinerary so she could put in a request to refund the last night
c50087,s7,We thought the issue had been resolved but the management‚Ä¶
c50088,s1,Been a loyal fan but had an extremely disappointing stay this time
c50088,s2,and it was my birthday stay
c50088,s3,"First off, mentioned it was my birthday during booking, no greetings no nothing, upon check in, still no smile no greeting and simply checked us in robotically"
c50088,s4,Then after a tiring day out and me and my partner longed for a good night sleep
c50088,s5,suddenly we were woken up by a group of customers yelling and running in the corridor for at least 10 minutes - to what seemed like a new group with multiple rooms just arrived past mid-night and was talking to each other shouting across rooms as if they owned the whole level!!  I then made calls to the guest service
c50088,s6,1st call Around 12:40am told reception lady and she said she‚Äôll look into it
c50088,s7,Chatters and noises continued
c50088,s8,2nd call‚Ä¶
c50089,s1,My experience with this hotel was already quite negative during the reservation process
c50089,s2,The reservation agent was not helpful and unprofessional; seems that she was not care at all with my enquiries and concerns
c50089,s3,Check-in was a mess
c50089,s4,"The queue was occupied by a big bunch of noisy guests, spitting on the floor, shouting adults and yelling kids"
c50089,s5,"Staff was offering an express check-in, but did not explain where I should go for the lift and which tower I was going to"
c50089,s6,Ended up I walked around for quite a while until a western gentleman helped me and my family out for the right way to go
c50089,s7,"When I entered the room, none of my requested (and confirmed) items were setup"
c50089,s8,meh~  Talking about the room
c50089,s9,"it was old, tiring, and dirty"
c50089,s10,"And, it was noisy! The lifts took forever to‚Ä¶"
c50090,s1,I called to make a reservation at the poolside bbq for dinner for 10 adults and 3 toddlers and spoke with Jackie
c50090,s2,She advised that they don‚Äôt take reservations and but will transfer me to the restaurant to see what they can do because we have a large party with kids
c50090,s3,"The restaurant didn‚Äôt pick up the line so she took my information (name, phone and reservation) and said someone would call me back"
c50090,s4,We have 4 rooms booked for the coming weekend and still have not heard back from anyone
c50090,s5,"This is not the service I would expect from the Sheraton, very disappointing!!"
c50091,s1,We checked in yesterday into the Family suite with the bunk bed
c50091,s2,"Typically, I‚Äôm not a reviewer but I‚Äôll like to warn parents of young kids"
c50091,s3,Mine are toddler age
c50091,s4,1
c50091,s5,There was a broken zip on the floor which my child found - it‚Äôs small and sharp; this will be very dangerous if she swallowed it 2
c50091,s6,The steps to the bed has very sharp corners so a toddler needs to be watched all the time to be safe 3
c50091,s7,Half the room lights were not working  4
c50091,s8,The crib was very small and very deep; so not suitable for a baby who‚Äôs a light sleeper
c50091,s9,5
c50091,s10,"Kids size table and chairs were made of plastic so if you have kids who like to climb, it‚Äôs very dangerous"
c50091,s11,"Separately on the adult room side, there was only 1 set of toiletries which was too small for 2 adults to use for more than 1 shower; so we‚Ä¶"
c50092,s1,"I arrived on a Wednesday around 5pm and, even with SPG Gold, it cost me 30 minutes to check in"
c50092,s2,"For business travelers, this is unacceptable"
c50092,s3,"The hotel facilities are ok, the gym is well equipped but congested and breakfast is quite good"
c50092,s4,"Elevators are not that fast, adding to the inconvenience of the check in/out lengthy process"
c50093,s1,I've stayed Sheraton Grand Macao quite some times
c50093,s2,I've arrived approx
c50093,s3,1AM in the morning at the hotel
c50093,s4,"I understood that Elite Member check-in counter is closed during night time but, staffs are don't care people who intervene the line"
c50093,s5,"Further that I have SPG Platinum but check-in staff told me I am Gold (Yes, I was Gold in 3 years ago)"
c50093,s6,"Beware, If you are Elite member of SPG who will arrive in night time, it will be nightmare to check-in the room"
c50093,s7,"They saying due to high occupancy in hotel, they aren‚Äôt available to upgrade the room and only can provide lower floor"
c50093,s8,(It`s not matter for me
c50093,s9,") However, when I enter to my room I heard noise and vibrating sounds coming from outside because of AC outdoor unit on the roof"
c50093,s10,I can't fall asleep because of that noise and I have to‚Ä¶
c50094,s1,We went to macau for one night from Hong Kong to see the house of dancing water
c50094,s2,I've not been to macau in years and find the place quite soul less and tacky but the dancing water show was worth it
c50094,s3,"Apon check in at the hotel at 3pm the place was a zoo, throngs of people all checking in at the same time"
c50094,s4,"When we finally got to our floor we noticed a strange smell, it just didn't smell that nice or clean"
c50094,s5,"the room itself was large, but nothing that special and certainly not super luxe, the fittings etc look cheap and not high quality"
c50094,s6,"the line for breakfast took at least 30 mins which was insane, one really positive credit though, for the staff member LANCE"
c50094,s7,"In the breakfast of Feast International, he gave my fiancee a shawl as she was quite cold from the airconditioning, without‚Ä¶"
c50095,s1,I had Feast dinner buffet at Sheraton Grand in Cotai Macau was terrible as they have long queue to wait for the table
c50095,s2,"However, there are only 2 chairs at the main entrance"
c50095,s3,It looks that they have badly trained the staffs to arrange the table
c50095,s4,"Also, they are under staffs to serve many tables"
c50095,s5,I will never return to Feast again
c50096,s1,I couldn't believe the bathroom was of such poor quality
c50096,s2,"First of all, the shower was only equipped with a shower curtain, no glass door, it was only spacious but with a cheap shower curtain"
c50096,s3,"And the toilet had no lid!!!  I thought I was in a public toilet!  Is it not common knowledge that you need a toilet needs a lid so that when you are finished, you can flush with the lid down and keep the bacteria inside???  How could a 5 star hotel do this?  Imagine all the towels, toothbrushes, combs, everything covered with bacteria???  My son & I went to the pool after check in which was about 6pm"
c50096,s4,"When we got there, my son wanted some fries but the pool's F&B closes at 6pm"
c50096,s5,"We were deeply disappointed, especially my son"
c50096,s6,"Again, I was surprised such service closes so early"
c50097,s1,I read many good reviews before booking sheraton hotel
c50097,s2,Many people recommended this hotel for nice location however i was quite disappointed when i first entered the room
c50097,s3,Dirty stain carpet and stuffy room smell
c50097,s4,I had to change the room but even changed room condition was not so different
c50097,s5,They had two pools however they were not in good length
c50097,s6,Both pools were divided in halves? I would pay little more and stay at Wynn palace
c50097,s7,I stayed at both hotels and sheraton was disappointing
c50098,s1,It is a 5 stars world branded hotel but card key can be spoiled and have to wait 30 min in corrido for re-entry
c50098,s2,It is a 5 star world branded hotel in tourist city but late checkout is 11:00am
c50098,s3,Most unforgettable experience was the guests could be bornt the outcome by the mistake of untrained waitresses and restaurant manager in result the services was poorer than wet market but you have to pay few thousand dollars a night to enjoy it
c50098,s4,"Frankly, I have no doubt not to render my recommendation for this hotel except the people do not mind their one star service"
c50098,s5,Other than that everything is so far so good
c50099,s1,"Ok hotel but consistent with my Sheraton & Westin properties around the world, this was is older, the lobby, entrance & casino is underwhelming"
c50099,s2,"Service seems excellent, although upon arriving at 3 AM it took forever to check-in, no one was working the Gold/Platinum line and despite having communicated with the hotel for the last 2 weeks about a few things I wanted upon check-in, they didn't have 2 of the items ready & hadn't bothered to communicate with me in advance"
c50099,s3,"Price/value is good but Wynn, brand New Grand Hyatt and City of Dreams looks off the charts modern and nice"
c50099,s4,In-room dining staff didn't understand my English and I could barely understand his (never ceases to amaze me that an American brand hotel doesn't employ and place English speaking people in key position‚Ä¶
c50100,s1,"I was a member of the fitness center, recently the management of the fitness is in downfall, the machines are dirty, before i can see the staffs clean the machines frequently but not these few months, the members have to clean them by themselves with the wet tissues that provided, i think its quite ridiculous with a five star hotel under the name of ‚ÄúSheraton ‚Äú, they even allow guests taking photos inside the gym eventhough sings are there to remind not to take photos, no wonder the old members stopped renewing their memberships"
c50101,s1,Stayed at tge property for 1 night and the overall experience was ok for a small chain but definately not a par for Sheraton
c50101,s2,"Had booked a nin-smiking room but by the time i checked in, all non smoking rooms were sold out"
c50101,s3,The only one available was without a bath tub and the staff at reception were very apologetic about it
c50101,s4,However the rooms were not fit enough for a Sheraton branding
c50101,s5,"Carpets were dirty, no electric kettle or tea bags in the room and no mini bar to go back to in case you feel hungry in the night"
c50101,s6,The overall staff were very good and express check out ensured you could walk out of the hotel in 2 mins flat
c50101,s7,Complimentary pick up  and drip from the hotel was a plus
c50102,s1,I visited Sheraton Grand Macau with my family and had read great reviews about the hotel However I found my self a bit disappointed as the services in no way matched the expectations
c50102,s2,The hotel overall is big and beautiful
c50102,s3,It is well connected with some other 5 star properties like the Venetian and Four seasons
c50102,s4,"The hotel casino is nice, however I liked the Venetian casino better"
c50102,s5,"The hotel also offers free shuttle services from and to the ferry terminal, though note that the shuttle is also used by the guest of other hotels so it can get really crowded"
c50102,s6,Our overall experience however was poor
c50102,s7,Firstly we had arrived at the hotel by 3
c50102,s8,12:00 PM
c50102,s9,M
c50102,s10,", however they said that my room was not ready which was very surprising for such a big hotel"
c50102,s11,We were only given a room at 6
c50102,s12,45
c50102,s13,P
c50102,s14,M
c50102,s15,‚Ä¶
c50103,s1,This hotel is absolutely the worst SPG hotel in terms of check in service
c50103,s2,"As an SPG preferred guest, I have to wait 2 hours to complete the check-in"
c50103,s3,At least 2 people jump in front of the queue
c50103,s4,"2 hours only for check-in to this hotel!   Can you imagine as a SPG guest member, you have to stand on the queue for 2 hour just for checked in"
c50103,s5,the manager actually feel like is okay without showing any apologize? I recommend you guys book hotel through travel agency not waste your SPG points since make no difference in check-in
c50103,s6,SPG member exclusive area was used by everyone without any management
c50103,s7,They not showing any respect and apologize to you expect put a bad fruit cart to your room
c50103,s8,I wish 0 star is an option for review this hotel
c50103,s9,Avoid at all
c50104,s1,I've been staying at this property since 2013 when it first opened
c50104,s2,"As an SPG Platinum Member, I almost always get upgraded to the Executive Suite (a big room that comes with a living room, media room, en-suite bath and view of the Cotai Strip), which makes me come back and stay here all the time"
c50104,s3,"Over the past 6 months or so, I've stayed here 3 times and on each occasion I was told the property was sold out and no upgrade was available"
c50104,s4,"Instead the front desk said that she could get me a standard room with a view, but cannot upgrade the room size"
c50104,s5,"When I got to the room on the 21/F, it was a nasty view of the rooftop and a bunch of pools that no one uses"
c50104,s6,How is that possible given that the hotel brags about how this is the biggest Sheraton in the world?! The quality of the‚Ä¶
c50105,s1,"I reserved non-smoking(I hate smoking), king bed, club room for one night"
c50105,s2,"During check in, Staff confirmed my room type also"
c50105,s3,"BUT entered room,  I could smell something cigarette, and noticed ashtray on the table and bath room"
c50105,s4,"I called to the hotel, but they told unable to provide non-smoking and king bed room because of full booking"
c50105,s5,They offer me to sleep separately with my husband in twin beds or sleep in smoking room
c50105,s6,"Why should I do that?I reserved that hotel ""two month"" ago and plan to go there for celebrate our anniversary"
c50105,s7,But no rooms????? sleep in twin beds????????  I was very upset and went down to club lounge with my 28 inch heavy carrier
c50105,s8,Only after they arranged the room along with my reserve
c50105,s9,"Although staff apologized and gave us some sweets, I'm very‚Ä¶"
c50106,s1,"I actually have great expectation on the hotel, but my experience speak otherwise"
c50106,s2,"We have book a room for 4 adults with 2 double bed, on arrival, the hotel inform us that one extra bed will be provided because the double bed is actually not a double bed but a super single"
c50106,s3,"So in order to cater for 4 adults, they supply the extra bed at no extra cost which we very much appreciate it and credit to the hotel, it is very comfortable"
c50106,s4,And that's all to said about the service
c50106,s5,"From the first day we arrived at our room, even though we clearly check in as 4 adults, all the amenities, towel, slipper, bottle water etc only prepared for 2 person"
c50106,s6,"We have to repeatedly call house keeping to provide 2 more set everyday during our stay, which is rather annoying seeing that we always come‚Ä¶"
c50107,s1,Well appointed rooms
c50107,s2,Given a nice view of the Parisian hotel and tower
c50107,s3,Checkin was pretty chaotic - huge line and people walking all over the place (especially groups
c50107,s4,)
c50107,s5,Luckily I saw there was a SPG counter and only 1 person was being served
c50107,s6,However when I got there I waited about 15 minutes to get any service
c50107,s7,For some reason there were 2 front office attendants serving the same guest
c50108,s1,The hotel have a nice view and comfortable bed
c50108,s2,"However, I do have a bad check in experience here"
c50108,s3,"There was a group come in once I was queuing,  they are keep cut in the line and without anyone from hotel to stop them"
c50108,s4,"(And yes, there was a FO stand in front of the line to delegate the guest to counter, they just cut in the line in front of him! And he do like see nothing)  Ended up my 1hrs plus ‚Äòlong‚Äô queue, I finally approached the counter, I checked with the FO why they are putting group and individual guest in the same line"
c50108,s5,The answer they told me was those people booked via online platform hence they are still consider an individual travellers
c50108,s6,"The DM extend the apologies, offer me fruit basket and extend late check out till 1pm for me"
c50108,s7,"However, there was no use at‚Ä¶"
c50109,s1,They have poor service where we put our luggage in the hotel luggage storage reception
c50109,s2,One of the bell boy doesn‚Äôt seem helpful at all
c50109,s3,We stay in the same hotel and same room  for 2 weeks and our last day was horrible
c50110,s1,Facilities as expected from Sheraton brand
c50110,s2,Several good staff around but overall worst ever experience
c50110,s3,- not allowed into breakfast as staff can‚Äôt find record of breakfast inclusion to my room
c50110,s4,This is despite prior confirmation via email and also again at check in
c50110,s5,"Staff called front desk but no one picked up, and my wife and two toddlers had to wait like denied morons while other guests with breakfast vouchers were served"
c50110,s6,"I had to raise my voice and showed email confirmation before allowed in  -  Departure time, submitted my luggage ticket and waited in queue but bags did not arrive"
c50110,s7,"At least 7 people behind me got their luggage before me, no explanation and I had to scold people"
c50110,s8,Eventually
c50110,s9,bag came but shuttle bus was gone
c50110,s10,We were hand carrying two sleeping toddlers‚Ä¶
c50111,s1,We are here staying now
c50111,s2,"There is no mini bar in the room, rooms are not so clean"
c50111,s3,"On top of it, we left our at 11am & got back at 4pm & our room was not cleaned"
c50111,s4,When I called customer service they gave me an excuse that we start cleaning after 3pm
c50111,s5,Although in the morning I saw their staff cleaning the room
c50111,s6,But what a silly excuse that we clean at 3pm
c50111,s7,"Most people check in by 3pm, rooms are generally cleaned in the morning"
c50111,s8,Not good experience at all
c50111,s9,"I recommend staying either in Venetian, Parisian or Galaxy"
c50111,s10,NOT SHERATON
c50112,s1,the hotel hardware is very classic sheraton but the hotel itself is very busy and a bit chaotic
c50112,s2,they have large area and queue posts for checking-in but only several counters opened
c50112,s3,"staff are not very helpful, they provide info but not helping"
c50112,s4,"the walk to hotel lifts is quite a walk, and the arrival hall and lift lobby are very dim"
c50112,s5,tho they have 8 lifts servicing each floor zone but with their vast amount of rooms hence guests
c50112,s6,you always have to squeeze in with many other guests in a lift
c50112,s7,"rooms are spacious, sheraton standard but not well-kept"
c50113,s1,"The Sheraton Macao is unfortunately, not all I hoped"
c50113,s2,"It‚Äôs Himalayan theme is novel and unique, but full of plastic trees, plastic balloon dogs for the kids and the same smell you get in all other Macao casinos"
c50113,s3,Nothing unusual there
c50113,s4,Check in line was busy at 1:30pm but not a long wait
c50113,s5,"The lady at the check in didn‚Äôt seem amazingly enthusiastic to see us (but I guess it‚Äôs hard to have a smile 24/7)? When we asked if we could pay for an upgrade to a Club room, the answer was a flat ‚ÄúNo, you cannot"
c50113,s6,You have to do it when you book
c50113,s7,‚Äù No offer of other options or room choices
c50113,s8,Obviously they didn‚Äôt want / need our money
c50113,s9,"Our key cards didn‚Äôt work for the elevator (but did for our room), which was right at the end of a very long soulless corridor that takes 2 mins to walk from‚Ä¶"
c50114,s1,I have stayed at the Macau Sheraton for more than 50 times (I think) since it's opening
c50114,s2,"The recent closure of the Sheraton Club has made the stay, especially for Platinum and loyal guests a big nightmare"
c50114,s3,"Checking in and checking out is the worst experience one can ever imagine! The platinum line is always jammed (and I don't think many of them are gold or platinum members) and with one person serving that line, it usually takes up to 30 mins before I was checked in"
c50114,s4,(I stayed at the Sheraton 3-4 times after the Sheraton Club closed and I keep reminding myself I have to raise a complaint
c50114,s5,)  Another big issue is the gym and the changing room
c50114,s6,"I think the hotel sells outside membership to the gym and hence the changing room is often packed, filthy and dirty"
c50114,s7,Claiming to be the‚Ä¶
c50115,s1,"Stayed here for two nights, Sheraton Grand Macao is located along the strip amongst with other Las Vegas named hotels - Conrad, The Venetian, Holiday Inn, and close to other 5-star hotels such as Wynn, Hilton, etc"
c50115,s2,The place was always crowded with plenty of tourists from the mainland
c50115,s3,The hotel is relatively brand new but the not so high quality of finishing is beginning to show and the corridors smelt of cigarette smoke even on nonsmoking floors
c50116,s1,Thumbs up to everything from the bus trip from the ferry to the check in procedure
c50116,s2,"All very polite, efficient, etc etc"
c50116,s3,Then we got to our room
c50116,s4,The first thing I noted was that there was just one towel
c50116,s5,It was double room with a King size bed
c50116,s6,Why would there be just one towel? Already this inconvenienced us since we were in a hurry to shower and leave for dinner
c50116,s7,I called Guest Services immediately
c50116,s8,"There was a long message in three different languages about how much they valued our patronage and that the conversation would be recorded, blah blah"
c50116,s9,I asked for a second towel
c50116,s10,The lady very sweetly replied that housekeeping would see to it immediately
c50116,s11,"Was it recorded? What do they do with the recordings?  Well, Sheraton housekeeping may have seen to it, but they sure did not‚Ä¶"
c50117,s1,They don't have any upgrade
c50117,s2,"For check in, I showed passport then need wait 30min until receive room key"
c50117,s3,"For drinking they don't have good lounge now also 1F tea space charged me 100%, ask asked AMEX SPG discount they don't know how work"
c50117,s4,Just sleep here is ok because not expensive
c50117,s5,"Room is clean, Bed is good"
c50117,s6,"But if want enjoy and have good feeling from hotel, you have more choices in here"
c50117,s7,I had many experience with SPG but this time is most unhappy time in my SPG life
c50117,s8,Never come back here
c50118,s1,If you want to stay in a 3 star feeling US style hotel - then this is the one
c50118,s2,"The redeeming features are the parts that make it 5 star, a very large and well equipped gym and heated pool"
c50118,s3,"Room service was prompt to deliver and some of the staff were enthusiastic, which cheers you up,  Staff in the cavernous corridors on route the the spa somewhat more sombre"
c50118,s4,Expect big crowds of people
c50119,s1,Very bad service at thin‚ÄùSheraton‚Äù
c50119,s2,They don‚Äôt speak English! Go to st Regis! We stay there in two rooms and really was the worst experience we ever had in a hotel
c50119,s3,Bad bad bad bad bad service! Or not service at all
c50120,s1,"When I checked in, I arranged for an earlier checkout than originally planned for the trip"
c50120,s2,I was told that it is fine and I will not be charged extra
c50120,s3,"Today when I was checking out, the staff was so confused"
c50120,s4,"I was first told that the Travel Agent that booked the room will pay for the room, so they can't reduce the extra nights and I will have to speak to my Travel Agent, so I queried if that was the case, why did they need my credit card for payment? Then their story changed completely and I was told I still need to pay for all the nights because I am checking out early"
c50120,s5,"So even with pre arranging it, it wasn't worth anything"
c50120,s6,So best is to avoid this hotel unless you are willing to waste your money
c50120,s7,"As a traveler for an international company, we use Sheraton around the world"
c50120,s8,‚Ä¶
c50121,s1,Shuttle bus from Taipa to the hotel is available
c50121,s2,Check in / out not flexible
c50121,s3,Room is spacious but neither well-maintained nor any special
c50121,s4,Amenities was not attractive at all
c50121,s5,Breakfast buffet was the best among odds
c50122,s1,"Stayed here for a company conference, about 1,000 of us"
c50122,s2,"Apparently the largest hotel in macau with 4,000 rooms  I only got my key at 6pm, not great  ""Forest"" theme in the lobby and there's an ok shopping mall attached"
c50122,s3,"Part of the giant cotai development, and linked to st regis, conrad, holiday inn, 4 seasons and sands  Got a suite so the room was fine"
c50122,s4,Showing its age a little
c50122,s5,"Overlooking the Parisian, with the gaudy multi coloured ""eiffle tower""  Gym is medium sized, with an ok locker/sauna area"
c50123,s1,"The hotel is beautiful, perfect location and I found it to be the only affordable option in the area"
c50123,s2,But it was way too crowded! May be because of the same reason the staff was not able to attend well during the check-in and check out process as well
c50123,s3,"There are multiple elevator banks, the least that could be done is to have someone guide after check in, which one is to be used!"
c50124,s1,This hotel was average when comparing it to others in Hong Kong and the standard of them
c50124,s2,The room was spacious however when you walked in it didn‚Äôt seem like it was immaculately clean like others in Hong Kong
c50124,s3,The buffet breakfast was very average there aren‚Äôt many breakfast options and the quality wasn‚Äôt the best
c50124,s4,The staff are all helpful and polite

c50126,s1,There was 8 of us booked in a club room for 3 nights
c50126,s2,It is a massive hotel
c50126,s3,"Was extremely disappointed when we first arrived as the club room was being renovated and alternative arrangements were arranged, we weren't aware of this"
c50126,s4,We were told that the new club facilities are going to be magnificent when finished
c50126,s5,"Really, I'm not going to be around so didn't want to be told this at check in"
c50126,s6,"The alternative arrangements were not well explained and left us confused, we needed more information and assurance"
c50126,s7,"The rooms are ok and ours was at the end of an extremely long corridor that overlooked air-conditioners of a building, not great"
c50126,s8,"After working out there were 2 rooms we needed to use as our club room , one for breakfast, one for evening drinks we were then shocked at‚Ä¶"
c50127,s1,First time staying at a Sheraton Hotel and I must say it was just ok
c50127,s2,"Room was spacious and clean, although some of the furniture were a little damaged by previous guests"
c50127,s3,Big down point is that the mini fridge was empty (like in most Chinese hotels)
c50127,s4,The electric kettle was nasty dirty
c50127,s5,couldn't even fix a tea
c50127,s6,The bathrobes in our wardrobe had holes!  I was expecting a 5 stars standard service that was not delivered
c50128,s1,The shuttle bus dropped us at the entrance close to the mall despite us telling him that we are not here for gambling but to check in to the hotel
c50128,s2,"There is no bell boy to help us carry the luggage at the mall entrance, so we ended up carrying our own luggage and my 2 year old daughter and walk all the way from the mall to the hotel"
c50128,s3,Not happy
c50129,s1,"Spent 3 unconfortable nights here, really not a pleasant one"
c50129,s2,"Read a few good reviews and decided to book this hotel, but I was wrong"
c50129,s3,"Check in was bad, service was terrible"
c50129,s4,Breakfast was mediocre
c50129,s5,"No, I won't stay in this hotel again"
c50130,s1,"I stay here for 2 nights, book a deluxe room and was upgraded to executive room with club lounge access on confirmation"
c50130,s2,"When I reach the hotel they told me only room upgrade, I show them the confirmation mention club are not inclusive but they say not indicated in their system"
c50130,s3,"If it is not provided, please do not indicate on confirmation as I have false expectations before I come and when I reach, I was disappointed"
c50130,s4,I don't want to argue further because mine was upgraded
c50130,s5,"Room is very big but seriously I don't need such a big room, I only stay like 8 hours in the room daily"
c50130,s6,"What I appreciate is the wifi, really very great wifi, other than that, the rest are normal to me"
c50130,s7,"Hotel shuttle bus from pier do not indicate their hotel name, I was wondering do they really have 4000‚Ä¶"
c50131,s1,The Sheraton Grand Hotel on the Cotai Strip is a big hotel with over 4000 rooms
c50131,s2,It's so big that noone is allowed to check in before 3pm
c50131,s3,This means that at 2
c50131,s4,45pm every day there are queues of new arrivals wanting to check  in at the same time
c50131,s5,I went to the casino for a couple of hours to avoid the check in queues and even then I had to wait in line for 40 minutes when I lined up at around 4
c50131,s6,30pm
c50131,s7,The staff do their best but there are just too many people
c50131,s8,The ground floor which includes the check in counters and casinos is always like shopping on Christmas Eve
c50131,s9,"Location is good, you can see 5 or 6 hotels without going outside and there are shopping malls amongst them all"
c50131,s10,Rooms and restaurants are typical Sheraton standard
c50132,s1,I am platinum member of SPG
c50132,s2,"Didn‚Äôt mug feel like I‚Äôm platinum member no greeting when I check in, even no upgrade the guy said fully booked on Friday?  No welcome fruits either"
c50132,s3,I haven‚Äôt treated like this as a platinum member
c50132,s4,Won‚Äôt go back for sure
c50133,s1,The room was very spacious
c50133,s2,It looked clean except I saw some mold growing on sink
c50133,s3,I didn‚Äôt know much about Macao so location of this hotel wasn‚Äôt too good for me
c50133,s4,I just signed up for spg membership and the staff told me that I won‚Äôt get points for staying since I booked the room thru trip advisor/Expedia
c50133,s5,I thought most people book a hotel thru travel agency like Expedia
c50134,s1,Sheraton is not my favourite hotel especially not impressed at all with the check-in experience yesterday but this housekeeping lady is best in class
c50134,s2,Will recommend her to Ritz or J
c50134,s3,W
c50134,s4,"Thank you, Angelee Morales!"
c50135,s1,Checking-in waiting for a pretty long time
c50135,s2,"Checkin staff bad attitude, look like don't want to work"
c50135,s3,"They only care about the casino business, their English is bad, finally, I checked in, the room still ok, but the internet is slow"
c50135,s4,The showerhead is not working well
c50135,s5,Not sure is it a real Sheraton standard
c50136,s1,"Yes, this is a grand hotel with 4000 rooms but that's pretty much where the Sheraton experience stops"
c50136,s2,We went there for my fianc√© birthday and even after being a SPG member there was no SPG experience
c50136,s3,Firstly we were asked to checkin at the mobile desk and not at the spg counter which itself was weird but not a big deal
c50136,s4,Then during the check in the girl at the counter forgot to tell us about breakfast and print the vouchers even though it was paid for
c50136,s5,Best of all the system did not show it was my fiance's birthday even though she is a spg member and the booking was on her account and I had to separately go and ask the service desk if they could arrange for something to make her feel special
c50136,s6,The breakfast was at Xin and predominantly Chinese non vegetarian food and even‚Ä¶
c50137,s1,In true sense a grand hotel
c50137,s2,Located just opposite the Venetian and Parisian good place to go around
c50137,s3,For Indian food go to golden peacock in Venetian
c50137,s4,"rooms are ok and when you are in macau, you are hardly in the room"
c50137,s5,Good place for a short stay
c50137,s6,Staff needs training on English as understandably not their first language
c50138,s1,We stayed 3 nights in early November and had been informed prior to arrival (not prior to booking however) that the SPG Club lounge was closed for refurb
c50138,s2,This was disappointing seeing as it is advertised as the biggest and best Club Lounge in the world
c50138,s3,On arrival we went to the makeshift SPG members check-in to large queues
c50138,s4,"Our upgraded room to a suite was good however I had booked a room for 3 people as my sister-in-law was sharing and they had made no provisions for this ie extra towel, dressing gown, bathroom soaps, glass etc"
c50138,s5,The reception was pretty quick to correct this however
c50138,s6,Instead of the Club lounge we had access to a choice of 2 places for breakfast and in the evening a buffet restaurant which was excellent
c50138,s7,My main disappointment was the fact that the main‚Ä¶
c50139,s1,It was a most disappointing one night stay for us at the Sheraton especially after we had a very enjoyable stay at the same hotel some 5 years ago
c50139,s2,We were quite shocked to find our guest room a little dusty and the carpet in both our guest room and in the corridor somewhat grubby
c50139,s3,The bath towels that were provided to us were old and fray
c50139,s4,"We ate breakfast at the coffee shop Feast where despite having paid MOP$502 (AUD $80) for the two of us, we could not have been tempted to have more than just a coffee and a plate of fresh fruits"
c50139,s5,The food items on the buffet counters were poor in terms of quality and presentation
c50139,s6,"In the section where the chef was making extremely greasy fried eggs from a pan with excessive oil, he literally would place the already cooked eggs on a piece of‚Ä¶"
c50140,s1,When we checked in there was no-one in front of us and there was no-one behind us so we were checked in with three staff helping us
c50140,s2,Unfortunately we were not asked if we would like our luggage taken to our room or offered by anyone to show us to our room
c50140,s3,We had trouble with the lift system -  only some lifts will take you to your floor and this is not clearly marked
c50140,s4,You go into the lift and the floor number is there but when you put your card in the slot and push the floor number the button does not light up
c50140,s5,It took us going back to the check in desk twice to be instructed on how the lift system works
c50140,s6,There are two banks of lifts and only one bank is for your floor BUT only 4 of the 8 lifts in that bank will take you to certain floors
c50140,s7,After a long flight or two‚Ä¶
c50141,s1,"Be warned that even if you pay for the CLub floor rooms, ordering anything (including a bottle of beer) will take them a minimum of 25 minutes to deliver, by which time you can expect the cold beer to be a bit warm"
c50141,s2,On a three day stay housekeeping will not bother to make your room or change the towels
c50141,s3,You only get that service if you chase the hotel manager
c50141,s4,Would strongly recommend going to the Sands or the Holiday Inn instead
c50141,s5,"Just not up to the Sheraton standards,"
c50142,s1,"This review is about the Deluxe suite of the Sheraton Grand, Cotai, Macau  The Sheraton Cotai Macau was rebranded Sheraton Grand Cotai Macau but the change is limited to the name only in my opinion, after having stayed in the Deluxe Suite twice in two months"
c50142,s2,Check in was done in the Club Lounge on the 4th floor instead of the main lobby which was less crowded but then the walk from the lobby to the Lounge took 10 minutes with a high chance of getting lost since the it was located amongst a spread of conference rooms and was not very clearly indicated
c50142,s3,The check in process was painless enough but took much longer than average
c50142,s4,Upon entering the suite one would immediately feel the sheer size of it and it was actually quite tastefully decorated in bright colours
c50142,s5,I would not go‚Ä¶
c50143,s1,It's the small things that make a difference & there were many small issues that left us feeling dissatisfied
c50143,s2,"The room itself was good - clean, spacious, great views"
c50143,s3,Everything outside the room was difficult
c50143,s4,Elevator system was annoying; 10:1 ratio of security guards:servers at the pool; no designated children's pool which meant noisy(but cute) kids in every pool area; advertised 15% discount for SPG members was not applied to my food bill; gym is way too small for a hotel of this size; SPG gold benefit here is non-existent
c50143,s5,was offered a shocking 1 drink for 2 people for a 2 night stay! If you just need a room to rest after gambling then you probably wont mind this this sheraton but dont expect any special treatment here
c50144,s1,My family had a mixed experience at this hotel
c50144,s2,"On one hand service is friendly and the hotel is clean; also, the Italian restaurant has an excellent Sunday brunch"
c50144,s3,"However, the Family Suite we booked came with a bunk bed, the top bunk of which did not have a mattress - it had a stone-hard mattress base that was covered by a mattress topper"
c50144,s4,"After our daughter's very painful night on the 'bed' we complained to the hotel, who provided us a rollaway bed"
c50144,s5,That was nice but they really shouldn't have supplied such an uncomfortable / incomplete bed in the first place
c50144,s6,"A real shame for what, otherwise, was a perfectly decent hotel"
c50145,s1,One of the worse swimming pool in a hotel we have ever experienced
c50145,s2,"The water in the pool was murky and uncomfortable, the walkway along the swimming pool was narrow to walk"
c50145,s3,"Each child under 140cm has to wear life jackets or arm bands, each pool has at least 1 ‚Äúsecurity guard‚Äù standing next to the pool to watch the guests, yet there are no life guards"
c50145,s4,"The guests would probably feel a lot better with life guards instead of security guards, people at least would not feel been watched as criminals"
c50145,s5,"The pool area supposed to feel relaxed while we are on vacation, instead Sheraton Macau made the guests felt under close watch by the security guards, while the pool is only 1"
c50145,s6,2 meter deep
c50145,s7,"When we sat down they did not offer any water, but made sure we did not bring any drinks of‚Ä¶"
c50146,s1,One of the worst pool experiences at an otherwise not bad hotel
c50146,s2,The water was dirty - felt like I was swimming in a river
c50146,s3,This was at 11am - not enough time for otherwise unclean fluids to cumulate in the pool for the day
c50146,s4,"This was surely a water filtration/cleaning problem - either too infrequently done, or not done at all overnight"
c50146,s5,Waiters didn't take food or drinks orders or offer water at poolside
c50146,s6,You have to walk to the bar to order
c50146,s7,"When I ordered and was about to walk back to my seat to wait, the waitress asked ""you gonna pay for that?"" - without explaining that unlike most hotels, here you pay upfront, not sign for it after"
c50146,s8,This is not because she has a language issue as a Chinese speaker
c50146,s9,I speak Chinese - it would sound equally rude in Chinese
c50146,s10,So I took my number‚Ä¶
c50147,s1,"After several reconditions from our friends, I booked this hotel for my husband's birthday"
c50147,s2,"He's always wanted to come to Macau, so we were excited for a weekend away"
c50147,s3,"I booked Club Level as an extra treat so imagine our surprise when upon arrival, they informed us that the Club Lounge was closed"
c50147,s4,We were really disappointed
c50147,s5,"Alternative arrangements were made but we really didn't care for the large, noisy atmosphere of Xin"
c50147,s6,Breakfast at Bene was similarly chaotic
c50147,s7,"We chose the club lounge because we don't like large, noisy venues; it was therefore disappointing in this regard"
c50147,s8,"The manager Stefan was very kind and accomodating and this was appreciated; however at the end of the day, I'm disappointed that we didn't experience what we expected to in booking the club lounge"
c50148,s1,I'm very happy with the room
c50148,s2,But hotel service definitely needs improvement
c50148,s3,"Food lacks variety, be it the breakfast at Bene or afternoon tea at Palms"
c50148,s4,I hope the food provided at Feast for happy hour later in the evening would not be disappointing again
c50148,s5,"There was no greetings when I went to Bene for breakfast, was left there not knowing whether I shall go in and find a seat directly all by myself or someone will usher me in"
c50148,s6,"Finally a lady showed me in, but she was going to leave without asking if I want tea or coffee"
c50148,s7,That's a different five-star hotel breakfast buffet experience
c50148,s8,"In the afternoon as the free (of course, it's included in the room rate) afternoon tea provided really is not the type I expected (I am sure Macau as a paradise for food and entertainment can‚Ä¶"
c50149,s1,Just checked in to the Sheraton last night
c50149,s2,Was very excited to spend the week here in Macao
c50149,s3,just now the Manager threatened to block the pool for my 7 year old daughter
c50149,s4,Physically threatened to not allow us into the pool due to an archaic policy about swimming
c50149,s5,Only because my daughter is under 1
c50149,s6,4 meters she is forced to wear flotation devices
c50149,s7,Even though she has been swimming for years and even had to pass a 3 minute water treading test to sail last summer
c50149,s8,What kind of customer service is that
c50149,s9,To threaten guests and not allow a 7 year old in the pool
c50149,s10,Last time staying at a Sheraton
c50149,s11,"Would be nice to get some help from the management, but it seems they just like to threaten 7 year olds"
c50150,s1,We chose the Sheraton as a safe value but ended up quite disappointed
c50150,s2,The check-in was efficient and friendly
c50150,s3,We stayed in a Deluxe king room
c50150,s4,Standard room quality - clean and functional
c50150,s5,Concierge service is helpful and bell service gladly kept our bags when needed
c50150,s6,"Breakfast was a major disappointment! After waiting in line for 30 minutes, we finally got placed at our table"
c50150,s7,I realized that this - never before seen - wait in line was not due to capacity issues but rather organisation
c50150,s8,There were so many free tables but all were dirty and waiting to be turned and that is the reason we had to wait
c50150,s9,No plates at stations
c50150,s10,No be leans in coffee machine
c50150,s11,No tea spoons
c50150,s12,No constant refill of food at stations
c50150,s13,We genuinely had a bad time here
c50150,s14,Doubt we'll be back
c50151,s1,"To whom it may concern, I have to say that I was very disappointed with the Concierge Night Shift Male Staff on 17th of Sep ! We were given the wrong information by him twice ! Firstly, we were meeting our friend who stayed in your hotel and thinking to have some drinks"
c50151,s2,"So, we approached him and asked where can buy some drinks, was the food court still open ? The answer was NO ! Okay fine, we were walking around for about 2 hours just to get our drinks ! What happened was we saw two hotel guest were holding some drinks and foods with them, and I found out that the foods and drinks were actually from 3/F FOOD COURT ! Second time, we went to him and asked for midnight bus service, and his answer was NO again ! Guess what happened ? At the end, we managed to got on the public bus ‚Ä¶"
c50152,s1,It takes over two hours to check in
c50152,s2,Sheets and rooms are clean and fresh
c50152,s3,You need to come alot earlier to get the most out of the day
c50152,s4,"If you're going to the casino there is one that takes up a lot of space, it is right in front of the reception"
c50153,s1,Shabby
c50153,s2,Poor check-in process
c50153,s3,Lovely view of an industrial plant
c50153,s4,Never again
c50153,s5,Don't do it
c50153,s6,Pools closed
c50153,s7,Breakfast expensive and poor quality
c50153,s8,Old room furniture nothing like advertised
c50153,s9,Scuffed walls
c50153,s10,Stained carpets
c50154,s1,"During the 3 days staying, Cleaning service was poor that always not give the water then we requested the cleaning service"
c50154,s2,but  Sheraton havejust two merits
c50154,s3,one is cheap amd another is good where to go other hotel
c50154,s4,I am going to macau again I will not stay sheraton
c50155,s1,"After lined up over 20 minutes to check-in, the receptionists told us they couldn't find our bookings with 2 rooms"
c50155,s2,"Therefore, we showed them the email confirmation, but they still took another 10 minutes to retrieve our reservation"
c50155,s3,"However, we were then informed both rooms had been arranged with king bed, which we did request twin beds instead, so they spent another 10 minutes to re-assign the room for us"
c50155,s4,"My brother already gave them both ID card and credit card once we approached the counter, but the receptionist still asked him if he would like to settle the payment by cash or credit card"
c50155,s5,"2 receptionists to handle one booking during the whole check-in procedure, it took almost an hour to get our room keys, totally not up to international brand standard"
c50156,s1,This is a massive hotel with super long check in lines
c50156,s2,It's even busier than my downtown office building
c50156,s3,This hotel is overflowing with people
c50156,s4,Forget about a relaxing holiday here and be prepared for rush hour
c50156,s5,"Seriously, pay extra for clubroom check-in and keep your sanity"
c50157,s1,First time to macau
c50157,s2,It was 16c
c50157,s3,We booked the family suite
c50157,s4,My 2 kids were ecstatic!! The other issue for us was the breakfast
c50157,s5,Food was below average & staffs were unhelpful
c50157,s6,It was also convenient hotel to walk about with outdoor amazing views!
c50158,s1,"The hotel is as you would expect a Macau casino property to be, large, loud, and with all the amenities"
c50158,s2,It was good for the purpose we went for - overnight stay with access to the casino
c50158,s3,"Do not expect great service, etc, it's too large for them to manage this effectively (though not bad)"
c50159,s1,The Sheraton used to be a fairly decent hotel
c50159,s2,It has gone downhill very fast
c50159,s3,"So many things that make a hotel stay great did not exist here! First of all, we are SPG members, so we SHOULD be able to check in at the SPG counter, but they would not let us check in as we didn't have the card on us at the moment"
c50159,s4,(Other hotels just refer to email to get it)
c50159,s5,"The checkin service counter people were so rude, they actually told us to 'go away', come back later!  Also, the rooms were not cleaned, nor new supplies replenished"
c50159,s6,"The pool is overcrowded, and a child was actually seen peeing in the pool from the side! All in all, very shoddy service indeed"
c50160,s1,"I recently stayed at this hotel, the price was high and the service was low"
c50160,s2,They didn't even clean our room or replenish the coffee or tea
c50160,s3,The check in experience was horrendous and actually had me near tears by the time everything was finished
c50160,s4,I think the hotel is overburdened and don't care about you if you're not from mainland China
c50160,s5,I will definitely be taking my visits elsewhere
c50160,s6,Not worth spending my hard earned money on a place that I'll be treated like a pain for trying to book a room
c50161,s1,Booked at Sheraton Macau again for last weekend stay
c50161,s2,The experience this time was rather disappointed
c50161,s3,"Being SPG member, I was eligible to check in/check out at their SPG member zone"
c50161,s4,"At check-in, not sure why, but I spent long time to do the check in (even I've booked the room via hotel website and got their email to remind me to send them my estimate arrival time"
c50161,s5,etc
c50161,s6,", I expected it should be a quick process)"
c50161,s7,"Then, was told that the system down and moved different computers"
c50161,s8,"Requested my non smoking room, however, when I got into the room, OMG, the cigarette smell was very strong and am sure it's stuck with the carpet"
c50161,s9,"Moreover, I was able to find the burnt stain on the carpet (3-4 spots)"
c50161,s10,"Housekeeping came to use the odor spray to try to cover the 'smell', and then‚Ä¶"
c50162,s1,"Rooms not delivered on time, banquet service was rude, unruly and uncooperative"
c50162,s2,"Their banquet manager, a Gagan ----- , actually started shouting and abusing, very uncharacteristic of hotel management, no signs of hospitality at all"
c50162,s3,Overall a very sad and pathetic experience
c50162,s4,Doesn't deserve a 5 star rating
c50162,s5,Housekeeping had the slowest service
c50163,s1,To start with it doesn't deserve a five star tag because the kind of services they offer to their guest is pathetic
c50163,s2,called several times for towels which never  came called for extra bed which never till 3 am in the morning and above that staff is also very rude
c50163,s3,will try not use this hotel again
c50163,s4,the banquet manager Gagan gupta is very rude and didn't accomodate our request !!!
c50164,s1,"To be honest, this is the most unforgettable birthday that I have ever had"
c50164,s2,"I can never imagine a hotel like Sheraton provided nothing for my birthday, no birthday cards and not even a word of blessing which was very disappointing"
c50164,s3,I still remembered we queue for check-in process which kept us waiting for more than half an hour
c50164,s4,"When we were waiting, I could see there were many staff presented while they refused to open an extra check-in counters ( 3 counters are closed and opened after we had wait for 20 minutes) We bought a package with breakfast, I would say the check in helper had ignored this"
c50164,s5,"If we didn't remind him, he totally forgot and treated us with no breakfast"
c50164,s6,"For the whole stay, I appreciate the fast speed and response of the housekeeping and customer service‚Ä¶"
c50165,s1,"I was travelling with my kids, husband and mum"
c50165,s2,Took us 2 hours to checkin because we arrived on a very busy Friday
c50165,s3,I liked that they have ammenities that my kids could enjoy like the dreamworks parade
c50165,s4,The rooms were neat and spacious but there‚Äôs something about the smell that I cant figure out about
c50165,s5,The attendants in the lobby were two things
c50165,s6,I asked a guy where the toilet was and he just pointed it with his mouth without saying anything as if im interrupting a very important conversation with his buddy
c50165,s7,The guy Martin was a different story
c50165,s8,Assisted us with our luggage and was really nice and friendly
c50165,s9,He made a connection with us by talking in french when he noticed the tag in our luggage
c50165,s10,His english was also really good for an Asian
c50165,s11,He told us the best places to visit‚Ä¶
c50166,s1,"There is a shuttle at the ferry but no signage for Sheraton, need to ask someone there"
c50166,s2,"This huge hotel took almost an hour to check in, very long queue and each queue also take such a long time"
c50166,s3,The hotel need a lots more check in counter
c50166,s4,Room are spacious and clean with a nice pool view
c50166,s5,"Compare with the price of venetian, I still go for Sheraton"
c50167,s1,This should be my fifth time staying in this hotel
c50167,s2,We booked an Executive suite and they upgraded us to a Deluxe suite (perhaps nobody booked large rooms in this middle-class hotel)
c50167,s3,"Compared to the rooms that I stayed in during my last visits, this one was a bit dirty and old"
c50167,s4,"The bathroom, especially, was a bit rusty"
c50167,s5,"Also, the hotel is extremely crowded and noisy, which is not welcoming to hotel guests"
c50167,s6,Don't stay in this hotel
c50167,s7,"If you stay in this hotel, remember to book a room with access to Executive club lounge for better service and fewer people"
c50168,s1,We have already been several times in Macau and our last stay in Sheraton was so far the worst
c50168,s2,"The facilities are great and well maintained, that's not the problem"
c50168,s3,When we arrived we had to wait around 1h45 before being able to check-in
c50168,s4,They mention that it's possible to checking starting at 3PM
c50168,s5,We managed to reach our room at almost 5PM
c50168,s6,Our plan was to enjoy of the swimming pool in the afternoon
c50168,s7,we arrived at the swimming pool when the sun was almost already gone (and the swiming pool was closing at 6PM
c50168,s8,)
c50168,s9,Everything seemed normal for the staff
c50168,s10,that was not very helpful
c50168,s11,That's the first time that we experience such a bad service in an Hotel of that standing
c50168,s12,We were all very disappointed
c50168,s13,We understand that Sheraton Macau is huge hotel but that's not normal‚Ä¶
c50169,s1,"Despite management's claim that they are trying to improve their check-in process, the line to check-in is still indeed one hour"
c50169,s2,The clerks were pleasant and apologetic but there is absolutely no excuse for any professional hospitality group to not have planned for accommodating their room capacity - certainly not an established company like Sheraton and certainly not one well past their opening days
c50169,s3,"That's lack of hospitality, a nuisance, but what's inexcusable is the lack of housekeeping!  We stayed for three nights and had been offered the ""eco-friendly"" option of trading in housekeeping for a late checkout"
c50169,s4,"Since we are Marriott Rewards members (late check-in already a given) with supposed reciprocity with SPG, we asked for housekeeping"
c50169,s5,"The first two days, we had no‚Ä¶"
c50170,s1,We stayed at Sheraton for 2 nights
c50170,s2,Check-in took an hour inspite of us being an SPG member
c50170,s3,There wasn't any place to rest/sit in the reception area while we were waiting for our turn to check-in
c50170,s4,The front desk staff was not at all warm and flexible during check in
c50170,s5,Same was the case with staff at luggage and conceirge service - they were neither friendly nor helping
c50170,s6,We were greatly disappointed with the service
c50170,s7,The room allocated to us was modern and clean but not luxurious
c50170,s8,There are other better hotels to choose from at Cotai center
c50170,s9,They had a mobile phone for guests to use inside and outside the hotel area
c50170,s10,It provided unlimited internet access and both local and international calls (to 10 or 12 pre-listed countries)
c50170,s11,We liked the pool area
c50170,s12,There were many small‚Ä¶
c50171,s1,"We arrived around 4:30pm, there was a super long queue"
c50171,s2,It took us around 50 mins to check in
c50171,s3,"However the front desk staff, Rikko was unfriendly, strict & does not even smile during check in"
c50171,s4,I am disappointed with the service
c50172,s1,Stayed at Sheraton for 3 nights
c50172,s2,Checking in take an hour
c50172,s3,Stayed at sky tower and room is old
c50172,s4,Stay at this hotel for the past 4 years and this would be our last stay at this hotel
c50172,s5,There are so many hotel to choose from at cotai center
c50173,s1,We stay two night for wedding anniversay
c50173,s2,The hotel is really huge and the staff is very busy
c50173,s3,Some of them seldom smile
c50173,s4,"The club lounge staff did not ask us of coffee tea, we need to ask fir it"
c50173,s5,"He serve tea without milk and sugar, we need to get it by ourselves"
c50173,s6,The suite is nice and spacious
c50174,s1,We are SPG Platinum members and we are deeply disappointed with this hotel
c50174,s2,"We came here for some rest and relaxation but instead of relaxing by the pool, the security at the pool has been haranguing us nonstop"
c50174,s3,"They have a new (and STUPID) policy where if your child is under 140cm, they MUST wear arm bands and an adult MUST be in the pool with them"
c50174,s4,"Our children are (unfortunately) under 140cm but they are all on the swim team, having years of (very expensive) swim lessons that they could probably save me from drowning in the ocean if they had to, yet because of their height, they cannot swim and play in the pools by themselves"
c50174,s5,"After an hour of arguing that they cannot make us go into the pool with them, they have to be in our line of sight"
c50174,s6,The Sheraton has multiple small‚Ä¶
c50175,s1,Very nice hotel but only one thing must be remembered and pay attention to  Check in time !  Either you go there to do the ore registration provided no need to queue
c50175,s2,Then come back after 3 to collect your room key
c50175,s3,Otherwise you are expect to wait for hours to finish your check in procedure
c50175,s4,I don't understand nowadays with the technology what Sheraton did not offer e check in service
c50175,s5,Since they are so popular otherwise it's not worth to pay over 1000 dollars for such short period of time
c50175,s6,Since check in time after 3
c50175,s7,Mostly you will be able to get the room around 4 and check out time is 11am next day
c50175,s8,The rest of the facilities are meeting the standard
c50176,s1,Its not my 1st time i stayed in this hotel but the worst experience i have ever had
c50176,s2,I booked the cotai view room and assigned to the normal deluxe room which was HKD500 difference on the room type
c50176,s3,The check in staff was not helpful and especially when i asked if there any pamphlet for the restaurants provided that the sheraton is connected with other hotels as we want to stay in the block such that my colleague and i can work in the restaurant
c50176,s4,"He gave me a look and asked me to go to the concierge, so i did and got a quite not useful one as the map was for the Venetian chain"
c50176,s5,"After i got into my room, my blanket was dirty and i have to call the operator to send someone over to change it while i was out for dinner"
c50176,s6,"It was 12am when i back to my room and ready to bed, 2 rooms‚Ä¶"
c50177,s1,i normally wouldn't write anything but i think it's useful for other parents to know about a few things
c50177,s2,My husband and I stayed in Sheraton Macau over the weekend and I felt the good comments i read previously was quite misleading
c50177,s3,"In conclusion, it's not a baby friendly hotel"
c50177,s4,"First of all, it takes forever to check in, we arrived at the hotel around 12 pm, they said the check in time is 2pm but my baby needs to take her nap soon, so i asked if they would allow me to check in first, and they said i could try at the SPG member check in counter, i waited in the line for half and hour and only to find out it's not possible until 2pm"
c50177,s5,so i had to come back at 2 and waited in the line for another 45 mins before we could get our key
c50177,s6,"and baby has become over tired and cranky,‚Ä¶"
c50178,s1,Check in at the club lounge was slow
c50178,s2,Might be understaffed
c50178,s3,However the staff was polite and courteous
c50178,s4,Our room was on a higher floor
c50178,s5,It was roomy and clean
c50178,s6,The reason I gave a 3-star rating was the poor design of the shower and the breakfast situation
c50178,s7,"First, there was no shower mat (you have to ask housekeeping for one)"
c50178,s8,Otherwise it was very slippery
c50178,s9,No handle bar
c50178,s10,Also water ran outside the shower door because of the shallow ledge
c50178,s11,"Secondly, there was not enough table for breakfast seating in the lounge"
c50178,s12,We finally found a table but was next to the outside area where people went in and out causing a draft
c50178,s13,Food was ok
c50179,s1,"First, the good news: Most of staff we interacted with, with the exception of the grumpy, over-worked concierge lounge people, were friendly and responsive--within their province"
c50179,s2,"The bad news, there weren't enough of them"
c50179,s3,The rooms were clean
c50179,s4,The bathrooms very small
c50179,s5,But my biggest complaint was the price gouging
c50179,s6,I attended a conference with a group rate and decided to stay on to enjoy a weekend in the city
c50179,s7,I asked my daughter and friends to join me
c50179,s8,"In order to accommodate this, I needed to make a second reservation and decided to do so on the club floor"
c50179,s9,My friends booked the club floor themselves for the same weekend
c50179,s10,"Once I arrived at the hotel I decided the room I was given was adequate and asked to change the reservation, cancelling the second and extending my stay‚Ä¶"
c50180,s1,The slowest check in I have ever experienced
c50180,s2,It was the long weekend in China so understandably busy but then the hotel did things like closing one of the pools which did not make sense
c50180,s3,Pool ran out of towels no drinks etc
c50181,s1,I was locked in the room on my first night there due to the faulty lock and my friend who came back to the room later was locked out
c50181,s2,Took the maintenance/staff almost 40 minutes to dismantle the lock from outside
c50181,s3,Staff at the reception didn't give priority to my call when I informed him that I was locked in my room
c50181,s4,I had to call twice
c50181,s5,I was given a different room but no compensation whatsoever was offered to me until we asked
c50181,s6,"As a 5 star hotel, I believe they can do better"
c50182,s1,Overall it's a good experience to stay in Sky Tower of Sheraton
c50182,s2,Especially to dine in the Xin restaurant with very nice hospitality from Catalina
c50182,s3,We did enjoy the food and to go twice within 2 days
c50183,s1,Stayed here in May 2016 and arrived the hotel at around 13:30
c50183,s2,My friend and I requested for early check in if possible
c50183,s3,"However, when I wanted to approached the reception, a man (looks like a security guard) told me check in counter has not opened and refused me for checking in (just directly turned me down)"
c50183,s4,"At that moment, I was very disappointed since no other guests over there and I wonder whether the staff there don't know how to do check in"
c50183,s5,Other hotels that I stayed before would allow me to do the registration and assist with luggage
c50183,s6,Well
c50183,s7,but no such service in Sheraton Macao
c50183,s8,My friend and I needed to bring our luggage to the bell
c50183,s9,"(Not close to front desk)  Before arrival, I was quite happy with their staff since I sent them an email and ask for assistant for‚Ä¶"
c50184,s1,To start off this hotel made a terrible impression when I had to cue up for 50 minutes to check in
c50184,s2,While this hotel has a rather large casino in the middle they fail to make space to accommodate their guest in their breakfast halls often seeing out their customer in 30 minute cues just to get seated in the breakfast buffet
c50184,s3,Furthermore they fail to realise that many guests have cued up for much time and they very quickly start removing the breakfast buffet at 10:30 resulting in many not receiving the package they paid for
c50184,s4,"Despite having such a great potential to be one of the best hotels in the area with spacious rooms and high quality of materials from the hair dryer which was greatly appreciated to offering free wifi hotspot throughout Macau and rather elegant hall,‚Ä¶"
c50185,s1,"About one to two weeks prior to our trip we requested to have 3 rooms that should be close to each other, but when we arrived we could only be arranged  with rooms about half a minute distance from each other"
c50185,s2,The worst thing appeared in the lift
c50185,s3,"They install a security system that requires the use of room card to get access to the floor we lived, but that system often malfunction"
c50185,s4,For quite a few times we could only take the lift back to G/F and scan the room card again
c50185,s5,The elevator is really a mess
c50186,s1,"I'm used to better from Sheraton, this was a surprising disappointment"
c50186,s2,"Try another NEWER Hotel I suggest, such as the Venetian or Parisian"
c50186,s3,I stayed in a Club Room on the 31st Floor of the Sheraton
c50186,s4,"The rooms are Nice and reasonable, however, an Older style"
c50186,s5,"Pillows are those super soft falls away type, that you either love or hate"
c50186,s6,The Internet speed is good and free in the Club Rooms
c50186,s7,The Room Service and the Food options are expensive and NOT the highest quality
c50186,s8,"The Minibar in the room is a bad joke, but it is Asia"
c50186,s9,"The food in the Food Halls is just as good and  1/3 of the price, and a 10 Min walk"
c50186,s10,Try the food hall in the Parisian or Venetian
c50186,s11,"The pool area is nice, but most hotels have nice pool areas"
c50186,s12,"The Club Room Lounge is a waste of time, the snacks at Lunch time are‚Ä¶"
c50187,s1,Sheraton Grand is just 10 minutes away from Macao Airport but is a typical massive casino style hotel where the lobby is like a busy shopping mall and it takes forever to find where your room is as the place is just too big
c50187,s2,If you like massive casino style hotels this place is perfect
c50187,s3,I dont
c50188,s1,This hotel is very good in terms of infrastructure and also the facilities but I was very disappointed in terms of service  I did share with the management and they promised to improve  Hope they do so  I normally have warm water with lemon and honey in the morning and they first say will try and then asked a exorbitant price for a this (which normally is free)
c50189,s1,The hotel was defintely good for its value
c50189,s2,The room was spacious
c50189,s3,It was also generally clean
c50189,s4,Check in was quick
c50189,s5,The internet was quick
c50189,s6,The view was ok
c50189,s7,The guy from the philippine who was standing in the lobby was super helpful
c50189,s8,I am sorry I forgot his name already but he was the best service staff so far I have encountered in Macau
c50189,s9,"However, most bell and concierge staffs were so rude and unwilling to help"
c50189,s10,The concierge were chatting among themselves while I went approach them to ask for questions and they made me feel like I was disturbing them and was not helpful at all
c50189,s11,That's not the worst
c50189,s12,The worst was the bell service
c50189,s13,The staffs there did not speak English or Cantonese
c50189,s14,They kept making me feel like I should speak Mandarin to them
c50189,s15,"And if I didn't understand, they‚Ä¶"
c50190,s1,I've booked 4 rooms for my friends and I
c50190,s2,It was a holiday so the 30 mins long queue was expected
c50190,s3,"However, the reception desk was very stupid and slow"
c50190,s4,It took us 15mins to complete everything
c50190,s5,At night we rang the room service and request for a dozen bottles of beer
c50190,s6,it took quite a few minutes to be delivered
c50190,s7,I rang the room service again and she said they were busy
c50190,s8,"Well, it was 2am"
c50190,s9,"The other day, 3 rooms were checking out and 1 room will be continue staying"
c50190,s10,I asked the reception desk lady if I have to pay for the drinks that we have ordered last night
c50190,s11,she said the guest checking out will be paying so we sorted out the bills ourselves to the guest leaving the next day
c50190,s12,And the room didn't cleaned up properly
c50190,s13,The left over of the beer bottles were still on the desk‚Ä¶
c50191,s1,My first stay at the Sheraton Cotai as a quick Birthday getaway weekend
c50191,s2,"Thought would give this a try as Sheraton is usually good for value!   Getting around is no problem, there are shuttle buses from almost anywhere to any given hotels in Macau"
c50191,s3,A taxi would be around MOP 50 to the airport or ferry terminal
c50191,s4,"Reception  Unless you are an SPG member, do not stay here as it could be a good hour before you get checked in"
c50191,s5,"As a member, I queued for around 20 minutes which has never happened at any Sheratons I've stayed"
c50191,s6,"Lobby It was a very busy lobby with all sorts from shopping, caf√©, promotion, casino"
c50191,s7,"This is something not preferred personally, as I expect some quiet moments but it is Macau so I should have expected it!  Room The hotel seems to have a few wings, and we were‚Ä¶"
c50192,s1,When we arrive we were led to a small check in area with three staff
c50192,s2,All three staff had a guest but we were next in line
c50192,s3,I swear 15 minutes later we were still waiting
c50192,s4,I was so upset i was going to cut in and ask what they were talking about
c50192,s5,Finally when our turn came I understood
c50192,s6,The check in process was relatively slow anyway but then the receptionist went through a barrage of sales pitches
c50192,s7,from flogging their loyaly card to wanting to provide late checkout on Sunday if we agreed to no room cleaning on the Saturday
c50192,s8,really? I suggest Management review their check in procedure
c50192,s9,Creating long queues of arriving guests is not a good start to the vacation
c50192,s10,Anyway that was the worst of our experience
c50192,s11,The room was clean and large
c50192,s12,We found the location very good
c50192,s13,Very easy‚Ä¶
c50193,s1,"The hotel complex itself is humongous! it is very impressive yes, but the attention to details get lost with a mega structure like this"
c50193,s2,"I don't really have anything ""wrong"" to say, it is just too big and too ""mass produced"" Buy if you are into the gambling and shopping then the location is ok"
c50194,s1,"Prior to 2016, Sheraton club lounge was one of the best in Asia"
c50194,s2,It used to provide lots of selection of hot and cold dishes for breakfast and evening canapes
c50194,s3,They have revamped the club lounge by giving out noodle in soup and cold sandwiches
c50194,s4,"In addition, they will hunt you down and charge for your children"
c50194,s5,Pay a bit more and go to JW Marriott Hotel in Macau instead
c50195,s1,On my  third stay in Macau I decided I would stay on the Cotai Strip for the first time
c50195,s2,I have previously stayed in Macau (Grand Lapa and Grand Lisboa)
c50195,s3,"So I discovered a problem with Cotai, there is no such thing as a 7/11 or supermarket anywhere in Cotai, so if you want a snack, or a drink you will be paying Hotel, restaurant or bar prices"
c50195,s4,"In central Macau this is not a problem, as there are stores everywhere"
c50195,s5,"The other problem is it was raining non stop, could I find a reasonably priced umbrella anywhere in Cotai -no"
c50195,s6,This became a problem meaning I had to take the free buses between the casinos (even if they were just across the road
c50195,s7,"I guess I can't blame the Sheraton for that, the hotel was everything I expected, room was large with full bath and shower, everything was‚Ä¶"
c50196,s1,I would never choose any mega size hotel in the future unless there is a better solution for check-in
c50196,s2,"I moved to this hotel from another hotel on Cotai Strip around 12 pm, and hotel front office was very strict that check-in only starts from 1pm, so after I stored my luggage in concierge and came back around 3:30, I have to wait in line for 50 minutes to check in"
c50196,s3,"The lines are just crazy as airport checkin counter, the craziest I have ever experienced"
c50196,s4,"I understand such wait I s inevitable for a 4000 room hotel like this, but they could had been more flexible on taking check-in to reduce the waiting line"
c50196,s5,"Apart from this, I booked my room through Agoda and I was assigned to a room with poor amenities"
c50196,s6,"There is no drinks in fridge, and the minibar is at economic hotel level"
c50196,s7,‚Ä¶
c50197,s1,The check in and check out took forever
c50197,s2,The lobby is too crowdede and most of the staffs do not speak english
c50197,s3,The breakfast was great
c50197,s4,Many food selection that we can enjoy and it very close with shopping center
c50198,s1,I always have a preference for SPG hotels when I travel
c50198,s2,"However, I stayed in Sheraton Macao for 1 night and it was highly unsatisfactory, and from now on I will always second guess myself when I book a SPG hotel"
c50198,s3,"First, the room was quite old, and although the room description said there would be refreshments provided - they were very minimal and highly unsatisfactory - there was nothing in the fridge and there were no snacks - only several tea bags and instant coffee were provided - this is definitely not up to standard of a luxury SPG brand hotel"
c50198,s4,"My most unsatisfactory part was that the next morning at around 10am, the next room was under renovation, and I have heard people drilling and banging the wall at 10am and I could not sleep at all"
c50198,s5,I really did not expect a‚Ä¶
c50199,s1,"This hotel is a very ""cold"" hotel"
c50199,s2,"Check-in process takes forever and staffs are pretty ""plastic"" and have no sincerity in helping you out"
c50199,s3,I have no complaints about the hardware of this hotel BUT the software of this hotel is absolutely disappointing
c50199,s4,"Location wise, it is definitely in one of the best areas in Taipa and there are plenty of shopping and F&B outlets around this place"
c50199,s5,I am disappointed that this property is nowhere near the high standards that Sheraton Hotel group has set
c50199,s6,Massive rooms for improvement
c50200,s1,"The hotel has got a great location; attached to the huge Sands Cotai Central mall, a walking distance to the Venetian, Parisian and Studio City"
c50200,s2,"However, the quality of service crushed my holiday experience"
c50200,s3,I am an SPG member and there is a special place to check-in for the SPG members
c50200,s4,"The receptionist did not greet me, not welcoming and not smiling; might as well check-in online; I felt like talking to a robot"
c50200,s5,"The room is quite spacious with a nice pool view, but there was a weird smell in the room"
c50200,s6,The only decent experience I had was during my workout in the gym
c50200,s7,The gym staffs greeted and smiled
c50201,s1,"Experienced the longest ever hotel check-in ever, took almost an hour and the front desk was pack of people"
c50201,s2,Never had this experience before where the front desk was so full of people waiting and sitting on the floor in a 5-star hotel
c50201,s3,"But once you got over the check-in, the stay was decent"
c50201,s4,"The room was clean, comfortable and rather big"
c50201,s5,The gym was spacious with enough machines to satisfy most gym junkies
c50201,s6,A good stay if it wasn‚Äôt for the long check-in
c50201,s7,One of the cheaper 5-star hotel in Macau and in a good location
c50202,s1,This is the second time for me in this hotel in the last one year and have experienced just the same issues as i had in my previous stay
c50202,s2,Let's start with the positives - big rooms and nice ambience and unfortunately my list of positive stops there
c50202,s3,"Having worked for this brand in the beginning of my career, I find it very hard to believe the bad attitude of the staff at reception desk and the restaurants"
c50202,s4,"They made us feel that the only thing they bare interested in money, not the service they should give us"
c50202,s5,We don't get water served till we order something
c50202,s6,"We don't get the rooms till we pay a deposit for other services even though the rooms are paid fully in advance, doesn't matter if you have travelled for 24hrs and you reach at midnight, they won't give you the room till‚Ä¶"
c50203,s1,"Although it is a 5-star establishment, it really depends on which wing you are staying at"
c50203,s2,We opted for a non-smoking room and were given a 16th floor room on Earth Tower
c50203,s3,My friends wanted a high floor room and were given a 26th floor room at the same Tower
c50203,s4,Another couple on the other hand were shown the Sky Tower which had access to the Business Lounge
c50203,s5,"We were all on a leisure trip and had booked deluxe rooms!  The Sheraton is massive, and linked via indoor walkways to the other two hotels - the Conrad and Holiday Inn"
c50203,s6,"At the Sheraton, if you are an spg cardholder, you are entitled to attend the Cardholders Casino or receive 20% discounts at its dining establishments and restaurants"
c50203,s7,The room is spacious and comfortable - especially the bed and pillows
c50203,s8,The bathroom is‚Ä¶
c50204,s1,Pros: Hotel is wonderful
c50204,s2,Rooms are convenient and breakfast is lavish
c50204,s3,The location is perfect
c50204,s4,Cons: Front Desk staff  Their attitude is completely unacceptable
c50204,s5,They are unable to communicate properly in english
c50204,s6,I asked them for their manager and the staff bluntly replies that the manager sits behind in the back office without lifting his head
c50204,s7,Their policy of 5000 HKD as deposit is from the 17th century
c50204,s8,There is however a better way of enforcing this than allow their untrained front desk staff communicate
c50204,s9,Somebody needs to drive the fact to their front desk staff that hospitality is all about being pleasant and warm especially when we arrive after a long humid day
c50204,s10,Never would i visit this hotel again nor recommend it to anybody
c50205,s1,Very low quality hotel for a Sheraton brand
c50205,s2,For few MOP more you can stay in other much better and newer hotel
c50205,s3,This is old most foreigners don't choose this hotel anymore
c50205,s4,"Room facility is not good, very low quality products on the bathroom"
c50205,s5,Towels are small and hard
c50205,s6,Minibar was EMPTY
c50205,s7,They put a notice to call the room service in case you want to fill the mini bar
c50205,s8,This is not acceptable for this hotel standard
c50205,s9,Breakfast was poor at most
c50205,s10,"And if you pay apart, it cost you U$ 23 per person"
c50205,s11,Don't recommend at all
c50206,s1,We paid for a room with view and the view we got was another building right next to us
c50206,s2,"Although, the bathroom is big but we are not sure about the cleanliness because we found hairs in the baht tub and pieces of snacks on the floor for over 3 days! There was nothing in the refrigerator"
c50206,s3,However! Great in room dining services!
c50207,s1,Background: We are regular patrons of spa getaway overnight stays in Macau
c50207,s2,"As my wife and I are based in Hong Kong and 10 minutes away from the pier, we nip over for some pampering whenever the mood calls for"
c50207,s3,"Usual stays: Four Seasons, Mandarin Oriental, Banyan Tree and Ritz Carlton"
c50207,s4,For this trip I thought to try the Sheraton Grand for my wife's birthday getaway as I had never been before
c50207,s5,Big mistake
c50207,s6,What could‚Äôve been quite a good experience was tarnished by hotel staff who were uninterested in providing hotel service
c50207,s7,"I booked the Deluxe Suite (1,345sq ft) directly via the Sheraton website so note that my booking was not one of those ‚Äòcheapest deals‚Äô on the net or via any third party website"
c50207,s8,"¬∑ Decent hardware, our suite was very nice"
c50207,s9,The layout of the suite‚Ä¶
c50208,s1,Pretty much like Venetian and cheaper  Downstairs mall is the same  They are all interconnected through pedestrian basement or overbrige They jointly have super connected malls and their own casino So I would prefer Sheraton over Venetian cuz it's cheap and the same
c50209,s1,Hotel is located in a very good location for shopping as it is only 10 minute walks to Venetian
c50209,s2,Free shuttle bus available to Galaxy area
c50209,s3,Concierge team are nice and very helpful
c50209,s4,Room is quite small and look a bit old
c50209,s5,The rest was just ok for my stay
c50210,s1,"We stayed in the Deluxe suite, it was clean and big"
c50210,s2,"Personally if travelling to Macau again I would look for cheaper options because not sure it's value for the expense, the lobby was v crowded and the hotel lacked a personal touch"
c50210,s3,Also having booked the room for two people with breakfast I was a bit surprised that the breakfast was for only one and I had to supplement the extra cost
c50210,s4,Location was good though
c50211,s1,"I chose the SGM for its pool area, and was assigned a room in the Sky Tower"
c50211,s2,"Found the rooms to be smaller than comparatives, clean but my room had a musty smell"
c50211,s3,"Our water was shut off without notice one morning for about 30 minutes, with one of us amidst a shower"
c50211,s4,Not cool! Will likely stay in the Venetian next time around
c50212,s1,We stayed overnight and it wasn't really our scene
c50212,s2,Massive casino / conference type accommodation
c50212,s3,Asked to come back to check in 3 times (and SPG members) because it was fully booked
c50212,s4,Good average
c50212,s5,Room was grand
c50212,s6,That's about it
c50212,s7,I'd probably stick to day trip to Macau unless you enjoy casinos
c50212,s8,meters away from reception check in
c50213,s1,"We checked-in on April 16th at 4pm,  I was so shocked to see the queue was tremendous long"
c50213,s2,It finally took me ONE hour to check in
c50213,s3,It was no fun at all as I was bringing along with 2
c50213,s4,5 yr old boy and he has to running around and my husband need to keep an eye on him
c50213,s5,"I have no choice need to remain on the spiral long queue myself!  As a brand hotel, I felt so disappointed on the holiday arrangement as simple as just for check-in & manpower! I have been told most rooms are still waiting to be cleaned & tidy up!  Room is clean and spacious, the bed is big and comfort"
c50213,s6,My kid loves the pool
c50213,s7,"However, there're numbers of sharp edges inside the room which parents might need to keep an eye on little ones while they're playing and wondering around"
c50213,s8,I would say it's a hotel good‚Ä¶
c50214,s1,"I have stayed at 17th floor at Skytower on 16 April 2017, around 4 to 5 rooms are under renovation, one of these room is next to my room, it's so noisy and dirty in this floor, dust is full of my room door"
c50214,s2,My daughter can't sleep in the room
c50214,s3,There's a woman called me and said that she's the Manager and understood about the noise of 17/F
c50214,s4,", she said it's just a regular check, no maintenance work"
c50214,s5,"I told her it is a maintenance, the brick was broke on the floor and dust is full of the corridor"
c50214,s6,Her attitude shown that she is not care about the guest comment/complain
c50214,s7,"I told it's not about noise, it's about safety and cleanliness, it is because after I back from swimming pool, several workers are in the corridor and they have come to my room mistakenly"
c50214,s8,As there were‚Ä¶
c50215,s1,Good value when booking from India
c50215,s2,This is the most basic Sheraton I've ever stayed in
c50215,s3,But in Macau you spend less time in the room and more out in the casinos or shopping
c50215,s4,The rooms have everything you need
c50215,s5,Wi-fi isn't great but the handy phone is very useful
c50215,s6,Coverage inside rooms is poor
c50215,s7,I stayed on floor 30 in Earth 2 tower
c50215,s8,Some rooms have bathtubs and some only showers
c50215,s9,If a tub is required please do ask specifically
c50215,s10,Located opposite the Venetian and adjacent to the Conrad and St Regis
c50215,s11,There's is nice shopping mall on the ground floor
c50215,s12,Also shuttles to Macau pier are available from the East Lobby
c50215,s13,A small walk away is where shuttles to the old Portugese town start from
c50216,s1,Sad that I started to write this review in total darkness
c50216,s2,"We booked 3 nights & 4 days, the first two nights in a suite & the last night in a smaller deluxe room because my mother was staying with us on the 1st two nights before flying back to Canada"
c50216,s3,"On our first night, we found one of the main ceiling lights couldn't turn off in the room so my mum had to sleep with it on"
c50216,s4,On the second evening we called the technician who said it would only take a few minutes to get the lights fixed
c50216,s5,So we waited
c50216,s6,Here comes the nightmare
c50216,s7,suddenly all the electricity in the room went off
c50216,s8,"No aircon, no tv"
c50216,s9,No internet
c50216,s10,"And, of course, no lights whatsoever"
c50216,s11,My 2 kids started screaming in the room and my husband was sitting in the toilet not knowing what happened! The tech
c50216,s12,guy called‚Ä¶
c50217,s1,So bad I cant even put it in writing
c50217,s2,"Where is Sheraton in all of this???  Dirt, lack of minbar?everything just falling part?  This is just not acceptable"
c50217,s3,Sorry Sherato but our last time here
c50217,s4,"Dirty, poor welcome , lack Of english at reception"
c50218,s1,I arrived late-night on a Saturday in March from Taipa Ferry station and was helped very quickly as I lined up on the SPG Gold/Diamond line
c50218,s2,This feature helped me advance more quickly
c50218,s3,I gained Gold Status through Amex Platinum card
c50218,s4,Check-in was seamless
c50218,s5,"As SPG gold, I was supposed to be upgraded room but I was not as the rooms were fully booked, I was told"
c50218,s6,"I was to receive a gift as well, due to SPG, but I did not"
c50218,s7,I was promised and given an upgrade to a suite the day after on my four night stay
c50218,s8,"I also inquired about the spa, and was noted and sent a reminder about a $1200 HKD package fir 90-minutes that would have granted me club/lounge access for my stay"
c50218,s9,"Comparatively,  you can get a top-notch spa treatment for $300 elsewhere"
c50218,s10,"At booking, I made the mistake to book a‚Ä¶"
c50219,s1,A 40th floor suite is awesome at all times and ours here does not disappoint
c50219,s2,Being at the front of Earth Tower views of Studio City and The Parisian immediately in front and China beyond are priceless - a wide window seat offers endless moments to just take in the view
c50219,s3,"A roomy lounge, full bar and powder room caters for guests, the bedroom beyond features a very comfortable kind-sized bed with luxurious bedding"
c50219,s4,Marbled walls in the ensuite with its free-standing bath in the middle is very decadent and double vanities with separate shower and toilet lend to that luxurious feel
c50219,s5,Being at the end of the long corridor means that we are away of midnight foot traffic and closing doors
c50219,s6,"However, (and this is a BIG negative) the lack of front desk service made making our way up here‚Ä¶"
c50220,s1,Stayed two nights at this hotel with the wife and three kids
c50220,s2,Booked the family suite as it featured a bunk bed for the kids
c50220,s3,Hotel lobby area is a quite hectic and I think they should have more staff in this area to guide guests
c50220,s4,"Breakfast area was at a different tower and so it took a good 10-15 minutes to get there, which is not a great way to start the day"
c50220,s5,"All in all, not recommended!"
c50221,s1,A 2 day break from HK with the kids and in-laws
c50221,s2,"Too many check in zones on arrival, but grateful for email to the right desk on the 4th floor"
c50221,s3,"The staff at the lounge were very attentive - almost too attentive!  Arrived early and was grateful room was ready, however the room had a faulty AC, after an engineer arrived was moved due to cold, would have been okay except I had a pair of in-laws in the adjacent room and we were moved to the opposite side of the building - no comp for this added inconvenience as babysitters were now so far away"
c50221,s4,"Macau still not family friendly, so struggled with the kids"
c50221,s5,"The lounge was great, always plenty to eat and drink"
c50221,s6,"A day trip out of 'new' Macau to old is definitely worth discovering, even if you have to be a bit creative in getting a‚Ä¶"
c50222,s1,Poor attitude at the counter for gold/platinum members! I didn't ask for or think of an upgrade at all so my comment is not related to any free upgrade request
c50222,s2,"Amazing slow, yes, I don't know what they are doing!  Careless and heartless"
c50222,s3,I stayed for two nights but breakfast vouchers were missing for one of the days
c50222,s4,I gotta queue up again at the reception for the vouchers the next day (I decided to get rid of the SPG counter this time
c50222,s5,Surprisingly it was better
c50222,s6,Don't know what's wrong with SPG!)  I requested for an upgrade of my breakfast for one of the days with additional charge and was confirmed by email but the SPG reception couldn't locate my request and so I had to present the email correspondence
c50222,s7,zzzzzzzz  The staff who handled my special requests thru email was‚Ä¶
c50223,s1,"I am a regular Sheraton customer in many parts of the world, but this Sheraton needs serious upgrade"
c50223,s2,It started with a relatively bad reception where our group (all of them gold or higher members) was denied the usual room upgrade due to a booking through a website different from SPG
c50223,s3,The check in took amazingly long - no idea what they where doing there
c50223,s4,The elevators are miles away from the reception area due to the casino inside the hotel just in and around the reception
c50223,s5,Rooms are very tired and nothing special certainly not up to standard for the price! Bathroom & Toilet wasn't properly cleaned
c50223,s6,"Hotel is loud and crowded at most times of the day   On the positive side, we had quite a nice and tasty Chicken WonTon soup at the coffee bar between the reception and the‚Ä¶"
c50224,s1,"Really surprised by how dated and mediocre this hotel is, especially under the Sheraton brand name and on a relatively new property"
c50224,s2,"Long queues to check in, followed by a lengthy walk from elevator to room (admittedly I was warned about this), keycards that worked pretty sporadically, especially in the elevator"
c50224,s3,"The room was pleasant and spacious, but lacked even a kettle to make coffee"
c50224,s4,The minibar wasn't stocked (although I don't mind so much)
c50224,s5,The bright spot was a friendly staff member who took my keycard and told me I didn't need to wait in line to check out
c50224,s6,Much better available for a similar price point in the area (inc Holiday Inn in the same building)
c50225,s1,Hotel itself is a very nice property but it is so damn crowded with ppl
c50225,s2,So so so busy lobby and the casino is just beside the check in counter
c50225,s3,Is a headache to move around the hotel lobby with tonnes of ppl around
c50225,s4,"But once we reached the rooms level, every noise seem to quieten down"
c50225,s5,Rooms were huge and clean and good view of the other hotels as well
c50225,s6,Hotel is of walking distance to Venetian shopping mall through a link bridge
c50225,s7,I find that there aren't alot of cafes or restaurants in this hotel
c50225,s8,Have to walk over to the other mall (Venetian side)
c50225,s9,Hotel has shuttle bus service to and fro the ferry terminal and to the old macau where the ruins of St Paul's cathedral is
c50225,s10,Have to ask the concierge
c50226,s1,This is one of the busiest hotels I've ever visited
c50226,s2,The lobby is a zoo and there are almost always lineups if you need to speak to staff
c50226,s3,"When checking in or out, I'd allocate an extra half an hour just in case"
c50226,s4,The hotel is located in the heart of where other high end resorts are situated
c50226,s5,Rooms are spacious and pretty well appointed
c50226,s6,"Overall, a comfortable stay as long as you are ready to deal with the crowds downstairs"
c50227,s1,What an interesting place Macau is
c50227,s2,Everything is oversized including the lines for everything
c50227,s3,Spent a few nights at this hotel over Christmas and the checkin lines were like no other I have seen
c50227,s4,"As a 4000 room property it's to be expected but waiting in lines of hundreds of people to check-in, best to avoid the 3pm check-in time altogether"
c50227,s5,Arrive late or well in advance and sign up for the SPG membership for a shorter check-in line
c50227,s6,"Can't fault the hotel facilities, the pools and spa were amazing"
c50227,s7,Food service and selections in the main restaurant were top notch
c50228,s1,I'm sad to say the Sheraton just isn't as good as a lot of the other Cotai options that are cheaper
c50228,s2,"It's very large, and I believe it suffers for that"
c50228,s3,"The rooms aren't as nice, you always get a smoking one no matter what you say, and the service suffers from the scale"
c50229,s1,At first the check in staff was really incredible and helpful with all the information needed
c50229,s2,"But at the cocktail time, the staff was very rude"
c50229,s3,"In club lounge, we entitle for 2 person to have cocktail time in the lounge"
c50229,s4,"My parent went to club lounge to had some food for dinner, and me and my sister just came back from shopping mall so we came to club lounge as well to take our room key because we left one in the room"
c50229,s5,"So we come to the club lounge and no staff offer us to sit at all  (the table only have 3 chairs) and i need to drag a chair from other table to my parent table and even the staff see us, they dont even bother to help or anything"
c50229,s6,"Once we sit in our parent table, my sister take a bite of their bread and the staff come and shout to my father "" IF I SEE YOUR‚Ä¶"
c50230,s1,Went to Macau for a hen party
c50230,s2,There were 8 of us
c50230,s3,At check-in we requested an upgrade and were advised that we could get an upgrade for a total of 4KHKD
c50230,s4,The clear understanding was that the price included everything
c50230,s5,We insisted on that point
c50230,s6,Once in the room we were called by the hotel and told that the 4KHKD was on top of what was quoted for the rooms we had originally booked
c50230,s7,To top it all  it took several hours to get a cable to plug in an iphone and they could only cater for Iphone 4!   Complaints to the hotel have lead me nowhere
c50230,s8,Overall I feel we were misold a product and I do not recommend this hotel
c50231,s1,"No service, not due to the employees"
c50231,s2,Noisy rooms farrrrrrr too long waiting time @ check In
c50231,s3,Makes your start not optimal
c50231,s4,Hotel was nice
c50231,s5,Biggest pool was closed
c50231,s6,But OK it was winter
c50231,s7,"Breakfast was ok, but not great"
c50231,s8,Restaurant I did not try
c50231,s9,Looked good
c50232,s1,This is the place to visit if you want to get a real feel for what it must be like to be a farm animal
c50232,s2,As one of the world's largest Sheraton Hotels they now have management of their guest stock down to a fine management practice
c50232,s3,On arrival you are greeted by a very lengthy roped off pen and staff to tell you 'check in is closed and you must return at 1
c50232,s4,00' to be queued with 300 others to be processed
c50232,s5,In the meantime you may line up at another processing station for baggage storage
c50232,s6,In the afternoon when you return you are roped into a very long line for processing
c50232,s7,Once satisfactorily processed you must exit along a new rope line in accordance with their direction
c50232,s8,When you find your way to the rooms it is a reasonable size but quite basic
c50232,s9,In my case the staff gave‚Ä¶
c50233,s1,This hotel was not as good as the normal Sheraton standard
c50233,s2,It was overcrowded and the rooms were not great
c50233,s3,"However, it was clean and tidy and in a good location"
c50233,s4,I would suggest the Venetian instead
c50234,s1,I have stayed in other hotels in Macau and Sheraton is just ok
c50234,s2,Nothing fancy
c50234,s3,Many tour groups from China and other mass tourists which probably cheapens the whole check-in experience
c50234,s4,"Noisy, crowded and just kinda crass behavior of guests"
c50234,s5,Perhaps because it is a cheap hotel compared to other hotels in Macau so I shouldn't complain too much
c50234,s6,Next time I will stay at the Ritz or equivalent instead to avoid mass tourists who are just too loud and unpleasant
c50234,s7,"Room is old and lack character, very basic"
c50234,s8,"Many other better and newer hotels in Macau, Sheraton is just too old for package tours only"
c50234,s9,Stay at your own risk if you don't mind mass tourists ruining your experience
c50235,s1,"The Sheraton Grand Macau is part of the original three hotels (the Holiday Inn, Sheraton and Conrad)that initially made up the Sands Cotai Central complex"
c50235,s2,The St
c50235,s3,Regis was added to the collection recently
c50235,s4,This Sheraton the largest hotel in Macau and supposedly the largest in the Sheraton portfolio with about 4000 rooms
c50235,s5,Being such a large hotel it does has its advantages and disadvantages
c50235,s6,"One of the advantages is that the prices of its rooms do not fluctuate as much during off- and peak- seasons (such as Christmas, Chinese New Year, or Easter) ‚Äì when the prices in some other hotels could go up by 200% - 300% during peak seasons - because of the abundance of rooms available, which makes this Sheraton one of the best valued hotels in Cotai"
c50235,s7,"However, the down side is, do not‚Ä¶"
c50236,s1,"I stayed 4 nights in Macau, Sheraton for 1st two nights & 3rd & 4th nights at JW Marriott Macau for celebrating wedding anniversary"
c50236,s2,"I'm a regular Marriott Rewards member, since SPG & Marriott rewards joined, so would like to try the hotels under SPG"
c50236,s3,"But, this is the FIRST & also LAST time"
c50236,s4,"I should listen to my wife stayed 4 nights in Marriott, instead of this Sheraton"
c50236,s5,"If want services, don't stay here"
c50236,s6,Here only for easy access to gambling area
c50236,s7,"Pick & Stay at other hotels, instead of Sheraton Grand Macau"
c50236,s8,"Arrive around 10:30pm, booked a Club Room that have Executive Lounge access for check-in & out etc"
c50236,s9,Here's the reviews (0-100 points) for this so called 4-5* hotel during my arrival & departure
c50236,s10,"1) Hotel Entrance & Lobby - Dissatisfied (30 points) Seem like a 2-3* hotel,‚Ä¶"
c50237,s1,"The hotel is huge and I got the Club rate, which to be frank with you there wasn't much difference from the normal rates with other Sheratons I have stayed (when it comes to benefits)"
c50237,s2,The hotel sold so many Club rates and as a result the restaurant was like a normal hotel restaurant where they serve breakfast / snacks
c50237,s3,"Too many people and in one occasion we had to dine in a ballroom, converted into a dining area"
c50237,s4,Not very pleasant
c50237,s5,"The room had nothing special, Club rate wise"
c50237,s6,It was mentioned that there were welcome drinks and fruits upon arrival; it didn't happen
c50237,s7,The room wasn't cleaned and had to ask the housekeeping to make up the room
c50237,s8,"This was because in the morning the Do not disturb sign was on, but after 12 I switched it off (they should check)"
c50237,s9,Reception and the‚Ä¶
c50238,s1,The hotel is very large and caters to many guests
c50238,s2,"Hence the service is focused on efficiency and everything that can be automated is, including the pan cake making machine"
c50238,s3,"However, the whole Sands Cotai complex reeks of cigarettes smell, including our non smoking room"
c50238,s4,"They tried to deodorise whenever we told them of the smell, which only mask the smell for at best for 5 minutes"
c50238,s5,"I can understand that the hotel is powerless when faced with clients that ignores the non smoking rules, which there were many"
c50238,s6,So I am not really faulting the hotel staff as the staff are hard working and tries to provide a service given the limitations
c50239,s1,We have been to many hotels and this is not a good one! we paid the extra for the Club Service and its not worth it
c50239,s2,Breakfast service not good club room too big and not enough people to run it
c50239,s3,Food always cold and not replenished enough
c50239,s4,We did make a formal complaint to the Manager and she tried to make changes but it was not any better
c50239,s5,If you like cold food its ok
c50239,s6,The evening service is 2 hours of branded drinks and a few snacks there was bread and cheese and salad and noodle hot broth but that's it
c50239,s7,Coffee always luke warm l
c50239,s8,Never had a hot cup all the time we were there 4 days
c50239,s9,"Check in good even though hotel full, but had to wait 2 hours for room"
c50239,s10,If you were not in a club room - over busy period then god help you as downstairs in the normal check in was I‚Ä¶
c50240,s1,The hotel stay and the service was really great
c50240,s2,Worst part is the membership which I don't recommend as they don't credit any points if you book through an agent
c50240,s3,They should change their terms or else no one will be encouraged to stay
c50240,s4,Macau hotel is in great location but in many countries I travel there are equal or better options
c50241,s1,"Check-in area very crowd & mess, we line up more than 40mins for check in"
c50241,s2,"I don't understand why staffs need so long time for check-in process ( just 8 guest in front of me & open 4 counters for check-in process, I still need to wait more than 40 mins)"
c50241,s3,Bathroom's water tap (shower area & bath tab) have lots of water scale
c50241,s4,Bathroom looks dirty & old
c50241,s5,"We consider the hygiene issue & ""no brave"" to use the bathtub"
c50241,s6,Staffs are very friendly & helpful
c50241,s7,Location is good
c50242,s1,This was one of the worst hotels I have ever visited in my life!  1
c50242,s2,"When I came through the front entrance, I was mind-blowen by how nice it looked as first looks"
c50242,s3,"When I went inside, then I started to stare and could not believe my eyes! Almost half of the check-in area was completely ruined by a large casino! Right next to the check-in desks! They used a seperator to seperate both areas which completely ruined it"
c50242,s4,"This was not what I was thinking, since I was with my family"
c50242,s5,2
c50242,s6,I had to spend an hour waiting in the line until I finally reached one of the desks
c50242,s7,The lines were too long
c50242,s8,"It took me another 30 mins to get my room, which I previously had booked"
c50242,s9,3
c50242,s10,"When I reached the room, it was filled with a disgusting fish smell, it was unbearable"
c50242,s11,The walls and floors were‚Ä¶
c50243,s1,We decided to spend the New Years weekend in Macau
c50243,s2,It was the first time we stayed at this hotel
c50243,s3,"We were however taken aback by the size of this hotel, very mass market and impersonal"
c50243,s4,The staff was well trained and experienced to handle the huge crowd checking in
c50243,s5,Rooms were clean and quiet
c50244,s1,First impression is very important for every hotel guests
c50244,s2,It's our first time to stay at the Sheraton Macau Hotel and we were surprised to see how crowded and chaotic it was at the check in area
c50244,s3,I understand Christmas is a peak traveling time and Sheraton Macau is a big hotel
c50244,s4,But having to wait in line for 45 minutes to check into a hotel room is just unexpected
c50244,s5,We walked around other nearby hotels but seems their check in process were more efficient and organized
c50244,s6,The hotel room is up to standard
c50244,s7,Bathroom is spacious
c50244,s8,Breakfast was pretty good
c50244,s9,Staff can add a bit more smile to welcome their customers
c50244,s10,Customer service was ok
c50245,s1,"Check in was a bit of a mess, because there are two large lines, with no indication of which is which, the wait was rather long even though it was nearly 3pm"
c50245,s2,Check in interaction was non-existent but at least we got the keys without much hassle
c50245,s3,"Was assigned a high floor room at the Earth Tower, which is quite a trek from the check in counters"
c50245,s4,"Upon entering the room was the smell of air freshener, while we didn't bother changing the room, the smell took quite a while to ease off a bit, using full blast of air conditioning"
c50245,s5,"The room was sufficiently sized, with a partial view on the Cotai Strip plus the Eiffel Tower at the Parisian"
c50245,s6,The bathroom was reasonably well-appointed as well
c50245,s7,"The room wifi speed was ok, but it was quite annoying that every time your device is locked,‚Ä¶"
c50246,s1,Me and my family booked a suit for New Year stay couple months ago at Sheraton Macau
c50246,s2,We were expecting very warm and nice stay as we traveled so far away to celebrate new year 2017
c50246,s3,First of all when we approch the front desk at 3:40 Pm our room was not ready
c50246,s4,We were staying at the reception untill 6Pm in order to get the right suit which we booked
c50246,s5,Due to the reservation unprofessional mistake we could not get our suit which we reserved couple months ago
c50246,s6,"Eventually, front desk gave us the suit which we booked but in the evening they asked us to move the rooms as our type of room was reserved by other guests, however we reserved the same type of the room"
c50246,s7,As we expected front desk employee would not even care about the guests
c50246,s8,Didnt even apologized for their own hotel‚Ä¶
c50247,s1,"the sheraton grand macao is a monstrous hotel, thousands of rooms"
c50247,s2,this in itself i think is the bigest problem
c50247,s3,"check in process is difficult, even as a platinum member i had to que for 45 minutes"
c50247,s4,and check in before 1 oclock
c50247,s5,"impossible, they dont even allow you to que"
c50247,s6,"everything else is just massive,"
c50247,s7,u want to get to elevator
c50247,s8,"u gotta que, u want go to concierge, u gotta que"
c50247,s9,u wamt breakfast? thats an hours que at least
c50247,s10,"i know its high season, but at the sheraton its impossible to avoid due to their massive size"
c50247,s11,"getting a taxi ??? thats another 45 mi ute que  the room themselve are very average, not bad"
c50247,s12,but more a 4 star then a 5 star
c50247,s13,if you compare it to Crown or  grand hyatt which are in the same street
c50247,s14,it falls behind alot
c50247,s15,stayed 1 night‚Ä¶
c50248,s1,"Having been to Macau many times and having stayed at different hotels, I am quite informed as to what a well-known hotel in Macau should be like"
c50248,s2,"I have also stayed at Sheraton hotels in Shenzhen and Bangkok, so I do know that Sheraton usually delivers a high quality of service, thus I'd like to think that my poor experience deviated from the norm"
c50248,s3,"Travelling in a large party of 20+, things can get quite chaotic, but this time it was wholly the hotel's responsibility"
c50248,s4,"Upon check-in, we were informed that one room had been cancelled, which we did not request for"
c50248,s5,"We had paid the full amount (including the room that was ""cancelled"", and had no record of any refund or cancellation)"
c50248,s6,We were then told that a room would be available at 4pm
c50248,s7,Understanding that it was peak season‚Ä¶
c50249,s1,This was our first trip to Macau
c50249,s2,"This hotel location is good and link to shopping mall at Cotai, very convenient"
c50249,s3,Stay in a club room
c50249,s4,"Check in on 21/12/16 3 - 4 pm at the SPG counter, the lady who serve us very good but forget her name"
c50249,s5,She change our room when we told her about the smell in our assigned room
c50249,s6,"Use the club lounge, find that the lounge understaff and not very helpful"
c50249,s7,we went there around 9-10 pm
c50249,s8,No Staff to serve us drinks
c50249,s9,"DIY! Went 2 days for the evening cocktail, limited food varieties"
c50249,s10,"Went for the breakfast, Please assigned a staff to make the pancake & waffles, Is terrible to let the guest do it"
c50249,s11,we struggle during the process
c50249,s12,Strongly recommend to improve the standard of the club lounge staffs
c50250,s1,"First time in Macau and since this is a 5 star Hotel, we were expecting for a 5 star treatment"
c50250,s2,"But upon entrance, we were dismayed that the Lobby was packed and crowded and there's no lounge area for women nor elder tourists to sit while their companion is on the longest que to get checked in"
c50250,s3,Guests were sitting everywhere
c50250,s4,That's so far the most stressful Hotel Lobby I've been into
c50251,s1,Called the hotel 2 weeks before to add my Platinum Number to my reservation
c50251,s2,"Bluntly told by the hotel manager, I will not receive any SPG benefits at all since my room is booked through CTRIP!  I understand that sometimes I do not get any points at a lower rate but this is the first time I was told my loyalty of staying over 100 nights a year is not considered if I ever booked at a lower rate"
c50251,s3,I am also a Platinum member for Marriott and I have never had this problem booking through any channels
c50251,s4,I would have cancelled this reservation if it is not for the non-refundable rate my wife booked
c50251,s5,"To make the matter worst, my wife called to reserve a crib for my baby and was told it may not be available!?  So my baby will have to sleep on the FLOOR?  5 Star hotel Service!?  Never‚Ä¶"

c50253,s1,I am a SPG gold member and used to stay in some Sheraton hotels
c50253,s2,This hotel give me a very different feeling
c50253,s3,Maybe because it is built in a big building with casino
c50253,s4,The materials used in room are off lesser quality than other Sheraton hotels
c50253,s5,"For example, the water control in the shower only have one direction"
c50253,s6,The hotel is very big with lots of customers
c50253,s7,I only appreciate the pool area with warm water area
c50254,s1,"This is for their FEAST buffet review, we went and ate there because we search in the internet that it was the best buffet in Macau, the food preparation was poor, not enough seafood selections, and the customer service was poor, most of them don't speak English and for $50 US dollar buffet, you would think it comes with unlimited beverages, you can only have either hot tea , coffee or warm water"
c50254,s2,Even the dessert was poor selections
c50254,s3,It's not the same how they made it look excellent online photos
c50254,s4,We were disappointed
c50255,s1,I reviewed this hotel 3 years ago
c50255,s2,"said it was my ""Best Experience Ever"
c50255,s3,""" How far this place has fallen in such a few years"
c50255,s4,Carpet worn and stained and torn in the room
c50255,s5,Furniture scratched and dented
c50255,s6,"Room was clean, but felt dated and spartan"
c50255,s7,towels strictly rationed
c50255,s8,Check in staff was less than polite
c50255,s9,"Room keys didn't work, TWICE! Pricing now out of sync with Macau"
c50255,s10,better buys at other properties
c50255,s11,I am very sad that my favorite hotel now feels like a downmarket roadside Holiday Inn from the 70's
c50256,s1,Services at this hotel was terrible
c50256,s2,Here are a few examples:  1
c50256,s3,"When we arrived at the hotel via shuttle bus from the ferry terminal, there were no staffs welcoming us or help us with the luggage"
c50256,s4,It's quite a long walk from where we being dropped off to the reception of the hotel
c50256,s5,2
c50256,s6,"When we make our booking, we requested that the fridge to be emptied out since we were travelling with a 2 years old and hence she will definitely play with it"
c50256,s7,"Moreover, we needed it to store some food for her"
c50256,s8,Not only it wasn't empty and when we try to call house keeping to do it
c50256,s9,They said they can only lock it (which means we cannot use the fridge at all)  and emptying the fridge will require an extra charge
c50256,s10,This is totally unacceptable
c50256,s11,I mean we paid HKD 2000+ for the room and‚Ä¶
c50257,s1,"My first time stay at Sheraton Macao, room is clean and roomy"
c50257,s2,"However, the experience of checkout and breakfast is worst, where during the checkout only 2 staff on duty (along with 20 empty counter"
c50257,s3,") on a Saturday morning, which I takes 10 plus minute to simply checkout"
c50257,s4,"The even worst part is the queue for breakfast are extremely long , with over 30 people queuing outside"
c50257,s5,"There are staff around however they are unable to provide any resolution options , which I end up skip the breakfast and leave straight to pier"
c50258,s1,Stayed in this hotel three times now
c50258,s2,Every time it has been a pleasant place to stay in a good location but every time it has taken an eternity to check in
c50258,s3,They just cannot cope with the numbers
c50258,s4,We also had lots of friends and colleagues in the same hotel and everybody had the same experience
c50258,s5,Room service also took a while but otherwise the rooms and service are fine
c50258,s6,Good option for checking out the Cotai Strip
c50259,s1,Reasonable ok with the room and bathroom
c50259,s2,However upon check in the room was not ready and only after signing up as a member the room was available
c50259,s3,Next day the room was not cleaned and after we approached a cleaner in the late afternoon and requested the towels to be changed we were told it would be done
c50259,s4,Arriving back late at night it wasn't done
c50259,s5,The breakfast buffet was disappointing
c50259,s6,Clearly only aimed at please the mainland Chinese visitors
c50259,s7,Most western buffet dishes were near empty and the bread was stale
c50259,s8,Not coming back here
c50259,s9,On a more positive note the gym was really well equipped
c50260,s1,Sheraton Macau is a lovely hotel to be in! Location is good
c50260,s2,"Its the hub of all activities; be it casinos, shopping, or just walking around (even stepping out is a fun as well as pleasure)"
c50260,s3,Good thing is that they gave a choice between lunch and breakfast on the house! Reception is rather bad! May be when we were there or its the case all around; rush was intimidating! In our large family of three; only one was allowed to go to the reception; that also in a queue; and we had to wait standing! Unlike a five star! Courtesies; bare minimum expected; forget about welcome drink or even water; was seemingly missing! A small detail oriented staff can bring about the difference
c50260,s4,Hygiene or cleanliness is good! But one odd hair can still be spotted here and there; again lacking eye for‚Ä¶
c50261,s1,"It's our first time stay in here, The hotel is very huge big connect with others hotels in the area"
c50261,s2,I asking for changed towels before we are out for dinner but the room service only let the towels at the bathroom
c50261,s3,"Wifi is not too good, needs to reconnect to free wifi once awhile"
c50261,s4,"The room has no coffee machine, no mini bar or drinks"
c50262,s1,I have stayed in many hotels in different countries but never been given this kind of treatment:  1
c50262,s2,Booked an executive suite for 2 adults and 1 child that comes with breakfast but was told only by the front desk I need to top up another Hkd220 per day if my son wants to eat since he's 6 years old
c50262,s3,"She was quiet when I asked her if she expected us to leave my son in the room alone while my husband and I go to eat, but didn't suggest any other solution"
c50262,s4,Of course I was also not able to use any club lounge benefits since I couldn't possibly leave my son alone
c50262,s5,2
c50262,s6,Requested for late check out at booking
c50262,s7,"While I understand this is subjected to availability, the counter staff suggested to me to give up room cleaning service to get a late check out to 2pm"
c50262,s8,I was under the impression‚Ä¶
c50263,s1,Throughly impressed with the public areas of the hotel and located in a convenient location
c50263,s2,"I emailed Sheraton a week before to explain that it was a special day for me and my wife but felt it wasn't taken into consideration, asked for an earth tower room with a view and was told it was possible through email, but on the day of check in the staff seems unaware that I have even asked for an earth tower, eventually I got an earth tower room but the view was of a construction site"
c50263,s3,"My room has old soap stains on the taps which I easily washed off with water and some scrubbing myself, was really disappointed with how much effort was spend into cleaning my room"
c50263,s4,"Otherwise everything else was fantastic, the staffs I interacted with were knowledgable and friendly, casinos are clean"
c50263,s5,‚Ä¶
c50264,s1,We were disappointed at the service and quality of the hotel
c50264,s2,The rooms were quite basic and stank of cigarette smoke even on the non-smoking floors
c50264,s3,The service was not great
c50264,s4,"The ""club lounge"" was so overfilled at breakfast time that we were moved to a charmless unused overflow ballroom"
c50264,s5,At the Italian restaurant Bene the seaters told us they were full even though we could see half a dozen empty tables
c50264,s6,When we did finally get seated 50% of our order had to be re-done as they were out of much of the menu
c50264,s7,The Filipino waiters were fantastic on the other hand
c50264,s8,There is a big pool area but half of it was closed when we were there
c50264,s9,The other half had only one pool in the sun which was absolutely packed
c50264,s10,"Overall, a poor experience"
c50264,s11,We would not go back
c50265,s1,That Hotel was a bit too expensive for what it offered
c50265,s2,"The stuff was quite friendly and everything was clean, but the room was really small, the view was bad (construction side) and the pool closed really early"
c50265,s3,Not again in this Hotel
c50265,s4,There are many other Hotels in this price category which offers more
c50266,s1,This time I stayed in Sheraton the corridor was very long and I have to walk a long time to get to my room
c50266,s2,Everytime I had to walk for a few minutes ! There is only a outdoor pool so in winter the water was very cold
c50266,s3,The entrance is beside the casino
c50266,s4,"The staffs was very nice and polite , the room was clean , though"
c50266,s5,The place was also convenient to Venetian and Galaxy
c50267,s1,"Sheraton has been our go to hotel whenever we are in Macao, but we notice that service has slipped a bit on every visit"
c50267,s2,"The club room attendants were friendly, but we noticed that they do not offer as much variety as before, and it got to be a bit of a zoo and over run with people"
c50267,s3,"We had several rooms on different floors, so the elevator banks were a bit confusing as they have signs clearly marked in the lobby level as to which elevators will stop on certain floors, but when we are in our floor trying to get to other levels, we have to go into each elevator to see if it goes to the floor that we want"
c50267,s4,which in turn slows down the passengers on said elevators
c50267,s5,Better signage and elevator bank management would be beneficial
c50267,s6,We also noticed that in our 5 days there one‚Ä¶
c50268,s1,It was my first time to Macau after 20 years
c50268,s2,I travelled with my elderly parents to this hotel from Zhuhai/GongBei port
c50268,s3,I read from the website that the hotel provided free shuttle to/from the port
c50268,s4,"Instinctively, we expect a vehicle with Sheraton logo on them"
c50268,s5,"When we arrived, there were no staff to greet us and point us to where we have to go(unlike other hotels in Cotai Central)"
c50268,s6,"There were no signs and directions either, 3 of us had to walk around with 4 suitcases to actually find the bus stop"
c50268,s7,"Eventually, I saw a minibus with Sheraton logo on it(as well as other hotels like Conrad)"
c50268,s8,"I asked the driver where is the bus stop, he pointed us to a direction"
c50268,s9,"We still couldn't find them, we walked back & forth few times in the rain before going back to the driver"
c50268,s10,The driver‚Ä¶
c50269,s1,Wifi free and ok
c50269,s2,Room size big for one
c50269,s3,Bathroom size is big too
c50269,s4,"However, there are small insects came out from the tissue box in the toilet"
c50269,s5,Those always came from the old papers
c50269,s6,"After changed room with my friend, stain found in the mouth rinsing cups, maybe water mark"
c50269,s7,"Otherwise looks clean, towels without smell"
c50269,s8,Bath gel did not cause me allergy
c50269,s9,Amenities available
c50269,s10,Shower with water flow good but the shower pipe was broken with water spilt and the water did not drain away properly
c50269,s11,"Pillow too soft for me, and mattress support ok"
c50269,s12,"Blanket non-breathable, maybe due to the cover"
c50269,s13,Air conditioner functioning well
c50269,s14,Staffs' attitude are good especially the man serves my friends for check in
c50269,s15,Maybe next time I should better ask for a firm support pillow during check in to let‚Ä¶
c50270,s1,Stayed there for 3 nights when I had a conference in Macau
c50270,s2,It was a maassive hotel so understandably the service might not be attention to details
c50270,s3,It did not offer turn down service and your room was not tidy up until 4 or 5pm each day
c50270,s4,Staff could be cold and unflxebile
c50270,s5,They did offer me a upgraded room which is very big but I did not have a chance to enjoy it due to my busy meeting schedule
c50270,s6,But I did appreciated
c50271,s1,Room was decently sized with a great sized bathroom but had a very old look and was facing another hotel
c50271,s2,The biggest issue we had was the drain in the shower was blocked
c50271,s3,We tried to call twice to get this fixed but did not have any luck
c50271,s4,A bit overpriced for what you get
c50272,s1,"We spent the last weekend in Macau and stayed at the Sheraton Grand Cotai Central, because it is kind of new and within the complex of Cotai Central"
c50272,s2,"From the moment we left the ferry terminal and waited for the shuttle bus, I noted that one from Sheraton was less frequent than others"
c50272,s3,We waited for about 15 minutes for a shuttle bus to get to the hotel
c50272,s4,We arrived early and they could not accomodate early check-in because the hotel was pretty full
c50272,s5,That's understandable
c50272,s6,Our room was a delux twin
c50272,s7,"The room was clean, and the bathroom was spacious"
c50272,s8,"But for a 5 star hotel, you couldn't believe that there was no comb in the bathroom for use"
c50272,s9,And you found that the staff at the hotel was merely doing their job and not enjoying their job
c50272,s10,You found no one interested in you or any‚Ä¶
c50273,s1,We stayed at the mid-price range Sheraton during Mid-Autumn Festival
c50273,s2,As expected the place was packed with Mainland Chinese visitors
c50273,s3,"The lines at the check-in counters were horrendous but the staff were super efficient and we managed to get our room in under 30 minutes! Our room was a decent size and comfy, and more importantly it was clean and didn't reek of cigarettes like some hotels"
c50273,s4,Breakfast was a disappointment though with lines at every food station
c50273,s5,"Next time, better  skip the breakfast package unless you like predominantly Chinese cuisine"
c50274,s1,Unorganised arrangement when checking in today
c50274,s2,We've a group of 12 people staying in here today
c50274,s3,We've made a reservation a month ago requesting connected room for each one of us
c50274,s4,"However, nothing can be arranged (What if they could just arrange two connected rooms for us, it would be easier for us to stay close) and the hotel staff suggested us to stay separately in different tower of Sheraton Grand today"
c50274,s5,"As a well-known brand hotel, the communication skill and interpersonal skill should be in a professional manner"
c50274,s6,"Unfortunately, they cannot meet the basic service standard and it's totally disappointing everyone of us"
c50274,s7,We definitely won't stay this hotel anymore
c50274,s8,PS: I am currently staying at rm 2527
c50275,s1,"5 star hotel but terrible service! First of all, my mum and i reached the hotel at 1pm so we q-ed to check in like every other guests"
c50275,s2,There were at least 8 qs with each line were to assigned to 3 separate server
c50275,s3,"There were about 10 ppl infront of us BUT WE WAITED FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR! Turns out that the line on my right has 4 servers and the line on my left had 3 but my line had only 2! The guy infront of us found the ""mistake"" so when the first server on my right was empty, he went over, only to get shouted by that server to q up so he explained that our q only have 2 counter where theres supposed to be 3 just like how he observed from other qs(number of servers √∑ numbers of servers) but the server just rudely ask him to move and ask another guest to come"
c50275,s4,"Fine, count us‚Ä¶"
c50276,s1,"I love the Sheraton brand, very loyal customer"
c50276,s2,You need to understand that this is a casino hotel
c50276,s3,On our hall there was a room with many young girls staying in it and older guys coming and going
c50276,s4,Not sure what type of brothel was being operated but we complained to HouseKeeping
c50276,s5,"We were told, they were paying guests and nothing could be done"
c50276,s6,Great hotel if you are going there to gamble
c50276,s7,"However, if you are not a gambler and a loyal Sheraton customer, you WILL be disappointed"
c50276,s8,"Finally, really not a family environment"
c50277,s1,"I stayed on 6-7 Oct and we deliberately avoided the peak time to check in therefore we checked in at 20:30 but surprising, we still needed to wait for 15 mins before to be served even with the SPG member counter"
c50277,s2,I booked through SPG and was expected to include breakfast + returned ferry ticket
c50277,s3,"To my surprise, only the room + breakfast was included and for some reason the ferry ticket was NOT BOOKED"
c50277,s4,I have asked the staff to check with the booking department but no one approached me on 7 Oct and NO ONE updated me when I checked out
c50277,s5,Also the service from the breakfast in Xin restaurant was way below average
c50277,s6,"No coffee / tea was served, in fact only 2 staff helping at 08:00AM"
c50277,s7,The attitude of the staff was also UNFRIENDLY
c50277,s8,Even though I am a member of SPG and a fan of‚Ä¶
c50278,s1,My girlfriend and I just stayed at this hotel on a trip to Macau
c50278,s2,This hotel is one of the massive glitter palace casino resorts on the Cotai Strip
c50278,s3,The facility is amazing
c50278,s4,"Two casino floors, multiple pools, a huge shopping area and food court, everything you could want"
c50278,s5,"You can walk between this property, the Venetian, the Parisian, and probably others without ever seeing the sun if you wish"
c50278,s6,"Now first, let me say in all honesty, my stay was during Chinese Golden Week, which is probably the worst week of the year to travel in China"
c50278,s7,But the staff is just utterly incapable of handling the kind of volume a place like this generates
c50278,s8,Our visit started off poorly at arrival
c50278,s9,"We took the complimentary shuttle from the airport/ferry terminal, which went fine"
c50278,s10,Upon walking into‚Ä¶
c50279,s1,"A very nice,clean and modern hotel in a great location!Those are the pros-  Cons, 25-30 min wait to check in(and thats in the priority check-in area) Uncaring and unfriendly staff, we had to ask for our room to be cleaned everyday even tho we left a good tip next to the phone each morning"
c50279,s2,Not the usual Sheraton standard
c50280,s1,Stayed here for company offsite
c50280,s2,Massive place and utterly charmless but rooms are good and modern
c50280,s3,"Only bother coming to this part of Macao if you want to gamble, otherwise soulless with masses of the usual high end chain stores and other hotels"
c50281,s1,"The Sheraton is a large, Vegas-style hotel in the Cotai district, surrounded by many other familiar hotel names"
c50281,s2,"It's comfortable and busy, with many eating options"
c50281,s3,"The room was comfortable and well appointed (although no tea-making facilities), but I suspect you have to upgrade to club rooms for additional comforts that would make the experience stand out"
c50281,s4,"The view from the window was a rather depressing building site, but with all the construction in Macau, that is hardly surprising"
c50281,s5,"It's close to shopping malls and other hotels (esp Venetian), all accessible by foot"
c50281,s6,Staff were helpful and everything seemed to work
c50281,s7,Huge queues for taxis at certain times - although that is a regular problem in Macau
c50281,s8,"All in all, it's a good hotel, but difficult to work out what makes‚Ä¶"
c50282,s1,Stayed here a couple of times for business
c50282,s2,"The lobby is always crowded and packed with people, not relaxing if you are on a holiday"
c50282,s3,Room are decent size but quite run down and quite dim
c50282,s4,Good location close by shopping malls and restaurants but wouldnt be my first choice of hotels in Macau
c50283,s1,My wife and I spent 3 nights at the Sheraton celebrating our 15th wedding anniversary
c50283,s2,We were very underwhelmed
c50283,s3,It was our first time to Macau and booked this hotel based on the reviews of trip advisor and also the advice of a friend
c50283,s4,We upgraded to the club floor for the breakfast and club access for happy hour
c50283,s5,The room itself was fine
c50283,s6,The view was not good
c50283,s7,"We looked directly out at the other tower, the roof top in between the towers and the construction that's going on in the area"
c50283,s8,If we look directly right we could just see the Eiffel Tower at the Parisian but that was all
c50283,s9,On our first night we were tired after walking and gambling
c50283,s10,We decided to order room service for dinner (not our usual but not uncommon for us either)
c50283,s11,The menu was very short so we decided on the‚Ä¶
c50284,s1,Second time stay there with friend for short trip
c50284,s2,"However, a bit disappointed to stay there for two days"
c50284,s3,This time the room very smelly
c50284,s4,Requested to change pillow and do house keeping again but have old people smell
c50284,s5,A bit disappointed since last time is not like that
c50284,s6,Will try to find a nice hotel in Macau instead
c50285,s1,Yea; that's the highlight of the Sheraton :) that it's across the road from the new Casino-Hotel-Mall: The Parisian & 'The Venetian' and the City of Dreams
c50285,s2,Just realized that being a SPG gold member did not account for much with them either as I was hoping for a room with a view at least
c50285,s3,What we liked as an experience was the Xin restaurant in the complex and their 'Hot-Pot' dining experience where one had to pick the seafood and meat they desired and have them dropped in the choice of broth
c50285,s4,The breakfast or the dinner at their other restaurants were just average
c50285,s5,"Like I mentioned in the subject, the proximity to the 2 major casinos is a major point as one usually comes to this part of the world for the casinos and maybe shopping -- even though I got lucky at the Sheraton‚Ä¶"
c50286,s1,We stayed for a night with our little one
c50286,s2,"The room was very big, especially when we had just came over from Hong Kong"
c50286,s3,"It was a comfortable stay, everything was clean and well-maintained"
c50286,s4,Called for top up of towels and they responded very promptly
c50286,s5,"The property itself was huge, so the crowd at the various lobby areas can be quite daunting"
c50286,s6,"At check-in, the queue was long but they had entertainment in the form of balling scrupling for my boy"
c50286,s7,"at one part of the lobby, There was also a small booth giving out cups of marshmallow and popcorns for kids"
c50286,s8,My boy was given a cup of marshmallow which he didn't want so we asked for a popcorn on the spot but was rejected
c50286,s9,"With the large property, one would have to be aware of the walking distance"
c50286,s10,It should not be an issue for older‚Ä¶
c50287,s1,It was my first time in such a huge complex
c50287,s2,The hotel looks really clean and nice from the outside
c50287,s3,"It many different restaurant, a casino, an entire shopping mall attached to it, a spa"
c50287,s4,It is a city inside the city
c50287,s5,You can spend your entire stay indoors
c50287,s6,"The room was spacious, but rather old"
c50287,s7,"As my second hotel stay in Macau it wasn't my favourite place, and I wouldn't book there again"
c50288,s1,"Sprawling, somewhat impersonal and very average in service-- though generally clean and comfortable"
c50288,s2,The enormity of the place is a turn-off-- makes you feel quite lost
c50288,s3,Bfast is also not great-- but ok otherwise
c50289,s1,The hotel is situated on Cotai Strip with free shuttle bus provided
c50289,s2,Check-in was unbelievably slow at 3 pm during the peak season and it took me over an hour to queue up in the lobby
c50289,s3,The lobby was overcrowded with guests but front desk staff are helpful luckily
c50289,s4,The room was okay and definitely worth its price (ard 700 hkd through travel agency)
c50289,s5,Room is spacious but it is just within expectation
c50289,s6,Wifi was slow and disonncected regularly and I found it frustrating
c50289,s7,"Anyway, if you can spend 1000 hkd or more, don't consider sheraton macao"
c50290,s1,Surprising that Sheraton has such an average hotel and casino in Macao where luxury and style are common themes for any hotel I have stayed at Venetian and Marriott in the past and they are miles ahead in terms of everything   Very standard fare which you should not expect in 1500 hkd a night
c50290,s2,"Check in is a nightmare with queues miles long , wifi slow and disconnects when you move in and out like old technology and room just ok"
c50290,s3,If you can spend 1500 hkd or slightly more then Sheraton is not a place to be in Macao
c50291,s1,"Too expensive for what you get,  250 euro per night and no breakfast included"
c50291,s2,Very noisy room with a massive on going construction site outside
c50291,s3,Slow service and staff english very poor
c50291,s4,Too crowded cheap casino atmosphere
c50292,s1,"Stayed 2 nights and I don't know why they claim to be a 5 Star Hotel, as I had anything but a 5 Star stay"
c50292,s2,"Got to my room, looks ok, very weird smell, no snacks except for a vending machine down the hall, that's a 1st"
c50292,s3,But ok
c50292,s4,"Went out first night in Macau, got back to my room at 4am, slept about 5am, then at 8am was woken by a loud BANG BANG BANG BANG, sounded like construction upstairs, waited an hour, still going, fed up, called the front desk, they said they would look into it, 30 mins later, nothing"
c50292,s5,"i call again, they say ok they will send someone"
c50292,s6,"Guy arrives and says aircon is making the noise, I'm like ok so?? He says call front desk and walks away"
c50292,s7,"Sigh, call for the 3rd time, after much arguing they agree to move me to another room, I say at the least they‚Ä¶"
c50293,s1,The room itself is very luxurious & clean
c50293,s2,Location is great
c50293,s3,However the following could be improved: 1
c50293,s4,We're a group of 2 adults & 2 children
c50293,s5,We were only given 3 towels consistently even when the room had been registered for 4 people & there are 4 toothbrushes on the sink
c50293,s6,2
c50293,s7,We got the room with breakfast buffet package
c50293,s8,"Unless you're from China,    ensure that your breakfast is at Feast restaurant"
c50293,s9,"Food at Xin caters more to tourist from China, & it's pretty bad"
c50293,s10,The rep at the Gold member service desk insisted that food from both Xin & Feast are identical
c50293,s11,It is not
c50293,s12,Xin is Chinese food & Chinese version of Western food
c50293,s13,Feast has a small area of Chinese food & a large area of Western buffet
c50293,s14,3
c50293,s15,"The pool is nice & huge, but has hundreds of guests using it"
c50293,s16,Therefore the‚Ä¶
c50294,s1,I stayed there several times before
c50294,s2,I booked this hotel again because of the special rate (less than HK$1000 per night)
c50294,s3,The room was generally clean but they did not maintain it so well
c50294,s4,There were several gray marks on the wall
c50294,s5,The chair was not clean too
c50294,s6,The swimming pools there all small ones
c50294,s7,It may not be suitable for someone who wants to swim a longer distance
c50294,s8,"But the location of the hotel was quite good, as it linked to shopping malls"
c50294,s9,Service was ok
c50295,s1,I stayed at Earth Tower 13F
c50295,s2,"Room was clean but 1 key card needed replacment took me standing in front of room door for  n3arly 15m!!!  Yes, the hotel was too complicated to get lost"
c50295,s3,(no clear signage from 4F meeting room to guest room
c50295,s4,"why??  I didn't know my room was in ,""EARTH TOWE"""
c50295,s5,"The key card cover only handwritten ""2-1334"""
c50295,s6,"2 = Earth Tower, how would a guest know it!! And I found there was a tiny imprint on the original keycard  but a much more bigger font on the replacement keycard"
c50295,s7,"The meeting room was huge, good for hundreds people group"
c50295,s8,All the meeting room staff were of great service but a bit timely
c50295,s9,the hotel was too big and complicated to getting one point to another
c50296,s1,We booked the deluxe suite for one night at a reasonable price and the room did not disappoint
c50296,s2,The following explains why the rating is not higher
c50296,s3,"Wonderful place, that is, when you finally get past the nightmarish queues at checking in at 3pm and the check-in counter girl advising you to come back for your room key at 6pm"
c50296,s4,"Upon one's reasonably justified  protests, and insistence to speak with the management, the delay was to some extent alleviated by a later checkout time authorized by the customer service manager in order to commensurate with the delayed check-in"
c50296,s5,"Had one not been so persistent, the check-in counter girl would have fobbed you off that all the managers were too busy to see you"
c50296,s6,The hotel pools look better than they really are
c50296,s7,Access to them from the‚Ä¶
c50297,s1,Check-in took over an hour due to hundreds of people all trying to check in mid-afternoon after check-in opened
c50297,s2,Hotel and room were nicely appointed and comfortable
c50297,s3,The hotel location is good in central Cotai part of Macau
c50297,s4,Food choices are limited if you're a westerner and don't want to eat Chinese food every meal
c50297,s5,"We ended up walking 10 minutes to the Hard Rock cafe for lunch on two days, which was very good"
c50297,s6,Dinners on both nights were at local Portuguese style restaurants
c50297,s7,"Overall, not a pleasant holiday experience due to way too many people---we won't be back to this hotel or Macau ever again"
c50298,s1,Stayed at Sheraton again this year for the annual pool party pilgrimage in Macau
c50298,s2,Check in took half an hour - way too long! Apparently they can't find a suitable room even though we have included them in our reservation
c50298,s3,"When we landed a room at the end of the (long) corridor, its toilet has a sewage smell, probably due to old piping"
c50298,s4,The taxi queue is so long mainly due to poor design
c50298,s5,They should have multiple loading bays so we don't get stuck behind big families with many luggage
c50298,s6,Checkout experience wasn't perfect either
c50298,s7,The bell service didn't even bother to address me when we took our bags from  baggage service
c50298,s8,He simply handed me the bag tag and a pen without actually telling me what to do - apparently I had to sign it
c50298,s9,Terrible customer service
c50299,s1,"We booked for one night a family room, which is a classic parent bedroom plus a kid room with bunk bed and kids deco"
c50299,s2,"First, the checkin experience was long, so long"
c50299,s3,"We had to become SPG member while we booked, so we went to the SPG member checkin counter and we had to wait 45 min before to finally checkin, there was less than 10 people in front of us"
c50299,s4,"Second, the kid bedroom was disappointing, no toys, a xbox with no game and no gamepad, the only tv channel was cartoon network and there was no sound only for this channel"
c50299,s5,So we had to call the guest service to get all sorted
c50299,s6,30 more minutes wasted
c50299,s7,"The best part when we came back at night to sleep, my 6 years old daughter was really excited to sleep on the upper bed but surprise the mattress was totally rock hard"
c50299,s8,We‚Ä¶
c50300,s1,#NAME?
c50300,s2,#NAME?
c50300,s3,You need to ask to know where you re going
c50301,s1,"Breakfast buffet: unexpectedly disappointed, not many choices"
c50301,s2,"Crowded with long queues all the time, I have to queue all the time like check in, waiting for taxi"
c50301,s3,"And services were also out of my expectations, I supposed I can get service like other same level hotels"
c50302,s1,Spent three days in this hotel with my family
c50302,s2,We had three rooms
c50302,s3,We arrived at 12ish noon but they wouldn't let us check in until 1pm
c50302,s4,The check in system is lengthy and messy
c50302,s5,we spent 25 mins to get the rooms sorted
c50302,s6,The queues are crazily long and the lobby was filled with customers
c50302,s7,The hotel is barely of 3 star standard
c50302,s8,"Why? When we get into the room,it's worm out and dirty"
c50302,s9,There are lots of dirts on the carpet and the bathroom was wet like someone just had a shower
c50302,s10,The bathroom floor was not clear and most surfaces in the room was dusty
c50302,s11,The amenity in the bathroom was cheap
c50302,s12,i ain't here to look for expensive stuff but I certainly expect more than that for a Sheraton hotel
c50302,s13,The breakfast system was also not efficient
c50302,s14,We were given two vouchers for each room to‚Ä¶
c50303,s1,This hotel has terrible service
c50303,s2,Check in processing takes a long time
c50303,s3,Room service take forever and the rooms had rapidly deteriorated since opening a few years ago
c50303,s4,TV programing is catered for a specific ethnic group
c50303,s5,Rooms often not cleaned properly  and serviced poorly
c50304,s1,"Just one night stay, room was generally clean, bed was comfortable, but air-condition was not working well, even turned to 28 degrees, still freezing cold, needed to switch off"
c50304,s2,"Free wifi very unstable, each time needed to reactivate the wifi while reading each whatsapp message"
c50304,s3,"Supposed free wifi at public areas, also very unstable, terrible hair dryer, big and heavy"
c50305,s1,Stayed over the weekend
c50305,s2,Family was really impressed with the DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda fun
c50305,s3,"Used SPG points to stay and had a basic room, similar to most Sheratons, pretty basic amenities"
c50305,s4,Hotel service was surprisingly good given the volume of guests
c50305,s5,"The dream works Kung fu panda academy, parade and friends was wonderful for the kids and made our stay"
c50305,s6,Will definitely come back for another weekend visit
c50306,s1,This hotel with several hotels as a group has continuing free shuttle bus  to connect with Macao Ferry Terminal regularly
c50306,s2,"During my staying for 2 nights, the free wifi in my room didn't work"
c50306,s3,On the 2nd day my room was made up just around 6
c50306,s4,30 pm after I complaint
c50306,s5,It is unbelievable
c50306,s6,It seems to me the hotel has a shortage of cleaner staff because their face looklike very tired at that time
c50306,s7,Location this hotel is good and close to restaurants and foodcourt as well
c50307,s1,The hotel itself is okay but too big
c50307,s2,The rooms are nice and comfortable with great beds and air conditioning
c50307,s3,We had no coffee/tea etc in our room and it took ages for housekeeping to finally get some sent up
c50307,s4,It took us 45 minutes to check in which is pathetic
c50307,s5,Only one of the 3 pool areas was open and was overcrowded and over run with screaming kids
c50307,s6,Breakfast was in a restaurant in a shopping mall far from our room and mediocre at best
c50307,s7,The overcrowding was bad especially in the lobby and lifts
c50307,s8,I think it's too large to run properly
c50307,s9,"Hardly the relaxed atmosphere one would expect from a 5 star resort, not recommended if you want to ""get away from it all"
c50307,s10,""""
c50308,s1,Booked Club King or Twin Room - with Club Lounge Access for 18 jul 2016 via booking
c50308,s2,com
c50308,s3,WORST sheraton experience EVER
c50308,s4,I have sent email and requested connecting rooms
c50308,s5,Came n checked in at SPG Reception area at 2pm
c50308,s6,"Just got 1 room of two bcs the other one was not ready yet, still being cleaned"
c50308,s7,Had my lunch and came back to get the key at 4
c50308,s8,"20 and the room still not ready yet! Gotta wait for another, ""MAYBE around 30 minutes"", they said"
c50308,s9,After confirming n pushing the house keeping for so many times still couldnt make sure
c50308,s10,30 mins of nonsense the receptionist finally called the manager which in fact couldnt do anything either
c50308,s11,"They held us till around 5:20 searching for other rooms available but there wasnt any, finally the room was ready"
c50308,s12,"When we got there, another‚Ä¶"
c50309,s1,Have to wait for over 30 mins to get on the shuttle in the sun while seeing countless Venetian and other hotels shuttles passing by
c50309,s2,"really got on my nerves!!!  However, this is not the worst"
c50309,s3,It costed you another 30 mins to wait in lines for checking in
c50309,s4,"Though they offered free internet for visitors, it's almost the worst internet I've ever used among all sheratons ( I've been at least 5 sheratons in the world"
c50309,s5,Well
c50309,s6,I guess maybe this is the world's largest sheraton
c50309,s7,"but this hotel provides the slowest speed for Internet?!) Anyways, Macau is a city just like Las Vegas"
c50309,s8,So you can easily find out other five star hotels are really BETTER than this one
c50309,s9,"I'd say this sheraton is pretty much like the Holiday Inn next door, just different brand names and‚Ä¶"
c50310,s1,Sheraton is one of the biggest hotel in Macau with a casino that can seat more than 1000 people
c50310,s2,"rooms are spacious , food is just above average and service is excellent"
c50310,s3,but the interior of the hotel is not at all exciting and you don't feel like you have come for a vacation in Macau
c50311,s1,A short two nights break
c50311,s2,We had a family room which was great for us
c50311,s3,"Kids loved it, we had the Dream works Madagascar theme with all kids amenities"
c50311,s4,"The hotel is a very big, Vegas style property"
c50311,s5,It is good for families with younger kids
c50311,s6,"Don't miss the all the Dream works theme activities, especially the kungfu panda breakfast"
c50311,s7,Do not expect it to be a five stars hotel with top services and amenities
c50311,s8,"Check in was quick with SPG, but only for SPG"
c50311,s9,I saw people waited for almost an hour at the other check in lines
c50311,s10,Swimming pools were crowded and I dont really recommend this hotel if you are looking for water fun
c50311,s11,"Food choices are limited, but there are many hotels within walking distance, so no need to stick to the Sheraton only"
c50311,s12,Will stay again only because of the family‚Ä¶
c50312,s1,I stayed here for a work conference
c50312,s2,I was quite looking forward to the stay at the hotel
c50312,s3,However unfortunately it was another soulless Macau hotel
c50312,s4,Pros - large gym with a lot of equipment - room wasn't bad  Minus - limited food options
c50312,s5,"For example there wasn't really a bar for drinks and snacks in the hotel - conference food wasn't very good - the decor inside felt the same as the nearby Venetian!  Recommendation - if you are staying in Macau for a holiday, try to find a smaller hotel for a better experience, not one which focuses on just on conferences and gambling"
c50313,s1,"I had stay here for 5 nights business trip , the room dirty I feel itchy while sleep the bedsheet with stain and housekeeping daily cleaning miss replacement and change , slipper without change for since the first day I check in , after clean the bathroom amenities without replacement while I want to comb my hair need call housekeeping ask where they throw the comb and no replace really feel up sad return to stay here"
c50313,s2,Make me feel wanted to check out like can't stand for another few nights
c50314,s1,I am a Starwood member and have stayed in many affiliated hotels
c50314,s2,"When it came to small details, this hotel was not at the same level as other Sheratons in which I have stayed"
c50314,s3,"Don't get me wrong, it is very clean, very professionally run and the rooms, although a bit underwhelming, are spacious and very comfortable"
c50314,s4,"However, ALL the hotels in this area of Macau are at this level, so what differentiate them is the small details"
c50314,s5,"For example, in this hotel in a room for two people, they only had 2 bath towels, 2 hand towels and two face towels"
c50314,s6,That is it
c50314,s7,"In any other Sheraton, there would be four of each"
c50314,s8,"Now if you know Macau and how hit and humid it is, then you know that one takes more than one shower a day and using the same damp towel is not very pleasant"
c50314,s9,Everyday‚Ä¶
c50315,s1,Like the room setting with lots of space
c50315,s2,Could hear people loud talking from the corridor  inside the room
c50315,s3,Most of the staff were helpful but there were few not energetic and not well trained
c50315,s4,Understandable given the busy flow of guests in the hotel during summer peak season
c50315,s5,Wouldn't take the buffet breakfast if I needed to pay separately
c50315,s6,The lobby bar Palms was not attractive at all for pre dinner drink
c50315,s7,We ended up enjoying ourselves at the bar inside St Regis hotel
c50315,s8,Swimming pools look pretty nice and big but we didn't try this time
c50316,s1,We stayed in this hotel for two nights on the Club Floor in July which was our fourth or fifth visit
c50316,s2,We had usually enjoyed the food and service of the Club Lounge as there were usually good selections of hot and cold food with drinks
c50316,s3,"But this time, the variety of food served over the evening cocktail was a lot less than before"
c50316,s4,"There was no hot western food served and only dim sum and sandwiches were available, We found no pastries nor cakes served apart from cookies"
c50316,s5,And only one kind of fruit was served compared to three or four in the past
c50316,s6,"For breakfast, we were much disappointed to fine no egg stations but just precooked fried eggs and boiled eggs placed over heated trays for self serving"
c50316,s7,I have not seen any 5-star international hotels which serve no omelets for‚Ä¶
c50317,s1,We knew it would be a busy day in Macau
c50317,s2,But it appears no one told the Sheraton
c50317,s3,The line to check in took 1
c50317,s4,"5 hours! The room wasnt available until 5pm, No cot for our daughter"
c50317,s5,The inroom dining childrens meals were a pile of stodge with a bit of dressing
c50317,s6,Even the egg on the fired fried rice was undercooked and went straight into the bin
c50317,s7,"The rooms were cramped, corridors dark"
c50317,s8,"It was clean enough, but nothing to distinguish it from a mass market 3 star hotel"
c50317,s9,"The check out took 30 seconds, but had to wait twenty minutes in a queue to do so"
c50317,s10,There was not even the usual perfunctory 'did you enjoy your stay?'
c50317,s11,"The pool was nice, but very busy as one of the two was being used for a private function"
c50317,s12,The queue to order and pay for food at the poolside was 10minutes after which‚Ä¶
c50318,s1,Ok 1st of July Weekend which is a holiday in China and Hong Kong so I knew it would be busy
c50318,s2,"It was busy but actually not that packed, the problem is the hotel just does have enough staff and management are not very switched on"
c50318,s3,"On what must be one of their busiest weekends, 4000 rooms fully booked, they decided to only open one pool"
c50318,s4,They have three pools but apparently one is only for events( more on that later)
c50318,s5,"So on Saturday the one pool was packed, they had one waiter for poolside drinks and two pool attendants which was nowhere near enough"
c50318,s6,"Only after I complained to Lombok, the pool manager, did they open the other pool which was still dirty"
c50318,s7,On Sunday you would have thought that they would have learnt their lesson but no
c50318,s8,When we got to the pools one was again closed‚Ä¶
c50319,s1,This is not a cheap hotel but it really should not be considered 5 star
c50319,s2,First off I could not find one picture on their website that looked like the room I was given
c50319,s3,"Small, cramped, beige, scratched and dented furniture"
c50319,s4,Not worth the $$$
c50319,s5,"The pools (that were open) were fantastic! Ordered pizza from room service, very expensive cardboard"
c50319,s6,just awful!!! Concierge/manager was very kind and understanding
c50320,s1,Wanted a mini weekend getaway for wife's birthday
c50320,s2,I booked the hotel via Ctrip and called their hotline to ensure they put down a remark it is a birthday stay
c50320,s3,I also emailed starwood customer mailbox just in case Ctrip missed
c50320,s4,I got a reply from starwood saying they cannot locate my record as of that moment and it is likely Ctrip has not send them the details so I asked for a follow up on this when details are delivered over to Sheraton's system
c50320,s5,I thought this was sufficient but it is not
c50320,s6,Check-in day: We took a shuttle from the pier to City of Dreams which is hotel complex next to Sheraton's hotel complex to have a walk around before we check in
c50320,s7,We walked into Sheraton's hotel complex and tried to look for Sheraton but there were no clear signs on how we can reach it
c50320,s8,‚Ä¶
c50321,s1,I stayed in house from 16th to 20th June and its was a bad experience
c50321,s2,"During the 4 nights stay, my room key cards spoilt twice"
c50321,s3,I accepted that the first was a pure system issue and let it slide
c50321,s4,The second time was a bad experience
c50321,s5,We called for assistance from the floor lobby phone and a bell man sent the new key cards up
c50321,s6,"When as why is this happening, he said, ""don't ask me, I am from bell services"
c50321,s7,"You ask FO"" (literally said FO)"
c50321,s8,"Entered the room and called guest services, spoke to the agent and he got a manager on duty to call back"
c50321,s9,Spoke to the manager and she offered late check out till 3pm out of goodwill as my flight was not due till 5pm the next evening
c50321,s10,Then the next day came and a Front office agent knock on the door at 1245pm asking us to checking saying‚Ä¶
c50322,s1,Expect the Sheraton standard at this hotel
c50322,s2,When choosing a hotel in Macau take note that a lot of them on the strip actually join together
c50322,s3,This is one of four all part of the same complex
c50322,s4,I was overall happy with our stay except for the cleanliness of the shower
c50322,s5,There was black mould half way up the shower
c50322,s6,Disgusting
c50323,s1,Visited Macau for a friends birthday and decided to stay at the Sheraton
c50323,s2,Room size and amenities were good
c50323,s3,I think a little more attention to quality needs to be taken
c50323,s4,The towels in the bathroom were so old that it was starting to fray  and  then ripped when I wrapped it around me
c50323,s5,Hairdryer was also broken
c50323,s6,Checkin lines were massive
c50323,s7,Felt very un personal
c50323,s8,Check out was very easy
c50323,s9,Just drop the room key in a box
c50323,s10,I would recommend this hotel only if your going to gamble or for a quick trip
c50323,s11,Prepare to be surrounded by tour groups from mainland China
c50323,s12,"Overall it did the job as I just needed somewhere for 1 night, but I probably wouldn't stay here again"
c50324,s1,Stayed at the hotel twice before and had a great experience
c50324,s2,The third time was a bit mixed
c50324,s3,"Firstly, the front-desk staff informed us that purchasing food vouchers for the hotel restaurants at the front-desk would be cheaper than paying at the restaurants (even with the SPG member discounts)"
c50324,s4,This turned out to be false at one of the restaurants (Bene)
c50324,s5,"The front-desk staff also said the discount was 70% off, which was never the case"
c50324,s6,Luckily the staff at the restaurants helped us sort it out
c50324,s7,"Additionally, the front-desk staff said that tables would automatically be reserved for us, but again this was not the case"
c50324,s8,"Secondly, the bathroom within the lobby/casino smelled entirely of piss and looked like it wasn't cleaned in days"
c50324,s9,"Not expecting much here, since I know it's‚Ä¶"
c50325,s1,I normally don't write hotel reviews since there usually isn't anything out of the ordinary to write about
c50325,s2,but this one really took the cake
c50325,s3,I checked-in this afternoon to my Deluxe Suite (room number: 2-4010) and upon opening the door I noticed that there was an awful smell pervading the room
c50325,s4,"Upon closer inspection I found cigarettes littered across the living room, along one of the walls, on the floor, and on one of the tables"
c50325,s5,There were ashes (!!!) strewn on said table as well
c50325,s6,Went back to the lobby extremely shocked and disappointed
c50325,s7,"How can a (supposedly) FIVE STAR resort mess up as simple a request as ""non-smoking floor, please""? Even if you were to give this room to a smoking guest, the room cleaning/preparation looked so shoddy and haphazardly unbefitting of an‚Ä¶"
c50326,s1,There is nothing in the standard of the room or the service that we would score as above average for a Club room stay
c50326,s2,"Sure the rooms are spacious, but they are average international class hotel rooms, the decor is nothing wow"
c50326,s3,"Where it does score well is price, by our reckoning, this is one of the cheapest Macau Club room packages around, especially if you take the full payment in advance option"
c50326,s4,We also enjoyed three thoroughly sound nights sleep and never once heard any noise from surrounding guests
c50326,s5,The staff is well trained in customer service and in general are helpful but we found were slow to respond
c50326,s6,Check-in was slow but we appreciated the calmness of the Club room check-in compared to the general check-in on the ground floor
c50326,s7,The twin towers of the Sheraton Grand‚Ä¶
c50327,s1,We stayed for 3 night after a 28 days in China it was nice to get a comfortable soft bed we had breakfast included in our package it was ok but long Cues and had to wait for them to fill up they needed 2 chefs to do the eggs as there was always about 15 in the cue  Over all it was nice an central with free buses to the other casinos and lots of places to eat out  We went on the gondolas at the Venetian go early in the morning and you should get one by yourself
c50328,s1,Poor Service - Wrong room number provided by Front Desk staff
c50328,s2,Assigned #3665 but inform us as #3605
c50328,s3,Clarify after half hour
c50328,s4,- No signature and notification for 1/f lift lobby which suspended after 2300
c50328,s5,Escalators back to G/F lift lobby
c50328,s6,Safety quest for wheel chair and baby wheels
c50328,s7,Poor hardware - Poor noise insulation in Room 3601
c50328,s8,Lift machanic sound all night long
c50329,s1,We went as a family of 4 to try out their family room with kids bunk bed
c50329,s2,The novelty effect wore off 10mins after we arrived
c50329,s3,The mattress was essentially a thin piece of foam and the bed totally rock hard! Would probably be more softer sleeping on the carpets! Complained to room service and was told that the mattress on the top was  thin so that the railings would still be effective
c50329,s4,Totally illogical reasoning as this should have been considered in the inital design stage for the comfort and safety of the guest
c50329,s5,"To give them their due, they did give us a rollaway bed after i complained"
c50329,s6,Another factor which they should look into is their Spa
c50329,s7,We usually spend alot of time in the hotel resturant and spa on family hoildays and have no problems charging it to our rooms to pay‚Ä¶
c50330,s1,The overall was a very lousy stay
c50330,s2,"We had a smoke free room,but was kind of small"
c50330,s3,We dun expect it to so small
c50330,s4,"BF was bad since day one, not choices at all, no refill,taste was off"
c50330,s5,We have a baby but bf was not suitable
c50330,s6,Very nice room
c50330,s7,Looking forward to stay there again
c50331,s1,The standard and service at the hotel has definitely slipped
c50331,s2,Wouldn't stay again or recommend this hotel anymore - and I've recommended it to a number of friends over the years
c50331,s3,A serious incident at breakfast summed up our recent stay
c50331,s4,My six year old son badly burnt his forearm on one of their hot plates at the Club facility
c50331,s5,"It was dangerously hot, with zero warning signs and caused considerable stress and pain"
c50331,s6,He has scarring two weeks later
c50331,s7,Had to chase the hotel up via email for an apology and to check they had put warning signs up at breakfast
c50331,s8,Got the impression from the hotel that it was 'just one of those things that happen'!   Avoid - plenty of great hotel choices in Macau - and the Sheraton needs to show a greater care of duty to it's guests
c50332,s1,We checked in on the Club floor which was fast and easy
c50332,s2,"However when one of our friends left their key by mistake in the room and asked for another key card, the staff were not quite with it"
c50332,s3,"They kept insisting to see identification, as we explained it's in the room and since we have not key we can't get that"
c50332,s4,It took 10 minutes before they understand and said they would follow my friend to the room to check the identification
c50332,s5,They really should have better trained staff who speak good and understand English!  Room service was slow took over an hour for food to be delivered
c50332,s6,We had a deluxe room which was fine - it was clean and comfortable
c50332,s7,"For a weekend, it is not a bad hotel but I wouldn't say it is one of the best hotels in Macau"
c50333,s1,Hotel Nice and Neat
c50333,s2,Extremely busy hotel
c50333,s3,queued for at least 30mins to check in even as a SPG member
c50333,s4,"Hotel staff was directing other non SPG guests queuing to check in at the ""less busy"" SPG area - hence actual SPG members had to wait longer than usual"
c50333,s5,"Many staff are hired from the mainland China, not as professional as staff in other Sheraton hotels elsewhere, didnt respect people queuing at the back of the line, just let other guests jumping the queue to check out"
c50333,s6,Room was neat & clean - although i found a hair on the showerhead
c50333,s7,Breakfast was alright
c50333,s8,Recommend to go early (esp on weekends) to avoid the queue
c50333,s9,Overall I am satisfied with the price i paid for as I didnt have much expectations when i booked
c50334,s1,"My first visit to this hotel was on mid April, our family booked two rooms through Sherwood website"
c50334,s2,If trip advisor
c50334,s3,"com need any proof that I actually stayed in this hotel prior to me writing a review, I  am gladly to provide them"
c50334,s4,Just ask
c50334,s5,"Anyways, my mom and dad arrived Macau first and it took them sometime to check in as they were asking for my credit card because I made the booking, my dad explains that i will arrive later that night and the front desk reluctantly checks them in"
c50334,s6,Not such a big deal at the moment
c50334,s7,"Upon arrival at the hotel, i notice that the corridor is quite smoggy, perhaps due to the fact that there are no air vents, at least not the distance we cover which is about halfway in from the elevator"
c50334,s8,"I enter the room, no big surprise given it was my‚Ä¶"
c50335,s1,"We have stayed at many other Asian hotels, but this one did not meet our expectations"
c50335,s2,The staff at check in was very rude and not very helpful
c50335,s3,It took over an hour for us to finally get into our room
c50335,s4,The rooms were just basic
c50335,s5,The food was just ok
c50335,s6,The location was nice for Macau
c50335,s7,"There was a mall attached to the hotel but not one that you could actually shop at unless you were a ""high roller"""
c50335,s8,very expensive!  We will not return to this hotel as you have many other choices in this area
c50336,s1,"Yet it is not extravagant, it is a weekend-get-away family-type of a hotel you may consider staying at"
c50336,s2,Nice complex with different types of shopping
c50336,s3,from M&S supermarket to luxurious brands
c50336,s4,Room are tidy & spacious
c50336,s5,Room service is efficient & very polite & considerate
c50337,s1,"We reached to the hotel at midnight due to delay of airplane, and stayed there 2N3D at the Club Room"
c50337,s2,We checked in through the Club Lounge
c50337,s3,"The hotel was huge and there were so many rooms, and it was not so easy to find my room"
c50337,s4,"But, the hotel staff never lead me to my room, and it was quite disappointing"
c50337,s5,"Room was spacious and clean, but the toilet was not properly maintained"
c50337,s6,We called house keeping service to clean the toilet
c50337,s7,"Food was fair, but I cannot say it was great"
c50337,s8,"Room service food was also fair, but again I cannot say it was good"
c50337,s9,"There was available shuttle service, but it was not as convenient nor frequent compared to other hotel"
c50338,s1,"When I walked into the hallway I found a bit musty, I thought it was the air con was not strong enough, but it turns out they are a bit old"
c50338,s2,"Rooms- I had stayed in Sheraton Taipei few weeks ago, and I found the room share the same style and design which is quite surprising that they did follow Starwood stand policy, the amenities are the same!!!! We booked 2 bed, the bed is quite big, but rather hard"
c50338,s3,The whole room is very classic Sheraton style
c50338,s4,"Sheraton Macao and Sheraton Taipei have one thing in common, the room have musty smell, Macao has less musty than Taipei"
c50338,s5,"Btw, I accidentally dropped something under bed, and accidentally found a used comb under the bed!!! I think the used comb had been there for a long time, that comb covered by thick dust!!!! (if management saw‚Ä¶"
c50339,s1,I stayed here only because the Venetian was fully-booked
c50339,s2,Probably won't stay here the next time
c50339,s3,"It's an okay room, nothing more, i"
c50339,s4,e while Venetian suites gives you an awesome experience while Sheraton rooms just provides you with a simple nights sleep
c50339,s5,And for the same price
c50339,s6,Great location though
c50340,s1,"Overall very good, but not a luxury hotel"
c50340,s2,Downstairs is a big shopping mall
c50340,s3,Walkable to Venetian Hotel
c50340,s4,Room is big enough and clean
c50340,s5,"One minor bad point, which is the temperature of the water"
c50340,s6,"When I took a shower, the water cannot maintain with the same temperature, like 1 sec hot, 1 sec cold @"
c50340,s7,@
c50341,s1,Stayed at the hotel for 1 night in March
c50341,s2,It took over one hour to check in (this does not even include the queuing!) which was incredibly frustrating
c50341,s3,The room itself was very spacious and clean
c50341,s4,"We had paid extra to have breakfast at the hotel, but when we arrived there was a queue for around 60 people ahead of us"
c50341,s5,They just could not fulfil demand and we therefore asked for a refund
c50341,s6,Luckily this was given without hesitation
c50341,s7,"The casino itself seemed a bit dated, there were other hotels on the strip which just felt a bit more glamorous"
c50341,s8,Unlikely to stay here again
c50342,s1,The Sheraton in Macao has sadly lost its way in an overly crowded cotai-side resort market
c50342,s2,"At one point, the selling point here was the incredibly personal, friendly, and professional service from the club lounge; but that has sadly dropped over the past few years (several other similarly priced resorts offer comparable or better service for the same or cheaper rates)"
c50342,s3,"The resort also went through a period where it attempted to cater to families, but now the JW Marriott is a clear preference to the Sheraton for any family wanting a western-quality experience that serves family (the JW Marriott offers the Galaxy beach / wave pool and a kids club on site)"
c50342,s4,"Now, with 4,000 rooms on offer, the Sheraton will most likely attempt to be the ""mcdonalds"" of macau hotels"
c50342,s5,a‚Ä¶
c50343,s1,"40 minutes to check in, same for check out"
c50343,s2,Very average breakfast
c50343,s3,No king bed available for a couple
c50343,s4,All the services around this hotel are really disappointing
c50343,s5,We stayed two nights
c50343,s6,"Next time, will go elsewhere"
c50343,s7,Only plus side was the quality of the materials the room
c50344,s1,Firstly I will declare that I was booked into this place by my company as we were presenting at a nearby exhibition so I wasn't paying the bill
c50344,s2,"Arrived, around 9pm, check-in process fine, go up to room (enduring brattish kids in the lifts) and find the room which has all one would expect of this standard of hotel, or so I thought"
c50344,s3,"Anyway, having unpacked and started to relax there were some emails I needed to deal with so tried to logon to the hotel wifi to no avail (neither my tablet or phone worked so I knew it wasn't me)"
c50344,s4,"Afte many calls to the front desk, '10 minute' waits, unplugs etc"
c50344,s5,I gave up and went downstairs to complain
c50344,s6,"Was advised to use the lobby lounge wifi, which did work"
c50344,s7,Hurrah! So sat down to do my work and thought why not order myself a glass of‚Ä¶
c50345,s1,We booked two rooms to stay with kids and my parents in law for easter holiday
c50345,s2,The staffs at front desk and operators are nice and helpful since we brought our kids with us and we had different kind of request
c50345,s3,"We arrived hotel at 8:45am, since the checked in time not ready yet so we walked around and went back at 5pm finally"
c50345,s4,"The room  I stayed with kids was terrible, because when we took shower with my kids, the shower head was broken"
c50345,s5,"Also,  the TV was mute by itself and even the volume is high, but no sounds cane out unless we restart"
c50345,s6,Both of two rooms' wall were quite dirty as well
c50345,s7,This is so surprise for me Sheraton likes that
c50345,s8,"We lived in 16th floor, my parent-in-law room can see the studio city but mine room can viewed the dirt"
c50346,s1,Stayed here for a few nights in December
c50346,s2,"Overall, this is what it is, a nice hotel that Sheraton is worldwide"
c50346,s3,It is fairly standard across the world
c50346,s4,You pay fo what you get
c50346,s5,"Sometimes at this end of the price spectrum, it is the little things that sets them apart"
c50346,s6,Unfortunate there were a few out of date coffee/ tea and milk on offer
c50346,s7,"They were months out of date, not days"
c50346,s8,"Overall, this hotel is very crowded with tourists and service can sometimes be lapse due to overcrowding"
c50347,s1,Check in took almost an hour
c50347,s2,My cousin in the states prepaid the room
c50347,s3,She sent the 3rd party requirements right away
c50347,s4,At check in they told us that their accounts is on holiday
c50347,s5,"So, I have to prepay it again and that they would refund my cousin back"
c50347,s6,"How ridiculous, finally the duty manager named Tracy came"
c50347,s7,"She was cold, no smile at all and sound very abrupt"
c50347,s8,"Her first words was, ""you can't show the credit card right?"""
c50347,s9,I explained that it was not my point
c50347,s10,"She then asked me to show all the documents again, which I did"
c50347,s11,"Finally, she let me go without paying again"
c50347,s12,Thank you for that
c50347,s13,"At Check-out queue , the staff assumed that I will use my credit card for express check out"
c50347,s14,I told her I'm paying cash
c50347,s15,"The front desk staff didn't even ask if I need a receipt, after I paid,‚Ä¶"
c50348,s1,It's my second time here and I must say I am sorely disappointed
c50348,s2,We could see many people stranded at hotel lobby today 19/3 due to heavy fog as flighrts and ferries were canceled
c50348,s3,We checked out of Galaxy and were ready to head to airport when we learnt that our flight was cancelled
c50348,s4,We tried booking galaxy but they were fully booked
c50348,s5,Then we booked Sheraton through booking
c50348,s6,com for the same night
c50348,s7,It was a Last minute booking
c50348,s8,When we reached Sheraton at about 5
c50348,s9,30pm the guy at SPG counter could not find our booking
c50348,s10,we realised it could be due to delay in response time from booking
c50348,s11,com hence he told us to wait and come back again
c50348,s12,after some 15 mins we approached the counter guy( he is not a local guy) and he said he could not fnd the booking
c50348,s13,he even suggested we call‚Ä¶
c50349,s1,It's extremely convenient to reach the hotel from Taipa ferry pier with the hotel's own shuttle (as is the case with most casinos in Macau)
c50349,s2,What put me off immediately after arriving at the hotel was a very smelly lobby and the long queues for check-in
c50349,s3,The smell was artificially added and very strong (I am not even allergic)
c50349,s4,Luckily we found out that the rooms themselves did not have such added odours
c50349,s5,Staff at the reception is well-trained and take care of every little detail
c50349,s6,"In such a huge establishment they do not have the time to give a second thought to individual needs, however"
c50349,s7,We stayed three adults in one room and got a comfortable extra bed in no time after arrival
c50349,s8,Room service is very courteous and polite
c50349,s9,We originally thought a couple could fit into a‚Ä¶
c50350,s1,"OK, we won't return"
c50350,s2,"It was my second and my boyfriend's first visit to Macau, and we were both disappointed in the state of and attractions in the region"
c50350,s3,But the hotel didn't do much to help
c50350,s4,"Even though it was still 28C and sunny, the pool areas were closed ""for winter"" - well, if you want to be a tourist destination, act like it"
c50350,s5,"The breakfast ""lounge"" with space for several hundred people was gigantic, noisy and not well-equipped for being a lounge"
c50350,s6,"But there was a lot to choose from! If we return to Macau, we will aim for staying on the peninsula itself, hopefully at the hotel school's pousada"
c50351,s1,"we're staying here for 4 nights great room,facilities and everything that's true but on our second night we came back to the room and the keycard doesnt work we called the lobby and they had us wait for half an hour"
c50351,s2,yeh that was great and then our third day(today) they're doing the construction on the same floor as ours
c50351,s3,what
c50351,s4,? The smell of the paint the dust and even coming into the room so now I'm having a really BAD allergy (at least give us some notice instead of killing me this way) not to mention that my brother brings his 10months daughter here with us Thank you Sheraton great stay
c50352,s1,"-	Check in: had my stay at Sheraton Macao on Chinese New Year eve, crowd was expected but the whole queue was beyond my expectation! Hotel should arrange more front office staff during such peak season; can‚Äôt remember how long I have queued up but the experience sucks!   -	Room: the room size is above average compared to most of the standard room"
c50352,s2,"However, hair was being found on the mirror, housekeeping should take note of it"
c50352,s3,"-	Breakfast: Due to the high occupancy, guests were being arranged to have their breakfast at FEAST / XIN according to their room location"
c50352,s4,I was looking forward to having my breakfast at FEAST however the staff allocated me to XIN without asking for my preference
c50352,s5,It‚Äôs fine if the food items are the same; however this is not the case
c50352,s6,After a long queue‚Ä¶
c50353,s1,I just checked out after a two-night stay
c50353,s2,"There were good and bad things about the hotel, but nothing that made it stand out as a memorable experience either way"
c50353,s3,The shuttles to/from the ferry terminals and Sands Macau were nice and convenient
c50353,s4,Check-in and concierge staff were friendly and helpful
c50353,s5,Room rate was good
c50353,s6,The upgrade to the executive suite was nice
c50353,s7,"I'm not sure when the Earth Tower was built, but the room furnishings looked looked worn and tired and the decor was a bit of a letdown considering how the property has been advertised"
c50353,s8,"Overall, I was very disappointed with the food and was glad I was able to find some inexpensive local restaurants in the historic centre and in Taipa village"
c50353,s9,"The ""Feast"" buffet dinner was 95%+ seafood dishes and breakfast‚Ä¶"
c50354,s1,The lobby was teeming with people wanting to check-in
c50354,s2,It felt like lining up for a concert
c50354,s3,"We were in line for almost 3 hours! After spending two days at nearby Venetian Hotel, we find our room at the Sheraton kinda tight"
c50354,s4,We only stayed in the hotel for the Sheraton experience but Oh no
c50354,s5,never again!  Room service was almost non-existent
c50354,s6,Had to call reception and ask them to let Room Service return our call because no one was answering
c50354,s7,I was already sleeping when my dinner arrived a little after 12mn
c50355,s1,The room was nice
c50355,s2,"I had a view to a construction site, so not very impressive"
c50355,s3,"The hotel doesn't have any place to buy water/coke after 11pm, which I think is unreasonable"
c50355,s4,The Italian restaurant in the hotel was very good
c50355,s5,"The gym was ok,  although much smaller than expected"
c50356,s1,Booked the family suite which includes a room for the 2 kids
c50356,s2,"The booking I made included breakfast, Madagascar package"
c50356,s3,"But for a strange reason, when we got to check in they advised that the room we booked did not include breakfast and we needed to pay an extra hk$300 per person for the breakfast"
c50356,s4,"Which only means the room is now at HK$4,000/night (yeah right"
c50356,s5,") Anyway, I am not the person who argues and stand up to fight for what I think would just ruin my family weekend out"
c50356,s6,"Checked in went up to the room, and to no surprise, the kids room had no books nor board games, never mind the amnesty which they claim the kids would get at the checkin, they even emailed me asking for the names of my 2 kids and their ages"
c50356,s7,"The wife got really angry, there is a limit after all‚Ä¶"
c50357,s1,"Given that Macau is the las vegas of asia, expect the casino to greet you as soon as you enter the hotel"
c50357,s2,"The check-in process was quick and easy, the check-out process a little bit too easy - we just dropped off our room keys and that was it"
c50357,s3,There was no opportunity if we were charged correctly or not
c50357,s4,"The rooms itself were spacious and amenities were decent, nothing great but nothing bad"
c50357,s5,Biggest disappointment was the distance from the hotel rooms to where the breakfast was being served - a good 10minute walk!  As well as the lack of cuisine variety within the hotel area
c50357,s6,"Staff were helpful, but as English speaking tourists, there was still some difficulty communicating"
c50358,s1,The location of Sheraton Grand is excellent if you want to stay in Cotai Central (which is the casino / entertainment district)
c50358,s2,There is an interconnecting walkway (through many shops) to Four Seasons Hotel and then to the Venetian Hotel
c50358,s3,"It does not have its own shuttle bus, but you can utilise the shuttle buses operated by other hotels to get yourself to and from the ferry terminal / airport (ie"
c50358,s4,There is a stop at Sheraton Grand)
c50358,s5,What we found was that it wasn't so convenient to catch a free shuttle bus to do our sightseeing (where the old district is) - you effectively have to catch a shuttle bus back across the bridge to the ferry terminal and then catch a bus or taxi to your destination
c50358,s6,We (family of four) stayed in a family suite
c50358,s7,The room is effectively made up‚Ä¶
c50359,s1,We used an express checkout and later found in our credit card bill that the hotel overcharged us
c50359,s2,"We called the hotel, but the waiting was so long that we had to hang up"
c50359,s3,This on top of the very long waiting time for the check in makes us dissappointed in the hotel
c50360,s1,I booked an executive room with lounge access
c50360,s2,We also have a special breakfast room
c50360,s3,Food in lounge and at breakfast just average
c50360,s4,Even waffle-making is self service
c50360,s5,Coffee only came in a flask
c50360,s6,"For a five star hotel, I would expect freshly brewed coffee"
c50361,s1,I have stayed at the suits room during their promotion period
c50361,s2,"but the service is not good enough at the check-in reception desk, lack of the staff during the night time at the desk and make a long queue, even as a SPG member, they have closed all the SPG line as well"
c50361,s3,The staff is q
c50361,s4,"impolite during the breakfast hour at the Sheraton Club, look like they don't want to serve you at the early morning"
c50361,s5,"(like not welcoming all the guests) A lots of different new hotel brand in Macau, even their sister company ST REGIS have been opened next to their building"
c50361,s6,I think they have to improve it their standard asap
c50361,s7,Thanks
c50362,s1,"My review here is regarding what my wife, mother-in-law and brother-in-law comment to me"
c50362,s2,The reason I ask their opinion coz my review/opinion might be a little bias for the property since im a hotelier working in a Forbe's five star hotel here in macao and rank as 1st or 2nd place most of the time since the opening last 2012
c50362,s3,"So definitely, im not going to give any review coming from me directly coz my standard will always base on the hotel where I worked"
c50362,s4,Here's their comments/reviews;  We stayed last December 24-25 for Christmas
c50362,s5,I book thru hotel website despite of the high season rate
c50362,s6,1 standard room with 2 beds
c50362,s7,I also registered in SPG which help a lot during the check-in process
c50362,s8,Seeing the queue in main lobby's reception that time makes me and my family happy‚Ä¶
c50363,s1,My third time staying at Sheraton Macau was under expectation
c50363,s2,Quite disappointed with services
c50363,s3,"First, long queue and slow check in"
c50363,s4,"Second, booking 2 non smoking rooms, but arranged 2 smoking rooms"
c50363,s5,"Third, some bathroom amenities were missing"
c50363,s6,"Finally, late check out request never guaranteed"
c50363,s7,"If possible, we will not stay here anymore since there are so many nice, new, and better price than this hotel"
c50364,s1,Stayed one night in a club room at this hotel
c50364,s2,"when we passed by the lobby, the queue for checking in is unbelievably long"
c50364,s3,glad that we did not have to check in there
c50364,s4,"The hotel feels dated with strange smell, although I think it's pretty new when compared to some other hotels in Macau"
c50364,s5,It's huge but when you get lost you can't possibly find staff to help you
c50364,s6,Anyway we made it to the club lounge
c50364,s7,The check in was quick and the room was okay
c50364,s8,However the evening cocktail session at the lounge was a mess
c50364,s9,"There were too many people in the lounge and we had to line up for 15 minutes to get food! People were rude and noisy, kids crying or running around, adults shouting to each other in the lounge and some didn't even bother to queue up for food"
c50364,s10,The presentation and quality of‚Ä¶
c50365,s1,My positive view of Sheraton has been destroyed
c50365,s2,"From waiting at hotel shuttle bus rank to airport for nearly an hour, around 3 pm on 3 Jan, a Chinese woman staff of hotel started shouting in Chinese and pulling my arms away from bus"
c50365,s3,I was severely confused as I don't speak Chinese she was pulling me repeatedly and no Eng speaking staff to assist
c50365,s4,I had to get on bus otherwise I would miss my flight
c50365,s5,Problem was randomly solved - just a cup of coffee that needs to be thrown but it was lost in translation and shouting
c50365,s6,Another male non-Eng speaking Chinese staff in shuttle bus rank counter looked at us with unfriendly insulting eyes
c50365,s7,Five-stars much? Don't think so!!!  Extra bed - waited until 9pm to receive my bed after repeatedly calling the guest services
c50365,s8,Room cleaning -‚Ä¶
c50366,s1,Stayed here for 1 night because we had an early flight the next morning to Beijing and on to London
c50366,s2,"At over ¬£200 for a night the hotel is grossly over priced for the standard, the room was mediocre and the bathroom in places was disgusting especially in the shower the hotel is getting tired and worn out but they re still charging top rate"
c50366,s3,Would strongly advise against staying in this hotel
c50367,s1,Just back from stay last week over New Year
c50367,s2,This was my 3rd time back over 2 years
c50367,s3,"By far the most disappointing stay, particularly due to the Exec Lounge amenity which has deteriorated quite amazingly"
c50367,s4,The evening food in the lounge was awful and basically 'mall foodcourt' quality at best catering exclusive for Asian guests with virtually no international choice (which you would not expect at a Sheraton)
c50367,s5,Small children running around screaming pretty much destroys any semblance of ambiance too in the lounge
c50367,s6,"If you aren't fond of big crowds/queues, Macau is not for you and Sheraton would be your least preferred option"
c50368,s1,I stayed during the 1 few days before New Year and the lobby and bell drop off for luggage were like a zoo with very long lines and people occupying every open space
c50368,s2,They shouted check in at 3!  So we had to store our bags
c50368,s3,But check out was at 11 the next day
c50368,s4,Other hotels in Macau were much more sedate and well organized during the same period
c50368,s5,Obviously under staffed at the bell desk and check in and housekeeping or they could be like other hotels
c50368,s6,The rooms are small - they look like a standard city hotel or even smaller
c50368,s7,Don't feel you are at a posh casino resort
c50368,s8,The beds are comfortable with good sheets and the air conditioning works well and blackout curtains cover the light well
c50368,s9,The rooms are quiet
c50368,s10,So sleep quality is good
c50368,s11,Restaurants:  The shopping‚Ä¶
c50369,s1,The good
c50369,s2,#NAME?
c50369,s3,#NAME?
c50369,s4,"Had to ask for it to be sprayed with air freshener - If you go out in the morning and expect your room to be clean when you get back, you will be disappointed"
c50369,s5,The room is not cleaned up until 4 or 5 pm - The Guest Service number is frequently not picked leaving you more frustrated - No simple inexpensive shops or supermarkets around the area  Will probably look for other hotels if we decide to come back to Macau
c50370,s1,Was there on 28Dec 2015 in the morning at 11+ in the morning
c50370,s2,But we're told we have to wait till 1pm to check in
c50370,s3,"To our horror, there was a long Q"
c50370,s4,It was an hour wait just to check in
c50370,s5,We were surprised that they didn't analyse their bookings and made better planning for the crowd
c50370,s6,On other matters: most service personnel weren't conversant in English
c50370,s7,So it was really difficult getting help around
c50370,s8,Majority of the hotel guests were from Mainland China and Hong Kong
c50370,s9,Perhaps the hotel management could consider a counter for International visitors so that we could get appropriate help
c50370,s10,The saving grace was the house-keeping service
c50370,s11,The rooms were kept clean with all amenities topped up daily
c50371,s1,We (family of 4) booked a deluxe twin room with 2 double beds
c50371,s2,"However, the two beds in our room were smaller than expected, and could barely fit 2 people each"
c50371,s3,"The room was also very cramped, with little free space, especially after we had housekeeping set up an extra roller bed"
c50371,s4,"Additionally, for the entire duration of our stay, housekeeping kept preparing the room for only 2 people (e"
c50371,s5,g
c50371,s6,we were always only provided 2 sets of toiletries)
c50371,s7,This meant that we had to ring housekeeping every night to get 2 additional sets of everything
c50371,s8,"However, the rest of the service staff were friendly and very helpful when we had difficulties finding the boarding points for the different shuttle services"
c50371,s9,We were lucky that the queue at check-in wasn't very long and we managed to check-in‚Ä¶
c50372,s1,When it's a SPG hotel you kind of takes some things for granted
c50372,s2,"Sorry to say, I did not exactly feel the love despite being a member"
c50372,s3,the check in took ages
c50372,s4,all the spg cards etc are of no great use
c50372,s5,the long wait I think is a known issue which is why they have some balloon creatures at the reception to humor children while you wait endlessly
c50372,s6,all this after booking in advance
c50372,s7,these small things do dampen your spirits when you arrive to a new place with limited time in hands
c50372,s8,after paying a premium you kind of assume things will be hassle free
c50372,s9,not all the time i guess
c50372,s10,The hotel room charges are on the higher side (obviously) but the service etc did not match the charged premium
c50372,s11,If you were to sit in the room with closed curtains and order in-room dining then I would rate‚Ä¶
c50373,s1,We just came back from a family trip to the Sheraton Macau
c50373,s2,"In a nutshell, it was a frustrating and horrible experience and we will never be back"
c50373,s3,From the unbelievably long check in queues (even for the SPG counters where we had to wait close to 45 mins with only 4 people in front of us) to the seemingly ignorant staff and poor service (we had booked 2 rooms - one deluxe room and one family suite and long requested these rooms be close together as possible
c50373,s4,"Whilst checking in, we enquired whether this was available, and the lady said she couldn't find any Deluxe Rooms that were ready on the same floor as the Family Suite"
c50373,s5,"This was already 5pm in the afternoon when checkin time is 3pm! When we agreed to the rooms being on different floors, the lady took another 5 minutes of‚Ä¶"
c50374,s1,This hotel has nice facilities but the service is poor and significantly lower than my expectations
c50374,s2,Let me share with you three incidents
c50374,s3,"First, my five-year-old son lost his bag on the shuttle bus"
c50374,s4,My wife immediately went to the bus bay
c50374,s5,"The staff were cold and unfriendly, with a substantial ""none-of-my-business"" attitude"
c50374,s6,"As a result, she was told to go to different places, despite that a simple phone call was all they needed to do to help us"
c50374,s7,"Second, we went to check out dining at Palms"
c50374,s8,"When we asked for a  menu, the waiter produced a copy rather reluctantly with a stiff face"
c50374,s9,"He then looked away from us, to make it obvious that he didn't want to be bothered with questions"
c50374,s10,"Lastly, the bell boy, Rohene Leo, I asked him about where to board the bus to the airport, which i‚Ä¶"
c50375,s1,If I had to choose between Vegas and Macau I know which one I would choose
c50375,s2,"The hotel is lovely, but the experiences are for hard core gamblers"
c50375,s3,Coaches take you to any casino for free (just have to line up)  We were lucky to go to the Macu Grand Prix which was a lot of fun
c50376,s1,"I stay in there on 25th, actually the room price and quality are acceptable, but compare with my friend's room"
c50376,s2,it's worse
c50376,s3,"My friend stay in Conrad, beside Sheraton, the room price is same as me, but he can free upgrade to king suit, X'mas gift, but I have nothing"
c50376,s4,"The funny thing is it has a SPG member counter,  it is separate with normal counter and have a long queue"
c50376,s5,So I guess maybe go to SPG side easy to get free upgrade and early check in
c50376,s6,"finally, I was foolüòí  In honestly, he room is fine, has a large bathroom, comfortable bed"
c50377,s1,I had no idea I was staying at the Sheraton because when I booked they said something like ‚Äúhay lay doon‚Äù in Chinese so I thought it was going to be Hilton or something
c50377,s2,"Anyway, found out it was the Sheraton which is a popular pick for bloggers in Hong Kong"
c50377,s3,"The hotel was quite nice, it was clean with a nice bath tub"
c50377,s4,"Although there was a long queue to check in, there had fruit infused water for people to drink"
c50377,s5,Checking in was a waste of time because there were so many people which means you lose some hotel time
c50377,s6,The quick check out was good because you don‚Äôt need to queue
c50378,s1,Booked a night at this hotel for the 2 bedroom family room
c50378,s2,"Rooms are worn out, smudges on the wall and had stale smell to them"
c50378,s3,Even though the family rooms were designed more for families with children we found that the room lacked the amenities for them
c50378,s4,1
c50378,s5,No Cartoon Network in English( Mandarin only) 2
c50378,s6,Wii did not work
c50378,s7,Had to call up and it took over 2 hrs until it was replaced
c50378,s8,3
c50378,s9,Children's room service food inedible
c50378,s10,If you were planning to book this room type for a family with children than I would recommend maybe booking a suite at The Galaxy as their rooms and facilities are more well suited
c50379,s1,"People seem to be raving about this hotel - as ever - but in all honesty, probably one of the most disappointing stays in a Sheraton I've had"
c50379,s2,No recognition of SPG status other than you get to wait in a different line to check-in
c50379,s3,"and they are so rammed that you are asked not to even stay with your partner, they want the queue to look smaller so it is one person only"
c50379,s4,Enough said really
c50379,s5,nothing more than a massive block in the middle of nowhere
c50379,s6,"We wandered out later that night and aside from the collection of drunk Mainlanders arguing, found nothing open and were grateful for a little convenience store a few blocks down in another hotel"
c50379,s7,I guess this is progress
c50379,s8,a hotel devoted to gambling and a particular clientele
c50379,s9,Numbers win over character and quality
c50380,s1,This is a mammoth 4000 bed twin tower hotel in the Cotai Central area
c50380,s2,Should really have been run as 2 separate hotels for optimum efficiency and service
c50380,s3,"Check-in: Massive lines, but fortunately, being a SPG member, I was able to check in in a dedicated member area"
c50380,s4,"Still had to wait a while, but it would have been faster than the snaking queue at the main check in counter"
c50380,s5,Staff at the SPG desks were friendly and helpful
c50380,s6,The experience was let down by the fact that I was double charged for the security deposit
c50380,s7,"Room: Hotel elevators do not have secured access to guest room floors, which is surprising as this is a relatively new hotel"
c50380,s8,"The room was large, clean and had all the usual amenities"
c50380,s9,"I had booked a room for 3 persons, but everything in the room was in pairs"
c50380,s10,I‚Ä¶
c50381,s1,"Book a suite & club room for family holiday of 6, on arrival to lobby, was usher to ""SPG Club"" check-in queue"
c50381,s2,"I reiterated to the usher/security that ""are you sure this is the right queue for club room guest"" - and he kept saying yes"
c50381,s3,Fine - I queued
c50381,s4,"There were at least 5 check-in counter/staff, so I guess it would be a breeze, then to my dismay, Gold/Platinum members were served first while those on queue just had to wait and wait"
c50381,s5,"After my check-in was completed after 30 mins of queue-ing, was given a leaflet of 'club benefits' - and what does it say? Club Guest should have check-in at their club, and there weren't anyone"
c50381,s6,"WIth my family in tow, NO ONE EVEN OFFER to bring our bags to our room"
c50381,s7,Well done Sheraton - you have made my stay truly MEMORABLE!  Another punch‚Ä¶
c50382,s1,"Good staffs service, express check-out service is excellent which can save much time"
c50382,s2,But lobby is very noisy & lift are very crowded especially during night time
c50382,s3,"Other then that, it was great"
c50382,s4,We will come again next time!
c50383,s1,"Don't  even know where to start, was mortified by my experience with Sheradan in Macau"
c50383,s2,"1) checking In: the front desk, had a massive had time, almost walked out kind of bad"
c50383,s3,"As a VIP SPG member, Never  received such bad attitude"
c50383,s4,Maybe she was just having one of those bad days
c50383,s5,"2) cigarette buds inside of elevator, enforce and even after I return from my evening run (2 hours) 3) night staff did not check if I was a hotel guest just let me walk right in, and screamed out "" what floor are you"", from the other side of the corridor"
c50383,s6,"4) there were no water left in the ladies locker room, the cleaning lady said ""there's water outside"" that means we don't need to drink there, there's water outside of the locker room"
c50383,s7,"If I had to give points to this hotel, it would be minus, we would‚Ä¶"
c50384,s1,I have stayed here twice now
c50384,s2,once because someone else booked and the second time because our friends were staying there so we moved over from Banyan Tree (which is amazing)
c50384,s3,Checking in is like a cattle market or a pig farm
c50384,s4,being herded
c50384,s5,No warmth at checking in
c50384,s6,Rooms are 3* at best and the pool is terrible
c50384,s7,the ONE major strength was the spanish restaurant buffet
c50384,s8,yet i had a jug of sangria spilt on me first time
c50384,s9,no problem accidents happen
c50384,s10,Second visit the chefs gave such tiny portions and also i was pulling fat out of my mouth or cutting loads of it off
c50384,s11,"Anyway, one thing will always stick in my mind"
c50384,s12,We had a late flight so checked out and went to venetian
c50384,s13,when we came back for our bags
c50384,s14,1-- The staff said my signature was different so wouldnt get the‚Ä¶
c50385,s1,Arrived at the hotel and had thought arriving at the refugee camp
c50385,s2,"The foyer is full of people, maybe the foyer was not designed large enough to cope that large amount of tourists coming through, having the casino sharing the same entrance with the hotel"
c50385,s3,I arrived at the hotel at lunch time and there was 3 lanes deep of cue at the front desk with people wishing to checkin and check out
c50385,s4,I went to have lunch first and came back at 1500 and the cue was still as long as before
c50385,s5,All counters were open and slow checkin was not helping at all
c50385,s6,We waited in the cue for good 30min
c50385,s7,"I booked two rooms for four people and our rooms were not pre-assigned, meaning they were prepared to give us our rooms on different floors, unless we take the smoking rooms"
c50385,s8,"The room was considered okay,‚Ä¶"
c50386,s1,"There was a problem in the toilet, and the water was stuck and it was water in the whole toilet after my wife took the shower"
c50386,s2,It's like flooding in my hotel toilet
c50386,s3,"Unfortunately it happened at 10:30pm, I called technician to fix and also asked the housekeeping to clean up asap! I warned the housekeeping to take off the shoes because I am not sure how dirty was the water in toilet"
c50386,s4,"The housekeeping simply didn't listen, all 3 housekeeping ladies were wearing shoes and I guessed it made the carpet dirty!  It's now about 12am, and I asked if they have a room for me to change, it seems no one cares in this hotel! My kids are still waiting for them to clean up! They are just 3 and 6 years old and they are very sleepy!  btw, I talked to the duty manager and seems she didn't care as‚Ä¶"
c50387,s1,We didn't realize how huge the commercial complex was until we arrived
c50387,s2,It was the longest check-in queue ever
c50387,s3,"Luckily, the waiting was not too long"
c50387,s4,"Our receptionist seemed a bit restless, which made me a little nervous - did I make a booking mistake?! I handed him our booking voucher and IDs but he only took one look at my husband's ID, as if he was too busy to check the other things I handed him"
c50387,s5,"Instead, he did some typing, stared at the computer and asked a few times, ""You are Mr"
c50387,s6,Ho and Ms
c50387,s7,"xxx? Booked for x nights?"" until he got the right one"
c50387,s8,How hard was it to just look at my ID and find my name as well in his computer? I surely didn't like being called different names and being asked if it was me at the start of a birthday get-away trip
c50387,s9,And then Sheraton saved it‚Ä¶
c50388,s1,"This is the train station of hotels (though possibly not the only one in Macau) with little style, little service but a lot of rooms!"
c50388,s2,"I didn't have a room pre booked, and they said they were full (I was there with friends) but they suggested trying online agents - which I did in reception, where they had lots! Seems crazy to have to book online in front of the booking desk that was ''full''"
c50388,s3,"I booked a suite, they didn't get confirmation from agency so I got a standard room which was OK and the following day moved to the suite which was HUGE"
c50388,s4,they tried to bill me for both nights in the suite mind - sorted a couple of days later
c50388,s5,all seemed a bit of a mess
c50389,s1,i stayed just one night from 12-13/11
c50389,s2,"as expected, the room is up to standard, location is fine"
c50389,s3,but what amazed me was the huge group of china tourists crowded in both front desks to check in!! this seems to happen everyday! i queue up to check in for 45 min!  this phenomenon was not observed in other neighborhood hotels
c50389,s4,"i felt a bit uneasy when queue up among all these mainland people, coughing, speaking very loud on cell phone around you, next to you and appeared as if they did not understand the meaning of staying in a queue"
c50389,s5,i will certainly choose another hotel next time to avoid this suffering
c50389,s6,the Gym was far away from my room and easy to get lost on the way
c50389,s7,one good thing is the speedy check out system
c50389,s8,otherwise cannot imagine!
c50390,s1,I spent 3days in Macau and 1 night in Sheraton
c50390,s2,This was to celebrated my husband's birthday
c50390,s3,I appreciated the hotel upgraded me to Family suite and the complimentary gift
c50390,s4,"However, what made me so impressed was the integrity of the staff!  I checked out at the Sheraton and went to check in Holiday Inn immediately"
c50390,s5,"Afterward, I found my trouser was left in the room at Sheraton and came back to Sheraton 2 times in next day to ensure if it was possibly a different person would kept my trouser"
c50390,s6,"What the answer I got was ""It was not found"
c50390,s7,""""
c50390,s8,I was so disappointed cause it is the 5 stars international hotels group but some of their staff are dishonesty
c50390,s9,My trouser is not a famous brand nor a high value but why its staff are unreliable?   It was definitely in my black list‚Ä¶
c50391,s1,I am an SPG member and booked for myself and family
c50391,s2,I also requested a wheelchair for assistance for my spouce and a room near the elevator to avoid the long walk in this large hotel
c50391,s3,I had to stay back in Hong Kong and my family went directly
c50391,s4,They reached at 3pm at the hotel with the Reservation detail
c50391,s5,Meanwhile i had phoned at 3
c50391,s6,30pm to enquire if they checked in and when informed room not occupied i was a bit worried
c50391,s7,I informed Guest relations and reservations on the phone that my family will be checking in and i will come later
c50391,s8,"They said noted and i also reminded about room near elevator and wheelchair, again said request there and noted"
c50391,s9,I made a total of 4 calls between 4 & 7pm and till that time not checked in
c50391,s10,Unfortunately my wife had a HK phone which was not‚Ä¶
c50392,s1,Our first impression of Sheraton Macao Hotel was too crowded; there are so many people in the lobby area and even with so many people service is above average
c50392,s2,Luckily as we are Starwood members we were checked-in in the Club Lounge with less people
c50392,s3,"The room is nice, clean and good in size"
c50393,s1,I stayed at Sheraton Macau for 3 nights
c50393,s2,We ordered coffee capsules which was scheduled to be delivered to us at the hotel during these 3 days
c50393,s3,"As we went with a group tour, our names weren't match with the reservation name because tour guide had rearranged new room for our family to stay on the same floor"
c50393,s4,We then talked to staff at the concierge desk about this situation since the first day that we had arrived
c50393,s5,"We provided them room number, our names, order number and pretty much everything"
c50393,s6,We reconfirmed with the staff many times but they refused to collect our parcels when it was delivered to the concierge desk
c50393,s7,The reason given to the carrier company was that the name did not match with the reservation name even the room number and our names were shown on the parcel
c50393,s8,‚Ä¶
c50394,s1,I have stayed here twice
c50394,s2,"Last year, I booked a room for 4 persons on SPG's website, made it confirmed by e-mail from the hotel that the room was for 4 persons"
c50394,s3,"But, they gave me a room with just 1 king bed when I checked in"
c50394,s4,"I was flustered, and the reception said that they don't have a room for 4 persons except for a suite"
c50394,s5,"To make matters worse, they suggested me to upgrade to a suite with additional pay because all the deluxe rooms were fully booked"
c50394,s6,"Anyway, they put some extra beds in a room and I had no other choice"
c50394,s7,"I had complained, and Guest Service Manager offered me a complimentary room upgrade for next visit"
c50394,s8,I had another chance to visit Macau early in Jan
c50394,s9,This time I'd booked a room and asked the Guest Service Manager if the last offer was still valid
c50394,s10,He didn't‚Ä¶
c50395,s1,Was expecting more from sheraton
c50395,s2,The building and rooms are a bit old and wornout
c50395,s3,I guess is just good for location and casinos
c50395,s4,is conveneient but not that delightful for the rooms
c50395,s5,For this price  i believe i can have better options
c50396,s1,We booked this hotel after losing a passport; we originally spent the night at another hotel but the rates were not within our budget for multiple nights so we decided to move over to this hotel
c50396,s2,We arrived early but rooms were available so they let us check-in
c50396,s3,We used room service and the food was mediocre but it satisfied our late night hunger
c50396,s4,The rooms themselves are clean and pretty large but they could use some updating
c50396,s5,"The hotel is HUGE so there is not a very personal feel, but that was to be expected"
c50396,s6,Added bonus for pictures with Shrek!
c50397,s1,"While the hotel is clean modern and the rooms are good, it just feels like the hotel is not up to the standards of a typical Sheraton hotel elsewhere"
c50397,s2,"Situated on top of a casino with crowds coming in and out every day, the place is busy and you don't feel as if you are in a luxury/Exclusive hotel (well they certainly have not priced it as a luxury hotel I have to agree)"
c50397,s3,The check in queue was very long and you feel being rushed
c50397,s4,"Everything is some distance away, including the walk from the check in desk to the lift where your room is"
c50397,s5,"Other than that, there isn't much to complain about the room I guess, it is modern and clean"
c50397,s6,"There isn't much they can do to be honest, this is one of three (4 soon) hotels on top of a massive casino and is designed to provide affordable beds‚Ä¶"
c50398,s1,I visited the Sherton Macao Hotel during summer holiday with kids
c50398,s2,"When I arrived, they check in area had a very long queue, I guessed there was over 300 people in the lobby waiting for check-in"
c50398,s3,There was some staffs to maintain the queue in good order
c50398,s4,I waited more than one hour to get the room key
c50398,s5,The front desk staff was too tired to offer a smile
c50398,s6,Not a warm welcome
c50398,s7,"The room was clean, I had left a top in the room afte departure however no one contact me for the lost and found during my stay"
c50398,s8,Perhaps the Housekeeping was too busy? The room package included daily breakfast or lunch
c50398,s9,The food and service in Feast was very good
c50398,s10,"The hotel had shuttle bus to Cotai ferry, however the other hotels would have shuttle bus to other areas in Macao"
c50398,s11,We had to take taxi when we went‚Ä¶
c50399,s1,Sheraton Macau is one of the lowest grade hotel for this brand
c50399,s2,Stayed there 2 nights and cannot believed they used such low end  products across the room
c50399,s3,The shampoo and soap are unbelievable cheap
c50399,s4,There is No security at all
c50399,s5,Anyone can get access to all floor as they do not have lift control
c50399,s6,This is one of the lowest standard of  Sheraton in Asia
c50400,s1,We had a good experience here despite the check-in line being ridiculously long
c50400,s2,The staff were very accommodating
c50400,s3,The room was great and we had a nice view of the pool
c50400,s4,The bell boys helped us explain to the cab driver where we wanted to go and gave us a small card with translations to help us better communicate with the driver
c50401,s1,"I was not enjoy my stay on 24~28 Oct, no show on 24 Oct,then check in on 25 Oct, reception counter full of staff but look so messy, receptionist seem like not so familiar with the system, after i enter the room, found a soap (used) on laundry basket, 27 Oct i back to room at night, room simply clean, found cup and coffee pot unclean, bed sheet like unchange, dust on carpet, seem no vacumm at all, and room svs tray still on the desk, no one take it out, so i put outside my room, but when i check out this morning, still at the same location, i don't know the standard for extend guest and new guest, that's make me quiet disappointed"
c50401,s2,I don't think i will stay there again
c50402,s1,Stayed for 3 nights
c50402,s2,Booked on a Club Loung basis
c50402,s3,The check in located on the 4th Floor is designed to give a superior experience this was not the case
c50402,s4,"There are potentially 8 check in positions, at the time of our check in only 2 were in use"
c50402,s5,"One of the two was dealing with a client on a protracted matter the other was the sole interface with the new registrations, the time spent waiting was in access of 20 minutes"
c50402,s6,I consider this to be unacceptable
c50402,s7,"Our Club Room was on the 31st Floor, for a 5* hotel this was dissapointing and the room  can only be described as basic and underwhelming, certainly not to the standard I was expecting"
c50402,s8,"On a positive note the arrangements in the Club Lounge were very good with light refreshments , tea , coffee and sandwiches available in the‚Ä¶"
c50403,s1,"My family and I stayed in a family (2 bed) suite last month, and were incredibly underwhelmed by the Sheraton"
c50403,s2,"We came on a busy weekend with a Bon Jovi concert in the neighbouring Venetian, so when we walked in at 3"
c50403,s3,30pm the queue for checking in must have been an hour long
c50403,s4,"We were ushered to an upstairs check-in area, which was only a HALF hour long! Upon checking in we were told that our room was not ready yet, and were shown to the lounge, where we were provided 1 drink each - there was no food, and by this stage the kids were hungry and miserable"
c50403,s5,"The suite was quite nice, with bunk beds for the kids and Madagascar themed accessories for them too"
c50403,s6,"Wi-fi was poor throughout the hotel, even in the room"
c50403,s7,The breakfast area was about a half-hour walk from our room to the‚Ä¶
c50404,s1,We chose this for a short break with our 4 year old twins
c50404,s2,First impression was a chaotic lobby and long queues but we were quickly ushered upstairs to the SPG lounge by an attentive concierge
c50404,s3,It saved embarrassment that I am actually an SPG member
c50404,s4,"I'm happy to carry my own luggage, which I guess was a relief as no help was on offer (a first for me - normally there's an embarrassment of service in that area)"
c50404,s5,"Adjoining rooms were good and the kids' room was bedecked with Dreamworks themed goodies, which was great and one of the reasons we had chosen the Sheraton"
c50404,s6,We set out to explore lunch options
c50404,s7,"Poolside bar menu was sparse, as was the service so we elected for Bene, the Italian on the first floor"
c50404,s8,Generally pretty good although the waiter got a bit pushy when we only‚Ä¶
c50405,s1,i had kept my pasmo/ suica in the card slot
c50405,s2,upon returning to my room it was taken
c50405,s3,i searched high and low before confirming i needed to contact reception
c50405,s4,house keeping found my pasmo/ suica and returned it to my room
c50405,s5,(now i am going through my bags ensuring nothing else has been taken 2:30am)  Thanks for a good nights rest
c50405,s6,(sarcasm)
c50406,s1,The hotel was lovely but our holiday was ruined and very disappointed with the check out service
c50406,s2,We paid a deposit on arrival and were told we would have the amount credit within 24 hours back onto our credit card it was a moderate amount
c50406,s3,3 and half weeks later I was still trying to get that money back I could not get any satisfaction from emails etc
c50406,s4,so disappointing from such a large well known company there was a huge mix up and paperwork missing not good enough I will never stay at a Sheraton hotel again I have never had this problem ever all over the whole world
c50407,s1,I had a early Ferry üö¢ from Hong Kong to Macau (Êæ≥ÈñÄ) and go to hotel by their shuttle Bus üöå üöå
c50407,s2,As a SPG member I go to the SPG counter to check in although I booked the room through travel agent
c50407,s3,I understand the earliest time to pick up the room is around 15:00
c50407,s4,So I put my luggage at bell service
c50407,s5,Friendly SPG staff marked down my phone number and he said hotel will SMS me when the room is really
c50407,s6,At last I do not receive the SMS at all
c50407,s7,"I come back to hotel around 23:00, I go to pick up the key at SPG counters as well"
c50407,s8,Everything is fine
c50407,s9,"When I go up, I hear some noise inside my room, then I use my key to open the door"
c50407,s10,I found that a staff is setting up my extra bed which I ordered before
c50407,s11,May be I didn't book through SPG for the room they do not give me a SPG room‚Ä¶
c50408,s1,Stayed at Sheraton Cotai from 24-28 Sep 2015
c50408,s2,"The check-in line was very long, luckily as our group consist of 2 young children (1 was done with fever) and 2 late sixties seniors were directed to the express check-in"
c50408,s3,I find the hotel concierege are really helpful whenever we approach them for assistance
c50408,s4,We would suggest that families with young kids to stay on the peninsula side and most of the tourist spots are located there
c50408,s5,The Cotai area is mostly for people visiting the casinos
c50408,s6,Our family enjoyed the fantastic House of Dancing Water show
c50409,s1,"This is my third time to stay at Sheraton Macao, I am fine with the hotel location, facility and the room is nice"
c50409,s2,"I had a very disappointing experience - when I check out, I told the reception Miss Chow/Zhou I loss my deposit receipt then she gave me a long face to calculate the deposit balance, then she ""throw the money"" on the reception desk"
c50409,s3,"I felt embarrassing, I need to meet my friends so I didn't raise complaint to her manager"
c50409,s4,"Very disappointing service I hope Sheraton to improve their service level, therefore I have to give them only 2-star"
c50409,s5,"To clarify: this time my room is not complimentary by the Casino, I book thru agent"
c50410,s1,The problem with this hotel is that it is so massive and loses its exclusivity
c50410,s2,It is becoming a really sleazy hotel
c50410,s3,There are two towers with a casino at the lobby
c50410,s4,"I went there during the China National Day holidays, and boy oh boy"
c50410,s5,It was so crowded at the lobby
c50410,s6,"This is my third stay in this hotel, and I have no idea why I was put at Sky Tower again"
c50410,s7,"From my observation, it seems that Caucasians were placed in the Earth Tower while Asians, which I am one, were placed in the Sky Tower"
c50410,s8,"I have never been into the Earth Tower, and hence, can't really comment on the layout, decorations etc"
c50410,s9,But what I can comment on was the quality of guests in the Sky Tower
c50410,s10,"I was placed on a no-smoking floor, and the first thing that I saw when exiting the elevator on my level was a‚Ä¶"
c50411,s1,Getting to the hotel from ferry terminal ‚Äì Free shuttle bus is available at both Macau/Taipa Ferry Terminal
c50411,s2,Is very easy and convenient to get to the hotel
c50411,s3,"Check in ‚Äì First, the building is large and we walked a long way from the shuttle drop-off point to the front desk"
c50411,s4,"Signage is unclear, we were unsure where to go, lost a few times and finally found the check-in counter"
c50411,s5,"To our dismay, the queue to check-in is extremely long! We don‚Äôt expect this from a 5-star hotel"
c50411,s6,The area was crowded with people and very noisy
c50411,s7,The classy feel of a 5-star hotel was lost at that first sight
c50411,s8,"We are a family of 3, my husband, myself and our 18 month old boy"
c50411,s9,"While I joined the queue to check-in, there is no waiting lounge or couch around the lobby area for my husband and baby to sit and‚Ä¶"
c50412,s1,Horrible stay
c50412,s2,Save your money
c50412,s3,This hotel had the dirtiest breakfast buffet I have ever seen
c50412,s4,Also the service is far below the other hotels
c50412,s5,I will never stay at this property again
c50412,s6,Ask for non smoking king yet room smelled of smoke
c50412,s7,Overpriced should be a one star motel not even hotel rating
c50413,s1,"Keeping in mind this is the biggest Sheraton Hotel in the World, in a tourist hub like Macau, you clearly have to make certain concessions"
c50413,s2,"Clearly you're not going to get away from the crowds, nor should you really expect to, but certain things which could help aren't particularly thought out"
c50413,s3,The Sheraton Club for example is MASSIVE and there isn't a slight air of exclusivity - the dining area just feels like another hotel restaurant
c50413,s4,As a platinum SPG member I was upgraded to a very comfortable suite and the service was rather good
c50413,s5,I ordered an item from the daily menu after 11pm and the staff had no issue at all bringing it to me
c50413,s6,I think if TripAdvisor allowed half ratings this would be a 3
c50413,s7,5-May
c50414,s1,"Honestly, I cannot follow many of those who posted the review here on Tripadvisor"
c50414,s2,but so be it! I just stayed recently at it was most likely by far the worst experience I had in a so called 5* hotel over the past couple of years
c50414,s3,It starts already with the feeling of being a number instead a guest that you have to line up for check in
c50414,s4,that alone is already not 5* but the fact the the check in process is slow and many counters are not manned is another fact
c50414,s5,The check in was not organized at all and took over 10 minutes leaving the waiting time aside
c50414,s6,The staffs was not well trained neither customer oriented
c50414,s7,That the lobby has no charm as it is permanently overrun by game machines is a fact that you have to accept when you are in Macau
c50414,s8,The whole ambiance just feels odd
c50414,s9,‚Ä¶
c50415,s1,The hotel itself is pleasant but there's 1 issue with the room
c50415,s2,The shower area will flood while taking shower
c50415,s3,We request the hotel staff to check it in the morning while we are going out and they promised to check
c50415,s4,"But when we are back, it did not fix"
c50415,s5,We also did tried to call the servicing line but the phone was spoilt
c50415,s6,We're not able to call out
c50415,s7,So we left a note in the toilet to request them to fix it
c50415,s8,There's no response and not fix
c50415,s9,So we bare with it for the 4 nights we stayed there
c50416,s1,"The first time I stayed here is few months ago, which I just keep moving around, don't really have time to look up the hotel at all, but I got a good first impression back then"
c50416,s2,"The check in is fast, the lady upgrade me to suite and she was sweet and considerate, it got nothing to do with the elite status yet"
c50416,s3,"So few months later I returned and stay here for one night for the concert, it turned out to be a huge disappointment"
c50416,s4,"I arrived at 1800 and it's packed, due to the public holiday and mid-autumn festvial, the place is totally packed"
c50416,s5,"So I went to the SPG counter, the queue is long and there's only two staff at the counter, and they took ages to finish one check-in, one even keep chatting with the customers on and off"
c50416,s6,I was in a hurry to fresh up and go for the event
c50416,s7,‚Ä¶
c50417,s1,Stayed for 1N over the Mid-Autumn Festival
c50417,s2,Crowded time to be there but expected better from a 5 star hotel
c50417,s3,"The Good: -fast, efficient check-in for SPG members, same for check-out at club lounge  -fast, efficient service by housekeeping when attending to our requests given the size of the hotel"
c50417,s4,-nice large room -Special mention to Edmund Yong (hope I got your name correctly) at the Club lounge)
c50417,s5,Our luggage was sent mistakenly to Bell services even though we requested otherwise
c50417,s6,He went down with us and personally ensure everything was in order
c50417,s7,Thank you Edmund
c50417,s8,The Bad: -the so-called club lounge is the worst I have ever been
c50417,s9,zero exclusivity with a huge dining area which serves mediocre food
c50417,s10,which club lounge has such a big dining area where half the hotel guests seem to‚Ä¶
c50418,s1,Stayed for one night due to Bon Jovi concert ( across the road at the Venetian )
c50418,s2,This Sheraton claims it is the biggest Sheraton in the world and since they have so many rooms / visitors; they need to have system to match the crowd over the weekends
c50418,s3,Basically everything works like clock work ( impressive ) but food is disappointing ( bland )
c50418,s4,"Otherwise, sleep quality was good ( good bed ) but the mini fridge was locked and could not get a drink!"
c50419,s1,Check in and check out is way too slow (even on SPG only line)
c50419,s2,I am not sure why the hotel staffs need such a long time to complete a standard procedure
c50419,s3,"Swimming pool Jaya is close most of the time, disappointing since you pay full price but availability of some amenities are just half of the time"
c50419,s4,Shower head hose is leaking a lot
c50419,s5,"Positive points: very helpful room service, trying their best to help to provide alternative for baby crib (unfortunately unusable as the rail guard is set to lock and cannot be opened), provide plenty of extra drinking water bottles without much questions asked"
c50419,s6,Most staffs can speak English ok
c50419,s7,Room and hotel condition & cleanliness in general are good
c50419,s8,"Did not try the hotel restaurants, unfortunately dining options at the adjoining mall is‚Ä¶"
c50420,s1,"We booked to stay for my birthday, we were staying 2 nights here and then 2 nights in Hong Kong"
c50420,s2,"This was the 5th time we have stayed in Macau but the first time at the Sheraton, we were debating if we should try this hotel or stay in our favourite which is the Venetian Hotel and we made a big mistake picking this hotel"
c50420,s3,"We checked in fine, the receptionist was friendly, we loved the room so it was a good start"
c50420,s4,"However then the hotel had major issues with power outages, we had to get ready for dinner with no lights the first night, the next day (my birthday) the power went again in the afternoon, there were people stuck in lifts screaming and crying, others couldn't get into there room because the keycards weren't working"
c50420,s5,We came back around 2am and there was still no power‚Ä¶
c50421,s1,There are smoking rooms floor at this hotel but I don't smoke
c50421,s2,"The room was not worth that much money, probably because of weekend"
c50421,s3,The breakfast cost 217 HK$ at door and 179 HK$ at checkin
c50421,s4,The entertainment playground is rather small with limited tables
c50421,s5,It's better go there at day time with less players
c50422,s1,Well we were looking forward to  the all round Sheraton experience and we were very disappointed
c50422,s2,You can't check in until 1pm
c50422,s3,Then at 1pm they cattle que you in long ques
c50422,s4,Awful system
c50422,s5,Why you can't check in and do all the paperwork and then just grab your keys and bags later like in normal hotels I don't know
c50422,s6,Terrible experience
c50422,s7,The restaurant is the furthest area away from the rooms so breakfast is a march
c50422,s8,Set off 15mins before you're hungry
c50422,s9,Nothing is sign posted well except the shops and gambling
c50422,s10,Everything else you need to constantly ask for directions
c50422,s11,Good fitness and pool facilities
c50422,s12,Rooms are dated
c50422,s13,Breakfast is OK but nothing special
c50422,s14,It seems that the standard and service you get used to from these hotels elsewhere is not continued here Macau
c50422,s15,Venetian is‚Ä¶
c50423,s1,"Booked a Deluxe Suite as a SPG Gold member, unfortunately, when I arrived at the hotel at around 4pm, the room was not available yet, while the official standard check-in time is 3pm"
c50423,s2,"And, the front desk staff suggest me to go back at 7pm, without any compensation or temporary room"
c50423,s3,"It was so disappointing, this is the worst SPG property in the world, this is the third or fourth time I stay at this hotel, and I realized that the service quality at this hotel has been decreasing again and again"
c50423,s4,"Friends, you may want to try some other new hotels around, unless only paying for the name of Sheraton"
c50424,s1,Rooms are ok - what you would expect from a Sheraton
c50424,s2,The food options are pretty poor
c50424,s3,Italian restaurant is below average
c50424,s4,Even the Chinese restaurant is below average!!!  Pools are great - they serve better food there
c50424,s5,Although they close the bar/food way too early in the evening!!!  Worst thing is that it's located in Macau - a poor man's Vegas
c50424,s6,Doesn't have the soul or crowds that Vegas pulls
c50424,s7,Really quite disappointing
c50425,s1,"After a long flight and ferry across from HK, last thing needed was a 1/2 hr wait to check in"
c50425,s2,Only 2 staff at the counter ! gave up and wandered off to another part of the hotel and found a SPG only area where check in was swift and efficient
c50425,s3,Room was excellent with great views and good amenities
c50425,s4,Bed was comfortable Asked for a scissors and that did not arrive throughout my stay
c50425,s5,Full of people and looked more like a shopping mall than a hotel
c50425,s6,But that is true of all Macau hotels - wandered around the place as a lot of hotels are interconnected
c50425,s7,"Venetian , Conrad, Four Seasons all connected and easy to walk"
c50425,s8,Not sure if all Macau hotels are like this so cannot say how the Sheraton compares but certainly not up to the same standard in service as others I have stayed in‚Ä¶
c50426,s1,"Firstly, I arrived at 3pm to check in and there was a super long queue waiting to be checked in, but because I had to watch the Dancing Water show at 5:30pm, I would definitely be late if I waited to check in, so a hotel staff asked me to check in after the show to avoid waiting"
c50426,s2,"So I came back after the show, and what happened was we requested a room with king bed, but they said they ran out of room and can only offered us a 2xdouble bed bedroom and we were not happy with this arrangement at all"
c50426,s3,The hotel staff was not helpful and all they said was because they have too many people coming in since its a weekend and all the rooms are occupied and that's what they can only offer us
c50426,s4,The room was ok but the toilet towels looked dirty to me
c50426,s5,they seem black and old and I didn't‚Ä¶
c50427,s1,i try the suit room on club floor this time
c50427,s2,totally no luxury feeling inside the room as the materials used inside looks old
c50427,s3,the club floor is big that means many people will share the facilities also make me feel no premium added
c50427,s4,the location of the club floor also not convenience especially with same floor of the swimming pool
c50427,s5,many people wearing the bath robe wondering around
c50427,s6,"if i want a comfort relaxing holiday, i wont choose this hotel"
c50428,s1,I recently stayed at Sheraton  hotel for a birthday getaway which was ruined by an ATM eating my boyfriends bank card
c50428,s2,The staff there were not helpful in helping us try and get our card back and never offered to call the ATM phone number for us
c50428,s3,Instead they chose to stand around and watch us while they chatted amongst themselves
c50428,s4,We then had to go back to our hotel room to make phone calls to our banks to cancel the card in case it did miraculously pop out somehow and someone tried to use it
c50428,s5,We made a total of 4 international phone calls totaling 10mins to our bank to cancel the card
c50428,s6,Only when we 'express checked out' ( some young lady who was rude and basically shooed us away) we didn't get a receipt or anything to say our checkout was fine
c50428,s7,Only to find out a few days‚Ä¶
c50429,s1,First time to have to suffer the indignity of queuing 40-50pax deep just to checkin for our room
c50429,s2,Something that's not expected of a Sheraton property
c50429,s3,Had no idea when we made reservations that this hotel has a casino
c50429,s4,Hotel is far away from local shops
c50429,s5,"There are no convenience shops, not even a mini mart"
c50429,s6,You are forced to spend your money within the property
c50429,s7,"Macau island is a 30-50 bus ride away (depending on traffic and which service number), rides are fairly cheap, 3"
c50429,s8,2 to 6
c50429,s9,"2 MOP per trip, just look at the machine when you board, it should reflect the fare you have to pay"
c50429,s10,Make sure you have lots of coins
c50429,s11,Rooms are clean and comfortable
c50429,s12,Fridge in our room doesn't work
c50429,s13,Kudos to the housekeeping staff for a thoughtfully tidied room
c50429,s14,Breakfast options are‚Ä¶
c50430,s1,It's my second time in this hotel
c50430,s2,"As compared to last time, I have noticed that the hotel staff have become significantly less patient and friendly"
c50430,s3,The shuttle bus drivers shouted at passengers when they insisted boarding the bus even when it's full
c50430,s4,"The bell boy at the entrance pointed us the direction to the restaurant with an angry face, without saying a word"
c50430,s5,These are just two of the examples I experienced in my one night stay
c50430,s6,This is my second time in this hotel
c50430,s7,"As compared to last time, I noticed that the hotel staff have become significantly less friendly and patient"
c50430,s8,The shuttle bus driver shouted at passengers when they insisted boarding the bus even when it's full
c50430,s9,"The bell boy at the entrance pointed us the direction to the restaurant with an angry face, without‚Ä¶"
c50431,s1,Arrived via the free Taipa Ferry terminal shuttle bus to see a check in queue with at least 150 people in it
c50431,s2,We were moved to a group check in counter (even though there were only 2 of us) and we figured this would be like an express line
c50431,s3,It wasn't
c50431,s4,"Even with 3 staff on desks and only 2 people in front of us, we waited 45 minutes to reach the counter and then the check in process took about 10 minutes"
c50431,s5,It was just absurd
c50431,s6,It seems this hotel classifies you based on the price you paid for a room
c50431,s7,I got an advanced 30% off discounted rate months ago which meant I was allocated a room in the 'Earth Tower' and almost the very last room furthest from the lifts on that particular floor
c50431,s8,It was a ridiculously long walk to the entrance and even to the pool
c50431,s9,I don't understand why the‚Ä¶
c50432,s1,The issue was I entered to a room with welcome amenity that was with another guest name
c50432,s2,So i went back to reception and said they gave me a wrong room and asked them to change another room
c50432,s3,But then I got a room with strong ciegarette smell
c50432,s4,I chose not to go back to reception again since I was so tired
c50432,s5,"Upon checkout, I informed the recepionist regarding these"
c50432,s6,She told me maybe because someone smoked in this room before
c50432,s7,"(I understand this is not the fault from the hotel but the housekeeping should make sure room condition before selling to guest) Besides, I told her that no one offered welcome gift upon checkin"
c50432,s8,I asked if I could get the points now and she said okay (luckily i did ask)
c50432,s9,She also mentioned no room upgrade for this stay due to high occupancy but will offer‚Ä¶
c50433,s1,I spent 1 night from Sunday to Monday at Sheraton Hotel Macau and it was great ! I am not going to complain about the service and the room because everything are fabulous
c50433,s2,One thing that I dislike about the hotel is the crowd ! It was my 1st time seeing the queueing line like that with 20 front lines people just to do the check in
c50433,s3,I spent about 30 mins just to do the check-in which is unlikely happen when I stay at 5star hotel
c50433,s4,"So I guess, Sheraton is one of the most popular hotel among tourist from China and you just need to be ready with the crowd and don't expect to enjoy the swimming pool peacefully either ! Eventho' they have a lot of pools the amount of guest just unbelievable, you can't expect to do swimming properly unless you just want to dip ur feet in the pool"
c50433,s5,I‚Ä¶
c50434,s1,Just concluded our family bonding in Macau and we had satisfactory experience staying @ Sheraton
c50434,s2,"Though when we arrived, it's so crowded at the concierge and I'm feeling uneasy already due to the long cue lines waiting for our reservation to be serve"
c50434,s3,"Good, the room assigned to us was satisfactory to my standard"
c50434,s4,How I wished that reception area at the lobby were that spacious so as not to be bored while waiting for our room assignment
c50434,s5,The hotel lobby were eaten by the casino and since I have kids we me we have no options but to stand and wait
c50434,s6,"Good that when we arrived at our room, I felt so relax and at home"
c50434,s7,Overall passes to my preferred hotel stadard
c50435,s1,Conference visitor
c50435,s2,"Huge place, i mean HUGE ! I reckon my room was 15 mins fromthe Lobby"
c50435,s3,"Overall Everything perfectly adequate, if not outstanding"
c50435,s4,"Two observations : no ' tidy my room' sign, so room service can arrive anytime"
c50435,s5,"Romm tidy not to European standards - beds and towels, but not much else"
c50435,s6,"Secondly, the the room safe was  not fixed into the wardrobe, so you could pick up and steal the entire contents ( if you could leave the building)"
c50435,s7,"Pool very nice, food fine (but pricey)  and i couldn't find a communal lounge bar - which is critical if you are to attract a western audience"
c50435,s8,Shopping expensive
c50436,s1,I arranged a stay at this so called service oriented hotel for my sister as a present
c50436,s2,Made online reservation and fully pre-paid with my credit card
c50436,s3,"Confirmation received, the usual standard procedure, all good"
c50436,s4,My sister arrives and is told that unless she can produce the credit card that was used for payment she has to pay again! There goes the gift and surprise out of the window
c50436,s5,"True to their mission they have certainly delivered a 'memorable experience', unfortunately the wrong one altogether"
c50436,s6,As part of the booking they had my e-mail address as well as my mobile number
c50436,s7,"In addition the reservation was made in my sisters name and obviously with me paying with my credit card, the name is different"
c50436,s8,Lots of opportunity for them to address this with me before the stay if the‚Ä¶
c50437,s1,"Went in April 2015, disappointed in the room and hotel features"
c50437,s2,"The swimming pool was disappointing and one side with the jacuzzi was closed, which was secretly open, but the pools were not accessible"
c50437,s3,"We were dropped with their bus at one side, but had to walk with all our stuff trough the hotel to another counter"
c50437,s4,Don't get why this was
c50437,s5,"since the casino floors are like in the middle, you need to walk around the whole complex to get there if you are with kids, really terrible after a bouncy boat trip from Hong Kong"
c50437,s6,"To get to the breakfast restaurant we had to walk like 10 minutes every morning, service isnt great"
c50437,s7,I expected luxury but had to walk that much that I felt we could have better booked in a 4 star smaller hotel
c50437,s8,The rooms were OK but compared with other 5‚Ä¶
c50438,s1,We were stayed in these hotel for one night
c50438,s2,The booking was though the on line agent to reserve with reasonable price
c50438,s3,The price was including two breakfast
c50438,s4,The lobby was great and a lot of Chinese people walking around
c50438,s5,The Reception counter were separate four different areas for check-in
c50438,s6,The front desk staffs were helpful
c50438,s7,The hotel is separate into two towers
c50438,s8,The security guard will cross check in front of the entrance of lift lobby for those suspect people
c50438,s9,The room is fantastic but only think the front desk staff cannot put me to non smoking room king size bed
c50438,s10,The room is smelly
c50438,s11,The check out system is good as you can do by myself in the check out machine
c50438,s12,Although we already reserved the breakfasts but they can allow you to choose to take breakfast or lunch buffet
c50438,s13,‚Ä¶
c50439,s1,"Went there for only one night and while we understand that is really full of people, we were extremely disappointed by the lack of service and food at breakfast! We arrived at 10am! Still 30 mins before they closed the buffet and they had many items gone"
c50439,s2,"Went to get some eggs and first: the station is just so dirty and disorganised that you don't fancy eating there, and second, the chef, while really polite, couldn't understand what I meant by fried eggs!  Great point: the people at check in were really accommodating!"
c50440,s1,There are heaps of hotels in Macau
c50440,s2,Choosing  Sheraton was a family choice but personally I would not
c50440,s3,1
c50440,s4,U would choose Sheraton because u r member of the hotel group
c50440,s5,#NAME?
c50440,s6,2
c50440,s7,Outstanding service?
c50440,s8,( not all hotel the same) 3
c50440,s9,Value for money
c50440,s10,? ( only the club floor that is all your meals are there) For my family it's the above 3
c50440,s11,This trip we were upgraded to a suite so I should be thankful but the sofa bed that was supposed to be set up was not
c50440,s12,This was done after 3 calls and it was past midnight n half an hour later tt they did
c50440,s13,Bed springs was protruding
c50440,s14,Sigh! Anyway
c50440,s15,They give a rollaway the next night
c50440,s16,Discomfort settled
c50440,s17,Food in the club- amazing
c50440,s18,"Almost can be your breakfast, lunch cum dinner all in"
c50440,s19,Great value for money but alas u will not need to eat any‚Ä¶
c50441,s1,Stayed over the weekends with some friends and the service was one of the worst I have ever encountered
c50441,s2,"While the hotel looks ok, it was let down by its untrained staff"
c50441,s3,The checkin took almost half an hour even without a queue
c50441,s4,First of all they couldn't find my bookings
c50441,s5,"When they have found it after 10mins, the reception asked me if I want to have the rooms that I've booked to be on the same floor, but then proceed to give us rooms on different floors because ""it was busy"""
c50441,s6,"Finally, the staff said our checkout time could be extended to noon, but when I double checked the next morning, I was told it is 11am"
c50441,s7,All this and I never heard them apologizing and said a word of sorry
c50441,s8,Don't stay here if you want a relaxed holiday
c50442,s1,This is my 2nd time staying at this hotel
c50442,s2,Had to wait nearly an hour to checkin at the SPG counter
c50442,s3,Completely shocking! Realised later its due to slow checkin system
c50442,s4,We were also told to 1
c50442,s5,5hr for in room food service  Really unacceptable for a 4 star hotel
c50442,s6,It felt like Sheranton is under resourced to serve high volume of customers
c50442,s7,They do make it up with friendly smiles and initiatives to serve staff
c50442,s8,We were there for the pool party at hard rock and were given complimentary water proof pouches! That's exemplary! We also asked for many bottles of water which was promptly delivered to our rooms
c50443,s1,We stayed at the club floor
c50443,s2,Access to club lounge was great
c50443,s3,"Great variety of food and drinks served, although service was not great"
c50443,s4,Staff were not proactive in serving
c50443,s5,We need to ask for plates to be cleared or ask again and again for orders to be taken
c50443,s6,Room was small for Macau
c50443,s7,I was surprised by the even smaller bathroom
c50443,s8,Smallest shower stall I'd ever been in
c50443,s9,Service was bad
c50443,s10,Reception at the Club lounge on 4th floor was friendly but nothing spectacular
c50443,s11,Free welcome drink and cold towel was a nice touch
c50443,s12,Didn't even note my husband's birthday after looking at the passports
c50443,s13,"Glad that we didn't have to queue at the lobby, it looked extremely busy, almost market like"
c50443,s14,"When we requested for additional toiletries, had to call twice to remind"
c50443,s15,When the‚Ä¶
c50444,s1,"Positives: Good service from the staff; fairly decent fitness room with free weights, treadmills, cycles and machines; the one-bedroom suite was large with nice views; the rooms were fairly clean; the bed was very comfortable; many English speaking stations on the TV; the included internet was fast and not censored, which means I can check all blogs on my favorite teams"
c50444,s2,Negatives: It's a casino so you have a lot of people everywhere on the property; long lines at check-in and out; breakfast was plain and not all that good
c50445,s1,What we liked:  Good location
c50445,s2,#NAME?
c50445,s3,You can walk over to city of dreams to catch house of dancing waters
c50445,s4,You can easily walk over to the famous Venetian hotel
c50445,s5,#NAME?
c50445,s6,All hotels around that area seems to provide shuttle buses
c50445,s7,What we did not like:  -Strong kind of smell of detergent in the room
c50445,s8,"It was not pleasant, what's up with that! -You have to queue for so long to check in even on a weekday, we were quite surprised"
c50445,s9,"The place itself is damn crowded, we had to queue for 40 minutes"
c50445,s10,"-Customer service is alright, but unlike other Sheraton hotels we have been to before, everything seems to be done in a rush, but we can't really blame them, they have too many customers"
c50446,s1,"I stayed here together with my family , 12 of us this time"
c50446,s2,The experience is disappointing
c50446,s3,I am SPG member so we get to stay at higher floor of sky tower whereas my family who booked their rooms via hotel
c50446,s4,"com , ended up sending to earth tower which is old and not well maintained"
c50446,s5,"Not only that ,4 of the room are all in different floors!!   The worst part though , I found the water boiler in my room is completely mouldy"
c50446,s6,Sheraton in Macau is the worst comparing to any other countries I have been to
c50447,s1,Stayed in the family suite which is an awesome size and the kids loved the bunk bed and little extras like kids dressing gowns & slippers etc
c50447,s2,"However, no toys or books in the room and only Cartoon Channel available on TV"
c50447,s3,Kids are too young for playstation
c50447,s4,Gorgeous kiddy styled cabanas by the pool but no kids menu for food and drinks
c50447,s5,"No kid friendly restaurants either, they all have high chairs but no kids menus or portions"
c50447,s6,"Swimming pool is basic, no major kid features like slides or anything"
c50447,s7,Nothing else in the hotel that is super kid friendly other than Shrekfast (highly recommend) or possible shows/activities that you can book and pay for (tried Kung Fu Panda Academy but left early)
c50447,s8,"Warning on check in and out, takes a min of 20-30mins which is pretty painful when with‚Ä¶"
c50448,s1,"No way this is a five star hotel, dont have that welcome experience when check in and was told to find the bell boy our self to bring our luggates to our room"
c50448,s2,There were three of us in a room and only two of each provided
c50448,s3,We got drop off at the back entrance
c50448,s4,Its along way to the consiege
c50449,s1,Macau's 5-star hotels are too busy counting the cash to pick up the telephone's receiver so the wife had to book via the agent
c50449,s2,"Yes, agents still exist, albeit only just"
c50449,s3,The Sheraton it is
c50449,s4,She broke it to me gently
c50449,s5,"I review hotel chains globally for some part of my meagre living and yes, i am a huge fan of the dying art of hospitality which is why i admire some brands and not all"
c50449,s6,"Anyway, this is supposed to be about the Sheraton Macau and not about me"
c50449,s7,"Then again, that is arguable"
c50449,s8,"I am the Guest (remember what that is?) and were it not for me, hotels wouldn't live"
c50449,s9,"Anyway, it is a bright sunny day in Hong Kong and the lazy ferry coughs into life as we begin our glide toward's the former Portuguese enclave now a colony of sorts -- owned in huge part by casino moguls‚Ä¶"
c50450,s1,I am writing this letter to you to bring to your attention a problem I have had with a receptionist name Ann Seridan BarbaI who checked me in during my stay
c50450,s2,Allow me to elaborate
c50450,s3,I have been heart good name about Sheraton and have always appreciated the excellent customer service Sheraton offer
c50450,s4,Yet a recent unpleasant experience at your hotel has shaken my belief in Sheraton ability to provide top notch customer care all the time
c50450,s5,"I stayed in room 1-1609 of your Sheraton Macau hotel from June 9th to June 10th, checked in by a non eye contact, non greeting, ice cool receptionist name Ann Seridan BarbaI when 620pm"
c50450,s6,"When I walk close to reception counter, she was looking at the PC screen (which I hope that my face in on PC screen so that she will be able to looking at me)‚Ä¶"
c50451,s1,"Queue to checkin like disney land! being the worlds biggest hotel, i had to queue in a lane system much like a large themepark, when i finally got to the clerk, i was asked for a 300 USD depoit, i didnt have credit card or the HKD currecny which they requested, i then had to change USD to HKD at the hotels exchange rate and proceed"
c50451,s2,"Once my deposit ran out, they cut off all supplies such as Room service, Telephone use and even 2 USD movies in room"
c50451,s3,"Just a number here, if someone wants 5 star treatment, best go to a smaller hotel which isnt juggling 5000 guests"
c50452,s1,"Out of the three hotels at coati central, Sheraton Macao is perhaps the least impressive with their rooms"
c50452,s2,Rooms are generally spacious (so does holiday inn and Conrad) but the decoration is minimal at best
c50452,s3,Amenities are adequate but seemingly made cheaply
c50452,s4,"Undoubtedly their suites are much better, but given the price paid for, Holiday Inn does a better job than Sheraton"
c50452,s5,What they lack in their rooms make up with their restaurants and service though
c50452,s6,Sheraton has better restaurants (Xin and Bene) than what the other two competing hotels offer
c50452,s7,And the service and buffet at the club lounge are quite good
c50452,s8,Guests that are SPG members and/or have club access definitely have better service
c50452,s9,Would recommend this hotel if it is on a promotion
c50453,s1,"In reservation stage,  the staffs were being so helpful"
c50453,s2,"Reply my enquiry quickly and offer a spa package which includes upgrade to suite,  one way transfer and club lounge benefits etc"
c50453,s3,All I thought was I could finally find a hotel in Macau that provide good service
c50453,s4,My experience was just bad
c50453,s5,1
c50453,s6,Early check in was accomondate
c50453,s7,"But when I check in,  I asked the staff if I can have an air purifier"
c50453,s8,He said I could call from the room because he doesnt recommend to have the machine on when I am still in the room
c50453,s9,"I felt weird with his statement but when I got into the room,  the machine was there"
c50453,s10,2
c50453,s11,"After I enjoyed a relaxing Shine spa,  i was resting in my room"
c50453,s12,One staff broke into my room without ringing the bell or knock on the door
c50453,s13,The manager replied the‚Ä¶
c50454,s1,Like any other hotel
c50454,s2,Has positives and negatives
c50454,s3,Lets start with the positive  The price is excellent for a hotel in this location and services provided   The location is excellent
c50454,s4,And the hotel itself has all the amenities you need
c50454,s5,Nice casino
c50454,s6,The rooms are big and the bathrooms are roomy   The gym is very good and the swimming pool is fantastic   Lets start with the negative
c50454,s7,Its really shameful to have such slow Internet in a facility like this
c50454,s8,reminded me of the Dial ip Internet Era
c50454,s9,although its for free but super slow
c50454,s10,had to go to Vanetian mall or Four seasons mall to get a better Internet
c50454,s11,The allies on almost all floors smell of wet cloths
c50454,s12,The Lifts are hot as if you are in an oven
c50454,s13,Probably they forgot to put Air conditioning there
c50454,s14,‚Ä¶
c50455,s1,It must be quite an adventure to run a hotel
c50455,s2,"Many things can go right, many things can go wrong too"
c50455,s3,"And when things do, the hotel is presented with an opportunity to impress, or in my case, disappoint"
c50455,s4,My dear wife surprised me with a trip to Macau (my first) with a stay at the Sheraton Cotai
c50455,s5,"A lot has been covered by the other 2,568 reviews, and it is easy to write about the good things"
c50455,s6,"For me, the wifi was faster than expected, though only in the first room (more on this later), the room was spacious and clean, the bed was awesome thanks to its Sealy mattress"
c50455,s7,"However, one incident marred the whole experience"
c50455,s8,The power tripped just as my in-room dining appeared on the first night
c50455,s9,"The room was plunged in darkness, the air-conditioning disappeared"
c50455,s10,There was some light‚Ä¶
c50456,s1,The room is cozy in a reasonable price
c50456,s2,Spend my day mostly in casino
c50456,s3,The  Terrible buffet
c50456,s4,Feel like the food are already put in there for several days
c50456,s5,Food in the food court are not in good quality too
c50456,s6,Better just eat outside the hotel
c50456,s7,by the way the monitor I order from lounge next to the casino is just terrible terrible teribble
c50457,s1,I understand it is a holiday weekend and was not too perturbed by the forty minute wait to check in
c50457,s2,"However, when we finally got to the check-in counter, we were told there was no room available even though we had booked and paid months in advance"
c50457,s3,"After waiting an additional 30 minutes at the counter, we got our room as well as a 30% discount on dinner at The Feast"
c50457,s4,We head up to our room to find the TV isn't working
c50457,s5,We were told to wait and an 'engineer' would be there in fifteen minutes to fix the TV and we should wait in our room
c50457,s6,"After two hours of waiting and a few phone calls assuring us someone was on their way, we were told they'd change our rooms"
c50457,s7,Did they upgrade us for wasting our afternoon? Of course not
c50457,s8,"Instead, we were moved to a 'gambling floor' to a room‚Ä¶"
c50458,s1,"Having spent 2 nights here in 2013 and having had a fantastic time, and also being a SPG member due to the usual excellent Starwood experience, we decided to book the same type of room - the family suite in the sky tower"
c50458,s2,The drop in quality of the service and our overall experience has been unbelievable for a 5 star hotel
c50458,s3,"The worst element is the stench of cigarette smoke on the family floor, which seeps into the rooms"
c50458,s4,"While smoking is banned and I flagged to staff numerous times that people were smoking on our floor, the only thing that appeared to be done was spraying some deoderiser"
c50458,s5,it's outrageous that a supposed family floor is so polluted and my kids are exposed to the smoke
c50458,s6,We had reserved a suite for 2 adults and 3 kids with an extra bed
c50458,s7,We had email confirmation‚Ä¶
c50459,s1,My husband and I are staying here with our toddler son
c50459,s2,"There are some real positives to this place, but I've felt 'annoyed' too many times during this 3-night trip to give it anything more than an a average review"
c50459,s3,Let's start with the positives
c50459,s4,"Firstly, I was impressed with the room"
c50459,s5,We're in a good sized suite with 1
c50459,s6,"5 bathrooms, and the room is in good condition"
c50459,s7,This is the place's greatest strength
c50459,s8,"I also like the fact that I snagged a good deal on their website (buy 2 nights get one free), so the price was very reasonable"
c50459,s9,That's another big plus
c50459,s10,Now for the frustrations
c50459,s11,"To start, I requested a baby cot and non smoking on my booking"
c50459,s12,"Because I've had enough experience to know that these things get overlooked on bookings, I called the day before departure to check‚Ä¶"
c50460,s1,"I found it hard to believe that a well known hotel like Sheraton does not carry charger for iPhone! I always thought that it's the little thing that shows you care! Other than that, the room is big and although I chose a smoking room, but I don't feel there's any odour in the room and that's a PLUS!"
c50461,s1,"Need to line up an hour for check in, staff service was terribly slow and the worst was they even made an error on written down room no to us"
c50461,s2,When we went up to the room and got failure to go in after trying all room key
c50461,s3,"We had to go down to lobby again for checking what wrong happened, the staff just said he wrote wrong no on the envelop of room keys"
c50461,s4,It is unbelievable this is service from SPG
c50461,s5,The even worst was when we went wash room and saw the toilet had not been cleaned
c50461,s6,"We had to help house keeping even for flushing, this was the first time of experience we had"
c50461,s7,"In fact if the hotel is not experience enough to handle so many visitors, they should not promote ss frequent like that"
c50461,s8,This is just treating !!!!!!!
c50462,s1,"Staying more than a hundred nights per year in various hotels around the globe, it is clear that not always things go smoothly and wherever humans are involved problems occure"
c50462,s2,Nevertheless the experience I made in this hotel was one of the worst which ever happened to me in many years
c50462,s3,"Woke up after 3h of sleep due to huge noise of hotel personell in the corridor, caused by laughing, loud talking, shouting"
c50462,s4,"Roused out of sleep, went out and asked the people politely to please be more silent"
c50462,s5,"Nothing changed, 30 min more of loud noise"
c50462,s6,"Went out again, asked them again"
c50462,s7,"Another hour of the same noise, nothing changed"
c50462,s8,Called at the guest service
c50462,s9,Explanation: police went there to check another guest
c50462,s10,"My comment: strangely it was not the police who made that noise, it was the‚Ä¶"
c50463,s1,We stayed at a club room some time ago and were impressed
c50463,s2,"So, we chose to come to this hotel again at club room again to celebrate our child's birthday"
c50463,s3,We checked in at the club lounge and were asked to pay for my child's use of the lounge
c50463,s4,"Fine, they already told me when I requested an extra bed for my child by email"
c50463,s5,No need so many reminders
c50463,s6,We got our room and did not find an extra bed even though we checked in after 5pm
c50463,s7,We need to ask again
c50463,s8,We went to the lounge for pre- dinner drinks
c50463,s9,The dining area was extremely cold and the food  cold too
c50463,s10,We could not stay long
c50463,s11,"Again, we were asked to sign for my child use of the lounge"
c50463,s12,"Luckily, we got the extra bed in the evening"
c50463,s13,A small cake was also sent to our room around 9:30 (isn't it a bit late?) by someone who basically‚Ä¶
c50464,s1,Thank you for Sheraton Macau giving me such a 'extremely terrible' experience to enjoy a 5 star  hotel service
c50464,s2,I book a room under the name of Ms
c50464,s3,Shen in Sheraton Macau at 23rd April
c50464,s4,I arrived your hotel around 11:00
c50464,s5,I understand that the check in time is at 3pm so i decided to leave the luggage in the concierage
c50464,s6,"When I approached concierage desk, one of the concierage associate said he couldn't find my reservation"
c50464,s7,I am definitely sure I have made the reservation in Sheraton Macau but i don't know why your staff kept challenging and arguing with me said there is no my reservation even I provided them my confirmation number
c50464,s8,"And also, he even tell me to settle the problem by myself"
c50464,s9,imagine if you are coming here for a business trip with only a very short time to take‚Ä¶
c50465,s1,Where do I begin
c50465,s2,I showed up at 4 to check in with platinum spg in a suite
c50465,s3,Room was not available
c50465,s4,Humm
c50465,s5,Even though check out is 1pm
c50465,s6,Okay
c50465,s7,Room available at 5
c50465,s8,Then I went to a nice concert at the venician
c50465,s9,Came back to order room service but no menu in the room
c50465,s10,I call to get a menu
c50465,s11,A guy came buy 20 minutes later to check there was not a menu in the room
c50465,s12,10 minutes later he brought a menu to the room
c50465,s13,Then we ordered food abd was told 40 minute wait
c50465,s14,Seriously? I ended up eating a bag of pretzels from the mini bar in the executive suite as they have No idea what a basis service means
c50465,s15,I will never come back to this hotel
c50465,s16,Think twice about coming to this hotel as a platinum member
c50466,s1,"I booked a room on 25 Apr for a birthday party, I contact Guest Relations a month ago for the set up and arrangement and everything claimed to be settled even when I was at the check in counter"
c50466,s2,Well
c50466,s3,"when I stepped into my room, nothing was set up, my balloons and flowers were not there as if the communication for the past month was an illusion"
c50466,s4,"I called and check, they kept saying ""we did the set up, are there really nothing in the room"""
c50466,s5,Oh come on
c50466,s6,"finally after a few calls and some wait time when I was so in a hurry to get the room fixed for the party, they came back to me saying that they did set up the room but it was not the room that they checked me in"
c50466,s7,"Ridiculous enough?! Alright, so they brought all the stuff back to my room and the party went on"
c50466,s8,I turned‚Ä¶
c50467,s1,"They have too many customers, i cant expect anything"
c50467,s2,"the worst part is, a male non local staff was very rude to us in the lift! He should explain to us that we couldnt just wear swimming suit in the lift! however, he just closed the door!! Too many people so the pool seems dirty"
c50467,s3,can hear people talking outside in the room
c50467,s4,"i dont think i will go back again, because in macau at this price, i could have alot of better choices!"
c50468,s1,Came back to the hotel on March 7th for a quick weekend getaway with some good friends
c50468,s2,I had recommended this place due to my positive experience last time despite having some hiccups here
c50468,s3,"Last time, I thought it was due to the hotel being relatively new, so the staff probably needed some time to get acquainted"
c50468,s4,"This time, it felt like the quality of staffing was much worse"
c50468,s5,"For starters, the ""platinum check in"" area was run by inefficient staff - our party checking into 4 rooms on three reservations took the agent over 20 minutes to handle"
c50468,s6,"Granted, its three different reservations, but I think hotel employees should realize that (platinum) member will be waiting for check in and call in backups to handle"
c50468,s7,It didn't happen
c50468,s8,We decided to have an early breakfast on one of‚Ä¶
c50469,s1,"From the beginning, there is a massive queue, worth 20 min, for check in"
c50469,s2,This is the first time I have experienced this at a good reputed hotel
c50469,s3,The room is large and clean
c50469,s4,"I was happy to see a recycle bin in the room but seeing how the hotel flaunts its plastic wrapped utilities etc, you can tell that Sheraton is not serious about it's environmental responsibilities"
c50469,s5,In room dining was a disaster
c50469,s6,Ordered some food which I had and threw up 5min after
c50469,s7,The meal cost me almost 80usd and I slept sick and hungry
c50469,s8,"Next morning put a complaint in, and the staff came in with apologies and a review form"
c50469,s9,We filled the form and staff promised to get back to me by email about the outcome of the investigation
c50469,s10,I doubt they will find anything to jeopardize their own hotel
c50469,s11,As a‚Ä¶
c50470,s1,Overall good experience
c50470,s2,Nice location
c50470,s3,inside walking way to casinos of venetian and other hotels
c50470,s4,Room was spacious   Buffet breakfast was good menu variety with Indian food also
c50470,s5,Shuttle service to fairy terminal
c50471,s1,Stayed here for one night for a day trip to Macau
c50471,s2,The hotel - was fine
c50471,s3,Its much like a large conference hotel
c50471,s4,"You can tell by the large hallways, massive rooms and the fact you have to walk about 15 minutes from the elevator to find the pool"
c50471,s5,"Hotel itself, if you are here to just sun by the pool - is fine"
c50471,s6,"Its a nice hotel, but its not special"
c50471,s7,You are one of 2000++ people here who are all very much about themselves
c50471,s8,"We used the SPG Club while here, which I am told is the largest in the world"
c50471,s9,It was PACKED with families with children
c50471,s10,Its not relaxing and to try and work here would be a nightmare
c50471,s11,They do drinks from 5pm - which must have 300 people at it
c50471,s12,"Its a large club yes, but the amount of people who bring their children with them is insane"
c50471,s13,It really should‚Ä¶
c50472,s1,"All hotels in Macau have the gimmicks - Venetian has it's Venice, Grand Lisboa has it's art collection, Wynn has it's tree of prosperity and dragon, and Sheraton has it's Dreamworks"
c50472,s2,"Can it have a recall factor for it 's guests? For a first time visitor, it is nice to see the characters"
c50472,s3,We had booked a club room and the club lounge was excellent
c50472,s4,The food was excellent and compliments to the chef
c50472,s5,Was disappointed that the room showed it's age - the bell sticker was peeling and inspite of staying for 3 days was not repaired or glued
c50472,s6,The rooms was not cleaned till 445 pm and had to be called for
c50472,s7,"Also,unlike Galaxy the bus connections were limited"
c50472,s8,I have stayed in many properties but was the first time that the Conceirge charged 1 HkD extra to post a postcard( we had bought‚Ä¶
c50473,s1,I received an email from their General Manager on April 9 and the email stated that I reserved a room from April 12 to 13 and I replied I didn't but there was no reply
c50473,s2,"Just now, April 13, they sent me another email to ask me to rate their hotel here"
c50473,s3,"Two years ago while I stayed in this hotel, I was mad by the poor services, no invoice after a month, wrong billings and etc"
c50473,s4,Now I could only pray they won't charge my credit card or my starwood points
c50474,s1,Not the ideal places to stay if you want to visit the cultural side of Macau
c50474,s2,"Very generic and uniform rooms, great for a family stay if you would like to spend most of your time at the casino or shopping"
c50474,s3,"Pool was lovely, nice idea to have choice between lap/spa pools or kids pool (however adults pool closes early)"
c50474,s4,"Check in was advised to be 3pm, however, was advised that they had over booked and room would not be ready for at least an hour (unless we would accept a twin room over a queen), I was not impressed as I had booked over 5 months ago and was not my problem if they had over booked for the easter period"
c50474,s5,Free wifi was useful and appreciated
c50474,s6,"Due to the size of the hotel, services are quick and dismissive but gets the job done"
c50474,s7,View of pools and lights of the‚Ä¶
c50475,s1,"The Sheraton in Macao has very nice, well equipped and spacious suites"
c50475,s2,The breakfast buffet in the Club Lounge is rather average
c50475,s3,The highest improvement can however be achieved by working on the service attitude of the employees in the Sheraton club
c50476,s1,We walked in to checkin counter where one of the front line staff was talking in rudely to one of the hotel guests
c50476,s2,"It seemed for me like, the guy was staying in Sheraton as if it were the only hotel"
c50476,s3,Hotel should train staff on handling guest better
c50476,s4,The rooms were nice and clean but nothing special to comment on
c50476,s5,The Nepalese security guards in the hotel were very helpful
c50476,s6,"If I visit Macau again, I will not choose Sheraton"
c50477,s1,This is a big hotel with 3000 plus room
c50477,s2,"When I check in from the ground floor , I have to wait for an hour ??? Even I am SPG member"
c50477,s3,It does not help even they have SPG counter there
c50477,s4,"Until is my turn check it , she told me to go up to the club lounge for check in ??? Why waited for an hour and told me to proceed another location ??? When I ask them earlier she say is the right place to check in with SPG member"
c50477,s5,So I get into the line
c50477,s6,!! What a crap
c50477,s7,Finally I got my suite room and check it
c50477,s8,It was more than 2 hours
c50477,s9,The room is very new with fresh carpet glue smell
c50477,s10,The layout and design is good
c50477,s11,One of the best of all other sheraton property
c50477,s12,But the service is so bad and they could not control well at all
c50477,s13,It had 3 block and most of the guest ms are‚Ä¶
c50478,s1,"With 4000 rooms and full occupancy for the Easter weekend, this place wasa heaving"
c50478,s2,"And being interconnected with the bigger complax that is the Cotai Strip, the largest Sheratobn in the world feels like no other Starwood property"
c50478,s3,"We took a Club Floor room and, to be honest, you are almost getting an all-inclusive package: all you can eat breakfast and 2 hours of drinks and food in the early evening means that you dont really have to put your hand in your pocket"
c50478,s4,"Staff were great, transportation from the ferry port was easy, never had to wait long for taxis, this place is great of all you want to do is gawp, gamble or shop"
c50478,s5,"But, it lacked adequate restaurants unless you wanted the food court or mass production (there is an Italian which, I admit, we didn't try) and there is‚Ä¶"
c50479,s1,"The Sheraton Macau sits opposite the Venetian, owned by Sands"
c50479,s2,So it's a good place to stay if u want to be close to the Venetian but not be swamped by the large crowds over there
c50479,s3,"The Sheraton is one of three hotels occupying a huge mall development called the Sands Cotai Central, also owned by Sands"
c50479,s4,The other two hotels are Conrad and the Holiday Inn
c50479,s5,"Each of these hotels are not small, each having more than 1000 rooms each, with the Sheraton being the largest of the three"
c50479,s6,"Price wise, it is cheaper than Conrad but more expensive than the Holiday Inn"
c50479,s7,It provides two shuttle services
c50479,s8,One to the Macau ferry terminal and other to The Galaxy Hotel
c50479,s9,"From Galaxy hotel, there are shuttles to other points of interest like the Border"
c50479,s10,U can also walk about 15 mins to the Tapa‚Ä¶
c50480,s1,I arrived at Sheraton with great expectations
c50480,s2,Having booked a great deal for their deluxe suite I was really looking forward to the stay
c50480,s3,Unfortunately my experience at the SPG counter completely ruined any good feelings of this hotel
c50480,s4,I made my way to the separate check in section where I was met with an extremely rude bouncer like attendant surnamed Yang who blocked my entry with a rope
c50480,s5,He said check in? Go over there and pointed to the regular check in counter
c50480,s6,I told him I was SPG and he actually asked me you are SPG with a very disbelieving tone
c50480,s7,I told him yes I am (a second time!) and he asked me to produce my SPG card which I have never received
c50480,s8,I said you can check my booking
c50480,s9,I don't have my card
c50480,s10,"To which he replied this place is full, go to the regular check‚Ä¶"
c50481,s1,We stayed a this property as we were part of a birthday group
c50481,s2,There is nothing intimate or subtle about the property which one would expect from Macau
c50481,s3,Thank goodness we are Starwood Gold which made the check in process quick and easy
c50481,s4,"We stayed in a suite which was spacious, the decor was standard"
c50481,s5,"The Club was huge and an awful experience, the food was tasteless"
c50481,s6,The property is a stones throw from the shopping centre so if you're there for the shopping it's an easy walk
c50482,s1,Just stayed 4 Conference days at the Sheraton
c50482,s2,Met at Macau ferry and complimentary transfer to Cotai - excellent As a Preferred Guest we were checked in seamlessly and given a great room on 24the floor overlooking pool
c50482,s3,"Room size, bed comfort and room features all excellent"
c50482,s4,The gym and pool areas all excellent
c50482,s5,Change facilities all excellent
c50482,s6,Our major problem was the value of food and drink to our lower valued Australian dollar
c50482,s7,When a hotel coffee shop charges over AUD 40 for coffee and an average tuna sandwich you know that eating at this hotel is going to be a problem
c50482,s8,All speciality restaurants are to our budget far too costly
c50482,s9,The hotel does have a MacDonald's and a Pacific Coffee venue for that type of product
c50482,s10,On the top retail floor of the Sky Tower they have an‚Ä¶
c50483,s1,Recently attended an educational conference here
c50483,s2,"The hotel has great facilities including the usual amenities, spa, swimming pool, shopping malls galore, plus the expected casino"
c50483,s3,"However, there is little to do in Macau except for gambling, so if this is not your motive expect to be bored"
c50483,s4,"With the exception of a very small old town, you will struggle to find the 'real'  Macau amongst of the glitter, tackiness and excessive lights and sparks"
c50484,s1,Nice large rooms
c50484,s2,Housekeeping lacking
c50484,s3,"Everything --like with all other hotels on the cotai strip, or indeed all casino-attached hotels, for that matter-- is casino/gambling-oriented and the rest of the services are only secondary: restaurants serve good food but service is abominable, there are no bars, the hotel lounge closes at ungodly early hours,"
c50484,s4,"Besides the gambling & possible shopping experience, there's nothing that would attract business people in particular"
c50484,s5,"The friendliness of the staff is also below par, but that is probably to be expected with the millions of guests coming thru the doors"
c50484,s6,Probably comparable to other cotai strip hotels
c50485,s1,I'm not 1st time stay at Sheraton
c50485,s2,But I would prefer stay at Conrad in the past due to room and service is better than there
c50485,s3,But I and my hubby are also have good stay at this time then will try to come again at next vocations
c50485,s4,"Furthermore need to appreciate to Sheraton hotel, they have provide quick check in and out for SPG MEMBER"
c50485,s5,We're no need spend too much time with the tourist to get out room
c50485,s6,thank you!  But we were happen a little thing during our 2nd nite
c50485,s7,The staff was overlooked to clean up our room until we back to our room at mid nite to calling up front to clean it up
c50485,s8,Hopeless
c50486,s1,"In order to make the review easier to deal with, I will split it into several parts: 1"
c50486,s2,Overall 2
c50486,s3,Room 3
c50486,s4,Service 4
c50486,s5,Food 5
c50486,s6,Location  1
c50486,s7,Overall impression
c50486,s8,"We have decided to book that particular hotel because they gave quite a good offer for the time period we were going to stay, it was roughly 150USD/night with breakfast and ""all-day"" snacks included into the price"
c50486,s9,"Hotel has a free shuttle bus service from Macau Taipa Ferry, which was particularly convenient for us(we've arrived from Shenzhen, China by boat)"
c50486,s10,"The bus takes literally 5-10 minutes to get from the ferry to the hotel, which was awesome"
c50486,s11,"Now, in order to make it fair, I'd have to really clarify things before I go any further"
c50486,s12,Our trip has taken place right before Lunar(aka Chinese) New Year in February‚Ä¶
c50487,s1,"Rooms are nice and very comfortable, but despite being reasonably new there are a few issues - the bath wouldn't plug so wouldn't retain water, a few standard amenities were missing and the entire (non-smoking) floor stunk of cigarettes, even inside the room"
c50487,s2,"I liked the staff very much, they were very helpful and took care of any issues and requirements"
c50487,s3,"Used the lounge, the free alcohol was very nice and generously served, the food is not bad but a little variable"
c50488,s1,Sheraton lives up to its name and its a beautiful property
c50488,s2,The rooms are spacious and well laid out
c50488,s3,So as far as hotel quality goes full marks to Sheraton
c50488,s4,However the staff leaves much to be desired
c50488,s5,We took almost 3 HRS to check in(agreed we were a large group but 3 hours is a lot)
c50488,s6,"The bfast staff was, putting it gently, uncourteous"
c50488,s7,However the house keeping staff was super
c50488,s8,So if u leave aside a few irritants its a super property
c50488,s9,They have a heated pool and a good gym and free WiFi
c50488,s10,Overall it was a decent experience
c50489,s1,We stayed here (3 ppl) for one night
c50489,s2,On check in I was told there were only 2 single beds and was not advised these were actually king singles
c50489,s3,I explained we were three as per booking and did they expect us to sleep two to one bed and the word single is for one and she said yes
c50489,s4,They said I van have another bed at extra cost and after some discussion said it would be free
c50489,s5,On arriving in the room I realised it was a king single so cancelled the other bed
c50489,s6,Overall as this place is so big with connecting walkways to three other hotels I feel the care you expect of paying what it costs to stay here is lost with so  many people and so a massive place
c50489,s7,Would I stay again no
c50490,s1,I stayed here for 8 nights
c50490,s2,The services was bad
c50490,s3,The bedsheets was only changed on the 3rd n 6th day
c50490,s4,The bathroom amenities was not daily replenished
c50490,s5,The pen n paper was not replenish as well
c50490,s6,The slippers was also not replenish as well
c50490,s7,The toilet roll given only on alternate days n the what pisses me off was the soap bar n shower n shampoo not given daily
c50490,s8,The free water bottle from 4 to 2
c50490,s9,I mean i PAY for 8nights but was duly shortchanged by the hotel
c50490,s10,To people who going to book this hotel
c50490,s11,do remember the hotel is in a shopping center n the human traffic is really horrendous
c50490,s12,Chaotic at the checkin n checkout counter
c50490,s13,Cos though there is a  que line but jumping que by people is so annoying
c50490,s14,Hopeless hotel staff at the reception who dare not stop those que jumping‚Ä¶
c50491,s1,Stayed for 2 nights at the executive suite of this hotel
c50491,s2,We had stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel on our previous visit but I wanted to earn some SPG points on my loyalty card
c50491,s3,Had access to Sheraton's club lounge which is huge compared to the other club lounges I've been to
c50491,s4,The breakfast buffet at this club lounge was a full spread and not like the other club lounges where you'd tend to get a very limited buffet spread
c50491,s5,"Although it came with free WIFI, the connection was spotty and slow"
c50491,s6,The location is great for shopping and there are many restaurants at the attached shopping mall
c50491,s7,We stayed on the 15th floor and trying a find an elevator that took us to our floor was like trying to play hide and seek
c50491,s8,This is a massive hotel and has dedicated elevators to certain floors
c50491,s9,‚Ä¶
c50492,s1,The hotel is not at the city centre but we knew this
c50492,s2,Shuttle bus runs to the city centre from the nearby hotels but there are always many people
c50492,s3,Twice we needed to get a taxi which was not expensive
c50492,s4,This Sheraton was quite a disappointment considering the standard of service of Starwood hotels
c50492,s5,Too too many people that took us long time to check in even at the spg reception
c50492,s6,We understand the hotel is big and you expect the number of guests to be huge but they could manage it better
c50492,s7,At the reception the personnel was friendly though we could have a better room
c50492,s8,We asked if our room was nice and on a high floor and we received a promising reaction from the receptionist
c50492,s9,"In the end, we were not on a very high floor and also the view of our room was blocked by the other hotel‚Ä¶"
c50493,s1,I would rather pay more to stay at other hotel or pay less staying with non-reputable hotel chain which provides professional service to their hotel guests
c50493,s2,"Given the reputable Sheraton hotel chain, I have decided to stay 2 nights at Sheraton Macao Hotel, Cotai Central"
c50493,s3,As a Starwood Preferred Guest (SPG) I received an email from the front office prior to my arrival date
c50493,s4,The email consists of check-in instructions for SPG member and I have to reply the email indicating my room preferences
c50493,s5,One of the questions asking for bed type and the options are king/twin bed/no preference
c50493,s6,I have booked a room for 4 pax and the expected bed setting is 2 twin beds
c50493,s7,"Having said so, given the option I replied asking for king bed"
c50493,s8,"Upon arrival, I went to the express check-in services to‚Ä¶"
c50494,s1,We booked a room for 2 nights stay here through an airline promotion
c50494,s2,Access to property is rather straightforward from the ferry terminal - a free shuttle
c50494,s3,"As we were there over the Christmas season, it was full of people and check-in took a bit of time but staff were generally helpful, especially the lady at the Concierge"
c50494,s4,"She takes time and make an effort to give us directions, map and our options on the ferry sailings"
c50494,s5,"Food and shops are easily accessible from the Hotel, although this particular one is about 15 mins stroll from the main activity area at The V"
c50494,s6,"Room-wise, it was on the 28th floor and very spacious"
c50494,s7,Amenities-wise are what one would expect from a hotel chain of this standard
c50494,s8,Good sleep quality with the bed
c50494,s9,Did not eat at the hotel so no comments about‚Ä¶
c50495,s1,"Traveling with my toddler, we were very tempted by the wonderful kid's activities listed on the hotel website"
c50495,s2,"Unfortunately, we were greatly misled"
c50495,s3,NONE of the activities were open during the period we were there
c50495,s4,"The tooted heated kid's friendly pool was more like the size of a hot tub, there were so many adults  in the very small area soaking that we were immediately turned off as a hygenique place for toddlers to have fun"
c50495,s5,"As listed on the hotel website:  ~ ""The hotel offers plenty of children‚Äôs activities in the hotel, from cookie decorating, aerobics, and a pool treasure hunt to recycled art making and weekend movie nights on the Sala Pool deck"
c50495,s6,Our pools and array of recreation facilities guarantee memorable family fun
c50495,s7,""" ~   We were excited that Dreamworks have taken‚Ä¶"
c50496,s1,"It's probably too big - as a result everything is too far away and there are far too many people at check-in, check-out, and everything takes forever"
c50496,s2,They should have done what Galaxy Casino did and that is to make each of the hotels small so that it is easier to manage
c50496,s3,The hotel itself is not bad - rooms are good sized and you see the hallmark of a Sheraton everywhere
c50497,s1,"I booked with Sheraton Macau for Dec 30, 2014 - Jan 3, 2015 for New Years with my family"
c50497,s2,I and my wife also like gambling a bit
c50497,s3,We had 6 rooms in all
c50497,s4,I always stay in the club floor when I travel for obvious reasons
c50497,s5,But I couldn't believe what happened to us in The Sheraton Club Floor
c50497,s6,"On our first day, my daughter and her hubby approached a male staff for some information"
c50497,s7,"When they were in front of him, he simply looked at them and left without a word"
c50497,s8,"Upon investigation, we learned that he is Joao Collado, Club Floor Manager"
c50497,s9,"On the second night of our stay, I and another daughter entered the club floor a few minutes before 7pm"
c50497,s10,"The female staff asked us the usual ""room number pls"" and told us to come in"
c50497,s11,"However, a man who turns out to be the same Joao Collado blocked‚Ä¶"
c50498,s1,"This hotel is 1 of 3 hotels, Sheration/Conrad/Holiday Inn, which are part of the Sands Cotai Central mega complex"
c50498,s2,"I've tried staying for the first time to try to escape the monster crowds at The Venitian, but as it turned out, the experience is not much different"
c50498,s3,Check-in lines are long as in an airport
c50498,s4,"More than 10 minute walk from reception to room, or from room to a restaurant or to anywhere, because this is such a huge complex with endless hallways and corridors"
c50498,s5,The deco and design average and not as memorable as The Venitian or Wynn Macau or Banyan Tree
c50498,s6,"The swimming pools are scattered in to several small pools, instead of 1 big pool"
c50498,s7,The service is decent
c50498,s8,"But lack the personal touches, since this is such a huge huge complex"
c50498,s9,The shopping center is a grand‚Ä¶
c50499,s1,This was my third time I stayed at the Sheraton Macau
c50499,s2,"The first time was during its opening, when front-of-house staff was still green to their service"
c50499,s3,The second time was average
c50499,s4,"Yet the third time, which was just after Christmas this year, was really deteriorating"
c50499,s5,"I had booked a three-day package which included free return jetfoil tickets, breakfast or lunch for two on both days, free lunch for two persons, and MOP400 shopping coupon"
c50499,s6,"The queue was very long at around 4pm, and my family was greeted by a Mr, Huang"
c50499,s7,"During check-in, he was always chatting with his colleague on his left side, probably having problems with her guest, and the guest on his right side could not find his reservation and was making a complaint"
c50499,s8,The whole check-in process took more than 15‚Ä¶
c50500,s1,"I had to walk a mile to get to my room, and another mile to the casino"
c50500,s2,"I wanted to gamble, but all of the ATM machines were out of money so I went to bed"
c50500,s3,"Arrived today, leaving tomorrow, which is not soon enough"
c50500,s4,This hotel does not represent the Starwoods brand very well
c50500,s5,I think it is designed to serve people who do not know any better
c50501,s1,"I had been booked five room night in Sheraton Macau last week, which is SPG Hot Escape rate, prepaid, non-refundable rate"
c50501,s2,Payment was settled before my stay and confirmed everything is fine
c50501,s3,"However, beyond check out, my roommate would like to settle the bill by himself and told the front service agent cencel my payslip and charge his credit card, unbelievable the service agent really do so! I told the agent while check in and confirmed agagain the rate is non-refundable, how come this evidence still happened? And I call their guest commend centre, the service agent there argue with me, told me that I were lack of communication with my roommate! I never expected a five star hotel Gove out this kind of services, and they still argue with me they were right! I completely mad with‚Ä¶"
c50502,s1,Booked deluxe twin room for our stay
c50502,s2,"Besides the usual expected of Sheraton n a very helpful housekeeping staff on duty on 11 & 13 Dec, service of staff whom I encountered was a disappointment"
c50502,s3,1
c50502,s4,Hotel prepared birthday cake for my son which was much appreciated
c50502,s5,"However it came without a knife nor candle, not to mention matchsticks"
c50502,s6,It took an hour before I received all 3 items
c50502,s7,2
c50502,s8,Housekeeping did not tidy up toiletries at shower area 2 days in a row
c50502,s9,3
c50502,s10,"SPG checkout area, ramp entrance was closed n I struggled to remove the barrier with staff watching"
c50502,s11,"At reception, when staff asked for feedback, I related incident but receptionist did not apologize for bad service at all?! No need to say more, the above is not acceptable for the price I paid for a stay at Sheraton"
c50503,s1,"Normally staying at a Sheraton hotel (or any of its competitors such as Hilton, Marriott, etc"
c50503,s2,) can prove to be a sublime experience
c50503,s3,Everything smells of mildew mixed with basic cleaning fluids
c50503,s4,That's exactly how this Sheraton was
c50503,s5,"Because Sheraton Cotai is part of the Sands Cotai complex, one would expect it to be much better"
c50503,s6,But Sheraton proves that reputations do matter
c50503,s7,Here is the review
c50503,s8,Positives + Absolutely clean room
c50503,s9,We had a two-bedroom suite that was kept in clean condition and definitely much better than what we were expecting from Sheraton + We had a suite and the dual bedrooms which were also very well laid out + The hotel's location in Cotai is very close to the Venetian Cotai and features lots of casinos and other entertainment within walking distance +‚Ä¶
c50504,s1,This is a nice hotel-we got a good deal and the rooms were large
c50504,s2,"But the 3900 rooms means queues:at check in/checkout, at breakfast,at the lift etc"
c50504,s3,There are queues & crowds everywhere
c50504,s4,Its hard to have a memorable experience at such a crowded hotel
c50505,s1,"The welcome letter in the room starts with ""welcome to the World's Largest Sheraton (yes each word is Capitalized)"
c50505,s2,and that's because it's BIG
c50505,s3,As you know Macau in a Las Vegas on steroids and this place in no exception to that    Big difference is the Small Service (notice the Capitalization) they offer
c50505,s4,Check in is a disaster with long queues (and I am a premium Starwood member) - and if you succeed to find anybody working here - then you have won at the casino
c50505,s5,In fact same chances I bet
c50505,s6,"Rooms are nice and bathrooms ""plush"", bedding is superb"
c50505,s7,Call it a 5 star if you want - I give it a 3 and 7/8 and a 1 for service
c50505,s8,"Can't tell you if this is a Macau thing or the hotel management style, but in a country where labor is affordable it's a big mistake not to pamper‚Ä¶"
c50506,s1,"First time in Macau, First time staying in Sheraton Macao Hotel, We arrived at the hotel on a busy weekend in the evening, I will told by my cousin that if I am a SPG member, I can go to SPG front desk for express check in, but the staff there do the check in very slowly, ever ask me to show her the SPG Card, when she can ever check at her system base on my email address"
c50506,s2,I think if go to the normal check in desk maybe will be faster
c50506,s3,"The rooms are clean, huge and well-kept and the room view also very nice(22th Floors)"
c50506,s4,"The staff who help us to bring our luggage up to the room ever tell us out front that the door is very heavy, when we are opening the door need to be careful not to injure our self"
c50506,s5,"The In room dining services also quite fast, I call to place an order, they‚Ä¶"
c50507,s1,Nice hotel coz its just beside the shopping center and i really love the scent of the hotel
c50507,s2,The room was simple but sooo comtable
c50507,s3,Id like to mention the breakfast
c50507,s4,was fantastic
c50507,s5,Hoping to stay again here
c50508,s1,"The hotel property is good, the food is awesome and the location is great"
c50508,s2,rooms are spacious and the casino is ok
c50508,s3,what needs to be in place for this to be a great hotel is the service attitude of some of the people in the hotel
c50508,s4,we were at a conference and just after the break when i asked for coffee i was told that coffee time is over and hence was not served
c50508,s5,likewise when asked early before the conference began it was denied
c50508,s6,during lunch we asked for something off the buffet menu and were first told that it cannot be ordered and finally after some negotiations got the same and paid extra for it
c50508,s7,some lessons on service to be given are needed to make the leap to a great hotel
c50509,s1,"I will preface this review by stating that my husband and I are SPG Platinum Ambassador members, which means besides all the benefits that we are entitled to, my husband stays in SPG properties over 100 nights a year!  That's 100/365 nights that our money is spent with the property chain and we were more than disappointed with the service that was offered to us"
c50509,s2,"Indeed, we have very high expectations, but what is the point of a sticking with a hotel chain if we do not enjoy any benefits?  We left the Sheraton Macau asking this very question"
c50509,s3,We arrived at the property on a busy weekend (the Grand Prix races were on) and the hotel was supposedly at maximum occupancy
c50509,s4,"I understand this is a stressful and busy time for all hotel personnel, but this is also the time big hotels,‚Ä¶"
c50510,s1,I made the reservation from agency for my trip with Sheraton Macau
c50510,s2,The receptionist Agostino assist me for check-in processing and he is really kind and nice
c50510,s3,"In addition, he helps me to translate my address with typing to become a member of SPG membership which no need to write anything and feeling like a ""king"""
c50510,s4,"I requested to stay on the non-smoking floor, but i could discover some smoked cigarettes were being remained near the lift and the surrounding area full of smells"
c50510,s5,"Thus, I request for change to another floor and another receptionist restricted me to change ""without a wise reason"""
c50510,s6,Thus I found a hotel manager Mariana to solve the problem and she really had a heart to handle the problem
c50510,s7,For the breakfast in Xin is really hard to taste and far away from my hotel‚Ä¶
c50511,s1,"All in all a decent hotel with average room and good location as it is connected well to four seasons and the Venetian via the cotai bridge, in room dining was a serious let down specially if you wish to satisfy your craving for Indian food"
c50511,s2,"It's unbelievable how a hotel like Sheraton Macau can go wrong with a simple dish like lamb biryani, what we indeed got in our room was steamed rice and mutton curry"
c50511,s3,"I called back in room dining and asked if I could speak to the chef but the lady who picked up my call said this is all that they can serve for biryani and sent a person in 5 minutes to get it picked up with the story ending then and there, a first experience for me in the history of staying with any Starwood brand"
c50511,s4,They even took 2 calls and 20 minutes to deliver ice cubes‚Ä¶
c50512,s1,Arrived very late
c50512,s2,Spg gold check in closed then with only two people checking in
c50512,s3,get a grip management :( also no one to help with luggage Gave me a suite room upgrade
c50512,s4,thanks guys
c50512,s5,what a room that is even a KTV room sound proofed in the suite Shocked that there are very very few restaurants and their quality not good Great gym one of best in Asia
c50512,s6,:) Casino
c50512,s7,no USA style games all Chinese No shows in Macau
c50512,s8,Cirque Du soleil canceled due to lack of business Shopping mall next to the hotel
c50512,s9,all high end Starbucks 10 mins walk The food court in mall
c50512,s10,no western food all Chinese ASK FOR UPGRADE TO SUITE
c50512,s11,WOW X 2
c50513,s1,"I stayed here for 4 nights for a business trip, 3 nights was paid by the company and I extended one additional night by myself prior to my arranged schedule"
c50513,s2,"When I checked in, I told the front office that this additional night will be borne by myself, but they insisted that I have to pay for all 4 nights, even they already had a confirmation letter and credit card warranty from the company"
c50513,s3,"Well, finally they locked up my credit card for $8000 as deposit"
c50513,s4,"But on the second night, at around 10 PM, the front desk called me and said the deposit was not enough for 4 nights, so I need to come down and swipe again my credit card"
c50513,s5,what the heck calling at this hour? Then I explained again to her about the condition above and she understood
c50513,s6,"My colleague also experienced the same thing,‚Ä¶"
c50514,s1,I‚Äôd stayed in mega hotels in Las Vegas years ago so I suppose I should‚Äôve known what to expect from the Sheraton Macau
c50514,s2,"They boast that their Cotai Strip hotel is the largest of their chain in the world, but it‚Äôs nothing worth bragging about"
c50514,s3,"Situated in a complex which connects to other hotels, restaurants, a mall and two casinos, the whole feel is cold and money grabbing"
c50514,s4,"I was told by a stroppy guest service operator that we could only get one extra pillow for our room and drinking water was limited to four free 33ml bottles per day (there‚Äôs a plentiful supply of bottles in the free to enter casinos, but you can‚Äôt take them with you)"
c50514,s5,"The bedroom, although bland and generically decorated, was good sized and had two comfortable double beds, plus we had an impressive view‚Ä¶"
c50515,s1,Free shuttle from the airport and ferry port
c50515,s2,New nicely equipped gym was one of the best  on our trip
c50515,s3,Nice new room with a comfortable bed
c50515,s4,Staff was awkward and the hotel lacked quality food options
c50515,s5,I would skip Macao on future trips to Asia
c50516,s1,I first visited Sheraton Macao in July / August '13 with 2 friends
c50516,s2,"The service was not outstanding and there were minor hiccups such as misinformation in pool availability and shuttle bus routes, but I really enjoyed the Club Lounge for me to book another trip to Sheraton Kuala Lumpur later"
c50516,s3,I brought my parents back to the hotel on a holiday in October '14
c50516,s4,How stark a difference it is from a little over a year ago! I checked in to a supposedly non-smoking room that reeks of cigarette smoke with a door that has a large crack on the side and stained carpets
c50516,s5,"Housekeeping happen to be setting up an additional bed in the room and they performed a 'cigarette treatment' which was nothing more than a few sprays of an air freshener, which masked the cigarette smell for an hour or‚Ä¶"
c50517,s1,We booked a room on non-smoking floor but the room is still filled with sickening smell of smoke
c50517,s2,It really ruined my stay in the hotel
c50517,s3,"I couldn't get a room change and the only offer I'd got was air-freshener, which basically means further air contamination"
c50517,s4,I have been to many Macau hotels but this is the first time I encountered such a problem
c50517,s5,"I'd seriously choose another hotel next time, honestly, the last thing I want for a vacation is bad air in my room where I plan to sleep and relax in"
c50518,s1,"Awesome stay at the hotel, all the staff are friendly, especially Luigi of Bene Restaurant"
c50518,s2,"Unfortunately had very bad and rude experience with the staff of most of  the shopping complex at the sands, cotai"
c50518,s3,"Also the taxi drivers and also the people of PRC, so dirty and like to spit everywhere, even in lift"
c50518,s4,"And you will get scolded for asking a direction from the locals!  Honestly, I do not recommend Macao a good place for vacation"
c50519,s1,I was there about a week ago
c50519,s2,Room was great & clean
c50519,s3,The bed is so comfortable
c50519,s4,Location is great
c50519,s5,"Service staffs are very polite, friendly & helpful from entrance > reception > housekeeping > restaurant > pool"
c50519,s6,We booked a table for 9 pax in the Feast restaurant
c50519,s7,Ambiance was nice
c50519,s8,The waiter that served us is polite & humble
c50519,s9,Thumbs up
c50519,s10,But there are few negative things I need to bring up to your attentions: 1
c50519,s11,"At 2000hrs, restaurant is running out of teaspoon(obviously not the waiter's fault)"
c50519,s12,We ended up using chopstick to stir our coffee & tea
c50519,s13,2
c50519,s14,I have no words to describe the satay
c50519,s15,It just don't taste like satay
c50519,s16,3
c50519,s17,"Lastly, near the dessert counter area"
c50519,s18,There are 2 chefs and a gentleman in jacket(I am sure he is the staff there as I can see there is a Sheraton pin‚Ä¶
c50520,s1,"Yes, there are black sheeps everywhere, and yes, it could ruin your entire stay just when you thought it could almost be a ""perfect"" stay"
c50520,s2,"The entire experience, to share for awareness"
c50520,s3,End to end
c50520,s4,Check in: The standards of check-in staff were consistently patience and attentive on our return trip
c50520,s5,The abilty to understand conversational english were primarily dependent on the middle supervisors and managerial level
c50520,s6,Expect some delays during check-in if you are in the rush to get in and move on with your itineraries
c50520,s7,We were offered an upgrade to executive suite
c50520,s8,An attempt to accomodate room preferrence at its best
c50520,s9,A wow factor from the front desk team
c50520,s10,Good job to Joyce
c50520,s11,In Room: The conditions of the suite were really clean and in order
c50520,s12,"However, the metal rack‚Ä¶"
c50521,s1,General room decos but new
c50521,s2,Super busy concourse because it is on the main aisle of casino!
c50522,s1,It takes a while to realize there are 3 hotels embedded in two good size casinos
c50522,s2,Maps are hard to decode
c50522,s3,Bus from the Turbojet ferry to hotel is a adventure
c50522,s4,There are two ferry docks on the way back
c50522,s5,Employees at the hotel referred us to three different lobbies to catch the one back
c50522,s6,Inbound bus takes you to a Sands complex on another island
c50522,s7,You need to figure out that there is another bus (of many) to get in line to go to the Cotai complex where you wander around to find the right lobby
c50522,s8,Service was great and room was alo
c50522,s9,Buffet in am is a bummer
c50522,s10,Go to a McDonalds
c50523,s1,We went in March to see the Rolling Stones
c50523,s2,"The hotel was fine, the room was a twin and perfectly big enough"
c50523,s3,"Nothing exciting or amazing, but nothing wrong with it either"
c50523,s4,"There are other I think better hotels nearby, but probably more expensive"
c50523,s5,The Sheraton is above its own casino and sort of melds into a shopping mall which has some restaurants and a mix of luxury and mid level shops and then turns into another big hotel
c50523,s6,"Amazingly (to us) there was no proper bar, we were pointed to the empty lobby cafe which has a few bottles of alcohol"
c50523,s7,So the concierge sent us over to the bar in the casino of the Venetian - connected by a covered bridge from the shopping mall
c50523,s8,"And he was right, the casino and the bar were much livelier over there and in fact the bar had a really good DJ‚Ä¶"
c50524,s1,Horrible service and horrible experience
c50524,s2,"Place is like a railway station Pool area has no food, no fruit juices, no cocktails and doesnt even serve Pizza"
c50524,s3,"I guess if you are the kind that looks for dimsum by the poolside, u wont be disappointed"
c50524,s4,Very few english speaking staff and so in-room dining is an experience in itself
c50524,s5,Lifts are very overcrowded and offers a monday morning experience in a crowded office lift lobby
c50524,s6,Will NEVER stay at a Sheraton again
c50525,s1,Firstly I would like to stress that the quality of accommodation and facilities in this hotel is 5 star - it cannot be faulted and I was impressed
c50525,s2,What really put me off were perhaps expectations I have become accustomed to in the West - hence I wanted to caveat this before my review
c50525,s3,"Whilst we chose non-smoking area of the hotel, it was quite clear that this was not observed by guests, nor was it enforced by hotel staff"
c50525,s4,"During our stay, we often saw people smoking, without discretion, throughout the 'non smoking' section of the hotel"
c50525,s5,in addition our non-smoking room smelled of smoke and we actually saw guests in the neighboring room smoking away whilst their door was ajar
c50525,s6,Indoor smoking is generally in the norm in Asia and something I am not used to with my family‚Ä¶
c50526,s1,"Location:  at the end of Cotai strip, currently it is a bit off"
c50526,s2,"A typical casino hotel connected with a mall, many average dining outlet, connected to a Holiday Inn"
c50526,s3,within 10 mins walk to City of Dream
c50526,s4,"Like other Macao Casino hotel,  Complimentary shuttle bus line to Ferry/Airport/Galaxy/Border"
c50526,s5,"A pity, there should be a line to Macao oldtown (city)/  Service:  The service at the 4th Floor Club lounge was excellent, yet the arrangement at the SPG  dedicated counters on Main Lobby was chaotic"
c50526,s6,"We booked the Club room, yet the Sheraton Club lounge is a bit of walk from the lift foyer of Sky Tower on 4th floor"
c50526,s7,"We hated the walk, so we checked out on lobby floor SPG area"
c50526,s8,There should be two lines or counter check-in and check out instead of one line since service was‚Ä¶
c50527,s1,"First the positive: Very nice swimming pools, pretty good food and a couple of very helpful bell boys"
c50527,s2,I would not go to this hotel again for some other reasons
c50527,s3,The hotel is huge and shiny but it seems that the got the air-conditioning a bit off with the result that the hotel is damp and smells musty
c50527,s4,We noticed that the corridors have no air vents or very few - making it a very sweaty and smelly walk to and from the guest rooms
c50527,s5,"Moreover, the staff either does not understand simple English and sign language, or just does not care"
c50527,s6,"Most of the time, they were indifferent to the point of being rude"
c50527,s7,"Check in and check out is a drab, dreary, slow affair and we missed our bus to the ferry in spite of having almost 30 minutes to spare"
c50527,s8,"It ended well though, there was one very‚Ä¶"
c50528,s1,I stayed there for our 7th anniversary with my love for 2 nights
c50528,s2,Thanks hotel gave free chocolate and had a little decoration on the bed
c50528,s3,But I have a little bit disappointed
c50528,s4,1
c50528,s5,"When we arrive the check in counter, a junior staff is with smile, but the senior staff is no smile and seems impolite (who stand behind the junior and helping the junior for our check in )"
c50528,s6,2
c50528,s7,"When we first come inside the room, few dirty and used pens are on the floor"
c50528,s8,3
c50528,s9,There is no comb in the toilet
c50528,s10,I have to take it from 4/F changing room
c50528,s11,4
c50528,s12,"When I want to leave some opinion on the hotel opinion card , I found that that card is used and there is guest's information like telephone no"
c50528,s13,"Last month I just stayed in Conrad Macau, their service is really very good"
c50528,s14,I stayed in Sheraton Macau for few‚Ä¶
c50529,s1,Booked a junior suite via Starwood SPG website
c50529,s2,Chose this hotel because it was the cheapest upscale international hotel in the Cotai area
c50529,s3,"By the number of guests rooms, it is also the biggest Sheraton brand hotel in China, perhaps in Asia"
c50529,s4,In-room decor is acceptable considering the cheap tariff
c50529,s5,Pictures attached
c50529,s6,"The service at Sheraton Macau is exceedingly impersonal, if not degrading"
c50529,s7,It is the worst of all Sheraton or SPG group of hotels I have stayed in China
c50529,s8,1) No bell boy at lobby to assist with luggage into and checking out of the hotel
c50529,s9,2) First time I have been told at an upscale hotel that towels has to be exchanged instead of extra towels being provided
c50529,s10,This is insulting for myself who neither steal nor have the need to steal
c50529,s11,If Sheraton is‚Ä¶
c50530,s1,Stayed one night at Sheraton Macao due to the hotel next door was fully booked
c50530,s2,"Since this hotel has over 3,000 rooms/suites, we had to be in a long queue upon check-in in hotel lobby"
c50530,s3,"Maybe we booked through online booking agent or we were the first timer of this hotel, we couldn't see or feel a warm welcome at all"
c50530,s4,"With 2 separate towers, i"
c50530,s5,e
c50530,s6,"Sky Tower & Earth Tower in Sands Cotai Central Complex, the Front Desk Officer didn't remind us which way we should approach while they gave us the room keys, and we just realized we went to the wrong tower until the advice by security officer at lift lobby"
c50530,s7,"The room is just enough for 2 persons, and no space for an extra bed"
c50530,s8,Don't expect any turndown service in the evening
c50530,s9,Though the hotel states that they provide free WIFI‚Ä¶
c50531,s1,"There is nothing wrong with this hotel, but there is also nothing exceptional about it either"
c50531,s2,The staff was friendly - after we resolved the disaster at check in
c50531,s3,The room was a nice size - I had 2 doubles
c50531,s4,And the bathroom was  a very nice size wtih a good shower
c50531,s5,"The location is not really in Macau proper - it is in the new part of town in Cotai, which is fine - just takes longer to get to when coming in from the Ferry"
c50531,s6,"All in all, I had a fine stay"
c50531,s7,"there is just nothing that really stands out about it and if you are in Macau, you want to be wowed!!"
c50532,s1,Travelled from HK for weekend in Macau and stayed at the Sheraton on the Cotai strip
c50532,s2,We were in a family suite which was spacious and suited our family
c50532,s3,The focus of our weekend was to relax by the pool and around the hotel
c50532,s4,Unfortunately we found staff customer service to be quite inconsistent and raised concerns with a very professional Duty Manager in Reception during our stay
c50532,s5,"However, this is a higher end hotel and some of the following inconsistencies are not satisfactory"
c50532,s6,Our experiences with inconsistencies in customer service started with the 'guest relations' staff on the phone once we had checked in and were in our room
c50532,s7,There seemed to be a language barrier when the call was made to 'guest relations'  and our problem was not understood
c50532,s8,It took several phone‚Ä¶
c50533,s1,"Scanning the reviews of this hotel, you will expect luxury and a quality of furnishings and service that are common of the Sheraton and Westin chain of facilities"
c50533,s2,Our experience of Macau Cotai is no exception to these opinions but with the major exception that we considered even these attributes to be unacceptably expensive
c50533,s3,"The fact that this also applies to the surrounding hotels, is no excuse"
c50533,s4,Macau Cotai is in our opinion overpriced for what it offers
c50533,s5,"Certainly this is an exaggerated offering of all types and the thrill of the gambling casinos within this complex of huge hotels with all they have to offer is startling, dazzling and entertaining"

c50534,s1,a colleague booked two rooms for us for a work trip
c50534,s2,on arrival i couldnt check in as they needed my colleagues passport as he had made the booking
c50534,s3,so i had to wait three hours for my room as we had flown in at different times
c50534,s4,not too bad for me i had only flown several hours from bangkok but if you had travelled a long way this would be the last thing you need
c50534,s5,check in was friendly and very helpful when i was allowed to check in
c50534,s6,room was very nice and very well equipped
c50534,s7,"view was nothing special, i could see the excellent swimming pools but the other half of my view is all the air conditioning equipment for the hotel"

c50535,s1,There is reason why this hotel is Cheaper than other 5 stars hotel in Macau
c50535,s2,Chose this hotel just because of the breakfast for my kids
c50535,s3,And you can walk to the'Water show' hotel in 5 mins
c50535,s4,Room is big but decoration is cheap
c50535,s5,Expect to see lots of guest from China
c50535,s6,One good point of this hotel is the Italian restaurant there is great
c50535,s7,But for dining there you dont need to stay in the hotel

c50536,s10,"However,‚Ä¶"
c50537,s1,I am a spg member and usually choose Sheraton for my business/leisure trips
c50537,s2,I have stayed in this Sheraton several times before but this experience was the most disappointing
c50537,s3,the short version is: when I asked for an extra bath towel over the phone I was told by two different persons in housekeeping that they could only exchange bath towels and could not give me an extra one
c50537,s4,I find this truly ridiculous and in fact having stayed in hotels all over the world  this is the first time ever such happened to me
c50537,s5,"I assumed this policy was there to prevent people asking for extra towels and taking them away (""stealing"" was the word)"
c50537,s6,"the point being, the hotel had my credit card record for incidentals (as well as breakages and/or anything missing/stolen from the room)"
c50537,s7,this‚Ä¶
c50538,s1,I spent 5 nights this month in a work trip that was held at the Sheraton Macau
c50538,s2,I was looking forward to the trip despite not being a gambler myself
c50538,s3,"However this monstrous hotel, which has apparently over 3,000 rooms, was a real let down"
c50538,s4,Room quality was poor although the room was huge
c50538,s5,"The fittings and bathrooms were luxurious in about 1990 but dated and poor now, although the bed was comfortable"
c50538,s6,"Worst of all, every available square inch of the common areas is given over to gambling"
c50538,s7,"There is no nice bar or decent coffee shop, apart from a hopelessly inadequate one on the ground floor which is constantly full of families apparently waiting for the gambler to come out of the casino, for hours at a time"
c50538,s8,"The staff show zero care or interest in you, and take no action to stop‚Ä¶"
c50539,s1,"We visit Macau several times a year and usually stay at the Galaxy, Holiday Inn Cotai Central or Galaxy"
c50539,s2,"Based on rather nice photos and many positive reviews of the Sheraton Cotai, we decided to stay here and ended up disappointed"
c50539,s3,"Having stayed at the Venetian which is spread over a larger area than the Sheraton, we were not overwhelmed by the size"
c50539,s4,The deluxe room is smaller than the TA photos would lead one to believe and lacking in character (see photos posted separately)
c50539,s5,The Holiday Inn Cotai has nicer and more inviting rooms than the drab and dull color theme of the Sheraton's deluxe rooms
c50539,s6,Just spend a Sunday night here if you want to experience the world's biggest Sheraton; it is not worth paying the marked up rates on Fridays and Saturdays
c50539,s7,The room attendants will‚Ä¶
c50540,s1,This is a massive hotel with a massive mall and massive casino on massive Cotai strip
c50540,s2,Vulgar would be rather fitting
c50540,s3,There are about 3 million people in the mall and around the hotel lobby
c50540,s4,"Once you get the elevator up to your room, it's another world"
c50540,s5,"Peace, tranquility"
c50540,s6,But alas my room had a nice view of the building site next door
c50540,s7,Another hotel no doubt
c50540,s8,The highlight of my stay was the queue outside and opposite the lobby for the taxis
c50540,s9,It took 45 minutes to get one
c50540,s10,The taxi situation in Macau is a major headache
c50540,s11,There are far too many visitors for the infrastructure to support
c50540,s12,This isn't a Sheraton
c50540,s13,It's way too much below par to deserve the name
c50541,s1,"This hotel is huge and you can get lost easily!  Like all other Sheratons, there is really nothing special about the rooms"
c50541,s2,It looks like any other Sheraton room in the world
c50541,s3,"It was comfortable, decent, and but not really any wow-factor‚Ä¶ which was okay because I am very familiar with the Sheraton brand"
c50541,s4,My biggest gripe is the ELEVATOR SYSTEM!  This hotel has the most confusing elevators in the world
c50541,s5,"Only certain elevators will go to certain floors, and I guarantee you will go in the wrong elevator at least once"
c50541,s6,The signs are not really visible in which elevators to take which adds to the confusions
c50541,s7,There was also a lack of dining variety at this huge hotel
c50541,s8,"There is an Italian restaurant, but other than I believe all the other 10 restaurants are Chinese"
c50541,s9,The food‚Ä¶
c50542,s1,"After a night of a dinner, show and other fun I went back to my room"
c50542,s2,While trying to fall asleep late a night there were many young kids running around the hallway
c50542,s3,I think the parents left them in the room while they were down stairs gambling
c50542,s4,These kids sounded like a heard of elephants and were screaming their heads off
c50542,s5,I called guest services to complain and they said they would take care of it
c50542,s6,They did not do what they said and did not send anyone
c50542,s7,The noise continued for 30 more minutes
c50542,s8,I called again and they told me I could move to another room
c50542,s9,ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!  Instead of taking care of the issue they wanted the me to move my room at 1 AM in the morning
c50542,s10,Completely ridiculous and horrible customer service
c50542,s11,Other than terrible customer service
c50542,s12,The‚Ä¶
c50543,s1,Not my normal hotel in Macau - thought I would give it a go
c50543,s2,Definitely will not be back
c50543,s3,"Not impressed at all, arrived around 8pm, 5 people behind the desk and only 2 actually serving the queue"
c50543,s4,Check in was a hassle then the long walk to the elevators through a throng of shopping and gambling crowds
c50543,s5,"Room was okay, I found service culture completely lacking and scale of the hotel makes everything chaotic"
c50543,s6,Looked for somewhere to eat on my own and gave up - myriad of faceless buffets
c50543,s7,Eventually went to another hotel and ate there
c50543,s8,Booked a club room so had breakfast the next morning in the club
c50543,s9,"Didn't get coffee, none offered and no service"
c50543,s10,"Went to check-out at the ""exclusive for club members"" check out in the Club reception"
c50543,s11,It was so exclusive there was no one‚Ä¶
c50544,s1,Friends of 4 ladies booked two twin rooms for one night in Sheraton Macau on 18 Aug 2014
c50544,s2,The check-in time was 3:00 and we arrived at 4:00
c50544,s3,"Wow! ""No twin room right now"
c50544,s4,You have to wait
c50544,s5,""" How long then? ""Not sure, right now there are 78 rooms to clean"
c50544,s6,oh now 124 rooms
c50544,s7,You have to wait
c50544,s8,""" What should we do? ""You have to wait"
c50544,s9,It may take a long time
c50544,s10,""" After we complained and complained, the attendant offered an upgrade of room with a double"
c50544,s11,"We didn't ask for an upgrade, we need a standard twin room! Then the attendant offered a temporary double room for us so that we could go to swim and wait for a twin room"
c50544,s12,She promised to call one of us when the room were ready
c50544,s13,Then we changed swimming suits and left our luggages in the room
c50544,s14,We received her call after we got out of‚Ä¶
c50545,s1,I did look through the reviews before i made the reservation
c50545,s2,"nevertheless, i thought i lost when i was led to the lobby for check in on the day of arrival"
c50545,s3,the reception counter is hidden at one of the corner of the lobby which is luxuriously decorated
c50545,s4,you felt like you are walking into a casino or shopping malls
c50545,s5,receptionist were polite but they tend to speak in mandarin
c50545,s6,the key card even have a map attached so that customer wont get lost n the hotel itself
c50545,s7,"among the hotels in cotai strips, it is very conveniently situated and the popular attractions such as Venetian is very nearby"
c50545,s8,you can just take the linked bridge and Venetian is just walking distance from Sheratan
c50545,s9,another good things is the hotel has a big shopping mall in it and there are a lot of branded shops such‚Ä¶
c50546,s1,If Henry Ford was alive and if he was a h√¥telier this would be his Casino/Hotel
c50546,s2,"I hated the moment we step in, it had no personality, its looked like a Mainland poor hotel trying to be westernized, but the lack of everything i expected in hotel made my experience in Macau a terrible terrible moment in my trip"
c50546,s3,Sheraton should be ashamed of adding this mocking of a hotel in their portfolio
c50546,s4,It is my 2nd disappointment in the Sheraton franchise
c50546,s5,Positive: The shopping mall during the day attached to the hotel is full of shops and with a lot of choices of restaurants and retail stores
c50546,s6,Negative: First indian queue i ever seen in a hotel it just so crowded that they need a controller
c50546,s7,It looked like we arrived to some sort of public service
c50546,s8,"The rooms, for a new hotel it was‚Ä¶"
c50547,s1,Tried to book 2 nights from spg website but no avail
c50547,s2,Found rooms via agoda
c50547,s3,com and reserved a dlx w bfast pkg
c50547,s4,Check in~ being an spg gold
c50547,s5,I quered at the designated line
c50547,s6,Check in was fast but unfortunately i was told i am not entitled to any gold benefit since i did not booked direct from their spg website
c50547,s7,I explained the no room situation but no help
c50547,s8,Was assigned to a non spg member floor on 18th floor neaabu elevator
c50547,s9,I called to speak to one of the supervisor
c50547,s10,Mavis
c50547,s11,She told me basically the same thing about nor being eligble for spg benefit
c50547,s12,i phoned to request for an extra duvet
c50547,s13,Was told by mavis the hotel is so full not even one extra duvet is available!! 7pm ~the corridor on 18fl was full of kids crying  parent screaming so i had to call Mavis again to request a‚Ä¶
c50548,s1,Stayed two nights at this hotel only because I had to see a show in the nearby City of Dreams complex
c50548,s2,"Well, the hotel property is modern and clean, but apart of that there is nothing to commend about"
c50548,s3,"The room is basic, even the toiletries are basic and no touch of luxury whatsoever, even so it commands a US$250 per night price tag"
c50548,s4,Didn't try the restaurant outlets as I was told that they are no that attractive - you could get more reasonably priced and delicious food at coati or back to the Macau peninsula
c50548,s5,Taxi queues can be a big problem for hotels along the Cotai strip and this place is no exception
c50548,s6,Would only recommend this hotel only if you are going with family (i
c50548,s7,e
c50548,s8,"you don't move around that often as traffic can be horrendous), and only if you are seeing shows‚Ä¶"
c50549,s1,"Arrived to sheraton with their shuttle bus, being dropped with nobody told us where to check in or help with our luggage"
c50549,s2,I tried to ask one of the door staff and all she did to reply is waving her hand making a gesture to make us go away
c50549,s3,"After getting inside and try to find SPG check in counter to no avail (since we are being dropped not in the main lobby), i lined up and queue in the check in counter, and after its my turn, when i walk and approach one of the receptionist (the name is Snow Zhang), she yelled at me loudly with some mandarin language that i dont understand and raise her hand making a halting gesture unpolitely and then proceed to make a phone call with a super sour face and ignoring me"
c50549,s4,One of the other receptionist then handle my check in and at least he is‚Ä¶
c50550,s1,This was not my first trip to Macao
c50550,s2,I had already been there a couple of years before and had stayed at the MGM Grand
c50550,s3,"This time though I wanted to stay and experience a different property so after much homework on Trip Advisor, had zeroed down to The Sheraton Macao"
c50550,s4,Well the trip started off on a rather rough note where I had booked for a private pick up from the Hotel through my travel agent
c50550,s5,When I arrived there at the ferry terminal there was no one to my surprise with my name card
c50550,s6,So called up my agent and he in turn called the Hotel and eventually found that there was someone there to pick me up but had wandered off somewhere instead of waiting for me at the visitors point
c50550,s7,Finally managed to meet him and after that things went on smooth
c50550,s8,The hotel itself is on the‚Ä¶
c50551,s1,"So far, every part of my stay at Sheraton Macau has been chaotic"
c50551,s2,"Check-in was chaos with no orderly bell-hop service, and a queuing system longer than Disneyland"
c50551,s3,The walk from reception to the elevators was like navigating an underground station at rush-hour
c50551,s4,The elevators were all full
c50551,s5,"The hotel lobby is more of a shopping mall than a foyer, with hundreds of people all about"
c50551,s6,Every experience also seems so mechanical with sign-in needed at the pool even
c50551,s7,Actual sign-in
c50551,s8,With a pen
c50551,s9,And an attendance register
c50551,s10,"Breakfast requires queuing and being scanned-in by a computer, then queuing again, registering your table size, waiting, being pointed to a table, and before even sitting down being confronted with ""Please tea coffee?"" Breakfast was by far the most chaotic eating‚Ä¶"
c50552,s1,Rooms - good size Pools - massive and still very crowded
c50552,s2,"but clean and well maintained breakfast - ensure you get your breakfast coupons at check in - otherwise you will have to wake up each morning, call the front desk and organise them as we had to"
c50552,s3,food - average
c50552,s4,kids food menu is limited
c50552,s5,better to go to the food court either at the Conrad or the venetian and eat there
c50552,s6,the restaurants in the Sands area were well above par
c50552,s7,service - either fantastic or downright poor
c50552,s8,"to give an example here - at breakfast one morning, one of the servers went out of their way to make our 20 month daughter feel comfortable in the cold room by bringing her a shawl and wrapping her in it"
c50552,s9,"on the other hand, when enquiring about the breakfast coupons I was told to go myself to the front‚Ä¶"
c50553,s1,Spent a weekend here & believe you me that one can easily get lost in this hotel! Nice comfortable room with a comfortable bed
c50553,s2,Friendly staff
c50553,s3,"Concierge staff are amazing, very very helpful with a vast knowledge to guide you around discovering the city"
c50553,s4,"Very accurate directions, in short very impressive"
c50553,s5,Ensure when you leaving your room for an outing that you haven't forgotten anything otherwise its a long journey back to get it! Had an enjoyable stay everything in Macau is built in a grand scale
c50553,s6,The connecting corridor to the Venetian is very convenient & prettily done up
c50554,s1,I think this was my first and hopefully last time to stay at this hotel or any similar supersize wanna-be luxury hotel
c50554,s2,"The lobby is so huge, you can't even find out where to check in"
c50554,s3,"The breakfast buffet was like a football stadium, with basically 1,000 people eating at the same time"
c50554,s4,The staff doesn't speak ANY English and is very rude
c50554,s5,"For breakfast beverage they don't offer anything other than orange-juice, filter-coffee or pre-boiled tea"
c50554,s6,"The selection is a nightmare, a damn nightmare, nothing else can describe that"
c50554,s7,"I wonder which crazy nazi maniac planned this kind of hotel, but maybe it is a culturel difference"
c50554,s8,Maybe for mainland Chinese this is actually their dream of having a vacation
c50555,s1,Opulent in theory
c50555,s2,"Rude and over-bearing front desk, bell boys and front desk supervisors make it the definite last option on the Cotai strip"
c50555,s3,"A huge difference especially since we had just arrived from the classy, courteous,Shangri-La in Hong Kong which was the opposite"
c50555,s4,The good things first: The rooms are super large
c50555,s5,"There is Vegas style opulence in the air, and in the fast developing amenities, all inter-connected, through the strip"
c50555,s6,Housekeeping and security are great
c50555,s7,And room service was efficient and multi-lingual
c50555,s8,We were even politely informed of the construction activity in the distance and the remote possibility of there being noise due to the works happening
c50555,s9,But unfortunately the bad overshadow all the positives: As soon as one arrives one is greeted by an‚Ä¶
c50556,s1,"Stayed for 1 night only, booked a standard room and avail an upgrade worth MOP$700 for a club room (suite) with buffet breakfast, free wifi, everning coctails and all day snacks"
c50556,s2,Huge and amazing pool area but too crowded
c50556,s3,Staff were accommodating and helfpul (front office and F&B)
c50556,s4,Had our dinner at Bene Italian Restaurant; food were under salted
c50556,s5,We ordered a giant three scoop ice cream that was half melted already when it was served to us
c50557,s1,"This was my second stay here, and my 20th+ trip to Macau,"
c50557,s2,I won't stay here again
c50557,s3,"The rooms are OK , well fitted out, but the conference team ruined my stay  I brought 50 people here to an event - and they offered to send two Madagascar characters to our training room"
c50557,s4,"About an hour into our training, I realized they were going to change me MOP22,000 for a 15 mins appearance from two characters in suits"
c50557,s5,"Can you imagine what you could do with MOP22,000?   So I cancelled them immediately, but the Conference team told me they needed to charge me 30% of the total cost (MOP6,000) for them NOT to show"
c50557,s6,Thoroughly unprofessional approach
c50557,s7,"While this may be a suitable hotel for an overnight stay for the Casino , I would avoid it at all costs for conferences"
c50558,s1,One of the biggest Sheratons
c50558,s2,Really nice location and a good hotel
c50558,s3,"Just that next time, I would probably pick a smaller hotel which has a more intimate feel to it"
c50558,s4,This one takes you through very long winded corridors and you would probably not see a single soul on your floor sometimes
c50558,s5,"Also, the hotel staff is not conversant in English"
c50558,s6,I was stuck outside my room since my key stopped working and it took all of 45 minutes and 4 staff including the manager to sort it out
c50558,s7,I had already missed my meeting by then
c50558,s8,Probably not much that the manager can do about this but I would suggest keeping those staff in customer facing roles who understand english
c50558,s9,Overall a good hotel in a great location
c50559,s1,I am a Platinum SPG member and expected far better service than received
c50559,s2,There are two very glaring issues with the staff
c50559,s3,1
c50559,s4,Their English is incomprehensible and 2
c50559,s5,They are unresponsive to the guest
c50559,s6,I'm here with a convention and asked that my SPG number be added to my account so I could be count this stay toward my 2014 nights
c50559,s7,"The response was, sorry you are booked at a group rate"
c50559,s8,Now while that is true I do not understand why you would not allow one of your better customers to count these nights toward my 2014 qualification
c50559,s9,Makes no sense and makes me want to move my loyalty to another hotel chain
c50559,s10,The worst event so far is I was not allowed to order room service breakfast from the menu (which I had to ask to be sent up to my room and arrived 30 minutes later)‚Ä¶
c50560,s1,The hotel area very BIG!!! Hotel require deposit of HKD1000 and the staff forget to give us the cash deposit receipt
c50560,s2,But they personally send us the reciept to our room
c50560,s3,the room very nice and new
c50560,s4,Packages includes breakfast or lunch
c50560,s5,"We went for buffet lunch, worth and nice"
c50560,s6,Not a good location to explore the Macau city
c50561,s1,I stayed in a number of hotels in Macau before but I found that it was the worst
c50561,s2,We arrived in the shuttle designated clearly for Sheraton Macao but we were dropped off in a side door and we faced very incompetent receptionist
c50561,s3,The checkin took ages and the experience was worse than a one-star Mainland China Hotel
c50561,s4,I booked through the Hotel's website but it seemed they didn't observe anything of my booking from their system
c50561,s5,The receiptionist did not know that I had booked the club floor and did not notice I wanted a non-smoking room
c50561,s6,"After the disastrous check-in, I could not find the way to my room"
c50561,s7,It was written on the room card that i should be staying at Tower 1 but you could not find something called Tower 1 there
c50561,s8,The signs only show you to Earth Tower and whatever‚Ä¶
c50562,s1,"We were looking to make a quick trip to Macau for the night from Hong Kong since it was cheaper to stay a night, knowing we were flying out the next morning"
c50562,s2,"Through Tripadvisor we found availability here and got wind of a Sheraton package including ferry tickets for the return to HKG and breakfast, which was exactly what we needed knowing we would have a long day ahead"
c50562,s3,"When trying to book said package, their website wasn't working (pain in the butt)"
c50562,s4,"I used their calling service to have them call my mobile, which I thought was nifty until they called and I could barely make out anything the agent was saying due to a poor connection or accent - couldn't tell either way"
c50562,s5,They did manage to tell me however that they could honor the package for me if I booked upon arrival at the‚Ä¶
c50563,s1,We spent a night using the Cash + points at the Macau Sheraton in Mid June
c50563,s2,"The check in was smooth and I got the high floor which I requested,"
c50563,s3,"Maybe because it was a  almost free room , the view was not what I expected"
c50563,s4,The bed was comfortable and the room is at a good size
c50563,s5,The bathroom amenities were limited as there were only one set of shower gels shampoo  and 2 sets on towels and
c50563,s6,"Normally, you will get at least 2 sets of shampoos  shower gels and 3 sets of towels"
c50563,s7,You have to request extra amenities
c50563,s8,"Other than that, everything was expected"
c50564,s1,"room s are not nice , decoration is soso , only the bathroom is correct"
c50564,s2,without the ashtray and smelly cigarette
c50564,s3,Very disappointed
c50564,s4,check in take forever
c50564,s5,room view was so bad
c50564,s6,"tv on the room was not set , only a few international channel"
c50564,s7,will never go back
c50565,s1,I have always been a fan of Sheraton but this is the first time I'm staying in one in Asia
c50565,s2,The rooms and check in service are good and the hotel is not bad at all
c50565,s3,But I was very taken back when I called and requested for one extra big towel and they said that each room is only allow two sets of towels
c50565,s4,They can only do an exchange and is not allow to give extras
c50565,s5,I was so surprised by the answer that I just said ok and hung up
c50565,s6,I just feel so disappointed by being denied such simple request
c50565,s7,I could totally understand if its from a motel but from Sheraton? This experience totally changed my view on Sheraton
c50566,s1,Hotel is well appointed and clean
c50566,s2,It meets the expectations of the Sheraton brand
c50566,s3,You had to show your key to security to gain access to the lift lobby
c50566,s4,Guest floors were well maintained
c50566,s5,The room was nice and well serviced
c50566,s6,All areas of the room were clean
c50566,s7,Bed was ok although the pillows were very soft
c50566,s8,Room was quiet and had a nice view over one of the pools
c50566,s9,I loved that the curtains kept the room completely dark even in the morning
c50566,s10,Great wifi signal in the room
c50566,s11,A solid 4 to 5 star hotel based on the room and amenities
c50566,s12,Pools were nice but a bit small
c50566,s13,Unfortunately staff were not very friendly at all on both checkin and checkout
c50566,s14,Nor were the concierge and events booking staff very friendly
c50566,s15,Front desk seemed to be unable to cope with questions and very grumpy
c50566,s16,‚Ä¶
c50567,s1,Stayed in the deluxe suite with club access in the beginning of June
c50567,s2,I was also a spg member
c50567,s3,The hotel emailed me a preference list few days before the stay
c50567,s4,Check-in was bit confusing as I was directed to the spg lounge instead of the club lounge
c50567,s5,Finally got to the club lounge where Jessica checked us in
c50567,s6,Jessica was great thru out our stay
c50567,s7,Felt as if i was really a privileged guest
c50567,s8,Breakfast and cocktails were served in the lounge
c50567,s9,The standard of the food was average
c50567,s10,I should have saved the extra $ and have my breakfast in other outlets
c50567,s11,We stayed in the sky tower on 32nd floor facing the pools
c50567,s12,I was informed during check in that the top 2 floors were undergoing renovations but we stuck to our choice for a high floor
c50567,s13,The noise was bearable
c50567,s14,Sheraton's shuttle was‚Ä¶
c50568,s1,Spent 3 nights at the hotel for business/personal holiday
c50568,s2,The check-in was hassle free
c50568,s3,the concierge staff who assisted my wife for ferry tickets to HKIA and booking of dancing water show was fantastic
c50568,s4,He walked a long distance with them just to show them the way to the dancing water theatre to buy tickets
c50568,s5,The room was big and a welcomed change after staying the previous 5 nights in HK Sheraton - their twin beds were super single size which my 2 young girls could share comfortably
c50568,s6,This deserved 5 star rating from me The housekeeping was the worst I had experienced for all my hotel stay (and I am comparing only 5 stars hotel)
c50568,s7,I declined the offer to opt out of the housing keep (in exchange for some SPG points)
c50568,s8,"For my entire 3 nights, the toiletries were not replenished -‚Ä¶"
c50569,s1,This review is really for travelers with families/ small children
c50569,s2,"Rest of the stay was standards standard room, standard buffet, standard amenities"
c50569,s3,"We went for 2 nights 3 days with our daughter, and stayed in a deluxe room"
c50569,s4,"Overall, we felt uncomfortable with the facilities and standards for safety for children"
c50569,s5,"Now for specifics:  Travel to the hotel - We got into the shuttle alright, but when we reached the hotel there was no one to watch over buses coming and going"
c50569,s6,The driver simply stopped and opened the luggage carriage as asked us to exit quickly since he had to leave immediately
c50569,s7,"So I climbed in (cause our luggage was at the back) while my 2 year old daughter stood IN THE MIDDLE of the road, because she wouldn't stay on the side alone with dozens of guests trying to‚Ä¶"
c50570,s1,"As a fairly regular Macau visitor, I decided to stay on the Strip for a change, as I was travelling with a group of friends"
c50570,s2,"It's fair to say that we were not the target demographic of the hotel, but the pool shut at 6pm, and there was no bar apart from a weird lobby cafe"
c50570,s3,"Good food options were also very limited: fortunately, we know Fernando's! A strange hotel"
c50570,s4,Back to the Westin or one of the other Strip hotels next time
c50570,s5,"For the biggest Sheraton in the world (and presumably their flagship hotel), this place needs some work, as do the staff who were unable to comply with a simple request to leave a couple of water bottles outside the room, so as not to wake my friend up"
c50570,s6,"Come on, Sheraton, you can do better than this!"
c50571,s1,"In this trip, we spend one night to live in Hotel Okura Macau and one night in Sheraton"
c50571,s2,"If you think the Starwood association which provides SPG (Starwood Preferred Guest) always has great  and amazing hotel, you might disappoint on the Sheraton in Macau"
c50571,s3,We spend about 250 USD( in the weekend of the holiday) for one night and I think it was not worthy
c50571,s4,"The lobby smells of smoke (maybe the Casino is next to the lobby, the smoke might come from there)"
c50571,s5,The room is just a normal size and it provides not enough towels and base rope
c50571,s6,"I think I'll spend more 100 USD to live in Hotel Okura Macau again, because the room size of Okura is triple size than Sheraton and everything in Hotel Okura Macau is better than Sheraton"
c50571,s7,You only need to spend about 100 USD and you will feel‚Ä¶
c50572,s1,This is world's largest Sheraton Hotel located in Macau Cotai area
c50572,s2,There are two reception area and SPG reception area on 4th floor
c50572,s3,Try to avoid the reception area in front ot MacDonald which is rude and lack of SPG knowledge
c50572,s4,"For SPG members, room upgrades are not given unless you strongly asked for it"
c50572,s5,We booked suite room which is large and luxury with standard above typical Sheraton room
c50572,s6,Service level within the hotel is good except for those in reception area
c50572,s7,"If you are looking for better service, go to Conrad Hotel"
c50573,s1,1 / The lobby having long queue and need me to wait at least 15 minutes
c50573,s2,"The hotel have a lots of counters but no good signage or direction system just guiding by the staffs (seems higher level), specially I noticed a male who is short fat guy is the guiding staff, but he was talking with the mobile phones, then walking around and just walk away to the back office in sudden"
c50573,s3,"Why he came to guide us and ran away if he is too busy?  That is not a good service which Sheraton should be  2 / there have a lot of lanes, but the mainland Chinese always jumping the queue or just go directly to the counters from the exit area, but no security guards force them to lane back"
c50573,s4,"So, what is the meaning that I wait so long for lining up?  3 / The front desk staff assist me to do the check‚Ä¶"
c50574,s1,Now we all know that Macau/HK people are comparatively rude compared to the rest of the world but I would never expect that the staff in a 5-star hotel are the same
c50574,s2,I am talking about the staff stationed at the entrance to the lifts (those who check your hotel key-cards)
c50574,s3,The manner in which they spoke to you made it seem like you were passing through a security check-point (gave off a vibe that made you feel as if you were someone trying to sneak through the security into a hotel that you could not afford)
c50574,s4,"To top it all off, no smiles, no 'good mornings, good evenings'"
c50574,s5,"Heck, even staff in budget hotels know very well that those are the basics in the hospitality industry"
c50574,s6,"While I have no problems with the rest of the hotel, this one blemish is enough to warrant an 'average‚Ä¶"
c50575,s1,We made a spontaneous visit from Hong Kong during the Buddhist's Birthday holiday
c50575,s2,This was our 3rd time staying in this Sheraton but we left with great disappointment
c50575,s3,"Upon arrival, we noticed that the priority check in area for SPG members are already closed, so we had to queue up for quite a while at the reception"
c50575,s4,The staff was pretty slow and their English level was far from the proper standard
c50575,s5,"As a loyal member, we didn't feel welcome at all as there were no special greetings and offer etc"
c50575,s6,"The staff started asking us questions like one bed or two beds, smoking or non smoking, higher or lower floor - I told him I already listed all my requests in my booking and it was shown in my member profile"
c50575,s7,This is ridiculous!  Then my issue with them was - since I made the booking‚Ä¶
c50576,s1,We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in mid-April
c50576,s2,"First impression, it looked pretty good however that quickly deteriorated by the time we got to the desk"
c50576,s3,I understand that I am in China - not back here in the US but the communication issue is so frustrating
c50576,s4,"For a brand that I believe (pls correct me if I'm wrong) is based in the US, I would expect at least one person in the desk all the time that speaks fluent English"
c50576,s5,(This was an issue with the rest of our stay here)
c50576,s6,The next day - we had better luck asking for directions from the concierge  on one of the other hotels (Holiday Inn?) that is adjoined with this one
c50576,s7,The accomodations were pretty good
c50576,s8,"Comfortable beds, great view of the city, nice bathroom"
c50576,s9,"At least we enjoyed the buffet breakfast, just do sign‚Ä¶"
c50577,s1,"I will start my review arriving in Macau, wow that was an experience ! Immigration was so slack that I still have my embankment card in my wallet as no one collected it or checked as we came through from Australia! We were confused as signage was poor or in Chinese which we can't read as to where to get our bags, could not find anyone who spoke enough English to help"
c50577,s2,Finally got our bags and went to find the shuttle to the Sheraton
c50577,s3,Again we had no idea as other hotels had people with signs at the airport but not Sheraton
c50577,s4,It was actually a tour guide from Whyn hotel who showed us how to get to the shuttle
c50577,s5,Once there we had the rudest and most unhelpful driver I have ever come across who just pointed and grunted at us
c50577,s6,We arrived at reception and got checked in and shown to‚Ä¶
c50578,s1,I am a SPG PLATINUM member and used to love staying at the Sheraton group of hotels around the world
c50578,s2,"I have had long stays at stays at Sheraton Hong Kong,  sometimes up to almost a year at a stretch"
c50578,s3,I used to greatly enjoy the hospitality and efficiency of the staff and the quality of the rooms and other services
c50578,s4,So it was a shocking experience in Macau Sheraton
c50578,s5,"Though the staff try their best to look courteous and attentive, there seems an air of utter chaos every where"
c50578,s6,"The moment you enter the main lobby, you are lost in the sea of people and the chatter and clatter reminds you of some over crowded flea market"
c50578,s7,Chaos seems to prevail everywhere and in everything you want to do
c50578,s8,I  Maybe it's because of the large number Chinese mainland tourists??  No I don't think‚Ä¶
c50579,s1,Had stayed in the sky tower on its opening and now am in the Earth tower
c50579,s2,Service is deteriorating - no welcome drink but luckily the check in reception service is good
c50579,s3,"Upon entering room, no room slippers, one table lamp and two ceiling light bulbs blown, no bar soap"
c50579,s4,Nice coffee provided but no fresh milk capsule - only creamer which really spoilt the drink
c50579,s5,This should not be a 5 star standard
c50579,s6,Leave message on table on above so that housekeeping can do the needful but too bad the staff cannot read English and message was left unattended
c50579,s7,Also after cleaning room no bath mat and no refill for shower gel
c50579,s8,Need to call and request staff to bring
c50579,s9,Typically there is no supervision to ensure everything is properly in place
c50579,s10,This is really shameful!
c50580,s1,I was told that this is Sheraton biggest hotel property in the world with 6000+ rooms! This place is huge but soulless
c50580,s2,I don't feel like a hotel guest but a shopper in a huge shopping mall with casino
c50580,s3,The room is spacious but of standard design
c50580,s4,I hardly get to interact with hotel staff at main lobby and concierge because they are located so far from my Sky Tower room
c50580,s5,"Due to too many hotel guests, one can do an express check out by dropping the room card into a box at lift lobby"
c50580,s6,"As a result, hardly any chance for human interaction"
c50580,s7,"As a SPG, the hotel offers a room wifi service at MOP 30"
c50580,s8,"I won't recommend purchasing any wifi service because the connection kept dropping and the speed, well"
c50580,s9,there was hardy any speed I guess
c50580,s10,"Compared to Galaxy Hotel, free shuttle bus‚Ä¶"
c50581,s1,This is not a good choice for the travelers who seek the experience of visiting Macau's historical heritage sites
c50581,s2,"However, it is a good place for those who enjoy casino, high end shopping and entertainment shows"
c50581,s3,Children will not enjoy this place
c50582,s1,We went for an overnight stay in Sheraton
c50582,s2,We chose this over the others because they seemed to be the most child friendly on paper
c50582,s3,Turns out it was worse than picking a hostel
c50582,s4,"W arrived by ferry from Hong Kong and upon arrival, I immediately went to the information desk and asked where the hotel bus transfer was and was told to cross the underpass and find them there"
c50582,s5,"While the other hotels had clearly marked buses, Sheraton had a print out of their logo on a piece of paper mounted under the steering wheel"
c50582,s6,Suffice to say it took us some time to find that one bus among the dozens randomly parked
c50582,s7,"Then when we did find the us, the attendants couldn't care less that I was carrying my 4 year old with our backpack and pulling 2 strollers with one hand"
c50582,s8,Awesome
c50582,s9,they didn't even‚Ä¶
c50583,s1,We visit this hotel again since last July and realized services continue to be poor and no improvement has been in place at all! We moved to Sheraton after spending a night in Grand Hyatt
c50583,s2,Nothing to be compared as it is a 2-star versus 5-star
c50583,s3,We were diverted to another side of the lobby for checking in without realizing we were club patrons and ended up waited 10 meaningless minutes before heading to club lounge check in
c50583,s4,"Nobody acknowledged us while sitting down at the club lounge, not a smile and of course none service at all"
c50583,s5,Unclear message was given upon check in and we eventually went to the wrong side of the hotel and tried opening a wrong door
c50583,s6,Housekeeping girl provided nil service and only told us about the wrong direction and we have to deal with this through‚Ä¶
c50584,s1,We were awaken in the morning (that too after a late night sleep) by continuous attempt of opening our door even when the DO NOT DISTURB was turned on (we guess they could not ring the bell as DND was on)
c50584,s2,We were too annoyed by the noise and opened the door to find out some random guests thought that it was their room
c50584,s3,"Mistakes happen, so no big deal"
c50584,s4,"However, what we could not believe is that they were accompanied by a hotel staff who took them to our room not realising their room was in other tower"
c50584,s5,Not only the staff did not check their room number but also he did not respect any value for our privacy (neither the red light for DND on our door bell)
c50584,s6,How pity!
c50585,s1,My girlfriend and I stayed here for our one night in Macao to experience the casino atmosphere
c50585,s2,Unbeknown to us this hotel is combined with several others all under one roof and is linked to The Venetian across the road via a flyover walkway
c50585,s3,The hotel is designed so that you never need to leave the complex which is fine but not what we were looking for
c50585,s4,The gambling arena and shopping facilities at The Venetian are pretty good but I felt that we were on the outskirts of the action
c50585,s5,We got a cab to the MGM grand at night and visited The Wynn and The Grand Lisboa
c50585,s6,This seemed much more central and where the action was at
c50585,s7,Notwithstanding the above the rooms were very nice and the hotel itself fine enough with plenty of good eateries to choose from
c50585,s8,There was also a free shuttle‚Ä¶
c50586,s1,We ordered and extra bed and blankets for our room
c50586,s2,Someone came in 20 minutes and brought the blankets but no bed
c50586,s3,When we called the front desk and asked where the bed was they said we first needed to pay at the front desk
c50586,s4,They could not just charge the room
c50586,s5,When we wanted to use the internet
c50586,s6,"same story, come to the front desk and pay for it first"
c50586,s7,When we wanted to have a coke from the mini bar it was locked
c50586,s8,Guess what they said?? Come to the front desk first to pay for it first
c50586,s9,All the food was high priced Asian crap except for Bene
c50586,s10,The problem with Bene was the hair I found
c50587,s1,"To start with: while the rooms are nice, the location is just wrong"
c50587,s2,"Construction sides all around, and a rather poor casino in the complex"
c50587,s3,Rather recommend to stay in Galaxy (much nicer inside) or better stay on Macau side which is more authentic and less clinical
c50587,s4,"If you go for Sheraton, upgrade to a lounge room, the premium is worth it"
c50588,s1,"Whereas the room itself was fairly modern and tidy, got few points to note -  1) There are areas in the pool side which are full of exhaust gas smell from the adjacent kitchen(?), which brings cooked burned oil smell in the pool area"
c50588,s2,Fairly unpleasant - we ended up changing our seats twice before found a spot where there is no ventilation noise or smell
c50588,s3,Just poor design really
c50588,s4,"2) It was a slow service to order food to pool area, drinks took borderline 15minutes and pool snacks about 40 minutes"
c50588,s5,Suggest bring your own drinks & snacks
c50588,s6,easier
c50588,s7,There's a McDonalds nearby :)  3) Wi-Fi connection non-existent to poor - tried and tested in the room and also on the pool side
c50588,s8,Perhaps cable connection is better (provided in the room too)
c50588,s9,4) Overflow of rubbish along the hotel‚Ä¶
c50589,s1,I have been to Macao for business conference and got a chance to stay in Shreaton Cotai Central
c50589,s2,Checkin formality was managed by our company event management team hence that was okay
c50589,s3,Pro: Rooms are good with all the basic facility provided within the room
c50589,s4,/ Size of the room is also big enough good space
c50589,s5,/ Bathroom is also very big and good
c50589,s6,Cons: Staff is not well aware on the English
c50589,s7,/ Almost no option for Vegi like me
c50589,s8,/ Very difficult to get in to room being a very big hotel and confusing ways
c50589,s9,Do think twice before visiting with family
c50589,s10,be ready to walk a lot within the hotel itself
c50589,s11,Overall its a mix experience to me
c50589,s12,did not find cool feeling
c50590,s1,With the Sheraton name you expect a little more from a Casino resort
c50590,s2,As soon as you walk in the hotel is confusing
c50590,s3,The SPG check in area has no ramp access from the front so if you have alot of luggage that's going to be an inconvenience
c50590,s4,The woman at the check in counter lost our initial reservation and tried to make up for it by offering free wifi
c50590,s5,In reality my entire hotel floor has free wifi
c50590,s6,"Laptop connection is just fine however, it will kick you off after 5 min for inactivity on a wireless device fyi"
c50590,s7,I would have rather paid for  my own access to avoid this
c50590,s8,Felt like a cheap ploy from the receptionist to offer free wifi when in reality it's free
c50590,s9,Rooms are nice and the pool is great
c50590,s10,I've only eaten the buffet breakfast so far and it was pretty good
c50590,s11,Just plan to‚Ä¶
c50591,s1,This isn't so much about the hotel as the area in general
c50591,s2,"Our tour company booked us into what is billed as ""the biggest Sheraton in the world"" with something like 3,880 rooms (yep)"
c50591,s3,The hotel is spic-and-span new but its hugeness is overwhelming
c50591,s4,A one-night stay saw a lot of time spent trying to find the right lobby (several of them) and the right bank of elevators
c50591,s5,Our room was utilitarian compared to other five-star hotels
c50591,s6,"The breakfast buffet (included) was the best feature, we felt"
c50591,s7,"This Sheraton is located on Cotai Island, a section of Macao under international mega-development as a clone of Las Vegas, lots of construction going on, themed ""City of Dreams"
c50591,s8,""" Right: it's far from the historic centre of a very interesting city, with no local neighbourhoods to explore, or‚Ä¶"
c50592,s1,I booked a Suite at the Sheraton for 2 nights to celebrate my fiancee's birthday from 24-26 March
c50592,s2,"This is my first time staying at the Sheraton property, however, it didn't leave me with a good impression"
c50592,s3,"My fiancee's birthday was on 24 March which I had already informed the hotel prior our arrival, the staff who checked us in was nice and friendly, but there might be some system error, the registration card was showing the wrong departure date, but problem had been fixed quickly, then we go to the elevator with our suitcase with NO ASSISTANCE"
c50592,s4,"Room in the Sky Tower on the 33th floor was assigned to us, the room was nice, clean, simple but absolutely comfortable"
c50592,s5,"However, when we just settled ourselves, there were some noises coming from the top (Drilling walls &‚Ä¶"
c50593,s1,This is the third time i stay in this hotel
c50593,s2,"The room is still very good, spacious and  make me feel relaxed and comfortable"
c50593,s3,However two of my friends room card didn't work when we come back to the room after having our breakfast downstairs
c50593,s4,We called to the front desk for help and we wait for the staff for 15 mins to open our room which had not been check out
c50593,s5,This is our first time we experienced this bad situation in any hotel we visited
c50593,s6,"Please ensure your room card system stable, not to bother your customers like that"
c50593,s7,"One of the staff in the express check out counter is not very helpful, i forget her name,  but her attitude is really bad, make me a bit angry"
c50593,s8,this kind of staff cannot be found in any service industry
c50594,s1,I really like this hotel
c50594,s2,I have stayed here many times since opening
c50594,s3,"Great gym, very nice pool's  Good spa Facilities  But the room service choice is very limited especially in relation to western choices and quality  Simple things like no club sandwich or standard hotel room service things like steak or chicken Been like this for over a year and always frustrates me when I visit  Also currently some construction taking place on the higher floors"
c50595,s1,"Very easy to get to the Hotel from the Airport, 5 mins maximum, but then the fun starts"
c50595,s2,"The check in desks (there are many) are accessed by a immigration style line queue, and all though they had about 8 desks open, it still takes an age to get to the desk"
c50595,s3,"Finally I make it, find out Im in the Earth tower, 21st floor"
c50595,s4,"You make your own way to the elevators, nobody carries your bag or guides you in the right direction and it would be quite easy to get lost, this place is massive"
c50595,s5,"Up to the room, very impressed, nice layout excellent bed, nice and quiet, all good so far"
c50595,s6,"Return to my room after a walkabout, according to the TV i have a voicemail and written messages, I go over to the phone and desperately search for the voicemail button, there isn't one, ring guest‚Ä¶"
c50596,s1,This was our first overnight trip to Macau to attend the Rolling Stones concert
c50596,s2,"We chose the Sheraton because it was so close to the concert venue and due to availability, quality and price"
c50596,s3,This is apparently the largest Sheraton in the world and it showed in terms of the huge numbers of people in and around the hotel
c50596,s4,We took the shuttle bus from the Macau Ferry Terminal and were very impressed with how easy it was to get to the hotel and check in
c50596,s5,"I'd booked through an online site and on arrival was informed that neither breakfast or WiFi was included in the booking, but that I could add this for a cost as an SPG member, which I did"
c50596,s6,"The place is HUGE, but the room we were given was very nice"
c50596,s7,The hotel itself is part of a huge shopping complex that attaches 4-5 hotels‚Ä¶
c50597,s1,I have stayed in many new hotels in Macau and Sheraton Macao is probably the worst I have ever stayed
c50597,s2,Inattentive Staff I booked the hotel room and transportation through the travel agent in one go to save time and effort
c50597,s3,"As I wanted to request for a non-smoking room with king-size bed, I wrote an email directly to Sheraton Macao"
c50597,s4,"In the email, I clearly informed the officer that I have already booked a room (with my personal particulars and date of stay) and would like to add a remark to my booking"
c50597,s5,"Sadly, the officer handled my email unconcernedly and gave me a room quotation instead"
c50597,s6,I have never expected such heedless working attitude or poor language proficiency from Sheraton Staff
c50597,s7,New but not worth I regretted choosing Sheraton Macao instead of other big brand‚Ä¶
c50598,s1,"The breakfast is unpleasant, the place is heaving with people, Palms the bar/coffee shop next to reception is an exercise in patience"
c50598,s2,Outside of the room this is a tiresome experience as is much of Macau these days
c50598,s3,The staff are very pleasant though
c50598,s4,Will not be returning
c50599,s1,Stayed in the Deluxe room for 1 night last week
c50599,s2,Luckily only 1 night in this hotel
c50599,s3,"The hotel is pretty new, however it feels more like a 4 star hotel rather than 5 star"
c50599,s4,The facilities and hardware are still in good conditions
c50599,s5,"Personally,, i don't like the pillows which are too soft"
c50599,s6,"Since it has a lot of rooms, so the lobby is very busy without any 5 star hotel touch"
c50599,s7,The sound proof of the room is terrible
c50599,s8,"It was a family staying next to my room, and i think the 2 kids were very excited with their holiday"
c50599,s9,We could hear very clearly when they were playing at the door area and running along the hallway happily
c50599,s10,I was waken up by them at 7am++
c50599,s11,"If you are a light sleeper, may consider request for a quiet room"
c50599,s12,"Another incident happened during our checked in, there was a‚Ä¶"
c50600,s1,I took the offer of Sands to enjoya cheaper rate of this hotel but I never expected the service quality would follow the price
c50600,s2,"But with same charge, I could  book Ponte 16 through a travel agent and enjoyed much better service quality of Ponte 16  although the casino there is much smaller in size, but within 15 mintues walk, I could go to other casinos"
c50600,s3,"Previously, I could check in and get the room before 12 noon"
c50600,s4,"This time, even I offered to complete the check in procedure and got the door key after 1 p"
c50600,s5,m
c50600,s6,", I was still rejected"
c50600,s7,Only few guests at the two front desk zones at that time
c50600,s8,"Being a SPG member, without the membership card, for the first time, I was refused to the membership zone for checking in"
c50600,s9,I had to go to the other check in zone to verify my identity‚Ä¶
c50601,s1,"Within two hours of arriving at this hotel,I could tell you more than five things wrong with it"
c50601,s2,"(1)asked to change room, none was available"
c50601,s3,"(2)not all elevators goes to all floors, confusing"
c50601,s4,"(3)can't charge restaurant bill to room,system down(4)largest hotel, by who's standards"
c50601,s5,"(5)who in their right mind would design rooms facing each other, so your view is the room in the other tower"
c50601,s6,"Sheraton, what a wasted investment,five star hotel, maybe,but definitely one star experience!"
c50602,s1,One of the the worst hotel I ever stayed
c50602,s2,1
c50602,s3,"You checked in, follow the sign to the lift, reached your floor, and guess what, you can not find your room"
c50602,s4,Your room number was not in this floor
c50602,s5,"Then you called hotel, then they told you that your room number is in ANOTHER building"
c50602,s6,"What ? Why not tell me when I checked in ? Their answer, 'sorry, we forgot'"
c50602,s7,2
c50602,s8,"OK, then you have to drag your luggage and go to another building"
c50602,s9,"Finally found your room, open the door"
c50602,s10,You got confused again
c50602,s11,You asked for a NON-Smoking room
c50602,s12,But the one you got is obviously heavily SMOKING room
c50602,s13,"You called and they said, 'sorry"
c50602,s14,' again
c50602,s15,3
c50602,s16,"Fine, maybe just open the window to get some fresh air"
c50602,s17,Then you wanted to check your email
c50602,s18,But found out your could not connect into internet
c50602,s19,"Call IT,‚Ä¶"
c50603,s1,I went there with family on 1 Feb and stayed there for 2 nights
c50603,s2,"The room was OK, but not as good as I expected"
c50603,s3,The bedding and pillow is good
c50603,s4,But the housekeeping is not
c50603,s5,"After we came back from the sightseeing in the afternoon on the second day, we found the hair dryer was not put back at where it was"
c50603,s6,"The robe was put where my husband left that morning, which was on the chair"
c50603,s7,The worse part was the housekeeping did not clean the coffee maker
c50603,s8,We needed to clean it by ourselves
c50604,s1,"This hotel has not met my expectations during my stay already:  - no upgrade for SPG Gold member  - late checkout to 4PM was given, but extension of late checkout from 4PM to 6PM was denied  - coffee press not cleaned and kettle not put away during room servicing  - request for a power adapter for my US three-plugged laptop was not available ('we don't support that"")   But the biggest disappointment was in the checkout"
c50604,s2,I had to make some calls to Cathay Pacific Marco Polo Club for a booking
c50604,s3,"Unfortunately, Marco Polo made it very difficult to call in - the call gets connected but then drops into voicemail"
c50604,s4,But Marco Polo has a toll-free number in Macau Local calls in Macau are *free*
c50604,s5,"Of course, there is a fixed monthly connection charge"
c50604,s6,Just like HK - so rather than use my‚Ä¶
c50605,s1,It was the second time we stayed in Sheraton
c50605,s2,Last time was last CNY when the hotel was just opened and needed lots of improvement
c50605,s3,I came again in CNY this year and found the signage problem and availability of express check out were improved
c50605,s4,"However, this year my disappointment was on dining"
c50605,s5,"Being a 5 star hotel,  all hotel restaurants did not accept booking because they said it was CNY"
c50605,s6,How ridiculous
c50605,s7,"It turned out that I dined in four seasons the first night which not only accepted booking, table was also ready when I arrived on time"
c50605,s8,"The second evening, in order to avoid the crowd, I have an early diner at 6Ôºö30 in the italian restaurant"
c50605,s9,You know what happened? The restaurant staff asked whether I made a booking!!!!! The hotel definitely needed to improve its catering‚Ä¶
c50606,s1,It is very poor in restaurant and room service
c50606,s2,I found out my belonging being stolen after my back home
c50606,s3,Something very personal but very European style
c50606,s4,I can't believe it
c50606,s5,I will not recommend this hotel to any of my friend especially people from Europe
c50607,s1,"You know what really grinds my gears about this hotel? That I paid for their second biggest suite, threw a dinner which cost USD 600 in the same suite, and they still refuse to credit me with my loyalty points"
c50607,s2,"Butler service was good, in fairness"
c50607,s3,"Oh, and the second room in the suite smelled of sewage"
c50607,s4,No apology was forthcoming
c50608,s1,The hotel is located right at the centre of the Cotai strip so is quite central in that sense
c50608,s2,Unfortunately the very common and un exclusive experience starts from the time you come out of the ferry and have to wait around for buses and the bus to get to Sheraton is also confusing
c50608,s3,"When you get to the hotel, given how large it is and in the midst of almost a circus/carnival like atmosphere, the first impression you get is one of ""how can this be a Sheraton property!"""
c50608,s4,"You have to carry your bag yourselves and that too quite a distance, wait for ling lines to check in"
c50608,s5,"Once you check in, the rooms, for close to USD 225/250 a night are just not value for money"
c50608,s6,Overall too expensive for the experience and I wouldn't stay here again
c50608,s7,This given that iam an SPG GOLD MEMBER and stay‚Ä¶
c50609,s1,Apparently the Sheraton in Macau is the largest hotel within the chains properties and I'm not in anyway surprised
c50609,s2,It is huge
c50609,s3,There are a number of towers clustered around the casino that form the Sheraton and a Conrad and a Holiday Inn within the same complex along with the expected Macau luxe retail experience
c50609,s4,It's huge
c50609,s5,It also means that the checkin lines are also huge however they seem to move at a reasonable pace
c50609,s6,"We had two twin rooms adjoining on the members level and they were both clean, comfortable, modern and very clean"
c50609,s7,No complaints at all
c50609,s8,"Pros Close to the two big players in Macau - Venetian and City of Dreams Reasonable walking distance to City of Dreams cirque water show Rooms are modern, spacious, clean  Cons Lack of reasonably priced restaurants -‚Ä¶"
c50610,s1,"we arrived at the hotel thru their free shuttle bus, but after we get off the bus, my mom was falled down and her head hit the corner of drive path"
c50610,s2,"head was breeding and we ask the hotel to call ambulance and send her to hospital nearby, after surgery we went back to the hotel"
c50610,s3,"we stay there one night, during the time we stay there, none of their staff visit us or make any concern"
c50610,s4,seems money is most important for them
c50610,s5,Sheraton means money??

c50611,s1,At 4000 rooms it certainly is & if bigger is better than this is just your cup of tea
c50611,s2,"As SPG members, my husband & I generally stay at one of the group hotels & have to admit this would not be my top choice - primarily because its so large as to seem almost impersonal"
c50611,s3,"Having said that, rooms are large & well-lit with good amenities & the staff are generally pleasant & very helpful but that little personal touch we have so come to expect from the Starwood Group was just missing"
c50611,s4,"It is very conveniently located with all the casinos, the theatre (Dancing Water) as well as the dining district (two great Portugese restaurants, check out my reviews)all within walking distance"
c50612,s1,It is our Annual Group Meeting (L & E International Ltd)
c50612,s2,We selected Sheraton Macau this time
c50612,s3,Overall service and hotel room is good
c50612,s4,One thing just want to highlight
c50612,s5,The conference room is not as good as our expected
c50612,s6,1
c50612,s7,One of the electric plug is not work
c50612,s8,2
c50612,s9,"TV cord do not connect with conference table, we need to move Notebook close the that plug (not user friendly)"
c50612,s10,3
c50612,s11,We have more than 10 staffs in the meeting
c50612,s12,It seems tooooo small for us to work
c50613,s1,Recently stayed here for 2 nights
c50613,s2,The celebrated Sheraton Sweet Sleeper beds and roll-away bed certainly lives up to its reputation
c50613,s3,They were the most comfortable hotel beds we've experienced
c50613,s4,We were given an early 10:45am check-in instead of the normal 3pm without additional charges
c50613,s5,Check-in process at the SPG counter was fast and staff were very friendly and helpful
c50613,s6,Our room on the 24th floor of the Earth Tower was pleasant but the bathroom was a big disappointment
c50613,s7,The tower rail on the shower door practically fell off making it very inconvenient for us
c50613,s8,The bath amenities were one of the poorest for a hotel of Sheraton's international standing
c50613,s9,There was also no power socket for the hair-dryer in the bathroom
c50613,s10,"Although we check-in as 3 people, water and toiletries were‚Ä¶"
c50614,s1,"The hotel was comfortable and staff was very helpful, but I need a bar! If I stay Sheraton, I'd expect a bar or a lounge to drink during taking a break from casino"
c50614,s2,It was pity to have drinks with my friends from mini bar
c50614,s3,Doesn't Chinese casino work with alcohol?
c50615,s1,The hotel is huge and new however Cotai in general is like a tourist trap especially for those who is not familiar with Macao
c50615,s2,I have been to Macau 2x and stayed near the central and enjoyed my stay
c50615,s3,"My recent visit, we tried to stay in Cotai for a change but was a bit dissapointed as to the lack of things to do except for casino and shopping"
c50615,s4,"To summarize my experience  Pros: -Beds are heavenly! -Rooms are of good size -Great views of the Venetian  -Huge Swim Pools (didn't use) -Easy access to shopping & other hotels in the vicinity (via footbridge)  Cons: - Feast (Lunch Buffet) - food was very bland, though there are numerous choices -Lack of things to do in the area -Location, a bit far from the City (though taxi's are cheap) -No food options in the area  This Sheraton‚Ä¶"
c50616,s1,this hotel is very good and centrally located at the cotai strip macao
c50616,s2,Is really easy to find this hotel and the casino and mall is very good
c50616,s3,What the problem is only whe we check in the reception work is very slow and not care with the guest
c50616,s4,"really bad service in the reception and guest relationship, they really don't care about the guest"
c50616,s5,Maybe is because the price of this hotel is cheaper than other in cotai strip
c50617,s1,The room was good and spacious
c50617,s2,"Apart from that, I might not choose this hotel again in the near future"
c50617,s3,"In short, the room rate was bit expensive without breakfasts and Wi-fi included"
c50617,s4,And the lobby was bit crowed and a lot of people were sitting in front of the casino area for Internet connection
c50617,s5,=
c50617,s6,
c50618,s1,Spent 2 nights at this hotel
c50618,s2,Location is good only if you come to Macau to gamble or spend your money on high-end shopping
c50618,s3,"A decent food-court located at the shopping mall below, not many choices but you can get seat more easily compared to the market street at Venetian"
c50618,s4,"Best thing about this hotel is the spacious room, double-double bed for family with kids, big bathroom with separate shower and bathtub"
c50618,s5,Worst thing is the crowd
c50618,s6,It took me about 1 hour to check-in queue and about 45 minutes to queue for a taxi
c50618,s7,"The crew were excellent, I really appreciate a check-out crew that allowed me to have a late check-out because of an urgent matter"
c50619,s1,We wanted to choose Venetian but in the end opted for Sheraton instead
c50619,s2,We were kind of glad that we made this choice
c50619,s3,We went to Venetian on a Sat and it was like a market place
c50619,s4,Troupes of tour groups from mainland China
c50619,s5,Everyone is shouting and shuffling people around
c50619,s6,Escalators were jammed pack
c50619,s7,"From a supposedly classy place, it became a market place"
c50619,s8,"Sheraton on the other hand was quieter, more refined crowds"
c50619,s9,Sheraton room has 2 double beds but they were pretty small
c50619,s10,The curtains were old fashion considering this is one of the newer hotels at cotai strip
c50619,s11,"For the price paid, compared to other hotels, I think it's the most reasonable and affordable for a 5 star hotel"
c50619,s12,We were given coupons to dine at Xin restaurant for breakfast for 2 nights
c50619,s13,The food option was not‚Ä¶
c50620,s1,"Nice, new(ish) and impressive enough in the lobby section, but unless you are an SPG member, be prepared to wait a while for check in"
c50620,s2,"The locale is central enough, surrounded by other big casino/hotels - the likes of Galaxy, Venetian to name a few in this Taipa area"
c50620,s3,The setup of the hotel is not so user friendly as there are very long corridors from one end of a floor to the other end
c50620,s4,"The rooms are clean enough, but lacks that opulence that one searches for the extra detail which made you feel that ""thoughts been put in to make the guest as comfortable as practicable"""
c50620,s5,"I'm not rubbishing their affair, but it is just a bit lackluster"
c50620,s6,"Rooms are acceptable size, not cramped, but lack the touches that make it a true 5 star hotel"
c50620,s7,ie: lack of fruits/paper/refillable‚Ä¶
c50621,s1,"May be it was due to the high season, we found the service level not on par with other 5 star hotels in the area"
c50621,s2,"As SPG member I got to check in at the special SPG counter which was nice, but the lady who served us seemed inexperienced and it took awhile for her to confirm our room and details"
c50621,s3,Most of the other staff we met throughout our stay seemed cold and never greeted us
c50621,s4,We did enjoy our first stay at this hotel though
c50621,s5,The location is convenient with easy access to shuttles and taxis
c50621,s6,There's a covered footbridge which leads to the Venetian complex too
c50621,s7,The casino is relatively new and the staff there was professional
c50621,s8,We got a deluxe room which was large enough (especially the bathroom) and the bed was quite comfortable
c50621,s9,However just as I was looking forward‚Ä¶
c50622,s1,"A bit disappointed with the room! We had two joining rooms, to my surprise, I think the hotel was opened a year ago, the carpet in one of the rooms was torn and the door locks already looked tired!  The lobby was so busy that you would not like to sit at their lounge for a cup of tea!  Staff are very polite and helpful!"
c50623,s1,We recently visited the Sheaton Macao hotel
c50623,s2,I found the hotel to be too big and confusing for people travelling with kids
c50623,s3,We are SPG members so we checked in at the SPG counters
c50623,s4,"We were the first in line, but waited at least one hour before the room keys were handed to us"
c50623,s5,It's a long walk to the swimming pool and to restaurants
c50623,s6,We visited in the second week of December and the swimming pools were too small for the number of rooms and guests at the hotel
c50623,s7,I will only stay at Mandarin Oriental Macau if I go back and visit Macau again
c50624,s1,I find this hotel very confusing to commute around
c50624,s2,"Though it's confusing to go between the 2 towers, it's a nice hotel to do shopping and restaurants"
c50624,s3,too many options to choose
c50624,s4,too difficult to find the right choice
c50624,s5,I presume Macau is like that too short at the same time too confusing
c50624,s6,keep surrounding the same place time again
c50625,s1,"The third time checking in this Hotel,  Funny issue no"
c50625,s2,(1) :check in and check out still a problem
c50625,s3,"It was a bit better in the SPG special area but should still be expected to wait for 4-5 guests before your turn, which means at least 30 mins"
c50625,s4,"Staffs are polite and tried to be helpful, but as some other viewers said, they are very busy with their computer keyboards, I had no idea why they need to type so much items"
c50625,s5,Funny issue no
c50625,s6,"(2) :staff like to tell you that as they got more than 2000 rooms, guests are expected to wait in various areas, says, lift, breakfast, room service, even your call to the front desk"
c50625,s7,"This "" We are a huge hotel with over 2000 rooms "" was heard most during my single night visit"
c50625,s8,Funny issue no
c50625,s9,"(3): No matter how Non-chinese looking you are, hotel‚Ä¶"
c50626,s1,"I am a passive and lazy reviewer, but if I write, it must be either superbe or shameful"
c50626,s2,And this time is the latter
c50626,s3,"The experience is so bad that should warrant the attention of a Sheraton management who better cares enough about the hotel's reputation, especially when it can cause dishonest sales and promotion"
c50626,s4,"We spent a bit more for the Club Lounge package under which guests are supposed to be entitled to a series of benefits including breakfast at the lounge, late check out, welcome drinks / food, a higher floor room etc"
c50626,s5,"Freebies aside, I assume a hotel should understand that guests spend extra with a purpose - to have a relaxing, less disturbed stay"
c50626,s6,But the truth is we suffered more than what we paid
c50626,s7,We couldn't get a seat at the Lounge during breakfast time two‚Ä¶
c50627,s1,"With almost 4,000 rooms, the hotel is expected to be busy during our visit from 19-21 Dec 13 with my husband and 4-year old child"
c50627,s2,Arrived via ferry direct from HK airport
c50627,s3,"Took a quick 15 min cab ride, costing ~ USD 10 though there are free shuttle buses to hotels in the Sands Cotai area (Conrad Macao, Holiday Inn Macao, Sheraton)"
c50627,s4,Service Check-in was relatively queue free but the reception basically lied and gave us a room with 2 beds instead of a king sized bed on a smoking floor even he specifically told us that our request isn't a problem
c50627,s5,Thank goodness we got to change to the room we wanted but it was unnecessary and extra work for no reason
c50627,s6,"Take note Sheraton!!  As expected, breakfast line was long at even 10am but it was breezy and service was speedy"
c50627,s7,Room Dingy‚Ä¶
c50628,s1,"I went there early this month(december), and was surprised"
c50628,s2,It is the worst hotel i have ever visited
c50628,s3,"First, let me tell you about my check inn experience, the lady at the desk was so rude she refused to even pass a smile and welcome"
c50628,s4,I told her it was our first wedding anniversay and she did not even bother to wish us
c50628,s5,"Secondly, the whole place is such a mess"
c50628,s6,so many people everywhere and no one is managing the crowd
c50628,s7,"Thirdly, the hotel staff is super rude, each time i went to their casino i was asked to show my passport,even after telling them i am staying there, they did not bother"
c50628,s8,"Forth, every morning we had to stand in a queue for breakfast outside their restaurant"
c50628,s9,that was disgusting
c50628,s10,"i mean a five star treating you like this ????? Fifth, the room service was utterly‚Ä¶"
c50629,s1,Sheraton Macau is a mess with no system / no character what so ever
c50629,s2,They are so big that they cannot handle it
c50629,s3,Lets start with checkin
c50629,s4,"It is nightmare, if you are not SPG you have to stand in a really big queue"
c50629,s5,"I was staying in a club room, and I could have checked in the club lounge, however, there was security on the ground floor who was very rude and did not allow me to go up and did not speak English, thus had to checkin in a big queue"
c50629,s6,"In club I had made request for some special meal requirements, which was duly acknowledged, however when I went for first day during evening hours, my request was not fulfilled, and rather it became very embarrassing for me"
c50629,s7,"After some harsh exchange of words, they treated me well for next 2 days"
c50629,s8,On last day in breakfast the same story‚Ä¶
c50630,s1,"To be fair, the hotel was nice, the rooms were nice and very clean"
c50630,s2,But my experience with Sheraton was scarred by my checking in and checking out process
c50630,s3,"First, I got an email in September to thank me for staying with Sheraton Macao and I was in shock"
c50630,s4,"Did I book the wrong date? So I wrote to them and after two emails, it was due to a lapse in their system and they mistook another Audrey for me"
c50630,s5,So I tot the episode is over
c50630,s6,"But in December, when I checked in at the counter"
c50630,s7,the same boo-boo happened
c50630,s8,The staff took very long to verify all my details and it was not a smooth check in
c50630,s9,"The next day, when we checked out, I was not able to get back my 1000HKD deposit"
c50630,s10,The staff insisted that I havent given any cash deposit and refused to give the deposit to me
c50630,s11,It was a‚Ä¶
c50631,s1,It was my first leg of a week long vacation
c50631,s2,The room size is considerably large and loads of amenities that are linked between hotels
c50631,s3,Many free shuttle buses to take
c50631,s4,I only wished that info is more made available to tourists once we step out of the ferry terminal
c50631,s5,Travel to the tourist attractions are mostly free and getting around is not difficult
c50632,s1,"Honestly, we didn't really enjoy the Cotai strip at all, shopping and gambling isn't our sort of holiday - we only went for one night to have a look around Cotai but really just to have access to old town Macau"
c50632,s2,"Everything on Cotai is completely soul-less, distances to get anywhere are huge because everything has been built on a seriously large scale; maybe that helps with the volume of guests in high season - but I can only imagine it would be a horrendous place to be if everywhere was full"
c50632,s3,"Off season, it was just like walking around a big almost empty shopping mall"
c50632,s4,"Nothing new for casinos but they all seem to allow smoking which is just downright unpleasant for non-smokers like us, so we didn't stop to spend in any of them"
c50633,s1,Spent two nights there as a weekend break to see the Taboo show as all other hotels nearby were fully booked for the boxing fight
c50633,s2,Hotel rooms are nice enough and service is ok
c50633,s3,Swimming pool and gym are hard to find if ok
c50633,s4,"However the lobby lost in the casino with throngs of people checking in and out at all times, smoking cigarettes inside and the rest, plus the very confusing layout of the ground floor and the long queues at breakfast are NOT ok for a 4 star hotel"
c50633,s5,Thank god we had the SPG card so had some advantages and took refuge in City of Dreams across the road
c50633,s6,Would not stay here again
c50634,s1,18/11 checked in and front desk staff told me to show my credit card for deposit guarantee
c50634,s2,I have never signed any slip with my credit card
c50634,s3,Then checked out next day at express check out counter
c50634,s4,The staff just asked me if the minibar was used
c50634,s5,She did not tell me there was already a chargeable bill to my room
c50634,s6,"When I got back to HK, I found there was a bill of HK$380"
c50634,s7,59 charged to my credit card by Sheraton Macao
c50634,s8,I was absolutely amazed and wondered how my credit card can be used w/o my authorised signature
c50634,s9,My card issuing bank suggested this might be a criminal fraud!  Then I sent an email to Sheraton Macao and Guest Service Manager replied it was a mistake made by F & B
c50634,s10,They confused my surname Wong with another guest and wrongly charged my credit card w/o any‚Ä¶
c50635,s1,"This hotel is managed very, very badly!!! We were sitting at the outside terrace of the Club Lounge on 4th floor at 21:30 and suddenly we got a shower with a very bad smell"
c50635,s2,We turned around and had to find out that just behind us they were spraying the plans with chemicals
c50635,s3,"Despite the very bad smell they were not able to tell us with what kind of chemicals we have been sprayed, we've just been informed that it's 'fertilizer'"
c50635,s4,This is absolutely not acceptable!!! A decent hotel management should be aware that the Club Lounge is open until 22:00 and therefore no chemical treatment should be done before 22:30
c50635,s5,But I'm honestly not very surprised about such a mismanagement at this hotel: after check in we came to our room and saw a lot of long black hair on the carpet and on the‚Ä¶
c50636,s1,"Despite the hotel and rooms being very nice, the food served at the pool cafe was by far the worst meal we have experienced in Asia"
c50636,s2,The menu only has 6 items and we ordered 3 of them so it is fair to say that we had a fair representation of what was on offer
c50636,s3,The salads were caked in mayo and the 3 sandwiches we ordered were bordering on inedible
c50636,s4,"All deep fried till they were like rubber, on rock hard bread, and again covered in mayo"
c50636,s5,"Unbelievably disappointing, we won't be back"
c50637,s1,I found the location to be an issue
c50637,s2,"This hotel is based on a small strip with some other hotels (Venetian, Holiday Inn etc"
c50637,s3,)
c50637,s4,It is far away from the main strip with the really good/fun/well-established hotels (eg
c50637,s5,Grand Lisboa/MGM Grand/Wynn)
c50637,s6,You need to get a taxi or shuttle bus to get to the other area
c50637,s7,The shuttle buses stop running at 11pm
c50637,s8,I found the choice of restaurants and bars limited and mediocre in and around the Sheraton
c50637,s9,"There was only one bar open after midnight in the hotel, and I was charged more for a Tsing Tao there than anywhere else on my week long trip to HK/Macau"
c50637,s10,The room was comfortable and quiet
c50637,s11,The breakfast was good - a very wide range of options
c50637,s12,I was staying again I would stay in the central area of Macau
c50637,s13,"You have not only a much, much better‚Ä¶"
c50638,s1,It was my second time staying in this hotel and would be my last time
c50638,s2,I have no complain on the hardware there but the staff were below the average
c50638,s3,1
c50638,s4,There were more than 10 used towels left on the floor of changing room of swimming pool
c50638,s5,2
c50638,s6,The staff in the restuarant have no intention to give way to you for breakfast but cut your way
c50638,s7,My table was next to their cupboard  and one of them placed the whole tray of folks and spoons on my table before they put them back to drawer
c50638,s8,3
c50638,s9,I used the express checkout and wrote down my email address for official receipt but i could get it after 2 weeks
c50638,s10,"I chased for SPG for another 2 weeks without any action done, until i gave up and went to Macau again"
c50638,s11,I got it in person and SPG communciation sent me the receipt on the same day
c50638,s12,‚Ä¶
c50639,s1,"Personal experience only:  Good: Room is spacious and comfortable  Bad: comforter is a bit dirty (with hair)  No lobby at all, quite confusing and nobody escorted us to SPG area (I've never seen a 5 stars hotel with no sofa near check-in area) ( finally found sofa available in SPG area)  Not efficient during our check-in, took like 15 minus and speak only Mandarin (don't speak Cantonese)  Breakfast is quite far away from our room, like 10 minus walk, and we've waited like 10 minus outside the restaurant assigned and it took me another 5 minus for queuing up for a scramble egg  Staffs seem to be inexperience, took me about 5 calls to check for a TV broadcasting schedule, and there were misleading information provided  There is no convenience store like 7-11 nearby, the nearest‚Ä¶"
c50640,s1,"First of all, I've never been to a 5 stars hotel that has no real lobby area, no sitting area, no sofa no nothing"
c50640,s2,It is a huge building divided by a few hotels and casino area in the middle
c50640,s3,"Poor direction signs, very confusing with the shuttle bus get off and pick up service ( to different entrance and they are far apart!)  Very weird swimming pool layout"
c50640,s4,"when we were there, the 8th floor pool was closed"
c50640,s5,"so only the 4th floor one was open, very strange 7-8 tiny pools, only 2 were heated"
c50640,s6,"others were cold as hell! Basically, they were just for a dip"
c50640,s7,"However, the service was fine, friendly and helpful staff"
c50640,s8,"the room was spacious, big bathroom with bathtub and shower"
c50640,s9,Wifi in the room for more than 2 device use
c50640,s10,thumbs up to that! Shuttle bus from the ferry‚Ä¶
c50641,s1,Not a good place
c50641,s2,Concierge is always busy to pick up the phone
c50641,s3,Casino dealers cannot speak a word of English and don't follow requests appropriately
c50641,s4,This hotel has a long way to go to meet international standard of a quality hotel
c50641,s5,Room seems like it was renovated in the 90s
c50642,s1,Stayed in Oct 2013 as couple
c50642,s2,"We spent a weekend getaway with Sheraton Macao, the property is pretty new, and the room is up to the normal Sheraton standard, but not a superb!  During the check-in, there's no SPG line, no matter whats your grading is, and there's loads of people at check in, and whatever we asked the staff at check-in, he wasn't quite listening"
c50642,s3,"Sheraton featured the 3 impressive outdoor swimming pools, that 2 of them are warm as 28 degree"
c50642,s4,"However, we found out that the 3 impressive outdoor swimming pools are split into smaller pools, like the one on 8th floor is split into 4 small pools, and on 4th floor, split into alot of pools"
c50642,s5,"and out of the pools, only 2 small pools are warmed, which is very disappointing"
c50642,s6,"BTW, please make sure you wear makeup‚Ä¶"
c50643,s1,We stayed at the Presidental Suite to celebrate my father's birthday but lot of the equipment is just decorative and serve no functional purpose
c50643,s2,"There is a karaoke room in the suite but the system doesn't work, there are TVs in the bathrooms and they don't work"
c50643,s3,There is a massage room but they don't offer in room massage service
c50643,s4,The phone doesn't work and there are no pay per view movies even though they installed an inbuilt Bose surround sound system with a 57 inches TV inside the suite
c50643,s5,The rooms are room but thy don't have family board games ready for rent even though they advertise themselves as a family friendly hotel
c50643,s6,"What's worse, we made all these notifications to our so called butler (which they advertise they would have but is actually non existent) but they‚Ä¶"
c50644,s1,I stayed here with a friend for one night when we went to Macau for a concert
c50644,s2,"While I'm impressed with the room, everything else seems to have gone downhill from there"
c50644,s3,"We were told at reception that we get free wi-fi service in our room, but apparently that wasn't the case, as we keep getting this pop-up message saying we need to pay in order to use the wi-fi"
c50644,s4,"Needless to say, we couldn't use wi-fi during our stay at the hotel"
c50644,s5,Not something I expected from a 5-star hotel
c50644,s6,Ordering room service was another disaster
c50644,s7,"They told us our food would arrive within 40 minutes after we placed the order, but we had to wait for over an hour"
c50644,s8,"When we call to check, the staff acted as if he did not even receive our order in the first place (then hung up on us)"
c50644,s9,We finally had to call‚Ä¶
c50645,s1,Sheraton is a new hotel just opened last year along with Conrad and Holiday Inn Cotai Centre
c50645,s2,"Since I'm a SPG member and also it claimed that it has the largest number of rooms (close to 4,000?), so I chose to stay at Sheraton for an experience"
c50645,s3,"The room rate per night is quite expensive, about HK$1,600 including tax without breakfast and it's already a promotional rate"
c50645,s4,"OK, it's like other 5 star hotels in Macao, they have a nice & big lobby area and the shopping mall is connected to Conrad and Holiday Inn"
c50645,s5,"Of course, there's a casino down there too"
c50645,s6,"When I checked in, the front desk staff spoke to me in Putonghua"
c50645,s7,"I talked to him in Cantonese, but he didn't understand and then I talked to him in English, but he's english is poor"
c50645,s8,My feeling is the hotel just prepare for the‚Ä¶
c50646,s1,I am SPG member and am always satisfied with this hotel group except for Sheraton Macao! It was our anniversary trip which we have advised the hotel and they confirmed by e-mail there'll be special arrangement
c50646,s2,"It turned out nothing was done! We checked in with a Chinese staff, she mentioned they were aware of our anniversary, I heard she called housekeeping then we were told to wait for at least half an hour more to let them prepare the room"
c50646,s3,"We came back an hour later and approached another Philippine staff to get the room keys, he seemed not welcoming with no smile"
c50646,s4,We went up to the room expecting something different from the normal guest room
c50646,s5,"Surprisingly, there is nothing prepared! Why do we have to wait then? Called the front desk, they did apologized and sent us a‚Ä¶"
c50647,s1,My husband and I passed five days in this hotel
c50647,s2,Rooms are correct
c50647,s3,Except that it is freezing inside if you dont turn off the aircon
c50647,s4,Pools are pretty good except that most of the time it is crowded by childrens
c50647,s5,wifi: well if you dont pay too bad for you
c50647,s6,since all the hotels and casinos in this areas are linked you have no chance to get it for free
c50647,s7,Location is ok too
c50647,s8,well deserved by the shuttles
c50647,s9,Honestly since all the hotels are connected you can pass easily from one hotel to an other and they all look exactly the same
c50647,s10,"All huge ,cold as death, same exact casinos, same restaurants"
c50647,s11,concierge desk is pretty helpful usually and keen to help
c50648,s1,I initially booked one night in this hotel based on feedbacks I read on trip advisor
c50648,s2,What a disappointment
c50648,s3,The staff was rude and not professional at all
c50648,s4,We decided to book an extra night because of the typhoon and my daughter was booking online for us at 12:30pm but the staff forced us to check out at 12:30 sharp (already considered as late check out!!) and we had to drag all our luggage out even though we told them that we will be staying an additional night and payment was in process
c50648,s5,"After 5 min waiting at the lobby, the staff informed us that payment was validated and we can drag back our luggage back to our room"
c50648,s6,This was really ridiculous and we were really unhappy about that
c50648,s7,They didn't even apologize for making us wait
c50648,s8,"When we checked out, I forgot my charger in‚Ä¶"
c50649,s1,We decided to go for a short family weekend to Macau
c50649,s2,The Sheraton Macau offered a nice deal which I could pay off by SPG points
c50649,s3,Usually we stay at the Westin as it still is (even though a bit outdated) a very nice family oriented beach resort
c50649,s4,We checked the website of the Sheraton and were quiet impressed of the pool area especially my daughter was highly enthusiastic
c50649,s5,"Once we checked in, I was welcomed by a nice german manager to the ""world biggest sheraton"" Well, when I heard that I was a little bit concerned"
c50649,s6,"Unfortunately, my concerns turned out to be correct"
c50649,s7,Matter of fact the pool area is dedicated for people which cannot swim
c50649,s8,None of the pools was deeper than 1
c50649,s9,3 metres
c50649,s10,"Moreover my daughter was disappointed about the lack of some poolf fun such as water slides,‚Ä¶"
c50650,s1,This is the first visit to their pool area as I am going with my nephew but adult can't really swim as most of them were in irregular shapes
c50650,s2,"Also when you walk with you bare feet, you just felt it was not clean properly"
c50650,s3,My newphew got Dermatosis after 3 day trip
c50650,s4,Poor him!
c50651,s1,"Before the expansion, I really regarded this hotel high in quality of service, but with the expansion of a new tower, the quality of service is far far behind the expansion"
c50651,s2,"Being a SPG member, I really cannot sense any special treatment I enjoy the IHG member"
c50651,s3,"Before, early check-in was allowed with one to two hour late check out"
c50651,s4,"Now, definitely not"
c50651,s5,"When I called the cocinerage for booking a restaurant through the operator, I was told they were too busy to pick up my call"
c50651,s6,"Minutes later, a lady asked me the details of my booking"
c50651,s7,"Then minutes later, she simply told me that she could not book successfully for no one picked up her call"
c50651,s8,She promised to call me later
c50651,s9,"Yet, hours later, near 4:30 p"

c50652,s1,We have travelled throughout mainland China and are now in Macao
c50652,s2,The checkin took 1 hour and the rooms we booked online 2 months ago were not ready
c50652,s3,Room service meals took 40 minutes so once again have to say Sheraton does not meet our service expectations
c50652,s4,beds are comfortable and well appointed
c50652,s5,Think I will be giving Sheraton a miss in future
c50653,s1,"Stayed here for 5 nights, booked 3 rooms"
c50653,s2,"So I've seen their Executive suite (upgraded), the normal deluxe? room and the Family suite"
c50653,s3,"We were very impressed on the first day, right from the airport transfer, to the amazing rooms"
c50653,s4,"During the stay, we got less impressed with the service until finally, some of us got locked out in the pool"
c50653,s5,Good: - Family suite is actually 2 identical rooms combined
c50653,s6,"On 1 side is the kids room with Wii games (Madagascar only), double-decker beds (which got the kids so excited until they realised the upper deck's bed was hard), play area, and yes - a bathroom all by themselves"
c50653,s7,"The space and the extras (kids bath set, slippers, robes) made it worthwhile"

c50654,s1,Hotel/Room: A new hotel in Macau equipped with comprehensive room facilities
c50654,s2,Room is clean and tidy Easy to access by taking free Shuttle Bus nearby Pier
c50654,s3,Hotel provides free breakfast
c50654,s4,I must to say that the food provided satisfied different people from different nationality
c50654,s5,Good Job!  The hotel is too crowded
c50654,s6,Everywhere is people
c50654,s7,No matter doing check in/check out
c50655,s1,The stay in the hotel in Aug proved to be fruitful
c50655,s2,"The room was proper cleaned up, bathroom was excellent just few things were missing such as personalized service, Luggage pick up"
c50655,s3,"We had to take our luggage to our rooms personally, no porter service was provided"
c50655,s4,The bathroom was extraordinary excellent and had shower in it with wall as well as hand
c50655,s5,which is quite comfortable and missing in many other hotels
c50655,s6,Hotel is quite big and have good ambience
c50656,s1,I had a very brief stay at Macau and was very disappointed at the service provided by the hotel
c50656,s2,"The room facility was barely a three-star, though the hotel claimed that it is a 4"
c50656,s3,5 star
c50656,s4,"This asides, my biggest issue is with their concierge"
c50656,s5,The staffs were not helpful at all when I asked to purchase boat tickets to get to HK airport
c50656,s6,They were very stubborn and suggested me take the shuttle 2 hours before the boat departure time
c50656,s7,"I questioned whether I needed to prepare that much time in advance, but she insisted"
c50656,s8,I took her advice and waited at the port for 1
c50656,s9,5 hours
c50656,s10,I think they should provide more realistic suggestion to tourists as it's their job to provide guests with a good travel experience
c50656,s11,"Maybe it is just Macau style, but I am very unhappy about the stay there"
c50657,s1,We stayed here for one night so we could see a show
c50657,s2,Location was good
c50657,s3,We were offered an upgrade for the room and breakfast included
c50657,s4,"The room itself was very good but hotel guests obviously don't look out of the window! The view was over a lot of building rubble! The breakfast was, in a word - terrible! We ended up going out to a coffee shop"
c50657,s5,If you want to go to the casino and see a show then the hotel is fine abd rhe front desk staff tried to be very helpful
c50657,s6,Just don't  have breakfast!
c50658,s1,A nice and clean hotel but possibly not 5 star
c50658,s2,It's felt like a 1km walk from the coach drop off to the reception desk and another 1km walk to the room
c50658,s3,Maybe OK if you have no luggage but exhausting with three cases
c50658,s4,The room view on the upper floors over Cotai Strip are fantastic
c50658,s5,The check in at 3pm and check out at 11am make this hotel a sleep place only if staying one day
c50658,s6,The Italian restaurant on the ground floor has great food and wine at reasonable prices
c50659,s1,We stayed in this hotel for vacation during the summer
c50659,s2,Some points that people may consider before making the choice:  1) Very small and crowded swimming pool
c50659,s3,2) No lifeguard on duty at the swimming pool
c50659,s4,This is stated on the stainless steel signage in the swimming pool area
c50659,s5,3) we have complimentary buffet breakfast provided at G/F restaurant
c50659,s6,"However, there was too many people queuing up even at 10:10am ( the breakfast time will end at 10:30 am), we were led by the restaurant manager to have breakfast at 4/F function room"
c50659,s7,"No need to queue up there, but the variety of food choice are much less than the ordinary restaurant"
c50659,s8,4) The hotel room is cozy and clean
c50659,s9,The bed is also comfortable
c50660,s1,The hotel was packed when I arrived
c50660,s2,The check in queue snaked all over the reception area
c50660,s3,Since I had booked the club room I hoped to skip this queue and check in at the club level
c50660,s4,Advice given by the staff was confusing
c50660,s5,They have two towers and the staff who told me the floor failed to mention this
c50660,s6,"Of course I had to go to the wrong tower and it took quite a while to get to the club floor, lugging my big suitcase too"
c50660,s7,Checking in at the club floor took quite a while
c50660,s8,Soft drinks were available but no hot drinks! I was told hot drinks would only be available from 11 o'clock
c50660,s9,I think this is the first time a club lounge offers no hot drinks outside scheduled time
c50660,s10,"After checking in, there was no one to show me to the lifts to my room"
c50660,s11,Again I had to lugged my bag around‚Ä¶
c50661,s1,first impression was poor with the hotel check in being a mere 5 metres from the casino floor and the smell of smoke was very strong coming from the gaming area
c50661,s2,If you're not coming to Macau to gamble i would suggest to choose somewhere other than here
c50661,s3,On the plus side even the standard rooms are massive and the beds are super comfortable and with the complete blackout curtains and soundproof walls it was easy to get a peaceful nights sleep
c50661,s4,Try to request a view overlooking Cotai as the view at the back of the hotel overlooks a desolate swamp and is a little depressing
c50661,s5,Also be mindful there are limited good western food options outside of the set breakfast/lunch/dinner times
c50662,s1,"This Hotel is decorated in 'Earth'  tones, which has been fashionable in the hotel industry in the last few years"
c50662,s2,All that brown makes the hotel very dull looking and it would seem contributes to the  bored looks on the face of the staff
c50662,s3,The Feast restaurant at 3
c50662,s4,"00 pm took up to 40 minutes to serve me and my friends with Prawns Piri Piri, a Beef burger a Hot Dog"
c50662,s5,We were the only 3 people in the restaurant
c50662,s6,"My friend thought that her massage at the Spa was excellent  We were on a one night package, in a standard room"
c50662,s7,Very average
c50662,s8,I would not visit again
c50663,s1,"First off, when you walk in, all you smell is cigarettes"
c50663,s2,It's ok to smoke in the casinos and the casino is the forefront if the lobby
c50663,s3,The lobby feels tiny because it wraps around the casino
c50663,s4,It's hard to find where to enter to check in
c50663,s5,Hoards of other mainland chinese block the entrance to the check I'm entrance
c50663,s6,There was a worker standing there and could see I was looking for something but completely ignored me
c50663,s7,The front desk check in was easy and painless
c50663,s8,"When I asked about wifi in the room, they said pay $30 an hour or you can have it for the whole day for $120"
c50663,s9,That was a huge disappointment
c50663,s10,The next morning we awoke to a tiny dead cockroach on our sheets
c50663,s11,I was furious
c50663,s12,"When I brought it up to the staff, they said it happens and would gladly switch rooms for us"
c50663,s13,‚Ä¶
c50664,s1,This was the first time I stayed in this hotel for two nights
c50664,s2,"But my experience was when I entered the room, the size and view of room were not totally disappointed"
c50664,s3,Extra charge for wifi in the room was required
c50664,s4,I will not recommend my friends or relative to stay in this hotel
c50664,s5,Since another hotel in macau with similar charges but better services and view than here
c50665,s1,"This is our first stay in Sheraton Macau, was wow by the room as we were stayed in the Executive Suite"
c50665,s2,The room is great and amazing
c50665,s3,Very huge and it makes us  feel very comfortable during our 2 nights stay
c50665,s4,"I checked in in the noon, was out for dinner but when I returned to my room my sofa bed is not fixed yet"
c50665,s5,As I was told it will be fixed soon right after I left the room
c50665,s6,Not to mention the bathroom was extremely fun and modern
c50665,s7,"A nice bathroom that we had, only cons is there isn't any hot water when we are getting our  shower"
c50665,s8,"Breakfast on the last day was ok, we were queuing for the breakfast, until it was our turn the manager asked us whether our room are included with breakfast? and I said no"
c50665,s9,"So he looked at me and said, breakfast needs to pay if you want to‚Ä¶"
c50666,s1,The Sheraton is sadly poorly organized with unmotivated staff and lack of basic training
c50666,s2,Maybe it's the gambling environment that makes all staff so disinterested and slow to act
c50666,s3,A very disappointing experience for the normally fabulous Sheraton chain
c50667,s1,"Brand new Sheraton, good location, nicely done rooms, atmosphere was good, nice hotel, but"
c50667,s2,I was extremely disappointed by the breakfast buffet
c50667,s3,"I know, I know it's free, included with the room so I shouldn't complain, what can you expect from a free service"
c50667,s4,"Well, I expect better"
c50667,s5,I travel a lot and normally stay at a competing chain's hotels but they don't have a property in Macao yet
c50667,s6,"So, I booked at Sheraton expecting similar level of service"
c50667,s7,The problem was just a lack of choices
c50667,s8,"They had waffles but only syrup for toppings, limited breads & salad choices and the bacon looked like a pile of undercooked soggy noodles"
c50667,s9,Bacon should be crispy for heaven's sake!  I ate a plate of fruit and left
c50667,s10,This morning I chose to skip it altogether
c50667,s11,For me the breakfast‚Ä¶
c50668,s1,"I am a loyal customers with Sheraton and SPG guest, and have been staying in Sheraton hotels for more than 50 times around the world"
c50668,s2,"However, our last two visits with Macau Sheraton were an unpleasant stay for us"
c50668,s3,"Firstly, due to the uneven air-conditioning in room, I wanna to request for an extra blanket, however, I was told that it was not available and even I requested to pay for the service but in vain"
c50668,s4,"In addition, I stayed with my room for 2 nights, however, the housekeeping rang the room bell twice to wake me up at 10:00 a"
c50668,s5,m
c50668,s6,"on the 1st morning for cleaning up, a 2-star service?     No extra toilet paper in washroom and  should I call room-services to request for urgent assistance?"
c50669,s1,"We were very excited about the DreamWorks holiday advertised and booked a family suite and unluckily, the weather was stormy and we arrived during Typhoon 8"
c50669,s2,"While the hotel was not responsible for the weather, the entire experience was far below average and where do I start?   The room was fun for the kids but that was about the only good thing about this entire stay"
c50669,s3,"Service was dismal and everywhere, staff seemed reluctant to help, disinterested and overworked"
c50669,s4,"Towels and amenities were not replenished daily; one day we were missing hand towels, another day, there was no bath mat"
c50669,s5,We have family holidays in Macau often and we usually stay at the Galaxy
c50669,s6,"After this experience, we will steer clear of Cotai"
c50669,s7,"I never appreciated the design, layout and service at Galaxy as much‚Ä¶"
c50670,s1,"Having stayed in Macau numerous times, I can say that this hotel falls short"
c50670,s2,This hotel opened up less than a year ago so the standards should be high being that Macau is continuously growing becoming more competitive
c50670,s3,"First off, I was put off by the fact that the wifi here is not free"
c50670,s4,Free in the lobby but you have to pay in the rooms
c50670,s5,$30 an hour or $120 a day
c50670,s6,Quite ridiculous
c50670,s7,"So needless to say, it looks like waves of hoarders in the lobby"
c50670,s8,"They sit wherever there is room to, which is already limited, with their faces glued to their phones taking advantage of the free wifi"
c50670,s9,So no sitting room in the hotel
c50670,s10,This leads to the next turn off:  The lobby is set up oddly
c50670,s11,"The casino is dead center so the rest of the hotel sort of wraps around it, leaving a narrow walkway that‚Ä¶"
c50671,s1,"the hotel offers quite decent value for money, although do not take the club lounge benefits, as there are no benefits and really not worth the extra money"
c50671,s2,"rooms are decent size, clean and has all you need for a couple of nights"
c50671,s3,The hotel is part of the Sands Cotai complex and it's easy to walk around and get to adjacent City of Dreams and Venetian / Four Seasons
c50671,s4,There is a casino in the hotel which is pretty average too
c50671,s5,It was August and must have been peak season school holidays - the place was so busy with huge tour groups and kids everywhere
c50671,s6,"Breakfast was a real free for all and due to the amount of people, a lot of the dishes were quite often empty"
c50671,s7,Worst egg chef I've come across
c50671,s8,Food is very average to say the least
c50672,s1,"Extract from Sheraton Macao website: ""For adults wanting a break from the cheery chirping of children, the tranquil Tiki Pool is the place to go"
c50672,s2,The adults-only pool is bordered by sun lounges and 18 private cabanas with fans and daybeds and peers spectacularly over the buzzing Cotai Strip
c50672,s3,""" I need a short breaks & i picked Sheraton Macao for 3D2N due to there's a ADULT ONLY swimmig pool at 8/F, the Tiki Pool, according to their webite"
c50672,s4,"Understand it is summertime, many families will go Macau for a short trip & i am travel alone who is looking for relaxation, so i think Sheraton is perfect for me even the ROOM ONLY costs HKD1"
c50672,s5,5k+ per night under early booking
c50672,s6,"After check in, i check with the front desk on the opening hours for the adult only swimming pool"
c50672,s7,The staff at the‚Ä¶
c50673,s1,Checked in late one rainy night
c50673,s2,"The lobby is a zoo, Grand Central Station is calm compared to this place"
c50673,s3,Staff was wonderful
c50673,s4,Room was without faults
c50673,s5,Went to the Italian restaurant
c50673,s6,It was wonderful! Breakfast was a zoo as well
c50674,s1,This hotel is the worst hotel with service compared in the other sheaton hotel in different country i have been lived
c50674,s2,My friends and I lived in this hotel for 3 nights today
c50674,s3,We just checked out today
c50674,s4,Our Room no
c50674,s5,23139
c50674,s6,in earth building
c50674,s7,"There are some truth experiences happened to us for your refrence, you have to know before you stay"
c50674,s8,1
c50674,s9,"First, the check in service is very slowly, according the hotel manager speaking, there are more than 3000 guests live in high season, they cannot help about it"
c50674,s10,"According my understanding, as a five stars hotel, it is NOT a reason to make your customer keep in line for 20-30 min"
c50674,s11,2
c50674,s12,"There are bag carrier services after check in, but not for all the people due to many guests"
c50674,s13,I thought it is basic service for a Sheaton standard
c50674,s14,3
c50674,s15,The bed is too‚Ä¶
c50675,s1,You stayed at the family suite with 2 young children while they have the big summer Dreamworks promotion
c50675,s2,"The rooms are perfect for families, it has bunk bed, tv and games"
c50675,s3,Kids enjoyed it a lot
c50675,s4,"When we arrived, front desk staff accommodated us with early check in"
c50675,s5,Front desk staff needs to be more familiar with the own promotion package
c50675,s6,"I was missing free wifi, qube tickets and breakfast for the children"
c50675,s7,Their also comes with a welcome packet for kids
c50675,s8,"Unfortunately, they kept telling me only one per room"
c50675,s9,"I have 2 kids, are they supposed to fight for it? After I talked to the staff on the phone, they sent another staff to bring us another welcome packet and qube tickets"
c50675,s10,I asked the about the activities for kids when they gave me the promotion card
c50675,s11,It was very confusing
c50675,s12,‚Ä¶
c50676,s1,"Hotel is clean and modern, very convenient sitting amongst the Sand's Cotai complex"
c50676,s2,"Shops, restaurants and of course, the casino"
c50676,s3,"It is a big hotel, and span's across two towers"
c50676,s4,"Check-in was slow, as an SPG member since 1999, it was the first time I had to wait 15 mins in queue to actually check in"
c50676,s5,"Arrived around 4 pm on a Friday, if that makes a difference"
c50676,s6,"They never tell you  that there are two lobbies to check in, which could have made it easier"
c50676,s7,"Also, the directions to your room are not clear, particularly if you come off the ferry bus at the back of the building you need to walk through the arcade for quite a distance to find the lift lobby"
c50676,s8,"My only negative feedback here is the breakfast, I was allocated to the Caspian Room on the 4th floor, which is a function‚Ä¶"
c50677,s1,"Spent a night with the Executive Suite which was nice, well-equipped and relaxing"
c50677,s2,NO argument on facilities and provisions as they are the first class
c50677,s3,"However, services are the issues, especially for the club lounge and spa reception"
c50677,s4,The club lounge is not that private as it is like a restaurant serving big crowd of people during breakfast and cocktail
c50677,s5,Not the type of privacy you could find normally on a E Floor
c50677,s6,The individual quality of staff there need improvement
c50677,s7,Spa treatment was good but the greetings of reception was poor
c50677,s8,Time to improve
c50678,s1,We booked this Hotel just for the family suite which included a child bed and wii
c50678,s2,"Overall, the Hotel is spectacular and the staff is awesome"
c50678,s3,There are 2 reasons why I would rate this Hotel average and not excellent:  1
c50678,s4,Had a very bad time getting to the Hotel
c50678,s5,"Once you get out of the ferry terminal, you can see signs and people from almost every Hotel in Macau"
c50678,s6,What you could not see is a sign of Hotel Sheraton
c50678,s7,Carrying luggage up and down to find the right shuttle was a real pain
c50678,s8,The management should do something about this
c50678,s9,2
c50678,s10,Bars and Restaurants are not open late night
c50678,s11,We came back at around 2 AM after watching the IIFA awards and we could not find a place to eat
c50678,s12,Restaurants in the casino are open till late but not for 24 hours
c50678,s13,Very difficult to have a quick snack‚Ä¶
c50679,s1,"At the time of writing this review, after midnight, a pool side private party in the Sheraton still continue and the noisy music keep my family, staying on the 17th floor, awake including my eight months old baby"
c50679,s2,so this is the behaviour of Sheraton which sacrifices the interest of its guest and could not offer them a good night sleep
c50680,s1,"Built as part of Sand's latest Cotai Central property, this place will sure awe it's guests at first glance"
c50680,s2,Tropical lobby and luxury conference/expo facilities
c50680,s3,"Being a Macau resort, luxury furnishing and deluxe amenities are expected and are delivered at this hotel"
c50680,s4,"This place takes loyalty very seriously, they have a mezzanine lobby, just for its SPG members, they get a special keycard and personalised welcome"
c50680,s5,"And of course, their casino VIPs get the same"
c50680,s6,"Having stayed at this hotel quite a few times, I understand how some reviewers experienced a 5 star stay and some who would have regretted their choices"
c50680,s7,"It all depends on the staff you meet, they can become very inconsistent"
c50680,s8,"When it's busy and lots of casino guests are checking in, you may be greeted by staff with an‚Ä¶"
c50681,s1,Upon check in: We stayed at this hotel due to Venetian was fully book during my travelling period
c50681,s2,"As my business conference was at Venetian, i decided to book this hotel room from their website since it was located just opposite Venetian"
c50681,s3,"Upon check in, i was referred to their normal check in counter to wait for my turn even i was SPG member"
c50681,s4,"(the staff told me ""it was the same"")"
c50681,s5,"For your information, the Starwood Preferred Guest check-in counter has nice sofa and complimentary drink for our partner or family to sit down comfortably while waiting for check in procedure to complete"
c50681,s6,This is absolutely difference from standing blindly waiting along the queue for check in ya
c50681,s7,The first impression for Sheraton Macau Cotai is not good already
c50681,s8,Room: We had the second last room‚Ä¶
c50682,s1,Was allocated room in the new Earth Tower which was only opened in Jan 2013
c50682,s2,Quick check-in and hassle-free check-out
c50682,s3,Large and spacious bathroom with both bathtub and standing shower
c50682,s4,Bed is large and comfortable
c50682,s5,Free internet is available only at the hotel lobby
c50682,s6,Links conveniently to The Venetian via the covered overhead bridge
c50682,s7,"Breakfast is included in the package, but we did not eat in, so could not comment on in"
c50683,s1,Family of two adults and two young kids stayed for one night
c50683,s2,Big hotel in cotai area close to other hotels and casinos
c50683,s3,Seems that Sheraton pools were all closed except for one small pool
c50683,s4,Not good
c50683,s5,Kids wanted to swim but it was just too crowded which takes away from the enjoyment
c50683,s6,For a weeknight we paid quite a bit
c50683,s7,Could have gotten room at larger Venetian
c50683,s8,"Rooms clean, ok size"
c50683,s9,but no wifi
c50683,s10,A bit strange for new 5 star hotel
c50683,s11,"Unless prices come down, we will stay at other places in cotai next time"
c50684,s1,First time to Macao so wasn't really sure what to expect
c50684,s2,Chose the Sheraton as the deals they were offering at the time made them around 30% cheaper than any of the other hotels
c50684,s3,"Situated on the Cotai side, it's still only a 15 minute ride by taxi over to where the Wynn, etc are all located, but being on the Cotai side it's 5 min from Macau Airport and the Tapai Ferry terminals as well as Caesars Golf Club"
c50684,s4,It's also connected by a walk bridge over to the Venetian
c50684,s5,"Living in Singapore, so used to Marina Bay Sands and also having done Vegas a few times, the Sheraton is like a mini cut down version of any of the big hotels on the Vegas strip"
c50684,s6,"First things first, it's not overly busy so check in and check out is nice and easy and you avoid the usual 'Vegas-esque' queues"
c50684,s7,‚Ä¶
c50685,s1,Visited the premises on a business trip
c50685,s2,My hosts booked me into this one since it was the closest to the Venetian which was our daily meeting point
c50685,s3,Walked into the room where to my horror the wall that separates the bed from the bathroom was covered in spit
c50685,s4,The rest of the room was quite dirty but the bathroom looked fresh
c50685,s5,I immediately informed them and they came to clean it
c50685,s6,For my 4 day stay they changed the towels but never really cleaned again
c50685,s7,NO WIFI in rooms and even if you want to pay its only available on LAN
c50685,s8,Ridiculous if your on business just with a smartphone
c50685,s9,The lobby offers free wifi but with the casino attracting hundreds of people at all times you have no internet and your phone bill will kill you
c50685,s10,Breakfast seems to be an issue for everyone on business as‚Ä¶
c50686,s1,It was my 1st visit of Macau and therefore I have choosen a well known hotel
c50686,s2,I am used to stay in 5 star Kempinski hotels and my expectation was to find something similar
c50686,s3,I make every morning some exercises and yoga and doing that I have to lay down at the floor
c50686,s4,Being in that position I looked around and saw the chair in front of the desk
c50686,s5,And I saw the dust from the last weeks or even months! The chair was so dirty that I got a very bad impression about the cleanliness of this hotel
c50686,s6,Talking to my chinese friends they told me that this is just normal in China but for a me used to the eurpean standard this is not acceptable
c50686,s7,My frustration was completed when they denied to write on my bill that breakfast was not included
c50686,s8,"""Our software does not allow any change and for the‚Ä¶"
c50687,s1,"I have to be honest, I was not that impressed with the Sheraton Macau"
c50687,s2,Service was a bit slow
c50687,s3,"I requested a non smoking room, and the room REAKED of Cigar smoke"
c50687,s4,I called to complain from the lobby because even the phone was unhooked in the room
c50687,s5,So they sent someone up 20 minutes later who also agreed that the rooms smelled like smoke
c50687,s6,It was really nasty that they even put anyone in that room
c50687,s7,"Other than that, the rooms are typical Sheraton rooms, dont expect fast room service, the hotel is so large that it takes them forever just to bring ice"
c50687,s8,Location is pretty good since its right across the Venetian which I stayed at the month prior
c50687,s9,"I think if you can spend the money, go for the venetian, their smallest room is 75 sqm"
c50687,s10,"Buffet was not bad, but cheap"
c50687,s11,you get what‚Ä¶
c50688,s1,The Sheraton itself is a largely anonymous hotel that shares a casino and shopping mall with the adjoining Conrad and Holiday Inn on the newly developed Cotai Strip
c50688,s2,supposedly the Macao Vegas
c50688,s3,"The problem is, it has the buildings but zero atmosphere"
c50688,s4,"something further exaggerated by the now ubiquitous designer shopping mall (I counted 4 Omega shops, 2 Dunhill stores and 4 IWCshops in 3 adjacent hotel / casino/ malls)"
c50688,s5,As you can gather this review is as much coloured by the Macao strip as anything else
c50688,s6,"Where as Vegas has a unique character to it, Macao is soulless"
c50688,s7,The casino floors have no vibe and are often half empty
c50688,s8,"Clearly the move towards a smoking ban hasn't reached Macao yet and despite requesting and, after some negotiating, getting a non-smoking room, the‚Ä¶"
c50689,s1,This was my first and probably the last time staying at the new Sheraton
c50689,s2,I travelled with my friend for a girls weekend away and booked the Club Floor deal so we could get some peace and quiet
c50689,s3,"Sadly, this did not happen for us"
c50689,s4,We were escorted to the Sky Tower Club Lounge
c50689,s5,it was quiet a walk from the shuttle bus lobby
c50689,s6,It is huge and looks like a restaurant bar more than a business lounge
c50689,s7,One end is the dining area for bfast and cocktails and the other is a large relaxing space
c50689,s8,In the middle is a smaller bar area where afternoon tea is served
c50689,s9,We got checked in quickly by a friendly staff and our room was ready
c50689,s10,"Our room was on a high floor but nothing special, it was just their standard room type"
c50689,s11,It was small compared to the Venetian and we were rather disappointed‚Ä¶
c50690,s1,The shuttle bus from Macau Ferry Terminal dropped me off at the east wing instead of the main lobby of Sheraton
c50690,s2,"When I walked in, I saw the big sign of SPG from the left hand side of general check-in counter"
c50690,s3,"As there were a lot of non-SPG members, I asked the staff if there was any available staff dedicated to SPG customers"
c50690,s4,The staff told me that I would have to walk all the way to the main lobby
c50690,s5,"When I walked towards to the main lobby, I found another SPG counter"
c50690,s6,Again there were no staff
c50690,s7,I asked another hotel staff for help and he told me that the counter was closed as it was lunch time
c50690,s8,But I had never seen any staff at that SPG counter during my stay
c50690,s9,The same thing happened to another SPG counter near to the Earth Tower
c50690,s10,The only available SPG counter was in the‚Ä¶
c50691,s1,"I am a Starwood fan but this was clearly ""City of dreams/Sands"" The staff were great but the exec club was so far below mainland China or Starwood managed it was laughable!  It was Super 8 or 168 in the Club level"
c50691,s2,Why so cheap?
c50692,s1,We spent one night in the executive floor with club lounge facilities
c50692,s2,The hotel room was not too big and the decoration was just average
c50692,s3,The white paint on the washroom door fell off and made the room looked dated even though it should be quite a new hotel
c50692,s4,We went to the lounge that had very dim light and it looked like a bar rather than a business lounge!   Both the cocktails and breakfast offered large varieties of food but the environment in the lounge was noisy and looked like a buffet restaurant!  The swimming pool was not big and was crowded with people!
c50693,s1,I waited a few weeks to write this review because I wanted to see if my disappointment with this hotel decreased
c50693,s2,"However, after all this time, I am still regretting my decision to stay at the Sheraton Macau"
c50693,s3,We chose this hotel over the Holiday Inn because as SPG members we have always been impressed with the high quality service from the Sheraton brand
c50693,s4,"However, if I ever go back to Macau then I would definitely choose the Galaxy or the Holiday Inn over the Sheraton"
c50693,s5,"After prepaying our room in advance, we were informed by our airline that our flight had been cancelled so we would need to fly home a day earlier"
c50693,s6,After many painful discussions with the Sheraton they were unwilling to refund our additional night
c50693,s7,We weren‚Äôt happy but ok with this especially since we‚Ä¶
c50694,s1,This is an interesting property for a variety of the reasons
c50694,s2,"It's the biggest Sheraton in the world, with literally thousands of rooms on the sprawling property, and they're not small"
c50694,s3,"As a Platinum SPG member, I was upgraded from my standard room to a Deluxe Suite that approached 1000 feet, with a media room, full living room, and enormous bathroom"
c50694,s4,"Suite upgrades, from what I can tell, are far from uncommon, and the materials in these rooms are literally shiny and new"
c50694,s5,Everything is glossy and modern
c50694,s6,These are some of the best rooms you'll see within the Sheraton system
c50694,s7,"The club lounge is enormous and almost comically overstaffed; every time I visited the lounge, I was greeted by no fewer than five employees"
c50694,s8,"The lows, though, make it clear how this is still a young‚Ä¶"
c50695,s1,We are a young couple who came to macau for a relaxing weekend away
c50695,s2,We decided to pay more for the Club Floor as thought it would be nice to have some extra things included during our stay
c50695,s3,We have enjpyed the club floor at pther hotels during our travels but we both felt that it was not worth the extra money at the Sheraton
c50695,s4,Both times we went to the club lounge we had to queue up for tables and the staff were rushing around trying to seat people
c50695,s5,"Tables were cluttered with dishes and they were under staffed, lining up beside the toilets was not pleasant"
c50695,s6,"We did not enjoy the club lounge, it is dark and quite far away from the club floor rooms"
c50695,s7,"There are no other benefits staying in a club room, you get breakfast included and the afternoon tea in the lounge"
c50695,s8,There is no‚Ä¶
c50696,s1,"To those of you that arrive Macau by ferry, just want to let you know that there is a free shuttle provided from the hotel  at the Macau Ferry Terminal"
c50696,s2,"Honestly, you won't see the sign like any other shuttle to other famous hotels, follow the sign for shuttle and just walk to the other side and you will see that Green Color bus, that's for Sheraton"
c50696,s3,"The hotel is actually at Cotai Strip, which you can find Venetian & Hard Rock hotel or Dream City is just near by and is also next to Holiday Inn Hotel, so everything seems just like walking distance which is nice"
c50696,s4,"Check in: I think her name is Karen and she is such a sweetheart, she is so patiently assist us for the registration"
c50696,s5,"Sheraton must be lucky to have her, seriously, she is one of best customer service I received"
c50696,s6,(But‚Ä¶
c50697,s1,First time stay in this new Sheraton for a friday night after work
c50697,s2,"The room is nice, staff is helpful, everything just like my previous experience in Sheraton hotels"
c50697,s3,"Well, however when I check out in the next morning,  I was told I have had breakfast in earlier time, which I didn't"
c50697,s4,"And I was told to wait so that they can check what happened, that's still fine for me"
c50697,s5,"Later on another staff come to us with the receipt of the breakfast, telling me that he/she could quote my room number and my full name to consume the breakfast"
c50697,s6,"Then she demand my friend and I to sign on a blank paper so that she can ""VERIFY"" the signature on the receipt"
c50697,s7,We know we shouldn't but we did sign as we're in a hurry
c50697,s8,"Finally she told me that the breakfast charge is ""WAIVED"" for me, I questioned‚Ä¶"
c50698,s1,Did not expect this is a style of new furbished Sheraton
c50698,s2,I expect more to the brand of Sheraon
c50698,s3,"In terms of Location, it was great as connected to other hotels and casino"
c50698,s4,"however, too packed in the lobby and seems like a four-star hotel for guestroom corridor"
c50698,s5,"Room size was large, offer double-double rooms which I do expect"
c50698,s6,Bathroom was not clean enough
c50698,s7,would rather choose to stay Conrad for next stay
c50699,s1,I have been stayed there 2 months ago
c50699,s2,the hotel is average
c50699,s3,the facilities seems not new even they just opening not longtime
c50699,s4,But it is very rediculous that I havent get my accommodation deposit back yet since 2 month
c50699,s5,they keep telling me just 5days
c50699,s6,5days
c50699,s7,and that is not their fault for this problem
c50699,s8,i have to say the service is suck!!! how they treat their guest?  or they dont do breifing for work?
c50700,s1,"After having read all of the very positive reviews about the Sheraton Macau, I was really looking forward to our stay"
c50700,s2,"However, I return home rather disasppointed by the who experience"
c50700,s3,The hotel is new and as such it looks great
c50700,s4,"I have no complaints about the ""hardware"" (ok, I have one, which I will mention below)"
c50700,s5,"The hotel rooms are adequately sized, if not very large"
c50700,s6,The facilities are all very good
c50700,s7,The bed is extremely comortable and I slept very well both nights we were there
c50700,s8,The bathroom was large and had all of the essential facilties
c50700,s9,"The toilet itself was slow to fill after use and a little noisy, but no big deal"
c50700,s10,The only issue I have with the room is the soundproofing to the corridor
c50700,s11,The door is very thin and basically you can hear everything that goes on in‚Ä¶
c50701,s1,Friends arranged an Easter weekend in Macau for a celebration and we stayed at the Sheraton
c50701,s2,It was everyone's first time
c50701,s3,Caught the free shuttle at the airport for the hotel which was a short 10-min ride away
c50701,s4,We did expect a busy crowd for the holiday weekend but were pleasantly surprised to find the check-in desk queue fairly short
c50701,s5,We got rooms on the 13th floor and on the side facing the pool which looked to be on the 10th level or so
c50701,s6,Beware though of rooms 1333 upwards as the view is not directly of the pool but of the power generators etc on the roof top next to the pool
c50701,s7,Quite unslightly but some may not mind if they don't spend a lot of time in the room and look out the window
c50701,s8,"The Deluxe room is pretty standard in terms of size, facilities etc"
c50701,s9,"Personally, I'd‚Ä¶"
c50702,s1,Sheraton sent me a couple of emails before my arrival to ensure they could entertain my requests - very hospitable
c50702,s2,"Got my Hi floor, non-smoking room in a quiet section as requested"
c50702,s3,"However, there is not much view as the opposite is either the Holiday Inn or Conrad and in the middle is a vast area with Air-Cons and facilities"
c50702,s4,I can see that the swimming pool is comparatively small and is not meant to accommodate over 100 Guests
c50702,s5,You need to always have the outer laced curtain closed to preserve Privacy as the exterior window is not the reflective type
c50702,s6,The room was slightly smaller than the one at Galaxy and the ceiling was comparatively low
c50702,s7,Actually you will feel the low ceiling once you exit the lift
c50702,s8,I believe if you are 6 ft high you might have to lower your head a‚Ä¶
c50703,s1,My partner and I went to Macau for a couple of nights for Christmas
c50703,s2,"We had a good time, but the Sheraton is so big that it gives a strange impression of not being in a regular hotel"
c50703,s3,The executive lounge is bigger than most hotels breakfast room but you still have to wait in line to get a breakfast table and it feels everything but 'exclusive'
c50703,s4,We got upgraded to a great suite
c50703,s5,It was very comfortable but the decor was really tacky
c50703,s6,"Service was not bad, especially when you think of the sheer number of guests that they must have"
c50703,s7,"The staff member at the club lounge who checked us in kept on insisting that we get two beds, which was not very sensitive to diversity! A chain like the Sheraton should train its staff better to be more sensitive to travelers needs as this made us‚Ä¶"
c50704,s1,The hotel is new
c50704,s2,However the service is so poor
c50704,s3,"There are many staff here, but nobody can better serve you"
c50704,s4,Chech in need to wait for a long time
c50704,s5,"The room is not really clean, so much dirt in the furniture"
c50704,s6,The check out time also takes so long
c50704,s7,The hotel really need to train the staff to be polite
c50705,s1,"don't get me wrong, this is a beautiful looking hotel"
c50705,s2,The buffet is to die for
c50705,s3,"I've stayed at pretty awful hotels in the past but the service was sooo good that they made the hotel ""look"" good"
c50705,s4,"I'm afraid that I've had better service EVERYWHERE else in macau, and I travel here often"
c50705,s5,1 hour to check in
c50705,s6,long lines
c50705,s7,Poorly trained staff
c50705,s8,"So the ""shine"" on this new hotel is quite dull"
c50705,s9,My advice: for the money try any other hotel in Macau
c50705,s10,4 stars for hotel but 1 star for service
c50705,s11,Express checked out as the line was so long I wasn't going to wait another hour
c50705,s12,"Then, thankyou so much for the extra charges added on my card that I did not authorise"
c50705,s13,bad
c50706,s1,"bland feeling,staff not particularly warm nor readily conversant in english"
c50706,s2,"new complex is ok i guess fren summed it up nicely, 'I think they are a 4 and a half star establishment?' For comparable rates, I'd probably go to other competitors  Cons  Bathtub too small even for asians"
c50706,s3,"Towels though brand new are not luxuriant, has that spongy material feel"
c50706,s4,"Toiletries again, look like something to be found in an SJM establishment not an international chain For a big complex they need to have been directions, especially for breakfast dining  Cordless phone base station keeps flashing green to signal that its on, very distracting when all the lights are off and you're trying to sleep  Pros One out of 3 pool areas was open and it was quite nice, though couldn't really do much given‚Ä¶"
c50707,s1,"I have high standards of Starwood - Sheraton hotels and I travel alot and stay in Sheraton every single time! English is an International language! What makes me really upset is when I speak in English, agents reply in Cantonese or mandarin? Agents did not make my trip any easier when I enquire about site seeing and restaurants"
c50707,s2,Poor product knowledge
c50707,s3,Most importantly is manager on duty kept talking to agents in mandarin in front of me upon check out
c50707,s4,"I might not know how to speak Cantonese or mandarin, but I can understand"
c50707,s5,"I'm sure the manager on duty and agent said I'm ""troublesome guest"" in mandarin! What a 5 star hotel! I will not recommend Sheraton macao"
c50707,s6,Below my expectation! More like low class motel to me! Such a disappointment on Sheraton macao!
c50708,s1,Me and my family (3 kids) stay twice in this hotel
c50708,s2,The first visit was back in October 2012 when the hotel just opened
c50708,s3,"It was a nice place, promotions, attentiveness of the staff made its part so that we even decided to extend our trip for one more night"
c50708,s4,Overall it was a pleasant expirience so we have decided to repeat this during Chineese NY
c50708,s5,To our delight hotel offered weekend escape package which included breakfast and late check out option (upto 5 pm)
c50708,s6,As we are traveling with small kids late check out was our target as it allow to plan naps/breaks/lunches pretty well
c50708,s7,We also bought afternoon return tickets back to Hong Kong in advance as NY days promised to be busy
c50708,s8,Despite the crowd check in was passed more or less smoothly
c50708,s9,I have ordered an extra bed for our older‚Ä¶
c50709,s1,"It's a rare occasion that I feel compelled to write a negative review for a hotel, but as it just so happens, the Sheraton Macau has earned it"
c50709,s2,"I stayed in the Sheraton Macau back in December for three nights for a work conference, also hosted at the hotel"
c50709,s3,"As a seasoned Starwood guest (I've been a Platinum member since 2009), I was happy to learn that I'd be staying at the Sheraton rather a different property, as I have, up to this point, had very good experiences with Starwood properties"
c50709,s4,"While the accommodation and amenities was on-par with other Sheraton hotels around the world, and the room equally as comfortable, the customer service was by comparison, abysmal"
c50709,s5,"Upon check-in, I was quickly shuffled through the maze of ropes to the front desk"
c50709,s6,"I received my room key,‚Ä¶"
c50710,s1,"I arrived Macau around midnight, hotel shuttle bus was nice and conveniece to get us to hotel, it came to surprise when arrived at hotel with absolutely no belt"
c50710,s2,"At check in counter very minimum service, the room key was just handed in and I had to carried all 4 luggages up to the room by myself without any help at all"
c50710,s3,"What a lack service! Always enjoy starwood hotel, but this one is believed to be such below standard!"
c50711,s1,We arrived late at night in January and we stayed in this hotel for 3 days
c50711,s2,"At first, we were happy with the accommodation but on the second night, I had an allergy due to dust mites! Good thing they provided a doctor, and she gave me a lot of medicines to take"
c50711,s3,The hotel transferred us to a suite that day and brought us fruits as a compensation to my situation
c50711,s4,My parents who stayed in another room experienced bed bugs as well
c50711,s5,"I've been traveling a lot around Asia, and this is the first time that I got an allergy------ from a 5 star hotel in Macau!  Stay here at your own risk!"
c50712,s1,This hotel is big very big
c50712,s2,Was drawn here by the sheer size of the place but disappointed by the mob mentality of the place
c50712,s3,Check in is disorganized chaos if you can even reach the check in area
c50712,s4,Finally found someone who understood that we are Platinum members and sent us on a small marathon to the club lounge check in
c50712,s5,Finally arrived at the room after walking forever
c50712,s6,The room is big but poorly fitted out
c50712,s7,The bathroom door doesn't lock and there is no bubble bath for the huge bath
c50712,s8,After venturing out please remember your room key as security is tighter than Fort Knox
c50712,s9,The club lounge is impersonal beyond belief and the hungry horde that arrives for breakfast simply ruins the ambience of the lounge
c50712,s10,Don't ask for any assistance as you won't get any just move with the mass‚Ä¶
c50713,s1,"It is a very big hotel with 2 towers, named as sky tower and earth tower"
c50713,s2,The hotel shuttle bus took us from ferry terminal to hotel but we did not know which tower it stopped
c50713,s3,"Right behind where the bus stopped, we found the check-in counter and after our 2 days stay, I think there were at least 3 check-in areas"
c50713,s4,"The check-in staff was very nice, his mother tongue is mandarin but he tried very best to communicate with us in English"
c50713,s5,"Check-in was also quick and efficient, but we needed to walk a long way to our room which was at the Sky tower"
c50713,s6,"When we arrived the Sky Tower just opposite the Chow Tai Fook jewelry shop (with a prominent sign in front), we found the doors closed but not locked"
c50713,s7,We then opened the doors and found the lifts lobby inside
c50713,s8,"Suddenly, a security guard‚Ä¶"
c50714,s1,Following last comment I also stayed in hotel during CNY and I am a SPG member myself
c50714,s2,I booked 2 club rooms
c50714,s3,"The check-in procedures at Club Lounge were smooth, and staff were friendly explaining the benfits"
c50714,s4,"The room itself is new, spacious and clean"
c50714,s5,The decor is rather simple
c50714,s6,"There are 3 meal options belonging to hotel, but don't bother to go there, because there are loads of restaurants in the adherant shopping malls"
c50714,s7,Now come to the negative experience
c50714,s8,"First, I don't like the breakfast set-up, due to high occupancy it was set in a ballroom, which made me feel no privacy at all"
c50714,s9,"I was warned the breakfast time might be busy, so I came at 7am"
c50714,s10,"The food choice was quite limited, and not up to 5 star standard"
c50714,s11,"Second, as one of the club floor benefits, welcome fruit and‚Ä¶"
c50715,s1,"Check in service unorganized and could not find reservation for our small group, rooms small but clean"
c50715,s2,Breakfast very good quality and variety
c50715,s3,much better than Venetian
c50715,s4,Friendly service especially guy that cooks eggs
c50716,s1,My family and i spent our New year holiday at this hotel
c50716,s2,I already read some of the reviews of this hotel so more or less i had an inkling of what to expect
c50716,s3,"Indeed, it was kind of confusing upon arrival at the hotel"
c50716,s4,We didnt know which reception area we are supposed to check in
c50716,s5,"There were a lot of guests in the lobby and at the same time, hotel staff guiding first time guests"
c50716,s6,It was not a breeze during check in time
c50716,s7,And it was a relief when we were done with the check in
c50716,s8,there was no waiting area for family's who wait to be checked in
c50716,s9,So we just stood in one corner while we wait for one member of the family to check us all in
c50716,s10,"And when we were about to go to our rooms, we got lost coz the structure of the hotel was a bit confusing"
c50716,s11,i cannot even begin to describe it
c50716,s12,‚Ä¶
c50717,s1,It was our wedding anniversary and we came over to Sheraton Macao for a short stay
c50717,s2,"The hotel is under a soft opening, not all the shops and facilities are fully opened"
c50717,s3,"It was the first time we stay at the Sheraton, but you might want to know that we stayed at the other hotel at the same complex (Cotai Central)"
c50717,s4,"I can confidently tell you that all three hotel buildings were built by the same developer with very similar layout, perhaps a slightly different design and interior color scheme, so my tip is, check all three of them (Sheraton, Holiday Inn, and Conrad) and see which one gives you the best deal"
c50717,s5,"I was greeted by enthusiatic and cheerful staff, smartly recognized my Gold member status and re-direct me to the proper counter for a friendly and efficient check in"
c50717,s6,‚Ä¶
c50718,s1,We spent two nights at this hotel
c50718,s2,"Prior to our arrival, we received an e-mail from a guest services agent asking us if they could be of any assistance"
c50718,s3,This really impressed us and we were expecting great things from the property
c50718,s4,We arrived late at the ferry terminal and took the free coach to the hotel
c50718,s5,"We were the only guests at check-in, yet it took an absolute age to be assigned our room"
c50718,s6,The staff was poorly trained and did not understand how SPG Cash and Points works
c50718,s7,It must have taken at least 25 minutes to give us our room keys
c50718,s8,Throughout the entire experience nobody explained to us what was happening and given that I don't speak Chinese was completely unsure what was happening
c50718,s9,Then came the nightmare with the lifts
c50718,s10,They simply do not have enough lifts to move the‚Ä¶
c50719,s1,We booked 2 rooms to stay over the recent weekend before NYE
c50719,s2,On arrival at the ferry we looked out for the free shuttle service to the hotel
c50719,s3,Very convenient as it is only 10 mins from the hotel
c50719,s4,"Likewise on return , very convenient to board the shuttle bus back to Cotai ferry terminal"
c50719,s5,This hotel is massive!!!! like 4000 rooms
c50719,s6,Check in was fast and very pleasant
c50719,s7,We got upgraded to a deluxe and executive suite
c50719,s8,VERY nice surprise
c50719,s9,The suites and furnishing were very tastefully decorated
c50719,s10,"The deluxe suite was massive, would be a size of a 3 bedroom apartment in Sydney It had a separate powder room on entry"
c50719,s11,The living room and dining area was very spacious
c50719,s12,"A large flat screen TV was in living room, another TV room with fold out sofa and main bedroom with king size bed and‚Ä¶"
c50720,s1,"We enjoyed a well appointed Executive Suite - great space, comfy bed, fantastic view"
c50720,s2,"For such a large hotel, the staff are well briefed on the hotels amenities + extremely polite & helpful"
c50720,s3,These are the highlights - the Club experience is the low point of the Sheraton
c50720,s4,Having traveled extensively  and experienced many club floors the Sheraton needs to re-think how this is achieved in a 4000 room hotel
c50720,s5,"Space is odd - feels like a cafeteria, little natural light & uncomfortable furnishings - due to over crowding a ball room was pressed into service - food sub-par - staff overwhelmed with the hordes of guests"
c50720,s6,I have never had to queue behind 150+ people to get entry into a lounge - requested breakfast vouchers for the main restaurant Feast on both days - food is better here -‚Ä¶
c50721,s1,We booked an Executive Suite with Club Floor privileges
c50721,s2,"The suite was very nice and well appointed, but that is where our happiness ended"
c50721,s3,"This hotel has 4,000 rooms so we thought a Club Floor would provide a more personal service and less crowds - we were soooo wrong"
c50721,s4,The whole Sheraton Macao club experience was a disappointment
c50721,s5,"The club lounge looks like a converted ball room, the food and  beverage service feels like a slightly upscale cafeteria"
c50721,s6,"It was noisy not enough chairs, no service, and uncontrolled children running  around the lounge"
c50721,s7,"We couldn't even get into the lounge for breakfast, day 1 as it had a queue of 200 people (I am not exaggerating I counted them) waiting to be seated for breakfast"
c50721,s8,!   Day 2 was the same so we queued in the shorter queue in‚Ä¶
c50722,s1,When we booked the family suite we saw pictures on tripadvisor that included two bedrooms and a living room
c50722,s2,"When we checked in, alas it only contained two bedrooms with adjoining door"
c50722,s3,The check ins were very slow
c50722,s4,"Having say that, Nash Wong the receptionist had been very helpful trying to meet our expectations"
c50722,s5,"Overall the front line needs to improve on its service, speed and communication"
c50723,s1,The experience was memorable but in the negative sense
c50723,s2,We were there for on Sunday (Dec 16) for 1 night stay with my in-laws & 2 sisters in laws & spouses
c50723,s3,We were told at the check in at the regular 2pm check in time  that out rooms will not be ready until 4pm
c50723,s4,That was a bit of shock but we let it go so went  out for snack & sight seeing
c50723,s5,"Once we got out rooms, we went to check it out"
c50723,s6,My in laws & sitters in law's rooms got to their respective rooms fine
c50723,s7,"For us, it was quite surprise when we found our room got luggage and underwear's hanging in the bathroom"
c50723,s8,So we called the front desk & they dispatched a customer service manager up to see us while we waited in our in law's room
c50723,s9,The Customer service manager asked us to check the room with her & the first word she said was‚Ä¶
c50724,s1,Staff is lack of experience; I was offered free local call & leave them the coupon when checking-in
c50724,s2,"However, I still have to clear those questions when I check-out"
c50724,s3,"Most staff cannot speak English or Cantonese, difficult to communicate"
c50724,s4,"When I was back to HK, I found out I was being ignored by the hotel"
c50724,s5,"I check-in in the 4th floor (notify by email) for being SPG member & booked a Suite Room, I do not have Relationship staff/ manager to coach me to the Suite, I had to bring along all my entire luggage to the room which I was lost during my findings of the Suite"
c50724,s6,I bit confuse & anger
c50724,s7,"Also, I wasn‚Äôt told about the Club stuff, I need to ask them every questions like breakfast arrangement, of course they don‚Äôt even mentioned evening cocktail which I have totally missed during‚Ä¶"
c50725,s1,Stayed in the twin bed room for a nite just before the christmas
c50725,s2,"Front line staff serving at the SPG counter are well trained, all my requests are being taken care of"
c50725,s3,Rooms are large comparing with the New Holiday Inn at the next block
c50725,s4,"However, only two tiny kids' dipping outdoor pools are available for guests, (a lot facilities are still not yet finish), while the ""heated"" water are too weak for winter's time;  construction noises could be heard in most of the areas includling your own guest room"
c50725,s5,"Bene the Italian restuarant serves very good dishes in bargin price, and its unexpected quiet during lunch hours"
c50726,s1,"We have booked (and paid through a single agency) for 3 rooms, 2 of which are for 2 nights and one is for one night"
c50726,s2,Here is our bad experience with the counter staff
c50726,s3,"Our check in took at least 10 to 15 minutes, the hotel staff was busy with the computer keyboard all the time until he finally figured out all the room numbers"
c50726,s4,"Normally, we expect this to take 5 minutes or less"
c50726,s5,"The hotel staff has also forgotten to give us the breakfast tickets which should be included in the package, fortunately we remembered to ask for that before leaving the counter"
c50726,s6,"However, later that day we discovered the key jackets for all 3 rooms wrote we need to check out the next morning"
c50726,s7,"When we returned to the counter for clarification, another hotel staff said such mistake may be because we‚Ä¶"
c50727,s1,"Everything I am going to share below is truly based on my feedback from the customer's perspective for a family with a child and I see that this hotel is very nicely built with malls connected but as a new hotel, there are a lot of areas for improvement"
c50727,s2,I stayed the weekend before X'mas and my wife and I and my 2
c50727,s3,5 year old came with a ferry from HK
c50727,s4,I am a SPG gold member
c50727,s5,"When we arrived at the ferry, we didn't see sign where the Sheraton shuttle was but no big deal and we found it at the end"
c50727,s6,I had a luggage and a stroller while my wife was holding the kid
c50727,s7,There was no help offered by the staff to help with the luggage
c50727,s8,ok
c50727,s9,fine as I thought they might not be direct hotel staff
c50727,s10,"When we arrived at the hotel, once again, I had to take out the luggage and stroller by‚Ä¶"
c50728,s1,"Sheraton Macau was recently opened for business, rooms were no doubt clean"
c50728,s2,The rooms were comfy with 2 double beds
c50728,s3,"However, I find the location of the hotel a little too far from all other activities and attractions"
c50728,s4,"Furthermore, there is no free wifi in the room, you have to pay for it"
c50728,s5,"We were told their free shuttle service to Macau island starts about 11am, which is too late by my standard, would be better if it can be slightly early"
c50728,s6,"Obviously from the above, their main aim is to try and make you stay in the casino and gamble the whole day"
c50728,s7,"If gaming is not your aim, I suggest you get another hotel"
c50728,s8,"I also found their pricing a little steep, at the price we paid, we probably could have gotten a better deal nearby"
c50729,s1,I booked 2 rooms at this hotel for me and my colleagues
c50729,s2,However I came across a few questions and would like a respond from the actual hotel itself rather than the central res (1800 number) or Agoda (which is where I booked through)
c50729,s3,My first attempt was to call the hotel's number +853 2880 2000
c50729,s4,"The phone keeps ringing and ringing, not even the promo message or what-so-ever"
c50729,s5,"Totally not within the industry standard of ""answer within 3 rings"""
c50729,s6,My second attempt was to call the central reservation 1800 073 535
c50729,s7,"I was assisted by a young lady, I asked her why is it impossible to get in contact with the hotel directly, which the lady laughs and said ""maybe they were too busy"""
c50729,s8,"I asked whether free wifi comes with my booking, she told me Wifi is free only for certain room types,‚Ä¶"
c50730,s1,"Just stayed at sheraton for 4 nights - would not have commented at all about my negative impression - until finding out that I have been double charged for the stay (pre- paid, then charged the entire amount again in error after departure without my permission or signature or even invoice)"
c50730,s2,A few specific gripes: The service was mediocre - many staff did not speak English (including the waiter whom brought room service - but did not understand instructions when I was half dressed after a shower and needing some privacy
c50730,s3,)  Wifi not included in room fee - had to be bought hourly/daily
c50730,s4,Even budget cafes have wifi - why can't this so called luxury hotel
c50730,s5,Full of non hotel staff soliciting and approaching you to sell services and accommodation at other hotels! - somewhat a‚Ä¶
c50731,s1,I was excited to try the new SPG property as Westin is just so old and so far away from everything
c50731,s2,Spent one night over a weekend
c50731,s3,"Overall I would say it's quite standard - rooms, amenities, etc"
c50731,s4,Nothing wow as a brand new property
c50731,s5,Several things that bothered me:  1) Hotel is huge but the sign is not clear
c50731,s6,2) Sound proof - people and kids walking around
c50731,s7,it was quite noisy inside the room
c50731,s8,3) Checkin line - waited for a while even as an elite member
c50731,s9,Staffs need more training
c50731,s10,Good points:  1) SPG points 2) breakfast at SPG Club is good (but super crowded)  I think Holiday Inn nearby is for better value and Conrad might be more luxury - which makes Sheraton's position a bit awkward
c50732,s1,Day 1- nothing in any of the material I had been sent indicated there was a shuttle bus from Ferry terminal to hotel
c50732,s2,"People from the Venetian Hotel graciously assisted, as not a sign, or person was in the arrival area to guide"
c50732,s3,Most major hotels had some form of information posted in arrivals area
c50732,s4,"- checked in Club level room, and 20 minutes later, 3 giggling young people walked in the room with no warning, knock or any notification while I was in the bathroom"
c50732,s5,"""Checking on water"" I was told"
c50732,s6,Nice room overlooking a construction site with pile drivers banking away most of the day
c50732,s7,Day 2- Long line up to the breakfast lounge on Club level
c50732,s8,"It was suggested I proceed to main restaurant where the food was said to be better, but at a $20+ cost"
c50732,s9,Room cleaned at 4:30pm Day 3 - It's‚Ä¶
c50733,s1,"This is a HUGE hotel, presently approx"
c50733,s2,"3'000 rooms - of which 570 are CLUB rooms, soon upgrading to 6'000 rooms"
c50733,s3,"And doe to this everything is huge and very, very crowded, the reception, the lobby, the ""Club Lounge"""
c50733,s4,"If you don't have any SPG tier - good luck, you'll wait"
c50733,s5,If you have Gold tier you'll wait some minutes
c50733,s6,I do have Platinum tier with SPG so normally I would be entitled to check in at the Club Lounge
c50733,s7,Sadly they told me this when I already went through the line at Gold tier check-in (even I told them that I do have Platinum status)
c50733,s8,"Okay, up to the lounge"
c50733,s9,"Everything is huge, but missing style and flair"
c50733,s10,"Just nothing has any style, just like the standard 3* US chain hotel"
c50733,s11,We were upgraded to an Executive Suite which is really nice - but you've to walk and walk‚Ä¶
c50734,s1,"I have spent one night in this hotel and was really disappointed, the quality of the service and the organisation was poor for such a Hotel which pretends to have 5 stars"
c50734,s2,I had to wait an hour in the queue to check in then 20 minutes to get my bag at the concierge because they have lost it
c50734,s3,When I finally get to my room the keycard was not working
c50734,s4,"The room was Ok, swimming pool was small and without any charm"
c50734,s5,"Another issue, I had to pay for the breakfast which was included"
c50734,s6,I had to negotiate another 15 minutes to remove it from my bill (by the way the checkout took me 20 more minutes)
c50734,s7,It cost me 400
c50734,s8,#NAME?
c50734,s9,Even a nice Palace is not that expensive
c50734,s10,My recommendation is definitely‚Ä¶ do not go there‚Ä¶
c50735,s1,The hotel was just one-month-old when I visited there
c50735,s2,"When the coach arrived at the doorway of this new hotel, I was impressed as it gave me a subtropical resort feel"
c50735,s3,"When we stepped in, dancers in Haiwaiian(?) costumes were performing"
c50735,s4,Behind them was the casino
c50735,s5,"The room is a standard one, yes, a very standard one"
c50735,s6,"All elements of a hotel room you would expect from a Sheraton group are all included, no surprise at all"
c50735,s7,What bothered me was the lighting control
c50735,s8,"Like many other hotel rooms, one cannot control all the lights from the bedside"
c50735,s9,"Service is good, the hardware is new at least"
c50735,s10,"Not very easy to get a cab, it takes time"
c50735,s11,So you may want to remain in Taipa for most of the time
c50735,s12,"Tried breakfast at Feast, no good"
c50735,s13,"If it is not included, I think you may give‚Ä¶"
c50736,s1,Bad housekeeping - 1
c50736,s2,missing toothpaste in the toothbrush packing
c50736,s3,"When we called guest service, they said there should be toothpaste inside every package of toothbrush, so that it may be opened by other guest"
c50736,s4,How can we ensure the hygiene of it? 2
c50736,s5,There was only one used sheet in the memo pad
c50736,s6,The housekeeping didn't notice and replace it
c50736,s7,3
c50736,s8,"There was a UNICEF ""check out for children"" promotion card but it was full of scribbles"
c50736,s9,The housekeeping didn't notice and replace it
c50736,s10,5
c50736,s11,We stayed for 2 nights
c50736,s12,"On the second night, we found that the small foil cover from the toothpaste that we used in the previous night was still lying on the floor of bathroom, together with some hairs"
c50736,s13,Obviously the housekeeping did not clean the bathroom floor thoroughly
c50736,s14,Unacceptable view - When we‚Ä¶
c50737,s1,Stayed one night on an SPG points and cash award
c50737,s2,"The hotel was nice but the service was problematic beginning with a door key that wouldn't open and ending with a 20 minute ""normal"" checkout"
c50737,s3,Also my wifi amenity didn't work and after 20 minutes trying to rectify it I gave up
c50737,s4,"In the 12 hours I spent in the hotel, I spent over an hour dealing with service related issues"
c50737,s5,"Although I don't expect  service agents in another country to speak perfect English, the agents English skills were challenged anytime something went off script and made solving simple problems an ordeal"
c50737,s6,I trust these problems will iron themselves out over time but for now I give the hotel 3 stars for room quality but 1 star for service
c50737,s7,"Incidentally, I talked to a female manager about my service related‚Ä¶"
c50738,s1,"In-room Facilities:  1) Good to find iHome in the room 2) light attached with mirror inside the bathroom was out of order 3) should have hints to tell room guests all facilities / services provided by the hotel were shown on TV! As i normally won't switch on the TV in the room, I finally found the info til 7pm (4 hrs after check in!) 4) No spa treatment menu / leaflet inside the room (even in yr website!)"
c50738,s2,It's ridiculous ! This is one of the hottest locations for ladies! I need to go there to check it out in person!  Other facilities  1) no staff standby in the changing room next to the fitness centre / swimming pools
c50738,s3,"The steamroom seemed not hot enough (I stayed there more than 15 min, but still feel warm only, no sweating at all) 2) it's a surprise no Jacazzui available with‚Ä¶"
c50739,s1,I have been a member of the SPG since 2007 and I stayed at this hotel to celebrate my own birthday with my friends and this stay with this hotel is the worse stay that I have ever experienced since 2007 with the following reasons:-  1
c50739,s2,"when I checked in, the staff at front desk me that I need to check out the deluxe room on and then check-in again for the club room"
c50739,s3,"After complaining to a member of a staff at the front desk, I save the hustle of checking out and checking in for changing from deluxe room to club room"
c50739,s4,"However, when a member of the staff brought me to the club room, the staff put me into a twins bed club room rather than thr originally booked double bed room"
c50739,s5,"As a result, I have to wait in the twins club room for 30 minutes"
c50739,s6,2
c50739,s7,After making my‚Ä¶
c50740,s1,We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights and have checked into a Suite on the 39F which included Lounge service
c50740,s2,"Unfortunately we arrived after 9pm and there was no more food service, not even drinks, we got bottled water, better than nothing"
c50740,s3,"The lounge closed at 11pm, doors closed with no more access"
c50740,s4,"We would expect that the room would stay open for guests to sit around or use the internet, but I suppose you should all be going to the casino? The buffet breakfast looked good but there were flies in the seating area outside while the inside AC was freezing cold"
c50740,s5,"When we returned to our floor, there were cigarette butts sitting on the trash can and a bag of leftover takeout food sitting next to it"
c50740,s6,"These items remained there all day and thru the night, still there when we checked‚Ä¶"
c50741,s1,As captioned
c50741,s2,"Had felt the front desk staff are kinda SQUARE to handle late check out request, as a over 3,000 rooms international branded hotel, a guest like me to celebrate their grand opening with my trail stay"
c50741,s3,a little request for late checkout which was rejected 3 times by the same receptionist that made me really despair
c50741,s4,"I love the lobby lounge, Palm"
c50741,s5,"Great band, good singers 'n nice saxophone player!!  The waitress, Nana is pretty friendly 'n full of smiling"
c50741,s6,"The manager, Park is helpful 'n nice"
c50741,s7,Whole thing made me feel enjoyable under a marvelous sentiments
c50742,s1,I was expecting this to be of a higher tier than the Holiday Inn at Cotai Sands however I was so wrong
c50742,s2,Check in lobby was HUGE with flocks of people
c50742,s3,"Then after checking in, no one to show where to catch the lift to room (spent a little time to find), then literally from lift to room took 2 minutes to walk to"
c50742,s4,"Room was dusty and dimly lit (even when lights were all  on), no view from window (looks at a piece of construction land), toilet was basic and plastic bags were hard to open (for tooth paste and shower cap etc)"
c50742,s5,Bathing amenities felt cheap
c50742,s6,Slippers were also paper thin
c50742,s7,I found it particularly bad value with Sheraton's brand
c50742,s8,Disappointed
c50743,s1,"Despite the more prestigious hotel brand name, this is fundamentally just a slightly nicer version of the Sands and Venetian hotels"
c50743,s2,Same fundamental approach
c50743,s3,"Ie Big, noisy, cookie cutter service"
c50743,s4,"Rooms are bland and basic (we were already in the more expensive suits), amenties basic, no sense of real luxury"
c50743,s5,Strongly targeted for the mainland crowd
c50743,s6,It wasn't that full and even then the SPG Lounge was not able to cater for us at Breakfast
c50743,s7,"The Spa was the only brighter spot, despite facilities not being finished, the treatment was quite good"
c50744,s1,There are so many hotels in Macau and it is very hard to be the best one
c50744,s2,Sheraton said this is the biggest hotel in the world
c50744,s3,I am not sure about this
c50744,s4,There are 2 towers (one is not open yet) but it doesn't seem like THAT big
c50744,s5,We've stayed at the executive suite for a night
c50744,s6,We checked in at the club lounge
c50744,s7,Service is good but I think it takes a bit longer than I thought
c50744,s8,The room itself is spacious
c50744,s9,The decor is very modern
c50744,s10,Our room is facing the other tower but there's nothing much to see
c50744,s11,"When you look down, you see the swimming pools plus a lot of big machines"
c50744,s12,I don't really understand why they don't cover up those big machines at the podium level (same level as swimming pool)
c50744,s13,50% of the room is looking at that and it doesn't seems like the best thing to see
c50744,s14,‚Ä¶
c50745,s1,"When we stay there, Sheraton just opened a week"
c50745,s2,They really need to think about to improve to meet 5-star standard
c50745,s3,"Room - Nothing special, room space like other Macau hotel"
c50745,s4,Working table is stainlesssteel one like using at office
c50745,s5,weird! Swimming Pool - just open 1 floor (they should have another floor?)
c50745,s6,"Pool area divided several small pool, you will not like it if you really want to swim! Club Lounge - Breakfast & happy hour at night is okay"
c50745,s7,"However, afternoon tea is really disappointed!!  Only prawn / fish / rice crackers & marsmallow everyday"
c50745,s8,no hot items nor petit cake!  They should consider to provide finger sandwiches / toasts! Casino - very small and not connected with Holiday Inn/Conrad one Food - only tried noodle in the food court
c50745,s9,It is okay but not much‚Ä¶
c50746,s1,Bottom Line: Would only recommend staying at this hotel if you get a very cheap packaged deal
c50746,s2,"Otherwise, it's definitely not 5 star quality yet, and still lacking in service"
c50746,s3,"Besides the kind greetings in the lobby, ""hi and welcome"" the staff are not experienced enough in english, making it a very frustrating experience"
c50746,s4,"Try asking anyone where the food court is, or how express checkout works, where the shuttle bus is, etc"
c50746,s5,and you'll see a bunch of blank faces
c50746,s6,"Cons:  - HORRIBLE view, despite being a SPG member"
c50746,s7,"Got a view of the back of the hotel facing all the ventilation systems, pipes, you know what I mean etc"
c50746,s8,That's what happens when you book a cheap promotional package
c50746,s9,They give you the worst rooms
c50746,s10,#NAME?
c50746,s11,The one that is open is‚Ä¶
c50747,s1,Checked in on 29/9/12 and stayed for one night in the club floor
c50747,s2,I am still in the room as I am writing this review
c50747,s3,It's such a big disappointment with such an ordinary room
c50747,s4,Not luxurious and 5 star at all
c50747,s5,"It makes it a lot worse when I had paid $2861 HKD, equivalent to $366 USD, for it"
c50747,s6,"WiFI is unstable, on and off every 10-20 seconds"
c50747,s7,"It was really frustrating! When I booked, the hotel was not opened yet, so no review was available"
c50747,s8,"As Sheraton was a brand name and never stayed at one, I gave it a go believing it could not go too wrong with a five-star hotel"
c50747,s9,How wrong I was as the room was so ORDINARY! It definitely had turned me off the Sheraton brand forever
c50748,s1,I don't recommend this hotel specially for special occasion as it ruined ours
c50748,s2,We got ours under $HKD1000 but still I was quite disappointed with the room and the service received
c50748,s3,More like a 3* hotel
c50748,s4,"Location was good as close to Venetian, City of Dreams etc but check-in staff were extremely rude"
c50748,s5,Waited for 1/2 hour and very frustrating our special request were not noted down in the system with the staff accusing us of making it up until we showed her email which confirmed our request
c50748,s6,Still unable to fulfill a simple request and unapologetic
c50748,s7,Very impersonal service and staff seemed frustrated
c50748,s8,"Other staff encountered was ok, best customer service were the greeters at the lifts"
c50748,s9,"Only 1 out of 4 pools were opened, with the rest opening sometime next year"
c50748,s10,No swim-up bar‚Ä¶
c50749,s1,"Decent hotel but not as good as I expected for the Sheraton brand, or for a 5 star hotel in Macau of today's standard"
c50749,s2,"First of all, spent over an hour for check-in because the hotel could not verify my booking for 3 guests requesting an extra bed via Hotel"
c50749,s3,com
c50749,s4,"I paid almost double of the promotion price launched by the hotel for a regular twin room so that I can have 3 guests sharing and requested for an extra bed, but the hotel staff said the increased payment was only a deal between myself and Hotel"
c50749,s5,"com, and I would need to pay additional fees for the extra bed"
c50749,s6,"Except for my name and booking reference, my personal details such as phone number, address and credit card number were wrong in their system"
c50749,s7,After almost an hour of information checking and negotiation they‚Ä¶
