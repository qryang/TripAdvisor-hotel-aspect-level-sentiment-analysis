"To be honest, the interior is nice and glamorous but that's it.  We wanted to change to a standard room instead of a queen-sized bed but we were told no room. In this covid19 situation and in late-Chinese national holiday which I strongly doubt it cuz the girl was asking other staff if we can get the room or not.  So our room was arranged to the opposite side of the lake and there's absolutely no view at all. We wanted to change to the lake side but also told it's 'difficult'. We'd pay for it.  The most unbearable case was at the bell service, where we had our luggage checked first. One of the concierge girl came and helped us, but she used her feet to balance our luggage on the ground which was a backpack.  I don't think it's appropriate for a girl, for a hotel man, or a service person to do such behavior, and it's simply just rude. Most of the staffs at the front foor are Taiwanese.  I'd not recommend this hotel to anyone anymore although it was my second time staying in this hotel but it will definitely be my last.  There's plenty of other great hotels to stay, you just don't expect too much despite of the price. I'd say St. Regis would be a wiser choice or any other hotels.  To prove I stayed here I post a pic.‚Ä¶",20
"It was a wonderful stay and birthday celebration of my wife. Wynn Palace never disappoints us as always, your attention to details is second to none. Looking forward to visit you again in the near future. We would like to give thanks to Ken of FO, Peach and Andrea of Poolside, Jason of IRD and Philip of Guest Service. They make sure the guest are happy, and we are! Kudos to Wynn Palace Team! üëèüëèüëè",50
"Booked the summer escape package, including spa and dining credits. Fountain suite experience is really great, we ordered room services for dinner, think the whole in room dining experience is very impressive. Staff are polite no matter where you walk to. My babies are very happy about their stay and enjoy the fountain view a lot.",50
"Wynn Palace has quenched my soul to a different level. It felt like I was out of Macao for a while. The amenities and features of the suite were exquisite and very much exceeds expectations from guests. If I had more funds, I'd gladly stay in that suite every time I book one for every occasion I have in my life.",50
"I checked in to #1987 on Jul 11. Booked Spa in the afternoon and the service was thoughtful and attentive to details, but there was an incident that my swimsuit got torn after drying. Spa AM apologized sincerely and she knew I had pool reservation on the next day so would like to offer me a new one from Wynn Shop. However, I failed to choose from those available so she handed me her card saying if I can get the new one from any Macau store, they will claim me with the receipt. After dinner, we also found some gifts with message card from FO in room. Actually I was just a little helpless on this case, wasn‚Äôt dissatisfied or wanted to complain understanding incidents do happen, yet the conversation and handling could be a better approach.",40
"Nice cable car experience for free with nice view of fountains if you are not a gambler. Don‚Äôt get off the coach, casino doesn‚Äôt worth it. Accessible via free shuttle service at the nearby City of dreams ",50
"I stayed at Wynn Palace during the last Macau GP weekend. Got a lake view suite when I found there is room available to book for. Not disappointing, from the room, services, shops downstairs.....Just make a perfect trip again in Macau.",50
"We visited the Wynn Palace in early February. The coronavirus outbreak meant that quite a few of the hotel amenities were closed as they are in every other hotel (swimming pool, spa, a number of the restaurants etc.) but we already knew this and still had a lovely stay in this stunning hotel. The buffet breakfast was not functioning but instead we had our delicious breakfast brought up to us in the room and set up next to the window. Generally, staff were very helpful and friendly but you do need to bear with them while they carry out the necessary temperature checks and form filling for the virus.  This hotel is a short walk from the main Cotai strip where all the other big casinos are located. You can also get a taxi to the centre of Macau for around MOP 100 where you can see‚Ä¶",50
For the past few years my husband and I have been staying at the Wynn Palace Hotel at least 3 or 4 times a year and usually for about a week or so. Usually the staff were very helpful and friendly but this time we encountered a very rude and unhelpful bellboy!   Back in January we stayed a total of 10 days and we also got friends to stay there for a few days too. While my husband was checking out my friends and I were standing to the side of a doorway with our luguages not blocking anyone. When my husband came out we got ready to push our 6 luggages out to the front entrance. A bellboy walked over and told us in Mandarin to move aside with our luggages. I told him back in Cantonese that we are moving out to the front entrance as we have checked out. . Instead of doing his job of‚Ä¶,30

Everything was excellent for stay. All of the hotels are so close to go to other hotels so you can just pick your hotel by pics. And I recommend you to order room service for breakfast or go to morning buffet.,50
"This is my third trip to Macau and I've been staying at many hotels, but your hotel was definitely the best. He escorted the room and prepared various baby items, and the installation of corner guards. Next time I visit Macau, I will definitely stay there again.",50
"Staying in a hotel you need to find your orientation, specially in a large hotel having 1706 rooms.Shops and restaurants are very well distributed within the square shape corridors surrounding the Casino inside. Hotel guests who have children will not be offended in unable to reach a restaurant located inside the Casino area. However, the color scheme is predominately shocking red making you eyes easily tired. Maybe that is what the Casino wants!",50
"Each hotel in Macau performs something special for their customers. In Wynn, you will be treated fully as VIP customers: water performance, buffet for dining, high class branded products, free shuttle bus to Macau centre, etc. Unforgettable experience while you are in Macau",50

"Thank you for the birthday cake with the name written for my daughter JIWOO and I am deeply grateful for the late check-out consideration despite the full booking.

a very pretty hotel. 1. Clean 2. Nice view 3. a good position 4. kind service I liked everything about this hotel. It is just like a palace as its name. The staffs are amazing. They were very kind and professional. The room had the most beautiful view of cotai hotels,50
We had such a great time in Wynn Palace. We are very happy to have had an unforgettable experience there. We could happily celebrate my dad‚Äôs 80th birthday in Macao thanks to Wynn Palace. We would be glad to revisit.,50
"We chose to go to the WYNN Palace to celebrate my birthday with a two-night staycation and, it did not disappoint.  We stayed in a fountain suite for two nights, which is spacious and comfortable, not to mention the view.  We loved how clean and well maintained the whole hotel is!  The hotel is far superior to its main competitors in Macau.  You can arrive almost everywhere in Macao by WYNN Palace suttle bus, and it's super clean.  A big thanks to the staff and management for making the birthday one for the books and a special mention to Edward, the reservation agent, Ray at the front desk, Mena at customer service, Sammi at the concierge and Sue at Wing Lei Palace.

On a business trip and wanted to work quietly for some hours while enjoying the hotel ambiance.    The check in process was a bit prolonged because the hotel could not find my booking record and the front desk reception did not want to read my booking confirmation in my iPhone.   The managress quickly came out and offered me room upgrade with small additional amount. I did not take the offer and the managress gracefully offer me handmade chocolates and extended check out hours.  Very nice.  I could check out at the VIP reception room as well.  The room is very spacious.  The bed sheets very good quality. The towels are five star hotel quality definitely.    Lots of interesting small decorations in the room.   Flower in pot!

I booked it for husband and my birthday, and I did not expect to be treated as a frequent affiliate like Hyatt or Conrad. However the result of it, I'm satisfied more then either Hyatt or Conrad.  We had inquiries about swimming pools before the visit through the email, but we were kindly informed that the swimming pool was not available upon the check-in.  However, Hotel was able to respond to the shortcomings with a quick response and to protect my family's important day.

"I've never experienced such a ""Spacious"" and comfortable hotel. The extra bed for my child was provided with no charge and especially the service of in-room dinning with a variety of international menu was really great for my family. Many luxury goods shops and various restaurants are located in the hotel for convenience. Very near to the airport and just next to the hotel of City of Dreams which has the most famous performance in Asia, House of Dancing Water. Please let me say in a word... ""AMAZING"" :)",50
This was my first time visiting Macau. The service was brilliant with welcoming and helpful staff. The food in the hotel was also great and the recommendations for outside food. The rooms were fully equipped with everything necessary and more. Would recommend this hotel to anyone.,50

Pool cafe foods was good, the buns from bakery shop was a bit dry and hard. Room dinning for Breakfast was good. Skycab experience was good, staff over there also friendly. The only thing would like to highlight is during check out time, the reception area a bit confuse that don't know where to line up, no doubt there are staff approach us and ask to wait for our turn, on off there are other guests walk in, can't imagine during peak season how are there going to recognize which are the guest to serve next.

The hotel is massive and very glamorous. There are cable cars that you can get that goes up and around where the outside lake is. This ma√±ana a a lovely water show to music which is great to see especially when on the cable cars. It is free also. Free shuttle buses go between the hotels,50

Too long waiting time considering the class of hotel.",40
"The experience of VIP check-in was excellent.  Parlor Suite, 136 SQM, has a separate living room, one king bed with fine Egyptian cotton, and dual vanity marble counters in the luxury bathroom.  Receptionist Alicia prepared the birthday cake, a box of chocolate and a box of macarons!  Thank you very much!  We enjoyed the breakfast at Fontana Buffet overlooking the Performance Lake and run into Michelin Chef Alvin Leung of Bo Innovation HK sharing high-quality cheeses. We had complimentary SkyCab access and like the outdoor swimming pool which has different atmospheres day and night.  If you know how to connect major Macau hotels via free shuttle buses, you will enjoy the vacation there!",50

One of the best resorts / Hotels I have stayed. Uber luxury and they upgraded me when I checked in. The price is steep but if ok with the price then this is the best hotel to stay. Once inside the hotel dont think u need to get out at all. ,50
"This is easily one of the most spectacular casino/hotels in Macau and well worth exploring. You can arrive by vehicle at the main entrance, or walk over to the small lake in the back and take the free cable car over. The atriums have mechanical decorative displays that are great photo opportunities. They have put a lot of money into making this one of the best looking hotels in Macau.",50

The room was so spacious and very serene! The colors of the room are so bright. I just loved the room! I loved the cable car idea and the fountain! Very spectacular!  The staff and the service were absolutely brilliant. The shopping arcade and the restaurants at the ground floor were just perfect. You can do so much in this hotel. It so vibrant and lively! The VERY BEST in Macau!! ",50

Very beautiful and quiet casino which put up a very enjoyable breakfast set which was very delicious..the poker room was pretty average had to wait till after 12pm for it to open by the time i got msg a table was ready it was near 9pm so probaly not the most popular casino for a game but still offers alot of other cash games aswell as ypur usual pokies etc.pretty awesome water feature show if you see it at night at the fountains also,50

"We ended up spending a family vacation at the Wynn palace. The kids enjoyed swimming in the pool despite the bad weather.  The rooms were large and comfy. We were situated on the 9th floor facing the water feature. The rooms were well appointed and the beds were extremely comfortable. Room service was fast and our butlers were extremely polite and friendly.  The only downside of our stay was the overwhelming stench of cigarette smoke  in our room. We tried switching to another room but had the same issue. Having two young kids, this was a major disappointment. Despite the smoke, we enjoyed our stay. The Wynn Palace has amazing restaurants and an empty gym with great amenities. ",40

"It‚Äôs perhaps worth starting by saying that Macau is not Vegas. Over 80% of revenue for Macau properties comes from gambling and there are very few non-gambling activities (unlike Las Vegas, which is nowadays almost the other way round).   Having said that, this is a great hotel. The rooms are simply incredible and superb value for money. The spa is world class and restaurants are very good. There is a great swimming pool overlooking a Bellagio style fountain show and cable car ride. It‚Äôs all pretty good fun.   I spent 48-hours here and can recommend this as a great place to stay.

"A wow factor is something which when it is seen or experienced, it causes you, and everyone else nearby, to say WOW-usually very audibly!       The Wynn Palace has a tremendous WOW factor , called the ‚ÄúPerformance Lake‚Äù. To musical accompaniement hundreds of water jets shoot high, wave in semicircles, rotate and sway in a series of patterns. At night they suddenly flash in such bright colours that it looks like a fireworks display. Even though we saw it seven times we were all still saying ‚ÄúWOW‚Äù.       The hotel staff including Check-In, and Check-outs, security, Casino employees, restaurant cooks and waiters, etc  etc.  Were invariably polite, courteous, and helpful, and they were also genuinely friendly.

For me this is the most fab hotel/casino in macau! I really love the ambience! It's almost perfect from the exterior to interior! Watch dancing fountain while riding a free cable car is the best! Kuddos!!!,50
The entrance to the hotel is with the cabs which are coming every minute and is a really nice idea. The hotel itself is very beautiful and the standard room is very very big and beautiful as well (68 sqm). Highly recommend!,50

"Yesterday April 15 was my birthday and I know for sure I wanted to celebrate it in Wynn Palace. I've been to many hotel in Macau. But I can definitely say it becomes my favorite! What I like about this hotel is their attention to details like soft toothbrush bristles, hairsprays, facial mist, bath brush and sponge, and all other special details that you will not see in others. The room is huge since I was upgraded by FO Amber before I check-in and another upgrade by FO Martin (These 2 are the best and nicest people, they deserve promotion since they are really excellent in their job) then FO Fiona and Louis to do my check-in and out, then Alison who picks up my call when extended me an hour stay since I needed some time to prepare to leave.

Not all staff are able to speak English but a majority can. Not a big deal. Pool is an incredible pool because it overlooks the fountain lake. Dining, Wing Lei Palace...it will make you feel Grand!!! The moment you walk through, the 8 foot tall vases make you feel like a king. Upon walking to the main dining room, while the fountains are going, will lead you feel palatial and royal.

"This must be one of the region's finest hotels.   Everything here is done well, particularly the detail-oriented operation of the cleaning and maintenance staff. The hotel also runs an efficient shuttle bus service that can get you to downtown/Old Macau, airport, ferry terminals, Border Gate, etc.  If there are any complaints about the hotel, it's almost too exclusive.   --No ordinary or small shops on premises to purchase a can of soda, a cup of coffee, candy bar, etc. --You can't really walk in/out of the property, Unless you're in a taxi or bus shuttle, the only way in is through a magnificent sky cab that takes you high above the hotel's lake (more like a castle's moat).

We ate at several of the restaurants and loved the high quality of the food, the service and the beautiful presentations. Our room had a lovely view of the fountains, and was comfortable in every possible way. In addition to exceptional architectural and interior design we also experienced a very professional and kind staff.  Eve and Amber at the check in made us feel welcome the minute we walked in.  We will not forget.",50
"Gorgeous property with amazing presentation of all spaces (private & public - feels brand new), floral throughout property is truly amazing and service provided from staff very attentive and polite with a clear priority placed on making the guests feel number one. Wynn Palace & neighbouring properties did seem quiet, perhaps the time of year? (April) This however was great as it was never crowded and all service provided was extremely prompt. Main entrances to Wynn Palace can be a little walk if visiting adjacent properties due to size of performance lake however the complimentary SkyCab was a great alternative, taking the SkyCab down from the property to the main street.",50
"This review is not for our stay at the Hotel (fully booked!) but for the Wing Lei Bar,  This is a stunning hotel and well worth a look around even if you are not a resident, The entrance via the cable car is so special and unusual!  We walked past the bar a few times as there was no-one else in it and it looked very exclusive. So glad we decided to try it. It was absolutely beautiful, but the service is the main reason for my review. The lovely staff here are so professional and friendly. One young lady chatted to us telling us about the paintings, the history and even brought a little mini chair for my handbag! We enjoyed a few glasses of champagne and as we had such a lovely time we returned the following evening before dinner. Top class service in a stunning, must see hotel.‚Ä¶",50
This is the place to stay when I‚Äôm Cotai! Everything about the property is fabulous and our Parlor Suite was incredible!

It was a real treat and I would stay there again in a heartbeat!   ,50
"We have stayed at some hotels in Macau, Wynn Palace is one of the best hotels. Though Wynn doesn't have the cable car ride, or water park as in the other hotels, Wynn does have the skycab, unlimited access for hotel guests, with views of the Performance lakes, where the fabulous fountain shows occurs every half an hour.   Gorgeous flowers display in the foyer, hallway and escalator entrance.   Pool was close due to maintenance during our visit, can't comment on it.  We were lucky to be upgraded to  a beautiful room with the fountain view, featuring a huge suite, with separate living room, luxurious bath, linen closet and lots of storage space. Ladies will like this room, it has everything that a woman wants, beautiful samples of the bath products are a plus.  Wynn is flexible.‚Ä¶",50
"My original plan was to stay at Venetian but after I saw photos of Wynn Palace including the guest room, I've decided immediately that I want to spend the night here. I want to celebrate my birthday here and I was surprised when I was given a room upgrade to the Fountain Queen Suite. The complimentary birthday cake is also yummy and the food is delicious. Even my mom enjoyed the entire experience with Wynn Palace. Although I left my pink bluetooth headphone and memory card inside the room, that still didn't ruin my overall experience. I would definitely recommend this. I also want to take this opportunity to commend Queenie from the VIP Registration and Paul from the Bell Service who assisted us with a smile. They were courteous the entire time.",50
If you‚Äôre in Macau for some hours you can try out the Wynn palace casino. But if you‚Äôre looking for alcoholic drinks you‚Äôll get disappointed because they just serve soft and hot drinks. But still fun! Nice view outside! ,50

We were placed in a relatively big room in general hotel standard with big bathroom! The entire room is well lit and spacious! A full wall of window except that ours is facing an airport. There are up to date control gadgets and switches for lightings and a giant 63 inch TV. There is also a buit-in TV in the bathroom mirror. We were impressed indeed. The common areas were clean and well maintained also. We had a great stay!,40

"When we had some fun inside the casino at midnight (sic bo and baccarat) around 3 hours, 2 of the casino officers came into us and offered us 3 free rooms for one night staying in Wynn Palace Hotel! (we‚Äôre 5 of us)  Pros: -The room was too huge especially in Macau‚Äôs room-size hotel üòÇ -A very comfortable king-size bed üëç -4 bottles of mineral water provided daily for complimentary service üòò  We enjoyed our staying in Wynn Palace!! We had some fun too inside the casino!!  Food‚Äôs taste and service at Pronto Cafe was amazing ü•≥  PS: 1100, 1712, and 1717 was our room number",50
"My wife and I were staying here as part of an extended honeymoon. The staff at the Wynn Palace were great in providing us with an upgrade. We stayed in the parkour suite which was the most amazing suite/room we have stayed in. The room was remarkable and oozed class and sheer opulence. However, it didn‚Äôt end there - the service we received from the staff at Wynn Palace was even better. The small touches after our room was cleaned - always brought a smile to our face. My glasses were left in the bathroom and we would be pleasantly surprised to find a lens cleaner would be left next to them and my earphones would be placed in a small pouch to ensure they weren‚Äôt misplaced. My wife and I would like to say a big thank you to all the staff at Wynn palace especially Moon for providing‚Ä¶",50
"I think staying at Wynn palace hotel was better than Las Vegas. Even though I didn't go casino, Every service was satisfactory. Complementary cable car was great, foutain was best thing ever in Asia, I think.",50
"The hotel is amazing. All the staff are friendly and helpful. Wonderful fountain view, luxurios and spacious room, room service is beyond expectation. Best hotel I have ever stayed in. Highly recommend!!! ",50
"I visited Macau for the first time, and it was so great and comfortable to stay at the hotel with my family. In particular, my family was served by all kind staffs working there. So, I'll recommend it to my friends who intend to have a trip to Macau.",50
"This is the best time in my trip. With fontine show and skycab is the best. If there is some not for pool time. it would be the best hotel, i think so. And there is only one macarons to 2people, and another room is two macarons for 2people. If you correct about this, it will be great",40
Excellent service from entry to departure by staff. Always a smile to customers and eager to help and support. A place travelers should stay at least once to enjoy their 5-6 stars service and accommodation. This place displays luxury in all aspects.,50
wynn palace was nice about everything and I wanna go again. I was thanksful about cleanless nevertheless it was very night. every person was very kind and I was very happy korean staff is there. shuttle bus is also good,50
A very palatial place and the most wonderful facilities and ambience totally ruined by rude and arrogant staff!!!  The only two staff I would recommend is Britney and Patrick in reception!!!   The room was upgraded to a parlor suite and that was pure bliss.... Great property but need to work on your software... And unfortunately that's what counts... The people working to deliver that service.  Pics attached. ,10
I have stayed many times at Wynn Las Vegas but Wynn Palace really takes it to another level. Everything from the time you enter to leave is just perfect.  The food at the Fontana buffett is some of the best I have tasted.,50
"We had a lovely 2-night stay.  Everything was delightful -- the room, check-in and check-out process, pool, SW Steakhouse, and shopping.  The service throughout the hotel was outstanding, and the hotel is just gorgeous.  We enjoyed the Sky Cab and the watershow too.  We also visited the other Wynn hotel in Macau and had a fabulous dinner at the Ristorante il Teatro with a table near the window overlooking the water.  The watershow there is fabulous, even better than the one at Wynn Palace.",50
The place is so nice and luxury. The bed very comfort.  You can ride the cable car for free. ( Fyi there were cable car as a facility hotel for the guest)  Here you can find the casino at ground floor and many store and restaurant.,50
You have to take the cable car to reach the mail entrance of this hotel from main road. Best in house shopping mall with international brands. Big casino hall. Very well decorated and warm welcome by hotel staff.,50
"We have just left this hotel on 29 Dec 2018, having stayed for 2 nights and it was without doubt, the best hotel we‚Äôve ever stayed in. Ever. Anywhere.  First of all, when travelling to Macau...we flew from Europe to Hong Kong airport. Without going through we immigration, we booked the Cotai Water Jet ferry which leaves from the airport to Macau. You do not collect your bags at baggage reclaim. The ferry staff do that for you and transfer them to the ferry and so the next time you see your bags that you checked in with the airline at your point of origin, is in Macau. It sounds dodgy, but it went seemlessly and we collected our heavy luggage in the Macau ferry terminal, or should I say, Taipa terminal. From there, you get on a complimentary hotel coach straight to the Wynn‚Ä¶",50
"My background is architecture, so my visit was more about seeing the design, amenities, art, finishes, and general layout It was also of interest to see how it compared with the Wynn in Las Vegas, USA. Steve Wynn was among the first to seriously bring high quality art to gaming venues and is great business genius as well. I was not disappointed (ok, the fantastic waterworks are a little bit more grand in LV but this was very good). Just really loved all the things related to the architecture and furnishings. Spent time in the gaming areas, restaurant, and the other rotunda attractions - wow, just fantastic. I love the attention to detail and the great taste in finishes and materials along with the design variety and adjustments to different functions. Although the public is‚Ä¶",50
"We had an incredible 2-night stay at Wynn Palace. Simply perfect. They upgraded us to the Parlor Suite (given my hotels.com gold status) which is probably most beautiful hotel suite I‚Äôve ever stayed. The spa is unbelievable‚ÄîI will fly back to Macau just to get the massage and use their amazing spa facilities. All the meals we had at the hotel are delicious and reasonably priced for the hotel of this caliber, especially Mizumi (thanks again RJ and chef Yasuda san!) I‚Äôve stayed at Wynn Las Vegas multiple times but this hotel (albeit smaller in size) set the bar really high. All of the staff from the VIP registration to bell attendants are really helpful and courteous. We were also allowed a late check-out at 2:30 pm just so we can make the use of the free spa pass! And they booked‚Ä¶",50
"Wynn Palce was the best hotel to us. This hotel was very luxury, beautiful and convenient. Location was good as well. I hope to stay in this hotel when I visit Macau again.: )Thank you for all staffs!!",50
"I have stayed in various 6 stars properties before but this has got to be 7 stars, a new level. The hotel is located at Taipa area, along with the rest of the high end hotels, which is 5 minutes drive from Taipa ferry terminal, 15 minutes drive from Macau-Zhuhai-Hong Kong customs. The hotel has many free shuttle buses going different routes to various parts of Macau (took 15 minutes shuttle bus to Macau area and walked 15 minutes to Saint Paul ruins easily). As hotel is new, facilities and room are in mint condition. The front desk staff are very friendly, and able to speak good English and Mandarin (we don't speak Cantonese). They gave us a good orientation of the property and provides maps/shuttle bus timings, gave restaurant suggestions in town, showed concern of our stay and‚Ä¶",50

"Booked the room for the weekend. It was my second time to stay in this hotel. Surprisingly got an upgrade to a suite room this time!   Spent 5 mins at the reception to check in and bellman escorted us to the room. The suite room is huge with lots of extras and all the amenities U need are well prepared. A big and comfortable bed give me a good dream.   Had a amazing dinner buffet in their restaurant with the wonderful fountain view and water shows. Really enjoy my dinner time there!   Again, I don't have time to experience their sky cabs - always have so many people there...  Service was excellent, ambiance was elegant...So relaxing to have my weekend in Wynn Palace!  ",50
"A brilliant hotel! Very spacious and luxury hotel room. Polite staff, good service, delicious food, excellent spa, and spectacular fountain!  Let me express a sincere appreciation to the Japanese restaurant service attendant  - RJ (and the other Thai girl in the Thai restaurant, spa therapist - Annabelle, and the super nice Taiwanese girl at the VIP front desk.  Overall 6 stars worthy.   I‚Äôm looking forward to my next stay, probably during summer :)",50
"Although I didn't stay here, I did get the chance to walk around the beautiful grounds and eat at one of the restaurants. It is the definition of luxury! Everything looks so new and the grounds are kept very clean. It is very high end. One mistake I made was not knowing that there was another Wynn property on the other island which had a restaurant we wanted to go to, which caused a bit of confusion but that was my fault.",50
"Everything is good.big room, comfortable bed,big bathroom,reception and room service staff are friendly. Everything in this hotel is delicate.. Shuttle bus provide very frequent ,i had never wait for more than 8 min and a lot station to different place. Would come back again if the price is not too high..",50
"I would like to say thank you for all the staff who treats us very well. Thanks to housekeeping for making up our room everyday. We‚Äôve been to a lot of places, staying in beautiful and luxurious hotels but WYNN PALACE is the one who caught our attention and amazed us so much. Thank you to PATRICK for assisting us our needs. He is very attentive and gentlemen. He make my mom really happy for making her a delicious coffee. We never experienced that kind of service in other hotel.

"My husband and I booked 2 nights at Wynn Palace for some R&R. Sheer relaxation and some gambling fun at the casino. Unfortunately we had had some unpleasant experiences but I like to commend the wonderful staff, Chris Un and another manager, Jason for their swift response and immediate action to rectify the hiccups. They assured us that they always provide their guests with the highest standards and they did. I like to thank the hotel and the staff, namely Chris, Jason and Ralf (Housekeeping) for the effort that they put into making our stay more than pleasant and treated us like royalty.",40

"I came here primarily to compare it with the Vegas sister and was not disappointed. This place is decked out almost identically, albeit that there is a definite difference in the mood down on the tables. People gambling here mean business and are not here just for fun. I also found this place to be much-needed restbite from the swarms of people pounding the streets of Macaus. At that moment, it was bliss. ",50
"Arrived early and immediately received our room (even a free upgrade). Extremely clean, cleaning staff even passed by twice a day, left a personal message and chocalates. Breakfast buffet and dinner buffet were the best we've done in Macau, with amazing view from the fountains.  We will definitily stay here again if we visit Macau again.",50
" Nice room with excellent window view of fountain show, either night or day, particularly the good service of a delicious breakfast buffet. You would have a surprise birthday gift then. I like the Thai food at the cafe and the 8 Chinese restaurant inside the casino.",50
"The hotel did have a very beautiful decoration, you may enjoy a feast with our eyes. However, I had a horrible experience at the last momemt. FOUR peoples used more than 25 minutes to find our bags. We almost missed our boat on that day. This mess really destorys all my good impression on this hotel. The efficiency of the hotel service is really bad.  Anyway, you may take a round of the hotel.",20
"Stayed at this beautiful hotel for 3 nights. The service has very good from the time you reached the hotel.  The hotel receptionists were extremely patience & answered our queries professionally.   We were given a room at the 25th floor & the views are beautiful.  Next, on the room, the housekeeping team has done well in keeping the room clean & everything one would need to have are in the room.  On other services, the hotel provides free buses to many locations like other hotels, ferry terminals, airport, old town etc. Wynn palace is definitely one of the best hotels that I have stayed in Macau.

"I can not say enough how impressed I was with the amazing experience we had here.   From check-in, Ron was kind enough to upgrade us to a parlor suite. It was breathtaking. After we picked up our keys, everyone we came across smiled and welcomed us, and that friendliness and level of service persisted our whole stay. I have never experienced service like this anywhere else in Asia.   The hotel was beautiful, well appointed, and just, simply, stunning.   Thank you Wynn hotel for the best experience in Macau!!

"From Sheraton we walked over and entered Wynn Palace on October 25 around 1025-1030pm via the cable car station in the building. Upon entering the premises and I approached the only staff there to enquire when next show will start.   He looked at me, smirking, and simply replied sarcastically (I can understand but can't speak) in cantonese:  ""You speak to me in English? I DO NOT KNOW English.""   More smirking and all the while with an altitude like a rude, impolite and unwelcoming bouncer from an underground gambling den.  I was extremely shocked and disappointed the very first Wynn staff I approached was behaving in such an unprofessional manner. Naturally our money went to other nearby casinos that night.   Talked about first impression.",10

Wonderful stay at Wynn Palace and this time we tried both signatures restaurants incl Mizumi Sushi and Wynn Steakhouse and their food quality plus ambiance were excellent especially the master Japanese Chef was so friendly. The steakhouse with hi tech 3D show was amazing.  The hotel king fountain suite is incredible comfortable with huge space and colorful. The music fountain every 30mins were so enjoyable plus breathtaking view from our suite window. The fountain show is different every time we watched. The cable car is a plus.  The hotel staff were exceptional helpful throughout our stay. Actually we reported lost and found on our mobile phone which was lost during our fast jet boat trip to Macau. Wynn concereage staff was excellent helping us to coordinate with boat company‚Ä¶,40
What a beautiful palace we visited at night and were awestruck with the lighting and vibe ... so lit up shiny and marvellous.... the flower display they had when we visited was a huge shiny pink egg with lighting and there would be a little show every 15 minutes.... must visit.

Just come back from Macau and was at the Wynn Palace. The new one not the old.. I must say amazing every detail.. This hotel is a casino first and foremost but you have the luxurious shops and just to wander round is fantastic. Rooms are wow.. It's what you would expect from this hotel. Didn't win on the table's this time but definately did with the hotel. A must for anyone visiting Macau. There are of course the other hotels ie The Venetian MGM but they are too overcrowded with Tourists. Wynn Palace is a must.,50

Read all the good stuff other reviewers observed about the rooms.  For me it was the great guest experience - the holy grail of the service industry. It was as close I got to experience it at the Wynn Palace. From the pickup at the Taipa ferry terminal, to the porter that took my luggage upon arrival, to the registration and check-in counter, I was greeted and with smiles all the way. A good start.

I have never seen so much marble used in any property ever before. Absolutely NO cost spared.   The service also provided at check in and check out was exceptional keeping in mind the size of this mega hotel. They have clearly divided the reception into 2 separate parts of the building in order to easy the traffic during check in and check out times making it seem as if you are in a small boutique hotel.

The bathrooms are generous and have a separate shower stall and make up vanity.  Everything has a high quality finish.    The next issues are purely a matter of taste.  The room was a very bright shiny combination of red, white and gold.  This is true of much of the rest of the property. It is exceptionally bright.  I almost feels at times brighter than full daylight outside. It is as bright as a Wall Street trading floor or a computer chip manufacturing plant.

We wander around the hotel waiting for our rooms and took the skycab which was fabulous. Rooms are big and plush, but the amenities are nothing to brag about, they only provide the basic instant coffee and the soap/shampoo are quite basic and small. The housekeeping staff were fab and took care of every little detail in the room. It's very hard to get a decent meal at the hotel, most restaurant charges outrageous price for okay food.",50

"We've been to many good hotels in Macau and wanted to try something new and different.  We chose Wynn Palace but really got a mixed feeling - the hotel was not bad at all, and actually it was great by itself, particularly for its newness, its unique cable car around the spectacular fountain show, the swimming pool facing the fountains which is good for kids, and importantly its friendly staff and service.  However all the good things can be disappointed by the Mainland Chinese guests who tend to be noisy, disturbing, sneezing crazily in the breakfast buffet area or spitting around the pool.  You know all that, and it's indeed not the hotel's fault, but it's something that the hotel can do and didn't seem to want to do anything about.  Another thing - the decoration of the hotel‚Ä¶",40

"We stayed for three nights. This hotel is not good if you are bringing kids. The problem is not really about the hotel staff or the infrastructure. There are just too many mainland Chinese people running around the hotel. They are not nice and friendly.  For example, we used our room card to get into the express queue for the cable car service. A mainland Chinese lady was originally in the normal queue. She came over to my queue and said that they know us and ""join"" us (i.e. jumping the queue).  Another example: In the middle of the day, two other Mainland Chinese tourists were wandering in the lift lobby. When we entered the lift, they followed us. We used our room card to go to my floor.

Everything in this place was totally spotless. The room was to die for, we could have just spent all our time in the room it was that beautiful. Love the little extras we got in our room the tea caddy as a souvenir, and the Wynn Macarons our maid left us by the bed as a good night treat. The staff also couldn't be more helpful, and even helped us check in for our flights returning to Beijing the next day. Everything is so well kept and pool is super clean. I think the little touches that the staff give you make the experience so much better (taking you down to the pool area, giving‚Ä¶",50
"Relatively new (3 years, I think) - spectacular public areas and excellent upkeep of the main features - no limit to the use of fresh flowers. Excellent rooms available for a relatively modest price - had one night in a larger suite which was very well appointed and worth another visit. Easier at the Venetian for the complimentary points system for gamblers, but the quality of the surroundings and the effort put in by the staff on a continuing basis is a sight to behold. In terms of the communications for non - Chinese language speakers, it is better here than at the Venetian, but having my Chinese Wife available overcame any difficulties. All the Best.",50
"Stayed for a couple of nights with my wife while exploring Macau. It is a great hotel, very nice people. Didn't eat at the hotel (except for in Starbucks), so can't recomment the food. Only downside is that the hotel is a little bit far from everything, but there is a shuttle bus for taking you to other hotels in the city.",50
"This is just tasty! I love eating buffets but this is the best I've ever tried! The food there are in the best quality and the desserts are truly amazing! If you go there, you won't be able to go away from the tasty food! I recommend this to everyone that are coming to Macau or in Macau!  _dreaming to go back there_",50
"A magnificent accommodation in Macau with reasonable price. As soon as we got off from shuttle bus and entered the hotel, we knew that we had made a right choice! Everything popped up to our eyes was stunningly gorgeous!! Staff at the reception was sincere and attentive. This time we reserved a king palace room online and got upgraded to spa king (78 sq meters) at check-in without request.  Room was spacious, clean, comfortable and well decorated. Most room facilities including lights, air conditioning, curtains, etc were controlled by AI technology system which we could make adjustments thru the ipad devices located at each side of the bed.   The performance lake at this hotel absolutely made it a new landmark of the city! Although we couldn‚Äôt compare it with Bellagio Vegas,‚Ä¶",50

Fountain view room  was  very spacious and classy, comfortable and modern! All the staff service were Superb!!! Breakfast was nice with variety selection of deserts!! You can watch the fountain show every 20 min. both from ur room and the pool!  I really want to thank Wynny for making my stay wonderful!! Go for wynn palace fountain view room! U won‚Äôt regret!!!:))) ",50
"as one of the luxurious resorts in cotai strip, wynn palace is a winner by all standards. it features a skycab that you can ride for free to get inside the hotel. the pool was enticing from the viewpoint inaide the cable car. its mall at the ground level is certainly a high-end one, with stalls selling signature items ranging from shoes, bags and other apparel. i know many tourists are not buying because like us, they seldom visit those stores they pass by.   although more expensive than the hotels outside cotai, wynn palace is certainly worth staying at in the future.

"We traveled in a group of 17 including my mum who is wheelchair bounded. The entire logistics arrangement & support were extremely heart warming with sincere touch.  The hotel is our no.1 choice in macua & we look nowhere except Wynn palace because of their room, cleanliness, ambience,thematic restaurant & song from New York New York!  All staff are friendly & always go extra mile to assist us.  Last but not least, sad to hear the resignation of founder Mr.Steve Wynn. He‚Äôs a miracle & love to meet him one day.",40
"The hotel was without doubt the most amazing place in Macau, and possibly one of the greatest in the world. Before I mention the hotel room etc, just to begin by saying that THE CASINO HERE IS A MILLION TIMES BETTER THAN EVERY OTHER IN MACAU. We toured every casino in Macau and none even came close.   We stayed for 2 nights and were offered (without any requests from us) a free upgrade to an enormous suite with a fountain view. The whole experience was simply stellar - the service of every member of staff from the bellboy to the concierge, all the way to the staff at the pool. Everything we possibly needed was taken care of, and more. Even after checking out on the last day, we were treated like royalty at the pool and pool cafe. The staff were always there but never‚Ä¶",50
"Without a doubt, Wynn Palace is the best hotel in Macau. Recently, I was lucky enough to stay in the Parlor Suite, and it was truly special. Upon arrival, I was welcomed by one of the bellman, who instantly took my luggage, and welcomed me to the hotel. As the normal check-in was a little busy, one of the bellmen took me to the VIP check-in which was amazing. As I checked in, the same bellman offered me a bottle of water, which was definitely needed in the hot weather. The lady at the front desk informed me that my room was ready, even though I was a little late, and she along with the bellman took me to my room. Instantly, I could feel a personalized touch, even though it is a 1700 room hotel. I walked into the suite on the 25th floor and wow. It was huge!!! The room had a‚Ä¶",50

The room was so incredible that I didn't want to leave it at all.  I felt like I was actually a queen in my palace.  The hotel's shuttle bus system made it very easy to get to/from the ferry terminal, other resorts, and also to points of interests in Macau.     The hotel facilities were stunning.  We used the cable car multiple times for fun.  The restaurants were delicious.  The pool was beautiful.    The service was impeccable.  Each bellhop and front desk person was friendly and helpful.    I would definitely recommend this resort.  I'm already dreaming about going back.",50

Stayed her for a night on a boys only trip.  Short wait for the shuttle from the ferry station to the hotel.   Check-in was quite nice.  They couldnt get us rooms on the same floor so they upgraded us to a one bed room suite each.  What a faboulous exprience.    The rooms were very large and very tastfully appointed.  Enter into the bed room separated from the living room with a door.  Given its part of a casino late nights etc are common and therefore need for sleep for some while day light for others is a real thing.  The thoughfullness of the this room is that the large floor to ceiling windows in the  large living room is after the bedroom keeping the bedroom dark and quite even during the day  The decor is high end and very tasteful.

Although this time I haven‚Äôt stayed at Wynn Palace, definitely I will stay in-house on my next trip! I must say I was very surprised , since I noticed that most of the players are not drinking alcoholic beverages, and they are focused on the excitement and energies of the baccarat tables.  It was a very funny experience, to see so many people playing and not understanding anything they were talking about. The facilities are amazing , the skycab is delightful, all staff very friendly and smiley, I faced some challenges due to language limitations while asking for some simple questions regarding show scheduling or‚Ä¶",50
There's a shuttle bus to the hotel. The facade and entrance is already grand and the cable car is already a tourist destination. The lobby is really alive and colorful. The shops are upscale. The view in the room is incredible. The amenities and facilities in the room are outstanding. I love the music system!,50
"When you arrive from the ferry terminal there is a Shuttle bus that takes you to the hotel which is on the other side of Macao , but its a very nice bus and a great view along the way . It is very much like Vegas here so the grandiose hotels is most of the fun. The palace ids stunning from the outside and even more beautiful inside , the flower sculptures at each corner are exquisite. We got upgraded to a suite and what a room it was. Gigantic and beautifully appointed. China Tea cups , a gift in our room every nights huge tub. , incredible views . That night we ate in the Noodle house which was excellent and had a burger in the restaurant overlooking the fountain. We took the Gondola ride around the hotel twice as the hotel was nearly empty or felt that way, and it was so cool.‚Ä¶",50
Absolutely stunning hotel !! The rooms are like suites with gorgeous teal and white colour scheme. Bathrooms are spacious and stylish. We had a view of the pool and the cable car. Great music system in the room - the place had everything you could ask for. Fabulous stay! ,50

wow what a place! We loved it. Service was excellent. Room was huge. Casino was buzzing. Skytrain was brilliant with amazing views. Could not be happier with our choice of hotel. Free shuttles from/to ferry ports is perfect. Our one small criticism would be that the casinos do not cater for the novice gambler but that can be said for all of the places we went to in Macau.,50
"Looking for a disaster? Go to Wynn Palace.  After watching the Fountain show, I wanted to take a taxi. When I was trying to get in, the door staff literally just pushed me into the taxi and closed the door without noticing that 1/3 of my dress was stuck between the car door. By then my dress has already been ripped and I had to walk on the street with a huge hole in the back just right below my butt the whole night because I didn't bring any extra clothes with me and it was already late at night. It was one of my favourite dresses but the door staff just destroyed it and most importantly I was put into the most embarrassing situation ever as someone on the street even approached me and asked if I was ok (though I got raped or something).  This was absolutely ridiculous. A total‚Ä¶",10
Sincerely service. Clean room. Perfect show.  Beautiful robby.    But too narrow kingbed. Early closing time pool.  Best hotel to me. Thank you so much. Your kind of my wedding anniversary to congratulate.,50
"After initial visit was marred by disorganized service procedures, they are far better now. From the courtesy call to confirm your time of check in to make sure your room is ready, to having someone at check in to organize a queuing process, made everything smooth. As always the hardware was top quality from the vanity kits in the bathroom, to housekeeping. Even lift access security using lift access was now in place Check out was as smooth, where the lady organizing check out, noticing a small queue, moved us to the empty VIP registration. Only some minor gripes. On the now free skycabs, don't just allow priority queuing for guests on the way in, but also on the way out of the property.

"Though I stayed at Venetian in recent trip, next time it is gonna be Wynn palace. They have amazing cable cars (i couldn't ride as I was not staying in the hotel). But I and my 1.5 yr old daughter thoroughly enjoyed fountain show. She wasn't ready to leave even after show was over :D. Certainly one of fond memories I carried from this trip. Took a walk in the lobby and I am sure it is a happening place.  Thanx Wynn Palace. Way to go.",50
"The hotel is really beautiful, staffs are really professional and nice, we got upgraded to a lake view one bedroom suite, and provide us a extra single bed for our 5 years without extra charge. Check-in and out was really fast and smooth. The hotel have more than 5 restaurants, the red 8 restaurant is open for 24hour, the food are tasty and the not expensive at all. We will stay the hotel again if we back to Macau.",50
"I enjoyed my trip so much. The room is so beautiful and neat that I want to come back again.It was nice because I was so precious to myself and could check in quickly. The fountain show was great and the morning was great. But I had an upset stomach after eating, and it hurt for several days. I still want to go again.",50

This place exemplifies sheer class. The moment u set eyes here you will fall in love and feel like a real VIP.  incredibly BEAUTIFUL.  We vistedc macau for a day and came across this hotel. They have a beautiful cable carts outside the hotel. Complementary for everyone. The fountain show was top class better than the Bellagio hotel in Las vagas. We went inside to have a look and was blown away by the ambience. You will not be dissapoinnented. Immensely clean spacious and beautifully decorated. I fell in love. I could not  resist so currently  in the process of booking a stay here. One of the best hotels I've ever seen. Blown away. ,50
"2 night stay, everything was spot on. Service was fantastic throughout, rooms are spotless and impressively big. Lots of nice touches, left glasses on the table, turn down service popped a cleaning cloth under them. Hotel is busy without being crowded (unlike the Venetian which was crazy busy), variety of food places, shuttle buses will get you most places you want to go in a short time, the local taxis are cheap and will get you everywhere else. Would choose again if in Macau.",50
This is a very special hotel. They have their own cable car rides. Across this hotel you will find Hard Rock Caf√© Macau. There are a few places to eat at this hotel. The buffet coat about HKD280.00 and it is really worth it.,40
"We stayed in Wynn Palace for one night.  There are two Wynn Hotels in Macau. One is called ""Wynn Macau"" which is located at Macau Central while ""Wynn Palace"" is a newly opened one in Cotai.  We actually wanted to book Wynn Macau but our agent wrongly booked Wynn Palace for us. In my opinion, it is more convenient to stay in Wynn Macau as majority of the attraction  sites are within walking distance from Wynn Macau. However, Wynn Palace is more calm with less people. (Maybe due to its rather remote location?) Nevertheless, if you stay in Wynn Palace, free shuttles are available to and from Wynn Macau, other hotel nearby or the ferry terminal. We got a free upgrade to a Suite. The room is spacious and everything is excellent within it. No stain, No weird smell, Bed is comfortable,‚Ä¶",40

"2nd time here, with a bunch of friends. Had a smaller room than last time, that was the one with the extra study area, which was not utilised much. Other sections of bedroom and bathroom remains the same size. Didn't get a fountain view room but really not an issue. Ate the complimentary chocolates in the morning. Took their golden toiletries home. By the way the socket by the bedside table has USB ports, but it is quite close to the power sockets so one way or another it's a nice touch. Good value overall.  I have to praise the toilet paper again, because it is so soft and comfortable.",50

"We booked this suite because we wanted the fountain view and yes it was a great choice !  Room is big around 900+ Sf , clean and with nice amenities. They gave us a box of chocolate during their turn down service, that was  really sweet! The hotel provide free Shuttle bus to a few places and also cable car ride . We really had a wonderful time during our 4 days 3 nights stay! ",50
"This hotel is absolutely amazing. The staff are the most professional people I have ever seen in a hotel. The furniture is beautiful, the food is second to none. The transfer to other casinos is on time and flawless. Our room looking over the fountain was faultless, beautiful and I did not want to leave. Because of this hotel I would like to come back with my family so they can experience what we experienced. Macau is beautiful, clean and very well run city. The Wynn Palace will be remembered for a long long time. Thank you for making my stay one to remember.",50
"The hotel is not located at the heart of Cologne, but it doesn't matter as Cologne is so small that almost everywhere is within a walking distance. Anyway, very frequent shuttle buses are provided by the hotel  to bring you to the places nearby. The outlook of the hotel is similar to the one at Macau peninsula which belong to the same owner. So try not to rely on the photos of the hotel to find it. The hotel consists of 3 parts: North Wing, Central and South Wing. Rooms on the side that can enjoy the view of the Performance Lake (one special feature of the hotel) are preferred. Among these rooms, if you like to watch the water performance of the lake then you should choose the rooms at the central part. Try not to have a room at low levels at the South Wing because the cable‚Ä¶",40

"We walked over to the Wynn Palace whilst staying at the Sheraton. It was great to ride the Sky Cab up to the hotel - what a novel idea!   We walked around inside the shopping mall and enjoyed the flower masterpieces in the lobby entrances.   We asked if they have a bar and were directed to the Pool Cafe. It was lovely sitting outside watching the fountains and cable cars going by. The service, food and drinks were very good.   I would definitely recommend this bar for a quiet place to sit outside (there are not many outside bars!) in Macau. ",50
"Stayed here for 1 night as part of an event being organized here, and the hotel generously offered us complimentary rooms - and a suite for me.  I had seen the suites at Wynn Macau a few years ago, and this was arguably even more OTT.  I never really got a chance to use the living area of my suite during my short time there, other than putting a few things on the table in the dining area.  Never got a chance to use the coffee machine, or take advantage of the incredible range of snacks at the mini bar.  The bedroom opened up to the large bathroom, with a glitzy tub that I should have soaked in to ease my tired shoulders.  The shower stall was large and comfortable.  The double vanities and sinks were pretty far apart from each other, and would have given ample space between two‚Ä¶",50

She was so nice to arrange the chocolate box to celebrate my stay as well as full set of baby amenities been arranged prior my arrival. We were so surprise when we entered into our room, feel really warm welcome from your hotel. For sure this is our first choice :-)",50

We stay at Executive suite first time and this time we stay at fountain suite. Fountain suite offer very fantastic view of the Wynn Palace famous fountain show. But we still prefer the executive suite. The breakfast buffet is so amaze as they offer so much of variety foods, fruits and deserts. ",50

Speaking of the pool, there are many staff that ensure you have the best experience, from serving drinks to keeping you from disturb, they manage a good job.

The finest Frette linens, Molton Brown products, the softest water, even the hairdryers are the best available.   I was fortunate enough to stay in a suite which was as over the top as you could imagine even though my view was lacking.   My reason for taking off a star is the food.  I was onsite 5 days and as a vegetarian there are no options.  This is odd as Wynn himself is vegan.  There were a few options at the noodle restaurant but that was it aside from breakfast.

The parlor suite was simply luxurious beyond any description, and the jacuzzi bathtub was the highlight of that spacious bathroom. Love it! Fountain show watched from the skycab, buffet breakfast next to the lake view, and cuisines enjoyed at the palace-like decorated chinese restaurant - they do not provide services, they create memories. For me, what makes Wynn hotels stand out is not just the opulent materials every five star hotel in Macau already got. It is the attention paid to all details by all staffs that made every single moment of guest experience so special. I believe I will still remember our trip here after a long, long time.",50

I also cannot forget, the personnel who gave me customer service more than I expected was Patrick.

"I like this place. This‚Äôs really beautiful and nice. Decorating and show probably the best in Macau , all is new . And fresh flower smell in all over the hall of the hotel . I didn‚Äôt stay in the rooms , it‚Äôs crazy expensive but you should visit the casino and take a cable car. ",50
"Wynn is known to be a bit extravagant but with amazing eye for detail and extremely quality focused. That's what one can experience at Wynn Palace. An incredible casino resort, very service driven, overall the service team is extremely professional, friendly and polite, outstanding. The rooms and its amenities also top notch without a doubt. Spacious, comfortable, using modern technology that one can use without getting confused. There is simply nothing to fault, a flawless experience that I would love to repeat soon again.",50
"We stayed in Wynn palace during our recent trip in Macau, we love our big room with great few. We took Skycab too! It is different with Wynn in Macau side, Wynn palace are more of a luxury as it is new version of the old Wynn. But overall we are very happy and would like to come back again!",40
"There are few people as masterful at branding like Steve Wynn - from his unique tastes in decor and ambience, to his attention to detail. Upon entering the front lobby, it even smells the same as the Wynn/Encore Las Vegas. And if you have enjoyed a stay there, those emotions are already pre-empting your expectations before checking in. Quite smart, Mr. Wynn!",50
"We decided to celebrate my birthday with a trip to Macau and chose the Wynn Palace as it looked fantastic. On arrival at the ferry terminal we boarded the free shuttle bus that took us to the hotel.  Walking round the wide esplanades lined with designer shops confirmed the quality of the hotel - the artistic displys at each intersection were really eye catching. Once we got to registration things got even better - the gentleman managing our check in noticed it was my birthday and a phonecall later we were upgraded to a fiuntain suite on the 27th floor. The suite was huge and the best hotel room I have had the pleasure of staying in. As the name suggests we overlooked the lake at the front with the water fountain display, the living area itself was as big as most large sized‚Ä¶",50
"I think I stayed at the king fountain room. It‚Äôs giant, with two 65 TVs and a separate massage room section that I found after two days. The casino is chinese style so if you love Vegas don‚Äôt come to Macau, they have a different style",50
"This place is RIDICULOUS. I was expecting a beautiful hotel but this exceeded expectations. Of course every hotel/casino in Macau is exceedingly decorated and fitted out, and the Wynn Palace is no different. You feel like you're in a movie from entering the lobby to getting into your room. The room is beautiful and luxe, amazing amenities, huge comfy bed, and the bathroom even has a tv built into the mirror.  Wynn Palace is over the bridges in Macau, so if you want to explore Senado Square, St Pauls Ruins and all of the general Macau area you need to get a taxi, so if that's your main reason for going to Macau then stay closer to that area! The casino is beautiful, but it wasn't as easy to have a drink while you're playing as some other casinos in Macau. Their bar though is‚Ä¶",50
"Absolutely brilliant they treated our visit as though we were the vip of the hotel. They upgraded us we had not asked! The suite was spotless, two toilets, spar bath, lounge with 80 inc TV,Master bed 80inc TV all remote curtains lighting and more. Food was perfect more than a five star hotel .  Andrea",50
"Entering the hotel the lobby is stunning with an amazing indoor garden with beautiful flowers. Rooms were huge and very comfortable, great views as well. Service is great, excellent range and quality of restaurants. (Good place for vegetarian food as well). The pool is spectacular as well!",50
Such a beautiful resort with great services. Chinese restaurant is excellent. The Fortuna buffet cafe and sweet spot cake cafe  need some improvement. Overall a very well designed hotel with great amenities.,50
"Probably the prettiest integrated resort in the world. Service and amenities are top class. Need some work on the quality of food in the western restaurant but nevertheless, a great experience indeed.",50
Well designed hotel with many nice decor and intricate design. A hotel with class to pamper onself for a stay. There is a skycab which is a cable car that brings you to the light rail. There are also many branded shops and nicely designed F&B outlets,50
"This hotel is very similar to the Wynn in Las Vegas.  However, this is on a larger scale and has many more shops.  We ate at the ""buffet"".  Well, this is no ordinary buffet lobster claws and sashimi and shrimp and crab and on and on.  The quantity was good but the quality was fantastic.  I ate so much sushi and sashimi all of the most impeccable quality.    The rest of the hotel was amazing, clean and virtually brand new.  I knew how to play very few of the games in the casino so it was not that interesting to gamble and their poker room was closed.  I think that is the issue for most ""westerners"" is that the games in the casino make no sense.  There are a few familiar games such as baccarat.",50
"The stay was wonderful as the room was very clean, the room was spacious and there was nothing I can complain but to be thankful for people constantly asking me whether my stay was comfortable and tried to help me anyway. I stayed in January but this time I felt like there were more English speaker and that was very helpful for me. When I visit Macau again, I would definitely want to stay at this hotel again.",50
"A stay The Wynn Palace offers everything you would expect from an absolutely top-end resort. Our fountain suite was luxurious, and tastefully so. Breakfast buffet is quite possibly the best in Macau in selection, quality of ingredients, and service.   However, what's outside the room at the rest of the resort is just as important to your resort experience, and here one may be somewhat disappointed if outside the Wynn Palace's core audience of gamblers. The Wynn Palace resort facility is as a whole somewhat smaller in sheer size than some of the others on offer in Cotai. In terms of on-site shopping, dining, and entertainment this means that the options are necessarily limited compared to, say, the massive Four Seasons Plaza/Parisian/Venetian complex. Of course one can hop on one‚Ä¶",40
Excellent luxury hotel! Great value for money! Smiling quality delivering service from all staff members. Beautiful watershows every day. Ski-lift entry to the hotel makes you smile every day. Excellent food & bar at the premices! Great getaway for couples!,50
"Exceptional in every way   Wynn Palace is a splendid property that truly has to be seen to be believed. My room was upgraded to a fountain parlor suite and I could not have been more blown away by it. I would imagine that even their basic rooms offer a level of luxury and attention to detail that is hard to find anywhere else in the world. But despite this, the folks at Wynn Palace have somehow managed to outdo themselves by making the beauty of the grounds and rooms only their second-greatest achievement.   By, far the most incredible thing about Wynn Palace, in my view, was the gracious and personalized service that I met in my every interaction with the staff there. This was true, and this is a crucial point that sets Wynn apart from other properties in Macau, in both the‚Ä¶",50
"This was one of the best things we did when staying in Hong Kong and Macau was to opt for a bit of luxury at the Wynn Macau.  It was very easy to get to from Hong Kong, take the ferry which is about an hour to Macau and then pop on the free bus and they drop you off at the hotel. Service was impeccable, everyone from the front desk to the porter and waiters and waitresses were extremely prompt, efficient and friendly. The room was amazing, we found a deal for the night through booking.com and booked a night in the Parlour Suite. The room is massive and had a high level of cleanliness. The TVs were huge, the room was huge but the bathroom was the best bit for me, most of it was from marble, every vanity item was available at no extra charge. Bottom line is that the bathroom is‚Ä¶",50
"The support staff are very helpful and the rooms are amazing. I really enjoy the big space and also the amenities provided. I did not have a chance to try the breakfast, however, more of the amenities and service provided are five star to me.  ",40
"High light of our trip to Macau ,from the ambience ,to the quality of food , to the choices,  price was reasonable , highly recommend it . Their dessert menu is extensive and sashimi bar with lobster claw in butter sauce is just great",50
Oh no~~ I wrote down lots of things but they were gone. Anyway our family had great time and we hope to have a chance to stay again. I wrote ma feeling in ptecious page. You can find it. Thanks and happy newwwwwww year!,50
"Outstanding place... Amazing service....I can only recommend this wonderful place, be it for the rooms, the restaurants, the attractions or the shopping gallery. I Have visited most of the other casino/hotels in the city, and would definitely return to the Wynn Palace",50
"We loved wynn palace so much, 2 days stay there simply was not enough. We love the convenience of the shuttles that go basically anywhere in and around macau. The luxuries that the hotel offered blew us away, especially as we were upgraded to a suite room with a great view of the fountains. Highly recommended.",50
"Grand and huge hotel, newly renovated with large number of shops located within, a special thanks for the great service from the receptionist Mr. Elliott upon check in. Large selection of restaurants and bars and convenience with the shuttle services. ",50
Just wow! I'm floored by the grandiosity of this hotel! The best hotel in Macao! Booked the fountain suite and it's fabulous! Huge and nice views of the fountain. So lavish...couldn't ask for more! Skycab is a nice touch. My kids thoroughly enjoyed it. I love this place and I'm glad to have stayed here. Highly recommended!,50
"This is a new hotel in Cotai Strip, and decoration is  beautiful and with unique style.Room was big and clean,The staff is  polite and very helpful,.The fountain show is very nice and worth to watch, taking the cable car is free, enjoy the stay",40
"We booked ours online didn‚Äôt know exactly what to expect other than a good reference from one of my colleagues and sparkling reviews over TripAdvisor (TA) but the result of our faith to the TA was above and beyond!   Our 27th floor room was absolutely gorgeously stunning. Check in time was fast, no fuss no hassles. Sherry, one of the VIP Receptionists, along with her supervisor were great and both provided us with excellent services.   Hotel‚Äôs staffs are courteous and helpful! We will definitely be back next time!   ",50
"Although I have visited many times already, I have more fun than I expected. So when I visit Macau, I will choose the British Empire again. However, I like the show which I like to watch on the lake, but I felt sorry that I did not see it because it was under construction.",50
"Great hotel with very spacious rooms and excellent service and amenity. The hotel is a complete resort by itself and you can rest inside and do all entertainments, shopping and eating without going out!  Book a lake view room and see the cable car and the performing lake in action. Weekday rate is reasonable for a hotel of such ultra luxury. That is the reson why I make return visits from time to time, and I always have a best time.",50
"Wonderful hotel, very friendly staff. Great rooms and decoration. Excellent food. Greatly enjoyed the fountain as well as the entertainmen in the SW steakhouse, which serves great food with very friendly service. Breakfast buffet was very good.",50
"The most impressive thing for me is the service of hotel staff at counter of Check in. The eye contact from staff Xuan Xuan (a 2 words name, sorry, too difficult for me to write over the keyboard) from the door way, up to the counter and her smile and her attention to details was perfect! I think she is a great asset for the hotel!",50
"It was great experience in Wynn palace. I can't forget the scent of flowers when I entered the hotel. The room, Fontana, fountain, staff and etc. are perfect. Wynn palace is and will be the best hotel I've ever been.",50
I visited Wynn palace hotel as a family trip with my mom. She said that it was the best hotel experience in her life. I really enjoyed staying in the Wynn palace hotel. I am truly grateful for their services.,50
"WE were fortunate enough to have been treated to a 3 night stay early December in one of their rooms and all I can say is that the hotel is awesome, one of the best if not the best in Macau.  I heard 20M HKD was spent for each room and it would not be surprising if you see the room, the finish, the beds, the ipad room controller, the bathroom, the TV, everything is beautiful including the amenities.  Try eating at Wing Lei palace at night and ask for a table by the window and be dazzled by the water display by the front of the hotel--it is spectacular, the synchronization  and color changes for the water display--beautiful.  All the food outlets even room service serve the best quality food, the porters and bellhops are aplenty and there is always someone ready to help you carry‚Ä¶",50
"We had a lovely room facing the fountains. Be aware that the room has a lounge area with fountainview and wall separates that from the bedroom so you can't see the fountains from your bed like in the pictures! The bedroom is spacious, bright, clean and comfottable. Really nice bathroom as well! The hotel is filled with things to do, great restaurants, casino, shopping, attractions and much more!!!",50
"A very well decorated and designed hotel.  Wide open spaces adorned with flowers and colours. Great service and wonderful facilities.  Nice restaurants and good choices too.  The only setback are they only offer normal Nescafe sachets in the hotel rooms, no Nespresso and they should strictly prohibit guests smoking in non-smoking floors!!",50
"Wynn Place has always provided us a place for relaxation. This is our second time in a year staying in this place. Our family always can feel so relax and we like the room and service provided by them. They are all very friendly. The only two things that we are missing out this round were the swimming pool due to weather and renovation; and the smoke salmon sandwiches that we used to purchased from Sweets cafe which was no longer available. My son will usually look forward to have the sandwiches for his tea time. It would be nice if they could have it back again. It is also nice to spend more time in the room, so that we could relax and take a good break.",50
"Wynn Palace is certainly the best palace/hotel I have seen. The staff and the service was above expectations. We've got the chance to be upgraded to a parlor fountain suit for my mother's birthday and it was amazing. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Macau.  The hotel also offers complementary shuttles from the ferry terminal, the airport to Macau Old Town or to Cotai Strip.",50
Every time I spend time in one Hotel of Wynn‚Äôs collection my time is simply fantastic. Wynn Palace is the best option in Cotai Strip as Wynn Macau is the best in Macau. I hope to come back soon. The other hotels have to learn a lot,50
Everything was perfect . Nice staffs. Good service . We were staying at queen fountain suit with amazing fountain view . The breakfast was perfect also . Nice decoration with fresh flowers everyday ... hope to go there soon,50
"Spend a night with kids for wife's birthday. The friendly staff upgrade our room after knowing my staying purpose. The room is luxurious, spacious that my kids had a lot of fun. Skycab and buffet is great as usual with fountain view. As a local we stay in hotel for occasional celebration and Wynn Palace is by far the best overall experience we ever had.",50
Very nice environment. Too bad Poker room is closing down at this casino. Very nice hotel rooms. The dinner buffet here is excellent. Wynn Palace staff is very friendly. Last day before I left Macau I visited Wynn Macau and the service there is very rude and not welcoming. All the staff members at this location is very cranky and rude. Not going back Wynn Macau ever again.,50
"The hotel's room is very nice, the staffs are very helpful, even the check in was quite fast.my kids enjoy the room and the sky cab so much. The hotel provide shuttle bus to many areas so it's quite convenient.",50
We stayed here for one night as part of our honeymoon in Hong Kong and it was amazing. Upon check in we were upgraded to a fountain view suite which gigantic with perfect views of the fountain shows.   We had dinner in the SW Steakhouse which is one of the best experiences I‚Äôve had in a restaurant. The food and drinks were perfect with a vast menu to choose from. The staff were ultra attentive and so knowledgable about every aspect. There is also a stage show that happens every 30 minutes which kept us entertained throughout the meal.  The casino has all the games you would expect with baccarat dominating as the game of choice. The minimum bets are high at the tables but it is to be expected in a place as grand. One thing I did struggle slightly with was getting an alcoholic‚Ä¶,50
"The friendly staff, clean and spacious rooms were very good, the restaurants and cafes in the hotel were also good with taste and service, especially James. I would like to have a convenience store in the hotel for the next use. Thanks to you, I'm going to rest well. Next time I go to Macau, I will go to Wynn Palace Hotel again. Thank you.",50
"I have several times stayed with Wynn Palace but this time it was a nightmare. The Hotel is beautiful and amazing but the beauty doesn‚Äôt reflect the Service you get. We booked for 3 nights but due to some misunderstandings and errors, which was not caused by us, they had in their System the booking for one night. Upon Arrival we informed the Front Desk clearly that we are staying for 3 Nights which they were fine with. Next day we start getting calls from the early morning if we were checking out. We informed them again that we will be staying for 3 Nights. We thought now the issue is solved and we can enjoy our stay but then in afternoon someone else calls us with the same question and at night again. This happened every single day. We had to confirm to more than 10 different‚Ä¶",10
"It was one of our BEST vacations ever anywhere in the world. Lobbies, interiors, restaurants, name it! We availed the complimentary upgrade to the Palace Suite as it was their 1st Anniversary promo. The room was luxurious with white and gold decors, jacuzzi, bed, linens and pillows, giant Smart TV's, amenities, Nespresso machines, etc etc are all high-end. We don't want to leave the room! LOL But we have to avail too of  the free cable car rides, shuttle buses that  goes in prominent drop offs/pick-ups  in the country and watch the their Dancing Fountain!  Aside from the room itself, the people are very warm and friendly. I have to say special mention to the following staff who made our experience the best so far: Freddie and Alicia (Front Office), Zed (Fontana Buffet), Darlyn &‚Ä¶",50
wonderful trip and we had great fun from conveniently connecting our nintendo switch to the huge TV in the room! the front office even prepared some chocolates for me as birthday surprise during checkout even if i didnt mention it was my birthday.,50
We spent the one night our biggest mistake wasn't spending more. From the moment we took the free shuttle from ferry terminal it was a great experience. Every staff we made contact with were friendly and willing to help. Both my wife and I have been travelling a lot over the last 10 years and Wynn Palace was by far the best experience.  We got upgraded from our basic room to a Parlor suite which was amazing one of the biggest rooms we have ever stayed in. The cable car was a good experience. We had drinks at Wing Lei Bar which had a great selection at a good price our waitress was really nice and enjoyed the endless supply of nuts and chips. The pool was closed while we were here due to the typhoon which was disappointing as it looked amazing but you can't control mother nature.,50
"It's a birthday celebration and we get to go try the new Wynn Palace and it's super grand! And the rooms are very spacious! There are a lot of restaurants so we have spent the days only in the hotel, trying to explore it.",50
"Everything in this this hotel is SUPER and extraordinary.   Perfect service, hotel deco, room design, cable car ride, foundation show, buffet breakfast etc..... are all so wonderful.  It's my son's birthday and we got a room upgrade to our surprise!!! We feel like staying in a real Palace!  So happy! Will definitely come back again :) ",50
Luxury hotel with modern style facilities. The digital control panel is very useful advanced.  I am not sure but I didn't find the pillow menu in room since the pillow is not firm. The toilet flush button is so loud and scared me at night.,40
"Will stay again next time. Hotel has good smell, good environment, clean ... hotel room has big space divided into 3 which is toilet, sleeping room and living room. Fountain view can enjoy the nice view, but Wynn Macau more interested.",50
"This was our last hotel in Macau after having tried 5 of the best and to our biggest surprise, WYNN PALACE is the place we were MOST HAPPY!! The big difference to the other hotels is the fact that they employ many women. And women by DNA have this ‚Äúmother instinct‚Äù this warmth, compassion, kindness, that will make your trip a HEAVEN! The lady at the reception searched for us tre most amazing room, in PEACOCK Color, and here comes our special recommendation, they call it Peacock and it actually is a Tahitian Ocean Turquoise color, it is extremely relaxing to have a room like that, because it feels like a tropical vacation!! The wood is all white with gold elements, what adds such a luxurious feeling, making these suites feel like paradise, and I say this after having tried there‚Ä¶",50
"From the moment we arrived in Wynn Palace, we were simply dazzles with entertainments. The attractions throughout this enchanted destination captivates every senses- from the lush flowers, dancing waters and accents of gloss.  Unfortunately, the ‚Äúdragon ‚Äú show is under renovation ( will open in December) so we were unable to see it. ",50
I stayd wynn first last week my choice is best wynn agents are very kind  also I satisfied  thanks to upgrade and excelent service I got my honey I will visit wynn I will recommend my friend and my coworkwers,50
"This was our second visit and the Wynn Palace is a lovely hotel. On both occasions of our visits, December 2016 and October 2017 the swimming pool was being renovated, this seems to be a permanent thing which I think is quite bad for such a great hotel! I would advise to get this finished ASAP and not linger on for another year. All other aspects of the hotel were great, the room, the breakfast, the cable car, the water shows, were all first class.",40
"Stayed here last Oct 31 to Nov 1 as part of our 5 days vacation in HongKong and Macau.  We booked the Wynn anniversary sale for a very good price.  The moment we arrived at the hotel lobby, we were amazed with the hotel designs and the warm welcome of the staffs.  We were so happy with our room upgraded to Parlor Suite and they provided my son a very delicious birthday cake.  My son was very happy with it and the balloon decoration in our room.  Although their swimming pool was still under renovation, they booked us at Wynn Macau for swimming. So this was not really an issue for us.  My kids also loved the ride at SkyCab, 11 minutes cable car ride in front of the hotel.  Hats off also to their housekeeping because when we got back to our room, they clean all our stuffs and‚Ä¶",50
"Love the hotel, design is very grand. Clean, classy and luxury :) Quite empty in October... The breakfast is fabulous too. Thumbs up! However when we were there swimming pool was under reno, bummer :(",40
"Booked the room in advance as they have a promotion that upgrades you right away for suite. Wasn‚Äôt disappointed with my choice. We had a dinner buffet at the cafe Fontana. I‚Äôm very pleased that they arranged our table just beside the window where we can have a very nice view of the lake while there‚Äôs a water show. For the food you wouldn‚Äôt be disappointed too as even it‚Äôs not so big of buffet, taste of the food wasn‚Äôt compromised. From the seafood selection, steak, their desserts and the rest. It‚Äôs all thumbs up!!! Best place for buffet! Would definitely recommend and come back here. ",50
"The hotel as a whole is great. Room is big and clean. Equipment and amenities are high standard. I especially like to in room B&O sound system which can connect to my iPhone and enjoy music at the room.  Unfortunately, the swimming pool is closed until next year....",50
"We stayed in the hotel with small kids for several nights and enjoyed this much. Everything was excellent - rooms, staff, surrounding. Only one problem - during peak hours (around 9-11) there is a long line to enter breakfast buffet. Breakfast itself was very good.",50
I have stayed in many hotels in my 56 years.  This was the BEST hotel room I have stayed in.  It was an awesome suite and everything was perfect from the moment we checked in until checkout 3 days later.  I recommend this over all other hotels in Macau.  Thank you for a fantastic vacation.,50
"The best of Bellagio and Wynn Vegas = Wynn Palace.  The opulent hotel is floral themed with real flowers used throughout the hotel.  The faberge egg musical display, Jeff Koons tulips and 16-foot-high musical floral carousel to name a few. We enjoyed watching the performance lake fountain circled by the skycab.  We took the complimentary shuttle from airport to the hotel.  Staff came to open our door and grab our luggage (all I noticed was how tall and good looking they were). We checked in VIP registration room, staff is friendly, professional and fast.  Then she lead us to the elevator to our room 2789.  Parlor Suite is lavish, gorgeous, spacious and modern.  There is a 75inch TV in the living area and 65 inch in the bedroom.  The Italian marble bathroom have dual sinks,‚Ä¶",50
Although price abit expensive but the room n Service is totally worth it. Room is extraordinarily big n breakfast spread is great. Plus free shutter bus is available to nearly everywhere u might wan to go. Hope the anniversary promotion would run every year so that I can get great deal for suite room again.,50
"I've gone to the Wynn and Encore both in Vegas and Macau but the new Wynn Palace really took it to the next level. Excellent in every perspective! Dining, Casino, even the Starbucks was something different.",50
We thoroughly enjoyed our family stay at your beautiful hotel with excellent buffet breakfast at Fontana Buffet. The remote control and the bathroom tv media screen at Room 1524 was not functioning well.,50
It was really nice experience! Everything related to the hotel was very very good!!Me and my husband and my kids had really comfotable time.We planning to visit Macao again cause the Wynnpalace hotel.,50
The best hotel where I had visited! The room condition is truley new and clean. The view is not bad even it is not the fountain view. The service is also great. I will visit here again when I will come back to Macau.,50
"Last minutes biz trip of my boss to Macau, I booked Wynn Palace for him without hesitation.  I stayed with Wynn Palace in this Feb and literally EVERYTHING was excellent! It's the reason I chose Wynn Palace again for my boss. It was the first stay from him, but just as I expected he was blew away by this wonderful hotel.  Manager Bruno was helpful and professional as always, he took very good care of my boss during his stay. He is asset to your hotel. ",50

"It is my first time to stay in Wynn Palace, I have not expect that there is also such an amazing water fountain it really gave me the feelings of heaven, I really enjoyed my stay in Wynn Palace, the cable car facility is another impressive thing that you can see, though u need to stand on queue i believe you will surely enjoy the cable car ride from huge dragon. The Room was fully furnished and very well decorated, high speed wifi and a excellent view from the window.  The buffet is very delicious and the staffs there really knows how do good customer service and makes the customer happy. I would like to spend my Birthday with wife on coming Nov and stay more Nights. ",50
"I enjoyed my stay in Wynn palace, Stayed in Wynn fountain suite. The suite was nice and the style was very different which I liked. No coffee maker in the room just Starbucks via which I didn't like! the housekeeping was very good. The hotel swimming pool was closed which was a bummer. The fountain show was better than Bellagio las vegas and Dubai fountain!   Overall nice hotel and my kind of style hotel.",40
"I stayed with family for two nights in a Fountain Queen Suite which was spacious and comfortable.  The room was facing the lake and we enjoyed watching the fountain shows, especially during night time with beautiful lightings.  It had a large living room which could be separated from the bedroom by shuting the in-between door.  This ensured family members could choose watching television till late night without disturbing other's sleep.    The hotel was decorated in a deluxe style like a palace and entertainment facilities were provided.  We really treasured the moment we were staying there!",50
It was good for our anniversary trip. No swimming pool was unfortunate. Casual dining options are too few. No point in complimentary sky cabs as everyone seems to be using it free. Distant from other malls.,40
"Perfect 5 Star Wynn Resort. Good Value for the Money. The Room are big and Spacious. The Restaurant, the Staff, the Amenities are great. The Resort excited our high expection. It is the best Hotel to stay not just in Macau.",50
After visiting all hotels in Macau felt Wynn to be grand and overall experience was good.Good bakery and food is bonus.even have cable car to experience outside view of hotel and fountain ‚õ≤ .The decor is fantastic ,50
"our room was huge! its new, and its bigger than u need. great tub, nothing l don't like about it. our rooms didn't include breakfast but it was fine, we went to the pool and ordered some burgers. the pool was fantastic, its heated with a separate jacuzzi. (note, i went in april 2017, i was in macau in sept 2017 and took the cable car again, saw the the pool was closed. probably due to the big typhoon before) we got a late check out too which gave us more time to enjoy the hotel room. Will definitely stay here again. even if you aren't staying in Wynn palace, be sure to take the cable car (free when you take from ground level i think, not sure if its free all the way), take it while the fountain is having a show, great experience at no cost.   highly recommended, hope to stay‚Ä¶",50
"I would have to say this is the best hotel so far in macau. Got the anniversary promotion, and upgraded to the SPA suite.  It was HUGE and amazing, the deco is so pretty. Toilet comes with jacuzzi, and also comes with a spa room for massage.  The hotel is so beautiful, with pieces of art work tucked at different corners.  Stafff was so courteous and quick, especially the bell boy was so friendly. Since we are celebrating a birthday, if you let the hotel know in advance they will give you a free delicious chocolate birthday cake! Also there's a mini pantry with nespresso, teas and their tea ware is quite beautiful.  Gym was good , however the pool was closed. The tram was fun and the water shows were nice to watch. Lots of things to do around the hotel, the restaurant . Buffet‚Ä¶",50
The sky car ride over the dancing fountain was breathtaking! Make sure to go at night for the full effect. We went on three times due to no line up. The Fontana buffet is also impressive and with the fountain view. What a treat!!  ,50
overall everything is good! it really exceeds my expectations and it would be highly recommended to my friends and others.  staff are friendly and nice with excellent services. good location and parking as well!,40
"Amazing!!!! Everything!!! Just unique!!! Staff, Food, rooms!!! You name it, they make it possible!!! What a team under the GM Frederic!!! Congratulations !!! The food and the staff in the Wing Lei Palace is one of a kind!!! Never ever experienced this befor!!! View over the lake and the water show amazing ",50
Best hotel in Macau The best rooms The hotel is very clean and well maintained The staff is always happy to help and solve any problem Close to every place there is a shuttle to every hotel and everything is very orderly,50
Everything about this resort is over the top. The service during my stay was phenomenal at every turn. Even the housekeeping was remarkable at intuitively leaving items in my room that I needed but never asked for. Wing Lei Palace and Mizumi were both absolute stand out restaurants.,50
Incredible friendly staff. Top Food!!! Amazing hotel!!! One of the best place I every stayed . Restaurant and Food quality top!!! Never experienced such a warm welcome!!! They make every dream come true,50
"The upgraded rooms provided for the first anniversary offer offered the highest comfort, and amenities provided by the guest room provided the highest satisfaction level. Also, the implementation of the pre-requisite was the highest, and the anniversary cakes were also delicious.  However, the red carpet on the corridor of the hotel makes the hotel more spectacular, but it provided some inconvenience to the person carrying the carrier. Also, I checked in at the time I was busy, so I did not get the carrier service, so I wasted a lot of time searching for the room.",50
"I seldom choose local hotel to celebrate anniversary with my girlfriend, therefore I hope Wynn Palace won't disappoint me.   The hotel is so spacious, luxury and grand, the interior perfume is also very nice. When I arrived at the reception, your staff Tiffany greets me by warm and professional attitude. She even upgrade my room when she noticed I came for anniversary, and tried all her best to ensure my trip will be perfect. All the check in process was smooth and quick. She even proactively escorted us to the elevator and explained the nearby locations and restaurants.  The room was so big and nice, I thought It was Palor Suite? The anniversary amenity was so nice and my girlfriend loved it so much. We just wanted to stay at the room and not going anywhere.   It was really a‚Ä¶",50
"Stayed in a Parlor Suite room overlooking the fountains.   Let's stat off by saying this room is 145 square meters or 1560 square feet. Huge flat screen TV's, marble floors, walk-in closet, jet tub, Nespresso machine, separate massage room, remote control everything.   But what I really liked is the ""Pillow Collection"". You get a menu where you choose from 7 difference pillows. Soft, Medium, Hard, Memory Form, Hypoallergenic, ect.  You are guaranteed a good nights sleep on these pillows.   Plus there 3 separate air cooling systems for each room.   This was the best hotel room I have ever stayed in.   Had dinner at Mizumi. Best service I have ever had. And I have eaten at some very high end restaurant. So a special thanks to Willie. And the food was excellent.   Very much looking‚Ä¶",50
What a fantastic place stayed in a Fountain lake suite so big and beautiful felt like a queen.The staff are absolutely fantastic throughout the resort nothing's to much trouble.Fantastic food ever thing was so clean and shiny and the fountain show beautiful.This resort is truely 5 Star in every sense if I could I would give it Six. Cannot wait to return with my family in the future no other place compares Mr Wyn you truely have made an exquisite resort with staff the best I have encountered.,50
"It is the best casino in Macau in terms of decoration, it should be ranked number one out of the 38 casinos. The Fontana buffet is also nice, especially the decoration, though the food varieties are limited. ",40
"We were very pleasantly surprise when we arrived  that our room was upgraded to a parlour suite I think because we were celebrating a birthday!  The room was amazing! The Wynn Palace knows how to treat their loyal guest and that is why we keep coming back. Everything was outstanding, the staff on the casino floor, housekeeping, guest services/concierge, staff at Fontana Buffett and especially the Manager at Buns & Bubbles, everyone was friendly and attentive. Can't praise the WP enough.  Highly recommend a visit, and it won't be our last.",50
"Overall stay was pretty much good. Especially for the room cleaning service and break fast bread range. But I wanna give you guys 0 point for concierge service details. I couldnt get any informations during our stay in your hotel through concierge when we check in, I even had to ask for our breakfast restaurant to a bellboy. We always had to ask when we wanna know something even for very basic things. They have to have service mind and have to be gentle and nice.",40
"From the first step into entry to staff reception to the room, accompanied by your luggaage attendant, everything was flawless! The personal tour through the rooms by him was inspiring. Made us feel special, please thank him.",50
"This was a trip of old friends reuniting and what a spectacular venue in which to do it. We stayed in the suites overlooking the lake and cable cars at the front of the hotel with excellent views surrounding us. The suites were very comfortable with lots of room including lounge area, dressing area and fully equipped bathroom. The heated toilet seats and a separate massage room were a first for me. We dined in the SW restaurant with exquisite cusine and impeccable service. There were innovative and entertaining shows during the course of the evening, each lasted about 5 to 10  minutes, all very clever and stylish in their own right. The gaming area and surrounding private rooms were all finished to a very high standard making the overall experience one to be repeated.‚Ä¶",50
"This was my first solo trip since a while and Wynn Palace made me feel at ease. I flew from Montreal to Beijing, then Beijing to Hong Kong and then a boat from Hong Kong to Macau. I actually missed my flight to Hong Kong from Beijing the night before, so I arrived in Macau a bit later. I admitted that I was exhausted from the flights. When I arrived from the ferry, it was pretty easy to get to the shuttle bus to Wynn Palace. Then, I was well welcome by the staffs over there. Check in was really fast and got my room in a flash. The room was super nice and really clean. As a solo traveler, the room was super huge. The room was also well decorated and make you feel like a guest. Other than that, you got everything in the hotel: restaurants, shops, entertainment and shuttle bus. I‚Ä¶",50
"Cafe Fortana serves wonderful afternoon tea set. The ambience is as welcoming as usual. Bright colours stimulate our appetite. The tea set has a good range of savours and sweets, with scones and two drinks. We enjoy every bite while watching the fountain show. ",40
"I totally agreed that Wynn Palace is better class than the other hotels nearby like Venetian, Grant Hyatt, MGM, and Parisian. The hotel is clean, very quite, not too crowed, well maintained, and the staff are absolutely genuine and attentive. We spent 3 nights in the king suite that facing the Macau airport and it gave us exceptional experience. The only downside is the hotel is kind of away from the old Cotai town and other hotels, but they do have free shuttle bus to take you around. The swimming pool was under maintenance during our stay. We definitively will come back again.",50
"Check in: was very quickly. Usually, at the hotel, check in time after 3 pm.  Our room: this is a magical place, a comfortable bed, beautiful bed linens, a luxurious bathroom, a cozy living room and an excellent mini bar with a full set of dishes. Breakfast: very nice view of the singing fountains, great selection of delicious food. Casino: high safety, new equipment very good design. The shops: oooo, this is a delight. Location: there are shuttle buses and taxis, very comfortably. –¢ry –æut th–µ c–∞ble c–∞r –∞nd singing f–æuntains during nighttim–µ, see how many fresh flowers and how beautiful the design of the installations.

This hotel can be the best hotel you can ever get in Macau! Staff were genuine and attentive! The food at Fontana will wow you and the friendliness of the staff will ensure your dining experience is elevated. The concierge was all ready to assist you without any hesitation!,50
Impressive property and courteous staff! Pleasant experience! Spacious rooms and lovely fountains! Unfortunately weather did not allow operation of swimming pool. Floral decorations were unique. Room automation fantastic!,50
the resort it was very nice. room clean and big...design and finishing very accurate. service ok. not bad not wow! ...just standard!!! the line in the morning to be seated for breakfast took me over 20' and the swimming pool it was close because under maintenance: that's very disappointing because it was a reason of my choice while booking and nobody informed about the disservice!!!,30
Very good Excellent But it's a little uncomfortable. We paid $1000 for the deposit We consumed $ 440 by eating two meals a day So how do we handle the rest of the 660dollars?? I stayed at the hotel on Sep. 13 Name is Sohn.Jinha,50
"I am reliably told that this is a better class than the nearby Venetian and Parisian, but since this is the first time I stayed overnight in Macau, I can't vouch for that. The room rates on the booking sites do show a premium of about 30 to 50%. However, I can say that I enjoyed a flutter on the automated roulette to background music by the Eagles, Michael Buble to Sinatra. The hotel lobbies feature hot air balloons made with colourful flowers and also boast a fountain that changes patterns and a short cable car which is free.",40
We stayed in the fountain view king suite and it had the most magnificent view of the fountain which is best viewed at night. The room itself was opulent with a separate lounge area with a HUGE tv (the channels catered to their Chinese guests more with western channels being quite minimal) and sliding doors to the bedroom. The most impressive thing about the room was that it had a tv embedded into the bathroom mirror!! Everything was spotless and had a grand luxury feel to it. Amenities were plentiful and gold coloured shavers!!It really shows that they thought about every aspect to make sure their guest felt this is a very special hotel.  Make sure however not to play with the minibar drinks and snacks in the drawer as there is some sort of sensor and once you lift it up they‚Ä¶,50
"Me and my husband just visited Wynn Palace. Shame it was just for a day. I am gutted. Hotel is just amazing and magical. It is very clean, comfortable and very modern and classy in the same time. The fresh flower display everywhere. The mirrors and artwork. The dancing fountain were just stunning. We did have cocktails hotel bar where we met Miranda who was so warm and pleasant. The cocktails we had were delicious. I need to go back and for longer period to enjoy it to the fullest.",50
"Wow, Mr Wynn really does it right! We just stayed at the Wynn palace in Macau for 3 nights and what a treat it was! We stayed in a fountain salon suite and it was gorgeous!   The room was amazing, the shopping was top notch, the restaurants were impeccable (especially SW Steakhouse)   Gaming was fantastic with lots of variety! We are from the USA and go to Las Vegas a bunch, after this trip, I would say Macau Wynn Palace will be my destination from here on out when I want to have pure Luxury and opulence that only Steve Wynn can make happen  Wynn palace is in the new part of Macau gambling and is within walking distance of other good properties. I would recommend Wynn Palace to anyone wanting to go to Macau!   Top notch Mr Wynn! ",50

"We went to the Macao Wynn Hotel for a birthday celebration, and it was really perfect, and the Palo Sweet Room, which we upgraded for free, was like a paladin. The breakfast was really luxurious and tasty, and the dinner at Wing Lei restaurant made an unforgettable impression - the staff were very friendly and provided the best service. I want to go to hotel.",50

"I never write anything about the travel experience, but this time I hv to write something about my stay. I booked Wynn Palace to celebrate my aunt's birthday even 1 day after, I really appreciated the DM Bruno for the arrangement of this stay, the room is being upgraded to suite with a really nice view, the receptionist, Alicia, is very nice and warm welcoming us, she noticed my aunt's birthday was yesterday, but still said ""Happy Birthday to her!"" when check in, and also the Birthday cake is very yummy which is chocolate muse flavor; although the swimming pool is still closed which is a bit disappointed, the overall stay is very satisfy, will recommend to my friends and family to staying this hotel!!!  Thank you to DM Bruno and the receptionist Alicia üëçüëçüëç",50
"If you visit to Macau, you should stay in Wynn palace at least one night! All staffs in Wynn palace were so kind! Room was so clean! And you can see the most beautiful fountain show in the world in Wynn palace!!",50
"Very relaxing in the room and good food in the restaurant. Unfortunately, the poor was under repaired because of typhoon. Most amazing thing is the flower in the hotel. Every flower in hotel is real and looks pretty. The way they decorate in lobby, hall way and every floor is absolutely gorgeous.",40
"Overall, room is spacious and bright.   Staff are polite and efficient.  Buffet breakfast is very good with various types of bread etc.   Sitting in the SkyCabs to view the Performance Lake at night is a magnificient program.",50
It is a great stay although the swimming pool is not open and the fountain lake is not fully operated during day times.  You should ask for a higher level room if possible since some amenities are not provided on lower level,40
"Overall, one of the best! Just need a bidet in the comfort room. More restaurants please in the hotel. Buffet food was drooling due to numerous choices. Ambiance was excellent! :) :) ;) ;) Will definitely be back!",50
A plentiful of floral scent and sculptures welcomed us and super awesome room upgraded made us happy.  Fantastic lake performance and riding skycab were big fun.  Fontana breakfast was extremely good stuff. Thanks for everything.  I am strongly recommending Wynn Palace to Korean travelers.,50
Wynn Palace is Fairy Tale. Beyond imagined.Macau is a place to see whether one likes casinos  or not.Hospitality and scenery both go together. Especially celebrating the Chinese New Year at the Wynn Palaca is an unforgettable experience.,50
"Good view and scenery from the hotel room. Very spacial and clean room we had. Amazing decoration of flowers everywhere! Although we have missed out on a lot of activities such as the cable car, and the swimming pool due to the bad weather condition. Hope we can have a more complete experience next time!",40

We had a wonderful time at Wynn Palace. The staff is very professional and nice. We had noise issue with our room and we were upgraded to a larger room. The room was very comfortable and clean. The hotel was easy to get to and convenient because it had lots of shuttle taking you to different places.,50
"I was very satisfied with the Wynn Palace Hotel in honor of my mother-in-law's birthday.  The staff at the spa were all friendly. Especially, the female employee who was in charge of the spa reception was very kind. She kindly explained the use of spas and spa facilities, and she told me details that I could not understand. Spa facilities and massages were very good. The staff at the reception at the hotel were also very friendly.  The hotel facilities were also better than any hotel I have ever stayed at in Macau.  There is something unpleasant. The restaurants in Win Palace were good, but the prices were all expensive. I had a baby so I could not go to a restaurant in the casino. So I could not use the cheap restaurant in the casino.  I had to use the cheap restaurants of‚Ä¶",50
"My sister and I saw a review of Wynn Palace on TV and when we travelled to Macau we decided to stay overnight there. The hotel provides a shuttle from Macau ferry terminal and we were dropped off in front of the receptionist. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. We took the fountain suite so we can watch the hourly fountain light show. There's a cable car line going around the hotel which is complimentary for the hotel guests. The overall architecture is very neo-classical and there's a huge casino as well as luxury shops.  The room was 69 sq.m with king-sized bed, a huge bathroom with electric mirror and bathtub as well as a study/viewing room with remote-controlled curtains over an entire section of window that overlooks the fountain pond. Vanity items are abundant‚Ä¶",50
"Everything is very good, especially to cater the need of  wheel-chair guests.  (We have visited another luxury hotel with Michelin 3 stars restaurants, but they are not helpful for wheel-chair guests) The hotel check-in staff is very nice and helpful. Before we come to Macau, the response of the Internet enquiry is very fast. Just few hours. Also, the cable car is very nice.Room guest can take the cable car free of charge. However, shuttle bus schedule and the hotel map isn't available in their web-site. You can see my attached photos for details.",50
"Room was perfectly appointed, luxurious, clean and spacious. Buffet was delicious, endless, well varied and had a perfect backdrop of the dancing water fountains. Staff were very helpful, efficient, friendly and knowledgeable of Macau and the resort itself. The skycab, lobby and public areas were all beautifully decorated. Complimentary shuttles to and from the port, old Taipa, other resorts were very prompt and quite convenient. Complimentary wifi everywhere even on the shuttles was an amazing amenity. I even won at the casino, so what more could I ask for. Next time we definitely have to stay more than 1 night to fully experience this palace!",50
"I chose this hotel because Wynn is known for its extensive use of flowers and my mother who traveled with me loves flowers. The staff are friendly and helpful although outside the reception area, few of the Chinese staff could speak English. We always looked for the Filipino staff to help us because their English is good. The rooms and the bathrooms are as grand as expected. One of the highlights was being able to fit my mother who was on a wheelchair inside one of the gondolas that glide around the fountain. She would not have been able to step on a moving gondola on her own. The restaurant breakfast buffet selection is extensive. I only wish that the hotel has a restaurant that serves simpler, non-Chinese food. One that serves fresh vegetables and salad and grilled fish.",50
"Had very high expectations since last visit when it just opened to hopefully iron out the small kinks. Took the kids this time to experience the luxury of the Wynn. What a mistake! The host tells me, that there is no gurantee, but good chance of an early check in at 12 noon. So we book a nice lunch at the Fortuna buffet, great value , great location in front of the fountains. Service is good but choice is slightly limited, Belon in the Banyan Tree it is not, but at half the pricve good value. Try to get the early check in, front desk says 3pm, so iw whinge a bit and they take my cell phone and tell me that they will see what they can do. No calls, countless trips on the sky cab (its free for guests), but you need to show your key card and get a ticket, which is bit painful.‚Ä¶",20
"We spent an entire day here - wish we had stayed here too! The casino is lively and luxurious - unlike the stuffy St. Regis. The different lobbies had art installations that were larger than life and out of a fairytale. We had dinner at a restaurant located right next to the casino - quite frankly the best in terms of taste, portions and price! The shopping was all aimed at high end luxury but still we would rather spend a day here than at the Venetian. The fountains though not on the scale of the Bellagio or the Dubai Mall, were lovely to watch. ",50
"Excellent lux hotel in Macau. Over expectation and the service was great. The room was incredible, huge and with all accessories you possibly could ask for. The pool was great both for adults and children. Our family had a great stay here.",50

"I do not speak English.  When communication became uncomfortable, the employees were in a bad mood.  I would not recommend this hotel for those who can not speak English and Chinese.  When we could not communicate, the staff kept us waiting and was doing sns.  The room condition was better than the Galaxy Hotel, but the service was a mess  I wanted to extend the day but I was denied that the room reservation was full.  But I was able to extend the room for free at the casino, but I was in a bad mood",30
"Checkin was quick and easy. No big line up like other hotels. Front desk lady attitude was super nice. She even upgraded our room to the Suite.  The room was quite big, clean and comfortable. I like the TV size and iPad remote control beside the bed. Room light & curtain control were awesome. Bathroom was so spacious and comfortable even has TV for bathtub. Overall, Wynn Palace is a great hotel to stay. I will come again for my next visit!",50
"Found myself in Macau again and on advise was told to visit the Wynn Palace. The advise was spot on,this is the most beautiful, opulent hotel I have seen in a while. The staff are very attentive, polite and accommodating,even if English is mot widely spoken there,the staff do their best to understand you and nothing is too much trouble,they even supply a chair to put your bags on  It's not cheap,but it's worth a look around. Westioners are a few and far between,so you stand out especially tall blonde ones like me,but the novelty factor is appealing.  Wait until the sun goes down to enjoy the water and light show from the cable cars taking you into the hotel.

Still, I have to ride the shuttle because it is hot It's hot at 9 a.m. or 3 p.m Let's hang out at the hotel and at the casino. Still, it was a pleasant trip",40

The hotel, room and everything were extremely beautiful, grand and of outstanding quality. Housekeeping was perfect and every single aspect was extremely neat and clean. The toiletries were of top quality brand. Even the toilet tissue papers cannot be found elsewhere which are so soft and comfortable. You can tell that the hotel was so caring to the hotel guests and the room offered 8 types of pillow for guests to choose. This is absolutely amazing!

Excellent service. The buffet is so extraordinary and worth more than one Michelin star. It is an exclusive buffet and the big panorama windows showing the water fountains dancing in different shows to the music in the restaurant is making this one of my best dining experience ever. Thank you for an excellent evening.  Afterwords we went to the Wynn casino and was complimented free beers when playing at the roulette. Although the service was not that good and we had to wait 30 minutes before getting our drinks it was still a very good experience compared to rest of Macaus casinos.  We will return. :-) ,50

Been to some nice hotels in Vegas but none compare.  From the glassware and attention to detail in everything, you wont be disappointing. Never wanted to leave",50
"In Feb we visited Macau, and this trip was for my daughter's birthday.   The Wynn palace was brand new when I went there, so everything must be so new and nice. The check in was easy and we didn't need to wait. Our room was a fountain view room, over looking the music fountain which provided fantastic shows. The cable cars around the fountain were the highlight of the stay. We took so many rounds of ride, kids just loved it.   The room we had was very big, it was actually a suite. A separated living room which has floor to ceiling windows. The bedroom had two large queen size beds. Huge bathroom with very good quality amenities.

Every corner of the hotel is picturesque (except the casino area, no pictures of course). They also house a wie selection of luxury brands. You dont need to go out to look for affordable food as there are outlets with good food with the right prices.

The wynn palace is his best resort so far. When I return to Macau I won't stay anywhere else. Room is outstanding and definitely 5 star.   Shuttle (free) will take you from the airport or either ferry terminal from Hong Kong. Just a 3 minute ride from the airport to the palace. But we never heard a single aircraft.   Kudos to the wynn people for converting me. ,50
It is the Wynn Palace Hotel that gave the most satisfaction to our family in Macau trip with my family. Staff friendly and clean. And there is a relaxing pool and shuttle bus. Everything was perfect and impressive. Next time I go to Macau I will stay at the Wynn Palace Hotel.,50
"One of the best Steak house in Macau ,you and enjoy prime grade dry aged Steak ,fine wine and best entertainment,good experience at SW Wynn Steak house ,you wouldn't disappointed to having fine foods here ,enjoy it ,cheers ",50
"We were doing a lot of research to find the best buffet in Macao and for sure we have found it! If you are looking for an unforgettable dining experience the ""Cafe Fontana"" it is. The setting is enchanting, the choice and quality of food is outstanding and the view over the fountain is entertaining. The staff members are delivering a high quality and friendly service. Also we would like to make a comment that we were dining with our Anaphylactic children (towards nuts) at the buffet. A special thank you we would like to give to the kind Lady at the Front Desk who upon our arrival checked with the head chef which dishes were nut free and safe to eat. She went out of her way to assist us in any possible way. Thank you to the Fontana Team for an excellent night!",50
"Stayed in Fountain Suite for 2 nights. The room was modern, nicely decorated and very clean. Totally 3 TVs, 2 Bluetooth speakers in room.  The room was very spacious even with a camp bed.  The pool is in reasonable size. The staff there is very attentive . The food in pool side restaurant is good. The fountain show was marvellous especially at night time. Unfortunately, there was no show in the second day due to strong wind. There are several restaurants in premises but the price are in high side. There is no convenience shop nearby. Grand Hyatt is just in the opposite side of the cable car station in where the famous show House of Dancing Water held. There is also a convenience shop inside their shopping centre. ",50
"Even though I did not stay overnight at the Wynn Palace, my family and I spent most of the day around the area. The sky car rides that are available to ride are very fun and gives a wonderful view of the hotel and parts of Macau. For these cars that they have, if you get on from the ground floor of the hotel, it is free to ride up to the hotel but if you ride completely around the ring (from the top to the bottom and the bottom to the top) is about 100 Macau dollars. The water show that the hotel has in the front is also very beautiful and something that should be seen.  I'd like to visit again soon so I can stay at the hotel.",40
Best property with ultra modern facilities and great staff. Very beautiful and really comfortable for couples and family. Better than most if price and value is compared as a package.. Great amininities in the room and very luxurious.,50
"great room, nice and helpful staffs, amazing cable car trip to see the water show from the top! smoking room for cigar lovers, good Cantonese restaurant. everything is perfect in this hotel. worth to stay.",50
"We have had a wonderful stay in Wynn Tower Suites Las Vegas many years ago, so our expectations for Wynn Palace Macay were high to start with, but the hotel managed to exceed those expectations by a mile.   We had booked a Parlor Suite Ocean View, but were offered an upgrade to a Parlor Spa Suite Lake View upon arrival. Words cannot describe how amazing the suite was, so we just have to refer to the photos. We have stayed in a number of fancy suites in luxury hotels, but this must have been the most lavish and luxurious suite that we have ever stayed in. The suite was furnished with beige and cold colours, and the bathroom was all marble. The view was as amazing as the room was, especially when it was dark and the lights in the buildings were lit. We were also able to watch the‚Ä¶",50
"It was a perfect and unforgettable stay at Wynn Palace. Next time I visit Macau, I would definitely stay again here. The room, the restaurants, the swimming pool and the entertainment like performance lake and skycab were so awesome!!",50
"It's one of the best hotels I 've been in. I was on the other hotel in Macau (the biggest one with 3000 rooms) on the previous night, so can't help my self in comparing these two.  I booked the hotel from Ctrip, and unfortunately the promo from Ctrip made it impossible to have a special request to the hotel. But the hotel reception make up for it by upgrading our room and a lovely truffle box as a late night chocolate gift. Superb!!  The pros: - Easy comfortable shuttle from anywhere in the island (airport, ferry, or other hotels) - No long queue! Lovely reception, attentive service, very fast check in process, and informative . Comparing to that other very big hotel in Macau, it's like comparing heaven and earth. - Bell boy taking us and the luggage to our room, with also lots‚Ä¶",50
"Service is excellent, hotel is squeaky clean, attention to details are amazing (Rooms amenities, plenty of water around the facilities). Great hotel, best we've every stayed in. Thank you for the memorable stay, keep up the good work, and high standard!",50
"We loved our stay at this fabulous hotel! The staff were the real highlight though - the service in all areas were phenomenal. Better than anywhere we have ever travelled. English was very well spoken and much appreciated by us as we do not speak Chinese. Our room was spacious and well priced. I love how our hotel was a better size than the other overly large hotels around the area.   The only downfall is the price of restaurants. We ate here twice but was very expensive. However, you got what you paid for and that was amazing",40
it was a great experience of staying here in a palace.  very great service and friendly of the staffs there. thank you for my birthday trip suprise by Wynn Palace.  i wish to get more suprise on nex visit. haha. tq very much and great job to all the wynn staff. keep it up!üëç,50
Good quality services and the room was free upgraded. It is located in good location and has a really good view. The rest in casinos is just so so and the service isn't good as I except. The overall experience is quite OK.,40
"I would like to express my gratitude to the F.O & Concierge team (especially the help from Tom Wang, Cyrus Wu, Jovita Li & Faye)! My family enjoyed so much and you guys truly ""wow"" us! The best place to celebrate my parent's wedding anniversary! Thanks for the awesome room decoration, we appreciated so much for the efforts. What a perfect stay at your place!",50
The room I got was a regular room but they offered me a suite room for just a minimal cost. The room was quite impressive its big clean and spacious. I will be back at this hotel for the very nice accomodating staffs and the buffet was very good with so many choices.,50
"I was busy and was not able to celebrate my wife‚Äôs birthday early this year. Noticed a few months ago that the Wynn Palace was offering a special on rooms, I decided to book the Parlor Suite to surprise her. We arrived at around noon on Sunday and went to the separate VIP Registration area for check-in. Thinking that we probably had to leave our bags to go for lunch and return later, our room was actually ready (maybe because it was a Suite). Before I book, I have already seen some photos of the Suite from a friend and the website, but I was still amazed when I stepped in the room. In fact, even the hallways that led to the room from the lift lobby were beautifully decorated.  Back to Room 2508. Size was roughly 1,500 sq feet, and the room was big enough to play catch inside.‚Ä¶",50
"Spent a whole day in Wynn palace, we just enjoyed the fountain view from our room and the swimming pool there! the water is clear and we hope we can stay for longer! We also enjoyed the unlimited cable car service special for the hotel guests, moreover, we had the dinner buffet in the hotel and the food was nice and tasty. We also received a chocolate box from the hotel. I believed that my friend had an unforgettable birthday journey there and we will be back for sure! Thanks a lot for the team!",50
"Front desk services are very friendly, rapid and nice services. The room has very nice night view and gorgeous performance pool. Convenient transport to tourism places. Hotel servicer helped us to booked restaurant and gave map with very clear directions to reach the place.",50
"This was the 2nd time i stay in Wynn Palace.  Among of the others hotels, i appreciate of their good services n cleanliness no matter in rooms, shopping arcade n restaurants as well.  Their courtesy manners are very good.  Aside showing concern to guests, and kids as well with welcome gifts",50
The view of the fountain show from the SkyCab was so Amazing !! Room is very large and good sense of decoration.I love it ! The atmosphere of the hotel is very luxurious. I certainly would like to stay again !,50
"Everyone was so nice! The decor was luxurious and over-the-top. I loved it! Oh, and the Phoenix! We would recommend the Wynn to anyone staying in Macau. The spa is a must along with the ramen noodle place. So tasty!",50
"Both servicd and facilities were very good. But I sent a glass after room service,  it was empty without adding the next day. So I spent one day in a glass.  I tried to request it and just washed it....",40
I wish there would be more entertainments for kids. And more shops and restaurants options.the swimming pool is not good enough and the cable car is to short.the concept is very nice n clean.thank you,50
"Everything was fine, but ...   I felt a little sorry for my poor breakfast. breakfast. was no steak & ice cream. But the fruit juice tasted good.  Bread tasted good, but I couldn't eat it beacuse morning.  and I didn't catch the sky cap.  See you next time.",30
"The guest room is very beautiful and unique. Good service especially bell service staff. Very kind and helpful, attentive to guest's need in details. High tech room and very user friendly. Nice room view.",50
Fantastic decoration Fantastic Service Fantastic People Fantastic facility for children!  It's  better to have more shuttle bus for customers as the location of the hotel is related far from the central area!,50
"I stayed with my mom and baby. They prepared a lot of baby's stuff and gave us a cake for celebrating my baby's anniversary so i was very impressed. And they let us use swimming pool after checking out so we could enjoyed the pool more. Very considering staff, and clean room condition. I hope to stay again.",50
"If you like gold and grand colours.  This hotel is for you.    There is gold decor everywhere - even the disposal toothbrush, comb and razor are in gold colour.  The room was a great size and super comfortable mattress - however the room is very orange.    Check in and check out very quick.    The lunch buffet at Cafe Fontana was excellent at less than MOP300.  Great variety of starters, mains and desserts.  Including 8 different ice cream.  Unlimited fruit juice and coffee / tea.  The only dessert to avoid is Serradura - the cookie crumbs not smooth enough for my liking.   The casino is right in the center and 99 Noodles pretty good.   ",40
"Of the other luxury hotels I've stayed in, the best feature of this one is the room itself.  The bathroom is beautiful, the bed is comfortable and the room is very spacious. In addition, the entertainment selection on the television has movies you can buy, which was not an option at the Four Seasons or the J.W. Marriott.  Unfortunately I was injured before my stay here so I couldn't do much exploring.  That being said, when you're at the Wynn you're kind of on your own little island with not as much connected to the hotel.  Also, they were unable to give me a smoking room which I would have preferred.",50
"My wife and I celebrate our anniversary during our trip. All the staffs are kind and helpful. The room was much bigger than I thought. Even I can dance with my wife inside the room with the music and the fountain view. The housekeeping had quick response to our request and inquiry. The food quality of SW Steakhouse was excellent. Although the swimming pool is not as funny as other swimming pool in cotai, but it's still great as I only want to have leisure moment with my wife.",50
Everything is worthy.    The facilities of the suit are the best in Macao.   I think this is the best hotel now in this area.   Espeically the food and service in the Wing Lei Palace are the best we ever had in the hotel.  We actually had our dinner everyday there.,50
The best Hotel in Macau. I travel a lot around the world. I have been nearly in all Hotels in Macau and this was the best hotel with the best experience. I had the strongest and nicest sleep in this amazing Hotel. I would recommend to everybody who likes good service and want to enjoy their stay in a excellent Hotel.,50
"I have just no words to describe this place. From arrival to stay to check out. Everything, EVERYTHING is just flawless and perfect. The room is spotlessly clean, the service is awesome the staff is super friendly and the food there is absolutely delicious. If you are planning on a trip to Macau. Stay at Wynn Palace. Trust me, you wont regret staying there.",50
"So I returned after about 9 months and I guess most of my original sentiments weren't changed.  The rooms are luxurious. I had the opportunity to stay in a Fountain Parlor Suite this time.  Massive room with a massage room inside. The dining table was cute but seemed undersized for the room.  The work desk was also located inside the bedroom which seems odd given the big empty spaces in the living area.  The complimentary bottles water was all Wynn branded. Upon closer inspection it was bottled by Bonaqua.  This is better than being unbranded, but when you compare to other top shelf hotel suites, it seems lacking.  Four Season uses Vittel and St Regis uses Evian in their suites.    The shower amenities also seemed cheap with the large font on the bottles. Again, they would be‚Ä¶",40
"Actually, as this journey was scheduled for my family including mother of law and my wife I was prepared to serve them as their servants. But I didn't need to do it all along the stay in Wynn Palace because we have rceived royalty service from the moment when we took a first step into Wynn Palace. The money I lost at the casino was worth a pound of salt. ^^",50
"The room is very clean.The employees are very kind.Compared to the level of awareness, the taste of food decreases slightly.Skycab was sometimes sad to stop running.It was impressive to see the employees carefully take care of themselves.",40
"Accessibility with other hotels is inconvenient, but I think it is the best hotel in the Cotai area. We stayed at the St. Regis Hotel, but the Wynn Palace hotel seems more suitable for family trips. However, there is no convenience store, and there are not enough restaurants to go with the baby.",40
"hotel is very nice, but spa can't use, so disappointed. food is so good, and room is very clean, service so good, next time i will choose Wynn place again, is very good experience, shuttle bus is very convenience  .",40
"We stayed there 3 nights this week and found the hotel absolutely top notch ~ from sparkling clean big rooms to high level of service and personalization. Everything in the hotel is stunning, beautiful and classy and flowers every where give it brilliant colours ~ it's a celebration ! The one thing I wished for was some Indian food options in the menues of the hotel. ",50
"Wynn Palace Macau is a very new hotel on the Cotai Strip. We stayed one night and enjoyed the cable car round the   lake of the dancing fountain.The ride was awesome. The hotel room is very spacious and clean and really cosy. We enjoyed the buffet breakfast, with its wide spread of desserts and pastries.  We sat near the window where we had a nice view of the lake.  All in all a pleasant and comfortable stay at Wynn Palace.",50
"Kind of nice service, fantastic facility, everything was perfect hotel. It was also comfortable to travel to the tourist resort using a shuttle bus.Above all, the beauty of the fountain show at night is still forgotten.",50
"The room is nice, though the column in between the glass window in the living room is blocking the view. Other than that, we have a good experience in wynn palace. Also, the staff who brought us the birthday cake was very polite too.",40
"Thank you for your attentive hotel consideration. Considering my elderly mother, the room adjacent to the elevator hall, the connecting room for the convenience of the family, the anniversary gift ... My family was fully satisfied.",50
Very different American interiors. The music and the ambience takes you to the Golden-Age of Hollywood. I can easily say this has been the best experience so far. From the fountains dancing to the tune of Frank Sinatra to the very warm staff; everything was golden.,50
"Casino is elegant, perfect gaming experience for high roller. Room is spacious and service is perfect. In house dining quality is superb but price should be cheaper for hotel and casino guests. Location is far from cotai central. Walking is not an option for most guests that can afford to stay here.",50
Once u enter the hotel u will smell very nice floral smell as the hotel uses fresh flowers for decorations. I booked palace king room however gave me free upgrade room fountain view bigger room. I especially requested for green blue room.  Once I come back from dinner I saw Birthday card and gift on the table. It was totally touching!!,50
"Nice hotel setting, relax and leisure atmosphere , free cable car journey that kids will Sure love it. Easy to transit by hotel shuttle bus. Super fabulous restaurant, mouth watering breakfast buffet. Excellent experience.",50
"The food, environment and the people working in Wynn group gave me an unforgettable impressions in my life. I had booked a Buffet Dinner in Cafe Fortuna in Wynn Palace but I made a mistake  and go to the Wynn hotel in Macau. The gentleman in the Cafe Es....(Sorry I forget the name)helped me to call the Cafe Fortuna and asked them to keep the table for me. May be I was so happy that night so I made another mistake. I overpaid my bill that night and only discovered several days later. I sent a request to refund and they responded my request at once. It showed us that Wynn group is a  most successful business in the world. ",50
"Same as its Name ... PALACE!! Expect everything Grand n Spacious .. Hardware, really Great!! Software ... Can be better. 2 things we really Appreciate most were Unlimited rides of cable car n 2 Huge TV inside room. Other than that .. Everything was just fine",30
Superb property. Room was extremely luxurious. All amenities were great. Casino floor was huge. Shopping all high end. Need mid level shopping for families. Breakfast buffet was excellent with numerous pastries and fruit. Service was excellent. SW Steakhouse was one of the best restaurants in the world. Gondola ride was neat feature. Highly recommended. I will return in future. ,50
"Wynn palace is one of the best hotels I have stayed in Macau  The Palace King room we stayed was amazing.  Everything inside is so  clean and spacious The buffet breakfast was  really nice, a very wide spread especially the desserts counter. I enjoyed the cable car ride very much with the dancing fountain below us , it was awesome.",50
Hotel room and services are very excellent and family-friendly too. We enjoyed out time in Wynn Palace and my son had a wonderful time in the pool too. We have a very pleasant stand in Wynn Palace and will sure to be back. We definitely will recommend Wynn Palace to all our friends too.,50
"We had a really fantastic time at the Wynn Palace, Macau. The rooms was palatial and the service provided was immaculate. Everything was just perfect and would definitely book this place again if we were to visit Macau again. Thank you all at Wynn Palace  Macau.",50
"The interior design and the service of the hotel is very good,just the location for the outgoing is not very convenient referring to the shuttle bus routes ,Anyway, thanks for the arrangement, it's a great time for us!",50
Beautiful Place and Extremely Fancy. Can keep Walking around for hours and offers the most beautiful and colourful Fountain show. Helpful Staff and Even Walk in visitors can get many conveniences like wheel chair etc. The Decorations are very beautiful at both entrances,40
"Excellent and fantastic. However we were unable to have our lunch at the wing lei palace as it was full. there were some empty tables inside but the staff said they were reserved. Quite unfortunate but the rest were good, such as the music performance and cable car",50
"Cant ask for a better hotel! Room was huge and fancy, love it! It was clean and they had gold combs and gold water taps (i'm a sucker for gold things) and everything looks classy.  Hotel staff were nice. There's shuttle buses to shuttle you to the centre, to the ferry point, and even to the town. You get a complimentary cable car ride too and you get to check out the beauitful water fountain.  I like that it's further away from the other hotels. Not too clustered, and not too commercial like your Venetian etc. Best choice of hotel for Macau.",50
"Wynn palace is the best! I think all of theirs is the best. Especially breakfast is the best of best to me. My wife was pleased,too. If I go to Macau with my family or along again,I will experience all of Wynn palace again.",50
"We liked our stay at Wynn palace, it Was almost perfect. Unfortunately, your service about the shuttle bus, the last time is too soon. I will recommend this hotel to my friend and for dure will come again on the future",40
The room is nice and great. Kudos to Victor Zhang from Front Desk who upgrade the room for us after he knew that we are here for honeymoon. He is super friendly and nice by offering us a late checkout. Although it was sad that there is typhoon signal 3 hoisted during the stay which cause most of the facilities especially cable car not available but still would not affect our overall stay.,50
Spacious rooms with great attention to details. Everything was clean and immaculate. Ammenities are excellent. Gaming floor is nicely laid out. Not much activities in the poker section when we were there though,40
"there was someone tried to enter the room in the early morning, luckily i locked the door when i slept, he/she could not enter the room, in room dining service is good, but the dry fried beef river taste was bad",30
The room is perfect and have a nice lake view with music fountain.  Unfortunately the cable has been stopped for maintenance which was a bit disappointed.  There are many luxury store in the hotel but not many choices for food.  Also there are no playgrounds for children.,40
"It was really good time. And your kindness and service made me very happy. The one thing,,, Um.. I just want to see the lake in my bed not on the chair.  Every other was very good. I want to use wynn palace again.",50
"I can say the hotel itself is pretty luxurious but lacks service recovery.   However, my boyfriend booked us a night stay for our anniversay by phone and he informed to have the room with the fountain view and also told that we were there for anniversary and later also received an email confirmation by the reservation Josephine Chiu (photo attached) and to his surprise- when he checkin, He was given the smallest room and no view at all and they never gave any amenities for our anniversary.   So when we got the room, we were not happy and called the guest service and carol assisted us to room move to a better view room and slightly bigger and we ask for a late check out they they said latest is 13:00 and we ask if we can have a little later - she said really the latest she can‚Ä¶",20
"We are massive fans of the Wynn and Encore in Las Vegas so we decided to go to Macau just to stay in the $4.2bn Wynn Palace. As expected, this place is amazing. Steve Wynn's attention to detail and no expense spared finish throughout this hotel are just of the scale. We upgraded to a Palace Fountain Suite and it was by far the largest and most impressive hotel room we've stayed in. This is a place we will visit again. AMAZING!",50
"Should be told exactly where and when.However I lov the shops opening until 12am. The decoration is very nice. This is an excellent experience.The drink of the Casio was not quite good, and delivered so slow!",40
"Wynn palace is about as luxury as you can get. Stunning decor, huge art installations, friendly helpful staff and plenty of amenities.  I stayed in what they call an exclusive suite. Not sure how exclusive it is as there seemed to be plenty! It was massive, a big lounge area, bedroom, dressing room, bathroom. Draped in white and gold with huge floor to selling windows in each room added to the opulence. Bed was really comfy and the provided luxury amenities were in abundance. Complimentary water wasn't in short supply either which was nice. Chocolates with turn down service was a welcome luxury. The iPad controlled lights, do not disturb and housekeeping were another welcome addition that actually worked.   I used the concierge service multiple times during my stay. Sammy I‚Ä¶",50
"I just spent a wonderful night in Wynn Palace. The hotel is new, well-decorated and with high-tech inroom equipment. I met Victor upon arrival and I was blew away by his genuine care. As he learnt we were celebrating birthday for our friends, he arranged a super nice room with pool view. Noticed I was carrying a big cake which couldn't fit in minibar, he initially assisted me to store the cake in their fridge. He advised us to to go pool side to enjoy facilities, which made our experience even more unforgettable. Anyway I am sure we will be back soon! Stay on 08Jun, RM2380",50
Room size is large enough for a couples or a family.  Casino is very  clean and luxury. The Swimming pool is beautiful and the attendants are very kind. There are many kinds of sculptures at the three lobbies to welcome guests and its fantastic.,50
"I stayed at Wynn Palace with a few friends and I must say we were all really impressed! Top notch service from arrival to departure. The rooms and the amenities were outstanding.  Special mention to Victor who delivered phenomenal service! Wynn palace is a highly recommendable hotel in Macau and it is a newly opened hotel.  The rooftop pool is a must go to when staying there, it also overlooks the pond where there is a water show after time intervals. Really beautiful.",50
Is definitely a good place to visit and also stay a night.  Overall experience is good and for sure will visit again with friends and family and also recommend to others.  The cable car build up was good and can oversee the whole Wynn Palace.,50
"When I check in the room, I am so amazed that I can get the room faced to the mountain view.  However, I feel so touched that the staff takes effort to curve butterfly and wishes me to have a sweet dream!  The staff is so attentive to details and so nice to keep customers come back.",50
"The room is big, light and clearly enough. The lobby is gorgeous and comfortable. I like the decoration of the lobby and the room, and the color at orange and golden are special for a hotel, these colors make people feel happiness and younger",40
"Spacious room! Clean! Big big toilet with bathtub! Bed is comfortable, nothing to complain about! Totally worth my money. I One of the best hotel i've ever stayed! Will definitely recommend this place",50
Most beautiful wynn property of them all! Stunning decor and cable car  makes hotel the most grand in Macau. Definitely will recommend and come back and stay here. Bravo! Great staff as well and friendly ,50
"I plan this Macau short trip to celebrate my mother and sister's birthday.   Reservation The high standard service was started from the RSVN - Tom, he reply my e-mail within 1 hour and remark all my request.  Front Desk We arrived Wynn Palace at around 13:00hrs and I didn't expected that any room will be really at that moment as the check in time is 15:00. However, they offered one room for us first and mentioned that another room will be really after one hour. I booked two Executive Suit and they upgraded our rooms to the Parlor Suite! Surprise! The reception agent - Ms. Chebi is pretty, cheerful and professional. She provide a lot of information and recommendations. Room The room is huge. When I saw the picture of the room and I didn't like it as it is too gaudy. However, when‚Ä¶",50
"We stayed here for one night on our honeymoon. It has all the bells and whistles of a high-end hotel. The staff were so helpful at all times, including bringing our bags up to the room and showing us around the room.   The facilities in the room helped make the stay even better including a full tea set, bathrobes, slippers, pillow menu and fully integrated lighting system.",50
It is definetly a place where to celebrate an anniversary or for a romantic escape. The service is superlative from the room service to the swimming pool to the fontana buffet (huge variety of choices to eat in the morning) to the WS steakhouse where you can enjoy a show while eating. Definitely ones of the best spot to enjoy your time in Macao,50
"Improvement at higher level,on this other side I have not feel any problems in the lower level, such as house keeping,room service.reception, reseveration even the luggage delivery etc. all seem to be quite on duty, that is want idea and feel during my stay.",30
"The stay was just great! The service was perfect, the room like a modern royal palace and stuff never asked for tips!  They offer free sunscreen at the pool and you get free water everywhere. You can see that they care about every detail.",50
"One of The best that we hv stayed in Taipa area!  The corridors to the room are very well decorated n beautiful. The room is huge, the toilet is big, amenities are well stocked. The lights n curtains are both electronically controlled but if you need to turn on a lamp you can still do it manually. Bed is comfortable not hard, suits us. A Beo Bluetooth speaker is provided, easy to link up. Big panel TV! Very adequate charging points at both bedside tables. Another good point is both the North wing and South wing are linked on all floor levels so easy to get to yr rooms from either lifts. Will definitely stay again if we are coming to Macau.",50
"Totally worth it to spend a bit more money staying here and pamper yourself and your family.  Friendly and sweet service since arrival, the room amenities with top qualities that made you want to bring everything home if can.",50
"It's a beautiful property, truly a class of Steve Wynn. There is a free cable car ride to the entrance of the property. Beautiful musical fountain and very colourful and well-decorated lobby. It's a class of its own. This property is making the Cotai Strip more and more colourful.",50
"The hotel is beautiful and the service is excellent, rooms are very spacious and the view is excellent with very good service, the swim pool is good too but only the food in my opinion is no have a really variety.",50
"The new Wynn Palace resort in Macau is one of the nicest hotels we have ever stayed in. The hotel opened late last year and we have already visited twice. My husband is a casino player so we usually get upgrades at casino resorts, but no upgrade has ever compared to the suites that Wynn has put us in, at the Palace. Both times we stayed in large, gorgeous suites where every detail was thought-out. The staff was also extremely attentive and accommodating, yet not nosy or overbearing.  The flowers and artwork throughout the building are spectacular. We rented a poolside cabana for an afternoon, which was an extremely relaxing experience, unlike the frat-house atmosphere of poolside cabanas in Vegas. It was just a wonderful weekend and we look forward to spending many weekend‚Ä¶",50
"From check in to check out the experience was awesome. Hotel lobbies are so beautiful and creative, the room was fantastic and spacious, toiletries are above par. Wifi connection was also strong. We tried the lunch buffet at Cafe Fontana and the price we paid was worth it. The variety of food was great. Another wow factor in this hotel is the swimming pool. They have 1 big pool and 1 jacuzzi with a very lovely view. Another attraction that makes Wynn Palace fabulous is their Sky Cab. Our experience was wonderful and the view in both ways are super amazing especially at night. Lastly, the service of the staff are excellent and fast. We will definitely come back here in our future trip in Macau. I am truly happy and amazedüòÄ.",50
Had a wonderful stay in the Fountain Suite. The decoration and interior design is exquisite and tastefully done. The spacious room and luxurious atmosphere elevated our holiday to a level that can be summed in 1 word. Wow.,50
The best from check-in to check-out.... staff support and service excellent!!!!  Food within the hotel is complete and no need to go out of the premises.  View and the fountain was beautiful.... I hope that they will add more colors in the fountain show.,50
"We booked a Palace Suite at a very competitive rate for an annual business trade show. The room was divine and the staff was nothing short of exceptional. Despite a 30 hour trip, and our room being delayed as ""ready"" for an hour and a half guarantee time, Alex did ever possible to ease our fatigue and slight frustration. We were offered a different room to shower / rest until room was ready or visit to spa for shower / relaxation. We were offered a complimentary buffet and fresh fruit was sent to our room the next day. Every modern amenity is available to you at Wynn Palace, from personal technology aids to laundering and pressing. Fantastic food choices abound and the property itself is immaculate.

"We checked in on the 21st, had our room free upgraded to the Palace King which was awesome! Too bad the fountain wasn't working due to bad weather condition. We had our dinner at SW steakhouse. Its nice what they did with the ""performance"" every 30mins so guests could enjoy some entertainment besides the food. Staffs were very helpful on the menu. We enjoyed a lot and it was totally worth it. During breakfast time there was a queue but we didn't wait for too ling, however it would be nice if Fontana wasn't the only venue for breakfast. We had enjoyed a lot overall.",40
"It was such a memorable experience staying at wynn palace. From the moment you arrive to the professional front desk staff, to the beautifully appointed suite, dining and retail options everything epitome highest standard and quality in hospitality, tips: spend a little extra and book a room with the breathtaking fountain view. ",50
"Nice stay, considerate setting such as warm toilet board and automatic lighting. There are pool view with regular show time and free sky cab for guests. But there are also many people from China staying there.",40
"I stayed one night at Wynn Palace and the view from the room was amazing. It was also very spacious, with a huge bathroom and lounge area. I had picked the suite. HIghly recommended for couples as it is pretty romantic. The only thing i didn't think was great was the decor of the interior when you walk into the casino as it looks a little tacky with the colours. But otherwise, i would highly recommend this place as it is one of the newer additions in Macau.",50
Beautiful & luxurious & large hotel rooms Well thought out layout and many amenities provided without extra charge.  Complimentary cable car ride for hotel guest is a real plus point.  This is one of those hotel rooms you would definitely want to be spending your time in rather than out.  Casino minimum bets were $500HKD though.,50
What a fancy resort is! It's the best choice for the celebration of 5/20. My girlfriend and I really enjoyed the period in Wynn Palace. It's really impressive for my first experience In Macau. I definitely will come back next time I visit Macau. ,50
The hotel is so clean. I considered it the best hotel in my life ir I may say the best hotel in the country I stayed. I will really recommend this property to my friends especially the food in Fontana restaurant which we ate everytime. I never seen a room like Wynns Palace in my life. Everything is nice I will never regret stating innyour place. That Soon to comeback.,50
A magnificent luxury resort in Macau inspired by the beauty of nature. A team of high quality stuff. Everything is so neat. I like the whole experience in Wynn Palace and will definitely recommend it to my family and friends.,50
"there're largest rooms in Taipa of the same price. the room is new, clean. and there're some control hub. it can give you a sense of modernization in a luxury palace. the experience is wonderful. but if they can use real painting, not print work, i think it will be better.",40
"Your best choice hotel in macau. New and amazing architecture, good services, and fast services. Clean room, nice and wide corridors. Get lot of experiences with the 3 nights accomodation on this hotel.",50
"A great place to unwind centrally located with great facilities and high standards of food at the various restaurants particularly the SW Steakhouse, the noodle shop. We went to Venetian, Galaxy, Casino Lisbon but they all pale compared to Wynn Palace. They are all dated with poor food quality and feel like market places.",40
"Wynn hotels never disappoint! I've stayed in Wynn properties in Macau and Las Vegas and like it every time.   This is the latest addition to the Wynn hotel group and I found a great rate so decided to give it a try.  Upon check-in, the front desk staff offered a bottle of water before even asking for my passport (how nice)!!  He then upgrade me to a room facing the lake so I could watch the water dance.  The bellboy who walked me up to the room was super friendly, helpful and welcoming, and he even went downstairs again to bring me the free cable car tickets after finding that the front desk forgot to give me the tickets.   The room is large, comfortable and well-equipped, as they've thought about every details for you, so it was very easy to settle in.  I did not have  a chance‚Ä¶",50

"My overall experience at Wynn Palace was good and the room comfortable.The one bad experience was at the taxi stand at Wynn Palace. We found the doorman working at the taxi stand ( North side)  not helpful at all and in addition, there was no telephone at the taxi stand for use by the doorman. The taxi driver that was supposed to pick us up in the queue was very rude and indicated that he did not know where the restaurant that we wanted to go was and because there was no phone at the taxi stand, the Wynn doorman could not check with the restaurant the directions.The doorman is supposed to help customers  provide directions to the taxi driver.  Because there was no phone at the taxi stand, the doorman was not able to call the restaurant to clarify the directions. In addition,‚Ä¶",40
"Very kind, gentle personal. We had an anniversary and hotel stuff provide us with very tasty sweets and best wishes - this was very good. My wife was happy to see this Tiffany style in our room. Very good view from our room's window.",50
"the overall check in/out experience and room access are excellent. the suite is nice and all amenities are luxury and well function, except the sliding door were broken - the hotel reacted rapidly after getting my call of broken door. The only little complaint is the in-room dining. Overall is good and excellent, but the quality seems less tasty compare with restaurants. ",40
wynn palace really surprise me and my wifeÔºåincluding perfect view„ÄÅcomfortable bed and excelent food„ÄÇthe only problem is the shops r not enough for my wife„ÄÇmaybe it will be better after new MGM and Lisboa palace open„ÄÇI definitely will choose wynn palace again„ÄÇ,50

Professional  warm service with giant room. WithB&O blue tooth speakers . Big bath room that can be sleeping if you like . Must ask for a poolside view room which can enjoy non stop dancing water show 24 hours and cable car are unlimited for guest . Very nice Wing Lei Bar where you must spend some there .,50
"were there to celebrate my anniversary, my room is well and sweet decorated, surprised  and really unforgettable, we went there with my 6 yrs old son, child amenities were so thoughtful, big room and clean, huge bathroom, highly recommended.",50
"As of this writing, my companion's luggage has not been delivered to his room nor has it been found. The last time we saw it was at the bell-service trolley.  Hey the staff is very respectful but not all are efficient. While we hope the guy doesn't lose his job, we hope that the luggage is found. It's more of the hotel system: the hotel is full of touchbutton technology and all, but i wonder about security cameras which should be able to trace the whereabouts of luggage deliveries. ",30
Third time to stay. Three rooms booked totally and poorly arranged. Two rooms in same floor but different wing and far away. Another one in higher floor. Staff attitude ok. Room still look new and clean. Free cable car riding after you registered your email. Pillow a little bit soft for me. Location is a concern.,40
"The best hotel i ever stayed in my life..All staffs put their effort s to provide good services.I should said it really make my stayed so wonderful and memorable.I will come back again if there is a trip to Macau.Wynn Palace,you are the best hotel in Macau.",50
The room was nice and they provide a good facilities for their guests. The location also nice. Just don't have opportunity to get a room with nice lake view. The rest was perfectly fine. Nice hotel that I stayed.,50
This hotel one of the best hotels I had ever and the service and the staff are very supportive and knowledgeable and the royal suite is very nice and clean with very nice features and the rooms views are great ,50
"The customer service here has been very impressive. From check in to check out, the staff members involved were all very friendly and helpful, they always have a smile on their face. Looks like they have a very good staff culture throughout the whole establishment. We walked back in our room while the housekeeping lady was cleaning, she professionally cleaned the essential areas without making too much noise, then came back again when we went out for dinner to finish up the vacuuming etc. We have stayed at Sheraton and Galaxy before, the service here is by far the best. The ad fixtures and furnishings throughout this hotel resort are all very pretty and glamourise. The downside is that the minibar fridge is fitted with sensors, so guests can't put anything in the fridge.‚Ä¶",40
Stayed 2 nights could have stayed more. Food great room spotless enjoyed our stay. The only thing we wish we could have stayed longer.Staff very helpful could not do enough.Meet some nice people and the coffee by the pool was great.Water show on thud lake was awesome,50
Best and new hotel in macau! Everything is good. The room and emenity condition is very spacious.  And lake view on the unlimited skycap is really nice. I will recommend my friends. I will be right back.,50
All of your hotel was amazing.I can't believe it that I can stay in this amazing room with reasonable price. I'll stay there again when I visit Macau next time. And the food of Wing Lei Palace was so delicious.,50

"One of the poshest hotels in Macau. From the rooms to the restaurants, they are all beautifully decorated and giving you a tour of all of Steve Wynn's Vegas hotels. The food served at all the restaurants are also very good.",50
the swimmin pool food ( the Wynn macau swimming pool's food(fried rice) is better than Wynn palace swimming pool's food).  and we stay last year your Wynn hotel open day also. the price is higher that this May.,40
"I had a nice experience dining this restaurant. The buffet was lavish with many variety for anyone to choose. The Manager, Mr Chai from Cambodia was very friendly and professional. In the matter of fact, I have to really say I wasn't expecting a high level western style service as the fact that most hotels in Macau is flooded with Chinese guests who can misbehave or speak loudly. However the ambience created by Mr Chai and his team truly sets a very good example and I can see his staffs was working hard to pleased every guests. Therefore kudos to the entire team. I will be back to Macau and this time, I will also stay here as I was inspired by the story told by Mr Chai about the founder, Mr Wynn about how detailed he about the entire restaurant interior",50
Staff are kind and service is great! I can get good impression of Macau by staying Wynn palace.  Their food and beverage always satisfied us and room conditions are perfect! I strongly recommend to stay here,50
"Thank you for a very memorable stay..we are already planning to come back within the next 6 months., that's how much we love your property.. we have been to the Wynn Las Vegas and I was bowled over then so it was no brainer that we stay at your hotel in Macau.  We were upgraded to the Parlor Suite by Karen at the Front Desk as our room was not ready upon check-in and. WOW! Words cannot describe how impressed we were, right from the word go, the suite, facilities and amenities provided and the hotel itself, blew us right off our minds! We were spoilt for choice to say the least. Our only regret is that we should have stayed longer, a mere two nights was not enough having come over after visiting Hong Kong, we just wanted to relax and enjoy the hotel .

"First time ever going to Macau and rent a 5 star Hotel. We gawked looking at either the exterior and interior of this hotel. Truly amazing and wonderful experience. Ordered the fountain King Suite, we had excellent stay, the staffs all are surprisingly very handsome and very beautiful. They also helped us all a lot, especially when we want to take skycab for free because we are indeed hotel guest. The concierge (male) also very informative when we asked for Macau tourist map, with fluent english telling us all the details and guidance. They were over the top friendly, even the maid/roomkeeper greeted us in hallways. In terms of service, 5 star, top notch. Amazing.

The rooms are very spacious and very exquisite. Staffs were very accomodating and friendly. Even our stay was short the experience is beyond my expectation. definitely sure that we will comeback. keep it up and thank you for the wonderful experience..,50
Wynn Macau has always be one of the best hotel in Macau. Wynn Palace is way beyond best! Its way larger and the room is spectacular . Havent tried all the restaurant yet but i will upon my next visit.,50

"the bed room is  awesome plus u got tailor made B&O desktop music player which beyond my imaging. Also the decoration is great, deluxe but elegant. The price is quite competitive. the only regret is that we miss the lake show cause of weather.",50
"Hotel is excellent, new, gorgeous! All the staffs are polite, smile! Very enjoy to take a short break here, the facilities in hotel is good, provides a shopping mall , foods, and the build in Ferris wheel is a big surprise for me.  One point is, this hotel is a little bit far form the centre of the town, hotel provides a shuttle bus, we choose by taxi to everywhere, don't worry the fares that Macau is quit small.  For me this hotel is 5 stars, considering the location that minus one. I highly recommend if you want to have a short break, take a rest, tranquil , this is your first choice",40
"The new Wynn Palace Macau is Spectacular! Every square inch of this luxury property is amazingly lavish and detailed. The d√©cor is over the top Wynn style with an even richer taste than their US properties.   The staff was warm, welcoming and went above and beyond to make the guest feel welcome and comfortable. The restaurants are works of art and serve up the cuisine to match. There is even a fun Starbucks Coffee with a sense of humor in the traditional Chinese paintings!   The casino is light and airy, and offers some open and inviting dining choices within view. The rooms are plush and luxurious and a great place to relax.   There is also a fun gondola ride that circumnavigates the small lake in front of the hotel and offers access to the never-to-be-completed light rail‚Ä¶",50

Big, clean, comfy bed, equipped with all the high tech stuff: bluetooth speaker, huge flat screen TV, everything from curtains to lighting is controlled by a tablet beside the bed. There's no espresso machine in room, but there's Starbucks instant coffee.   I ordered room service and also ate at Red 8 (a chinese restaurant in the casino), food was amazing!   Nice gym, big outdoor pool. Free WiFi everywhere in the property.  Staff are all very friendly and helpful, great service!",50
"This hotel just had a great vibe from the moment you entered it's doors. The staff were very friendly, the facilities were amazing, the room was incredible and the location was perfect.  I can't see why you would stay anywhere else when in Macau.",50
The front side has a performance lake and cable car ride. It's very nice to see the performance from above of the cable car. The cable car will take you for free into the hotel but not out of the hotel (except if you're a hotel guest).,50
We came to celebrate friend's anniversary and I would like to express my feelings from pre-	arrival arrangement to staying experience.  Pre-arrival. 1. I book two rooms (a package with guarantee upgrade to suite room and cable car tickets) online and requested for connecting room.  I found the rate was double than my Oct reservation with the same deal.  I called to reservation and they of course can't do anything.  Not even bother my question.  I explained that I visit Macau every month and each time I stay in suite in other hotel.  Last month I got a much better offer and I also found a good rate on travel agent.  They said they didnt cooperate with that travel agent and just ended my question.   2. I called to Concierge to help a few arrangement to my friend's room.  They‚Ä¶,30
"I stayed there for one night with my friends visiting Macau. Everywhere in wynn palace is clean, tidy and brand new.  The room I booked was standard room with two queen beds.  It is spacious as Suite room in studio city I realized from my previous stay. Also, I really needed an early check in in order to decorate the room for my friend's surprise bridal shower. Concierge team was really helpful and they even offered me a decoration service yet I could do by myself as the room was ready early.  I cant thank enough for the service that I got! Bellteam and doorman, they are always smiling and offering help.  Housekeeping team also does a great job they set the language in devices in the room according to our nationality which was so thoughtful.   I would definitely return to stay‚Ä¶",50

The Wynn is a beautifully kept resort. The aura did make us feel as royals with the white and gold accent. No closet space was found but still a wonderful place especially if traveling with kids. I would have like if at least there was more complimentary than water in the mini bar considering the price we pay per night.,50
"Loved loved loved everything about this hotel! From the beautifully designed lobby to the amazing guest service to the most fantastic room we ever stayed in. In-room dining on another level and right on the casino strip of Cotai. With shopping options that rival the best shopping districts in Milan, London, Paris or New York and casual dining spread out around the hotel. A fantastic water show with the hotel's own Gondolas and bus service direct to the ferry to go to Hong Kong or to the Airport! As you read this you may see that I/We are in love with this hotel. And we only stayed one night but were still able to experience everything besides the spa/swimming pool. We will definitely be back!",50
"We stayed at Wynn Palace for two nights. Room condition, service and food  were all good. The most impressive were friendly empoloyees. We are going to visit again as soon as possible. We strongly recommend you.",50
We had a wonderful time at Wynn Palace. Luxurious and clean. Casino dealers are very professional and much nicer than those in other hotels. However some staffs there do not understand English so we had hard time finding stores or exist.,50
"I liked the facilities and the feeling, not too busy but still a hot spot. It's a great value and experience. I would love to return next time in town. Only little suggestion is to have some middle level shopping!",50
"My review title summed it all up. It definitely exceeded our expectations. From the smooth check-in (they prevent long lines from building up), we were ushered to their VIP registration eventhough we are only ordinary guests at the hotel. Common areas are clean & beautifully decorated with fresh flowers. Not chaotic than the previous hotels we have stayed at. Less loud people roaming around. Restaurant options are more on the expensive side. Red 8 will be your best bet but kids are not allowed since it is inside the Casino. We end up with take away & enjoyed the lake view inside our room while eating our dinner. Staff are courteous. Great hotel recreational facilities (spa, swimming pool) Get the room facing the Performance Lake, you'll thank me later. I could go on enumerating‚Ä¶",50

"It was fortunate that I chose Win Palace. Room condition, service, lake show, breakfast, and so on. Everything was fantastic and it was an unforgettable vacation. I hope the opportunity to visit next time soon.",50
"This is my fifth times staying at this hotel, every time was fantastic. Excellent services from the front desk to the housekeeping. That's why i been booking this hotel every time i am here. See you next in May!",50
"I had a wonderful time and everyone was on point with any given service . The air ride and the fountain shows where breathe taken. Shopping was fun . Although I did not gamble, the casino was very nice",50
"Amazing new resort, minor details are questionable at turn down and when leaving on the curb side but overall extremely attentive staff and beautiful suites.  I would love to enjoy the fountain without the music but still beautiful. I will efinitely be back for business and likely as a leisure staycation too!",50
I only spent one evening there but the service and room were all terrific. Everyone who worked there was professional and went out of their way to be of assistance. If I return to Macau I would certainly be happy to stay there again.,50
"A friend was staying at the resort and so I got the chance to return to a room. The standard was well maintained and the room was as fabulous as the one I stayed in earlier. We decided to go to the Wing Lei Bar, which I hadn't been to, for a drink, on a Friday night. The menu was as small as the bar itself, with a majority of bottled alcohol drinks. There's only a page (or two) of house-mixed drinks, totalled to about 10-12 choices only. I wasn't in desire of alcohol (because I needed to drink afterwards) so I ordered an in-house soda drink instead, but the entire soda section, even though there were only 2 choices, was unavailable. The seats we were offered weren't quite comfy. Those were average chairs for restaurants and the support wasn't enough for a relaxing, long sitting.‚Ä¶",40
"I had my wonderful stay as a getaway (2D1N)trip with my friend and we booked a Palace Room Twin Beds package.

The mini bar is full of boxes of snacks. A large bathroom with separate shower, bathtub and an in-wall bathroom television.  There will be two‚Ä¶",40
The hotel is absolutely my favorite place to stay in Macau. Excellent quality in the design and build of the property to meticulous detail. Food was great at the steakhouse which I ate there twice. Check in is still not smoothe as it should be with delays in getting the room at 4 in the afternoon still no room was ready. Staff are trying to please but have no real authority to act decisively in helping the guest.,40
"If visiting Macau, Must stay at Wynn Palace- DEFINITELY! You would never go wrong. Everything on this hotel is the BEST! Their rooms are very spacious, love the bed, soft and very comfortable pillows. their robes and slippers are also nice. the bathroom is so classy.. the green carpet color with yellow accent is also very relaxing. control the lights, curtains, aircon,etc using the tab near the bed. so far, the best hotel I've stayed on.",50
"Steve Wynn still got it. The new Wynn palace, which cost more than $4B is typically Wynn.   It is the best of Wynn Las Vegas mixed with updated fountains from Bellagio with amazing customer service.   We got upgraded to a 80+ square meters suite with fountain view. And I gotta say, the technology here makes Wynn LV seem a bit dated.   I thought the swimming pool area was beautiful. I feared it would be too small, but it doesn't seem like the Asians like to chase the sub as much as us Norwegians ‚ò∫Ô∏è  But all in all, I still prefer Vegas to Macau. And I hope there will be more things to do at this hotel in the future. It was only one small bar, and I missed a show or more happenings at night.",50
"Great Hotel, comfortable bed. But very cheap on food and drink. Prepared a lot of money on their restaurant if you don't already have meal plan with the room package. Also stay away from the sensor refrigerator and snack bar.They will charge you even you are just moving the drink to make room for your own water.",40
"Everything about this hotel is superb!   The staff is outstanding, kind and friendly and super helpful!  They go out of their way to help. Our Suite was unbelievable!  It had a great living room, with floor to ceiling windows and views of the lake,  massive bedroom, 2 huge t.v.s and a small one in the mirror in the bathroom.  The toiletries were amazing.  They were housed in this gorgeous lacquered chest.  I wanted to buy one, but it was being sold for over $700.  too expensive for me.  One of the best features was the heated toilet seat!  Loved that! I would stay here again, in a flash.  It's new, so obviously super clean.  Couldn't find a better place.",50
"It's the second time my husband and I had stayed at Wynn Palace. The first time was for my husband's birthday back in October when they first opened. Second time was in January before CNY.  They never fail to surprise me. The fountain view was AMAAAAZING at night. We were recommended to take the cable car at night and it was spectacular!   Check-in was fast and efficient. Staff were friendly. Rooms were cozy and big. We got a complementary cake and chocolate truffle box for my husband's birthday.   We also tried SW and Wing Lei Palace, both were delicious! We stayed 3 days both times and ate at SW both nights for dinner. You could see how good it is!  Highly recommended!",50
"From the moment you arrive to the time that you leave, every details are taken in great consideration. The staff are the most helpful and friendly. you will not get disapointed by the restaurant either but be wise to book in advance.",50
"We dined at Fontana during Chinese New Year and the hotel's outstanding services attracted us back to stay in the hotel during Easter holiday. It was a great experience for our family trip.  One caveat, if the hotel booking says the room should be available at 3pm, pls make sure it will be available on time. Thanks!",50
"This hotel is beyond words! From the moment I stepped into the room, I thought I had the wrong room type. I booked the lead in room and what I got was far more than I expected. Really great value for money! The service is spectacular and the rooms are to die for. Extremely clean and modern. The bathroom even has a tv built into the mirror so you can either watch movies while getting ready or listen to music. Compared to Las Vegas, Macau definitely has a higher standard of accommodation.",50
"Another hotel signed by Steve Wynn,another outstanding hotel that has everything you can dream of. The vibe,the decor are so classy and pleasant. The rooms are huge with so many unthinkable details(plus twice a day room service). The hotel has a wide range of outstanding restaurants (not overcrowded food courts). Overall unique hotel experience at one of the best hotels you might stay in.",50
"Haven't been to Macau for 5-6 years so this was a big surprise. There was nothing in Taipa then, now it is Vegas recreated!!!! A local brought us here for lunch. He dropped us at the courtesy cable car ride up into the ""palace"", I had shorts on so that was a no no but that's not a problem cos they will provide courtesy trousers to diners!! Even better, a special bag chair was provided for my worn out back pack!! Lunch with a view of the fountain display was very pleasant, the dumplings were great, the service impeccable and the bill was covered by our friend. Quite an eye opener!",40
We had a Wonderful stay at the wynn palace...and would definitely stay there again if we return to Macau. The staff are all very polite and ready to help at a moments notice. The pool was very clean and the grounds well kept. üôÇ,50
Very clean and great facilities! Restaurants and the bar in the wynn are definately worth checking out. Great atmosphere and in room facilities. The complimentary cable car rides are worth the visit.  Would definately recommend.,50

"It's my second time to stay in this hotel since its opening. I stayed for two nights from 10/4-12/4 with two kids. When we arrived the South Lobby reception, we only waited for few minutes and with the front desk services. The lady front desk staff was very nice to greeting us and noted that we came to celebrate my kid birthday. She then arranged an excellent room 2731 for us and on understanding we needed twin beds, she offered additional bed for us too.  My kids enjoyed a very happy stays in this hotel especially the spacious room that they could freely had fun inside the room. The swimming pool was also very lovely, there also with a warn water outdoor jacuzzi that you could relax in the pool.  I will surely come back again if the hotel continues to keep the quality services‚Ä¶",50

It gives you a palace  like experience  with high standards modern amenities.Rooms are huge with a huge on screen TV in the room .Also have a small beautiful inbuilt mirror TV in the washroom (really cool ). Amenities are excellent . tablet controlled lights , drapes ,sheer ... everything is class.Excellent service , great food... everything is just perfect . Cable car ride around the performance lake is also incredible. Will definitely recommend this to everyone and would definitely stay here if I revisit",50
"The best experience of my life! I loved every minute that I spent in the Wynn Palace.  It is beautifully decorated, spotlessly clean, smells delightful and the staff were incredibly attentive.  I cannot recommend this establishment highly enough.  Will be back for sure!",50
"May I express my sincere thanks to Ms. ViYan Wu (Reservation Agent - Room Reservations).  ViYan provided excellent customer services to my family.  She helped me to handle many small but difficult points, as my relatives they speak Wenzhou dialect.  My relatives stayed 2 fantastic nights at Macau Wynn Palace - Parlor Suite.",50
We had booked the hotel assuming it to be old Wynn in Macau. We were pleasantly surprised to land up into brand new hotel. Our disappointment of being far away from the main hub melted after experiencing freshness of the new hotel.,50
"Great hotel with incredible service.  SW steakhouse had the best steak I've been able to get in ""China"" so far.  Poolside service was very good as well  Gambling minimums high - can find lower minimums at Venetian or old Macau.",50
"We visited all major hotels in the Cotai area and found Wynn Palace clearly to be overall the best hotel. Most striking is the decor, so lavish, so rich, so fun. The amount of flowers is just mind-boggling, although some are preserved, but still real flowers. The rooms are huge and well equipped and most comfortable - apart from the lack of reading lights above the bed (how can they forget this?) and a shower door which is wrongly installed - opening to the wrong side, making it difficult to get into the shower. They have wonderful restaurants, not cheap but what they serve is top. On the F&B side the only complaint we have is the soft bun bread served at the SW Steakhouse. For such a wonderful restaurant to serve such terrible buns instead of a small variety of proper breads is‚Ä¶",50
Good service from the entrance throughout the leave of the hotel Phenomenal suites and swimming pool. Good shuttle services made my trip easier to get to places. The only bad thing i could think of is that i have not received any welcome gift but i dont think other hotels provide them either.,50
Free upgraded into parlor suite. Very nicely decorated and arranged. Very nice view from the living room and the bedroom. Sufficient space for a family. Splendid water display in front of the hotel. Private cable car rides to have a different view of the hotel and the water display.,50
"It was a wonderfull stay at the wynn palace, the stuff is friendly and helpfully, the rooms are big and clean! The food is very good and the service in the restaurant is excellent... Good shuttleservice",50
"As I visisted Wynn Palace it was amazing stay in there. They have beautiful floral displays throughout which gives the hotel delightful point. All the staff were polite, helpful and welcoming. Our room was amazing and I would definitely recommend booking a fountain view room. Skycab ride was one of the memorable.  The Wynn Palace has set a new standard for 5-star hotel and we will definitely stay here again when we are in Macau.",50
"I've stayed at Parlor Suite. The room was over than 120m2, much bigger than my apartment. Very clean and had everything we need. We can enjoy the waterfall show in the room. The staff were very kind and the buffet restaurant is recommendable. I think this hotel is the best choice in macau for now. The facilities are 6 stars grade but the rate is reasonable.",50
A memorable trip with good food and service. The swimming pool is excellent and the cable car ride is fantastic. The Fontana cafe lunch is enjoyable with good food and view. The room has an iPad like high tech control panel that you can easily adjust everything. We particularly like the bath tub with water jets and we spend hours in it.,50
Very good hotel and provided good quality service. The hotel is very close by the airport and has shuttle bus to the port. The restaurant in the casino opens 24/7 . The front desk service is extremely good and extension my check out time until 1.,40
"Huge huge rooms!!!! It was so nice to have the space.  Which made us want to stay longer.  Fluffy bed, pillows and coverings. Food at the hotel was excellent although not too many choices. The staff gave us a front and center view of its lake/fountain and it was beautiful at night. Staff service was impeccable.  We arrive like most people via a shuttle bus from the HK ferry so there were a lot of people checking at same time, but the staff proactively add more people at the counter so guest did not have to wait. That is service!!!!!! ",50
Wynn palace is a very nice hotel... with An amazing an attentive staff. From the lady at the check in to the waiter in the pool cafe everyone exceeded our expectations. Rooms are nice and big. Very recommended.  Having said that unless you go with a lot of cash...That is not the ideal hotel/casino. Min bet starts at 500hkd so it gets expensive fast.  ,50
"It was such a wonderful stay at the Wynn Palace. Not to mention many art pieces have been used through out the hotels, which worth paying the attention. The touch screen panel in the guest room is just awesome, the guest can control the lighting, screen/drapes, TV all at finger-tip convenience. The spa facilities is beautiful decorated, a must go if there's time. The transportation is convenient as well. The free hotel-buses covered pretty much all the destinations.   Really enjoyed the service from Wilma at Fontana Buffet, always offered a friendly smile and even remembered our preferences!!",40
"Wynn Palace Macau is surely one of the best hotels in Macau which has started operating late 2016 hence is very new. I am no gambler particularly so can not really judge their gambling capacity but their spacious rooms full of whatever you may need on a short trip, their open-air pool, marvellous open buffet and all makes Wynn Palace one of the best choices in Macau with their competitive prices for such a service!",50
"Due to a minor miscommunication in the reservation (reserved 2 rooms and only 1 reservation shown on the hotel's system), we were upgraded to 2 Lake View Fountain Suites.  The rooms were spacious and clean with a great view over the Fountain.  Amenities were outstanding.  Dining at the hotel's steakhouse was a great event with a 3D cinematic show every 15 to 20 minutes.  Hotel staff are very well trained to make each guest feel welcome. Overall well worth the price you pay for in this wonderful property.",50
"The Wynn Palace, is truly a luxury hotel and probably the best one in Macau at the time being, yet its room rate is quite reasonable as compared to other prestige hotels in town.   My wife and I had a short vacation in Macau in mid November. This time we chose to stay at a Fountain Parlour Suite as we already stayed at a Fountain Suite a month ago so we wanted something different.   This Suite was located in the high floor zone and was generously sized measuring over 190 sqm.  Its size is larger than a Verona Suite in Venetian Macau which used to be my favorite however the room layout and facilities in this Fountain Parlour Suite are much better.  There is a separated master bedroom and bathroom, an isolated massage room,  and a spacious living room adjacent to a guest toilet.  ‚Ä¶",50
I arrived at the Wynn tired. Going to a dull conference and general fed up.  I was upgraded upon arrival and my room was stunning.  It is pointless to bore you but it was literally palatial as befits a palace.  The staff were extraordinarily helpful and I hope to be back very soon. The conference turned out well too!,50
"Spent a day in Macau and we had chosen to stay at Wynn Palace. Very friend service. Thank you Martin at the check in counter that makes my check in and late check out request a pleasant one.   You should not miss the breakfast buffet as it is probably one of the best I have experienced in Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, Japan, US, Europe.   The shopping center is bit empty but it makes the browsing a leisure one.   The King bed room is sizable and comfy. The in room equipments are modern and makes you want to stay longer. The price is reasonable compared with other major Asian cities.   Try to visit at non peak period. ",50
"Beautiful hotel. Immaculate. Room was stunning with a great view. The breakfast was good, but could have had a bit more variety (lots of desserts and not enough savoury). The staff were all super friendly. And it has the best bar in all of Macao - wing lei. Stay here now!!",50
I love this beautiful and cozy hotel. Not crowded but peaceful! Room is clean and breakfast is nice. Tepanyaki at Mizumi is wonderful. Full of flowers in the place. Also I won a lot in the casino. What's more to tell?,50
"Complientary skycab, newspapers and high quality teabags. All you can find in a ""6 star"" hotel. Wish i was given a lake view room though. I have stayed in a number of hotels in cotai and this is simply one of the best! Staff are unimaginably helpful and always take the initiative to offer assistance. Everything is new and looks splendid.  One imperfection is that when i checked out, the counter wanted to charge me extra for the fact that i might have opened the drawer? Somehow their sensor detected so and might have moved the chip a bit? (No way i have removed anything from there for more than 60secs - and I suspect some guests dont even know about this) Anyway, they didn't insist and remained polite. I hope my credit card wont be charged for more than necessary.",50
"We had 30 years anniversary, we got most wonderful and luxury suite we ever had. Huge suite, big living room, very big bedroom, large bed, wonderful bathroom, all was very clean, so polite staff!! We enjoyed so much in this vacation!! We'll be back!!",50
"The room was large and well-decorated, service was excellent, quality was awesome. I think it will be a very good choice to stay if visit Macau. I am a local in Macau but I am still willing to pay for staying in this hotel for experience.",50
Upgraded to a suite. Only slight issue was that I couldn't log in to my ipad ( though Techical team did their best) . Surprisingly I don't have problems with my mobile phone. Anyway they were prompt to have their staff to come by to attend to me . Thank you.,40
"Nice place,service excellent,value for money,recommended hotel to stay at macau,dont have to think twice to stay back when i'm going to macau in the advance,love it very much,what a great place to stay",50
"Best Casino , the most clean one in Macau . Room was excellent . Service was excellent . Have shuttle bus from ferry station . Breakfast was including many choices and good quality. Tried the cable car which is free for hotel guest . Suggested to be best hotel in Macau . ",50
This was a Grand Hotel. Automatic Free Wifi was connected upon entering the room. Sleeping accommodation was very roomy. Plenty of towels and drinking water was provided. Free ride of the cable car was offered. The Casino was Grand. The service of the Fand B outlets were satisfactory.,50
"I stayed in many hotels but this one was just amazing !!!! Mr. Wynn chose everything in this hotel and you can feel his influence. The lobby & the pool were amazing and the staff are so nice and professional.  We went to visit other big hotels like Venetian, the Parisian but they were a bit crowded. If you are looking for a quite & luxury stay in a 7 star hotel this is your choice. Mr.Kelly keeps the hotel in a very high standard and I was really amazed and will definitely will come back.",50
It was very excellent and convinient for me. Also I would like to recommend this hotel ti my friends and collegues. This time was very empressive memory for me. Once again thank you so much and I pretty much appreciate for your true service.,50
This hotel is Luxe and everything is OTT but a great experience. We stayed in a suite that was as big as a small apartment - always ask for an upgrade! Bathtub huge shower amazing overall a greta stay. Place is sooooo big its a very impersonal stay. Buffet breakfsat great range and top quality.,50
"Only stayed one night, but from the time we arrived until we left a totally pleasant experience. The staff are so nice, well trained and welcoming. The accommodation, as you would expect, is first class and the location opposite the City of Dreams makes it perfect. Take the cable car ride and experience the water show, very spectacular! Only slight disappointment was that late at night there are very few places to eat, only one in fact, and if you want a beer we did not find any nice bars, just a small lounge. I think those facilities could be improved on. But all in all, yes, we enjoyed our stay and would recommend this hotel!",50
I got upgraded to parlor suite for my 2 nights stay. it was really really amazing. the room was huge and the view was stunning. got the unlimited sky cab ride from being the wynn insider and the dancing fountain was magical. ,50
Second stay at Wynn Palace and very difficult /impossible to criticise.  Staff are very accommodating and try their utmost to assist. There may a be a problem looming with potential clash of cultures; but that is something that everyone is facing in the region and beyond. Will remain my preferred destination on the Cotai.,50
"Newly opened Casino, Hotel and shopping complex just 5 minutes from the International airport. Understand that Mr. Steve Wynn invested USD 4.2 bn in the property and I must say you can see the money that was spent in the construction, decor and finishing of the hotel. The property has to be seen to be believed!! Its huge. Facilities and amenities are first class. Rooms and F&B outlets amazing. All that one could ask for in a hotel. The shuttle services to the sights and other places of interest efficient and staff excellent.",50
"The hotel staff are excellent, especially for the arrangement of birthday cake. However, the waitress at Red 8 was displeased when requested to change a pot of hot tea. The waitress at Noodle99 was also unfriendly when I was taking photos of my family at the table. A bit of disappointment when I was waiting outdoor at the performance lake to view the performance at 11.40pm & 12 midnight but there wasn't any performance. The skycab has also stopped service & I have to walked round the lake to get back to the hotel.",40
Taxi drivers at night time charge double price. Is it Ok? Would be nice to get an official taxi for such a respectible place. Also I feel luck of non expensive european 24 h food. Would be so nice to have an option to eat at any time you arrive to hotel or before early departure for not much money.,50
"Great service, great location, great amenities.. hotel staff is very kind and helpful.. shuttle service of the hotel really makes getting around macau very easy and pleasant.. overall great experience",50
"Since hotel is new, rooms are clean and nice. There are a lot of shops but location is not accessible, hence there is little shoppers. There is cable car ride at the hotel entrance which is interesting.",30
"Quite an exhilarating experience at Wynn Palace, Macau.  The decor at Wynn Palace Macau , with its spring flower theme is quite a sight to behold. Impeccable service from their hotel Ambassadors , special mention to Miss Bibi.  Great shopping arcade and good restaurants, special mention Mizumi.  Will certainly be back!",50
"If 5 is the top star rating I need to give this one a big 'plus'!  It is simply stunning: a cable car ride to check in over a man-made lake probably 4-times the size of the lake at Bellagio Las Vegas. This new 1800-room hotel is only a few months old, but despite competition business is already good, defying the Chinese austerity act (if gaming intake comes down). There are so much to do within the complex that I probably do not need to go out during my three night break. So many restaurants of star quality to try out (and will attempt to write reviews here later as I have arrived only yesterday).  Saw the tremendous water show from my window and it is simply stunning, unmatched in Vegas!  Exquisitely decorated to last detail, this is a real palace of a hotel. And great that I‚Ä¶",50
I was contented your hotel stay and your skycar. All of experience was great! I would recommend  wynn palace to my family and my friends. And tea service was good. I enjoyed all tea in the room and after I arrived my home. It gives me the memory good.,40
"Everything was as close to perfect as can be, with tons of special touches that put a smile on my face.  I was sad to leave, and could only think ""I'll definitely be back"" as I left the property.  Thank you to everyone involved for a special experience for me.  A few things worth pointing out.  Any negatives below are generally pretty small, but I've listed them here because this seems to be the type of place that strives for complete perfection, and really cares about the small things.  1. The housekeeper, concierge, front desk and all other staff were all excellent.  They made me feel valued and important without being stuffy or having overly sanitary interactions. 2. The breakfast buffet was good.  However, the buffet was scheduled to close at 11am, and they started removing‚Ä¶",50
"We stayed at the wynn palace last weekend. Booked two parlor suites. The rooms are huge and very clean. We felt very welcome, the staff always greet you with a smile and are very attentive. The beds are so comfortable we spent a couple hours just watching tv! There are two sinks, a huge bathtub, heated toilet seats, and even a guest washroom.  While we stayed in to enjoy our room, our friends went down to The outdoor heated pool as the weather was too chilly for the regular pool. Had to mention this as not all hotels have one.  We dined at SW and Fontana cafe. SW restaurant is simply divine! the entertainment was a bit OTT but the food delicious! Special shout out to Harry who is the best! Very knowledgeable about the dishes and recommended the most suitable ones for us.   We‚Ä¶",50
"I visited Wynn Palace with my mom. She loved this hotel. There are great points to taking pictures.   Fountain Suite King room is really big and great condition.  Unfortunately, there was no welcome fruits.",50
"Impressive and awesome place! I went with mom for trip. Actually It's first time in Wynn palace. Everything is perfect such as shuttle bus, tour, restaurant....! It's very convenient and even awesome!",50
"We came to Macau as part of our trip to Hong Kong. The stay we had at the Wynn really was spectacular. We had a beautiful room looking onto the fountains, it can only be described as luxurious! And not bad value for money, considering the delicious breakfast that was also included. We live in Dubai so are used to visiting 5 star hotels but this was on another level. We ate at the Wing Lei palace restaurant, the food was delicious and the staff were unbelievably attentive. Will definitely stay here again if we ever come back to Macau, a very special place!!! ",50
"Mr Wynn, you have done an outstanding job with the property and staff ..My first stay at a Wynn property and was impressed in the level of detail and service level from staff ..enjoyable and comfortable experience..will be back and must stay for any visitor to Macau..",50
Overall experience is nice... We been to different hotels but the one impress us was the hotel corridor it's huge...almost double the usual...and it makes u feel comfy and relax...we missed the fountain show that night though...i took a photo from the pool view making the Wynn Palace as background...but you cannot notice the Name...but still it's very comforting...,50
"Unlike any hotel I've been in before.  Fun and whimsical in many ways, yet the extreme attention to detail was evident in all regards.  The room was perfect. The bar was a masterpiece.  We plan a return visit very soon.",50
"Reserved for my parent's birthday after seeing some of the positive reviews on TA; when we were checking in, one of the staff appraoched, think his name was Alan, and assisted us and i mentioned to him that we're here to celebrate my father's birthday and he got us a better room! He was handsome and very welcoming! Just came back from dinner and he even got us a beautiful cake!!!!  The room itself is luxurious, Molton Brown amenities and everything else in gold, cannot complain more definitely best hotel and service in town.",50
The scent of flowers was great and the service was good. And the meal was delicious. I had a pleasant time. And the Korean language under the front line would be better if there were employees. See you next time.,40
"Everything is nice. Location and transportation is good. Room is very fantastic with nice view. but do not book connection room. my next door, they has birthday party until 3 am. we couldn't sleep, we complain to HOTEL but nothing change. I think Hotel need more strong policy.",50
"I like the room facing fountain, amazing fountain show, the amenities  are very nice. staff are very pleasant, good food, decorations are terrific, the hotel so clean what can I say For me all are excellent",50
"Would be arrange for second stay on coming trip . Good front desk and available to offer late check out bcoz my flight in late evening. Room clean and new , very efficient service. It's very good experience to stay in this hotel.",50
It was very nice place to stay with family. Room was beautiful and all service was perfect and everyone to support was very kind. I will return my visit next time in Macau and will stay in Wynn palace absolutely.,50
"Wonderful fantastic value for every centime we paid to stay here, beauty, quality, wellness and service. Surrounding area from the cable car to the gardens. The light and sound show. The lobbies decorated with natural flowers.",50
"My boyfriend and I stayed in Wynn Palace Macau was awesome experience we ever had. After the check in, bellman-Bo was friendly and entertaining when he escorted us to room. The room was marvelous! Beautiful, luxury design and yummy chocolates and macaroons amenity during the turndown service.  Had a dinner in SW steakhouse, all the foods and wines served were delicious. Thank you Waitress-Sally of her service.   I love hanging out at The Spa! It provide a great relaxation environment! Thank you to Jem, Michael, JR and Mali for the great service to us! We will coming back again!   Thank you so much Concierge-Jovita for setting up the room of our surprised propose! Great work!   Lastly, my boyfriend and I will looking forward our future stay in Wynn Macau!  ",50
"I updated my hotel Iist in Macao. Wynn Palace now is on the top as same as Ritz Carlton. The room was spacious, the service from Manager Bruno was exceptional. It is amazing of being taken cared in a trip for relax. So I cancelled my Spa reservation in Banyan Tree and booked Spa here. The Spa experience was good and my therapist was nice and professional.   The only challenge was occurred when checking out. I was asked by Receptionist if I have returned the portable charger to SPA. I did not see where it was coming from, coz I have never borrowed anything from SPA. I left after I explained. On the shuttle bus, I called back to hotel and asked to talk with SPA. It turned out that the staff could not find the bag of the portable charger so they reminded Receptionist to ask me.‚Ä¶",50
Experienced splendid personalized services and hospitality. Enjoyed heartful services particularly at dinner at SW. View from the room is breathtaking and breakfast is superb. Hope to stay longer so that we could experience more of other services and occasions. Thank you all!,50
"Hotel facilities are first-class. However, there is insufficient Korean language service in the hotel. I felt uncomfortable because there were no Korean staff available at the hotel. I hope Korean staff will pay attention to us when I stay in the hotel.",40
"What an experience to visit the brand new hotel in Macao! The suites are amazing and as in Vegas the Casino at Wynn is again the most exclusive and interesting in town to visit. The only thing missing currently is the party atmosphere we very much enjoy at Wynn in Vegas, but that must be doable in a short period of time...",50
Wynn Palace is one of the recently opened hotels in Cotai. The furnishing throughout are marvelous. All weather outdoor pool is neatly placed and superb. Kids surely love the cable car ride which would be a moving point for viewing the fountain show.,50
"When I checked in in the morning, someone I did not know was booked with me. But I was relieved because your staff told that there was nothing wrong with me. I returned to the hotel in the evening i can not enter my rood because the key did not work. When I contacted the staff, I was embarrassed that my room had changed without any mention . I was so tired that I packed my bags in the 20th floor and went to the newly assigned room, and I found that  the stranger was already in the room. The manager upgraded the room, but I was not feeling well. Especially the most unpleasant thing was that the next day when I checked out, the staff was the employee who checked in the day before and there was no apology to me.",20
"I've been to this hotel for 3 days with my family because of my mother's birthday. Everything are perfect and my mom is satisfied especially. Most of all, every staffs is so kind and friendly. Thank you all again",50
"This place lives up to it's name. It is luxurious, gorgeous without being stiff. Most of all, the staff was outstanding. They were polite, responsive, and knowledgeable. I can communicate with them in English, Mandarin, and Cantonese without difficulty.  Food selection, however, is limited and the ones available, with the exception of Starbucks, are on the high end of the price range, even though the quality is good and the ambience is exceptional.",50
"This is the only hotel with a cable car service, which is for free ride up, but you need to pay if you ride down. Class of hotel and quality of decor much better than many resort hotels. However, the prices of restaurants are higher and luxuri Casino: less crowded but different crowd. Chances of winning much better than other casino The most economical way to have lunch is in Restaurant 88 which is located inside the casino. You may use points earned from playing machines in casino to pay for the food, which ranges from HK$68 and upwards for a decent rice or noodle meal. The better place to eat",40
"clean, quite, beautiful. and comfort.  i stay a night at king palace, and it was great moment. I will defenitly choose winpalce again if i visit Macao again.   I stayed with my mom, she loved it. it was beautiful!",50
"I stayed at the Wynn Palace recently for one night as part of a 5 day trip to Hong Kong. I have been to Vegas and perhaps unfairly expected a similar experience.  The room at the Wynn was exceptional, perhaps the best hotel room I have ever stayed in, certainly the largest television!   The casino was less impressive, mainly higher stakes games; probably fair enough given their target clientele but nowhere near the diversity of choice available in Vegas. Drinks service at the tables was very slow bordering on the non-existent; as amateur gamblers we expected a drinkie or two!   The casino is surrounded by shops and amazingly there is only one bar! I think one of the restaurants had a bar within but only one dedicated place to get a drink! Very odd. The bar itself was nice, a bit‚Ä¶",30
"I have visited Wynn Palace before the Lunar New Year.   I have selected one with living room area lake side fountain view room. The design and the layout of the room gave me a great surprise!  Extremely comfortable and a best leisure rooms here. None of the advese comment from this hotel at this moment. The hardware and the software were excellent. The shuttle bus have a good routing especially can go to the Taipa buzaar.  My another experience in Wynn Place Hotel for this trip is the buffet resturant in Cafe Fontana. Even Im not a ""King of big stomach"" both of the quality and the quantities for the food also impressed me very. They can provide a lot of choice to the guest and the restaurant with a lake side fountain view also is a strength point for this restaurant.  The cable‚Ä¶",50
"The room is spacious and huge, kind of wasted since we were her only for 1 night. Our package didn't include breakfast, so we need to go out for meals. Not much choice of restaurants within the hotel complex, because most of the restaurants are quite expensive, although there is a Starbucks outlet.",30
Overall a great stay. But you can get overwhelm and a bit lost initially as everything looks almost the same inside. The free shuttle from the pier doesn't stop directly in front of the main lobby so beware. Go in the building and turn left and walk all the way till the merry go round. The reception is on your right.,50
Stayed here for 2 nights and I was not disappointed. The decor is incredible with Amazing pieces of art and floral arrangements throughout the hotel. Rooms were huge and super modern. Buffet at dinner over looks the lake and water show and is good value for money.  If you are planning on gambling in the hotel I recommend you sign up for the red members card. You earn points when you play which you can use in the restaurants against the bill.   We were lucky enough to get offered a free night from gambling on the floor.  Would definitely stay again and recommend to anyone. ,50
"Really enjoyed my stay here. Great rooms, nice size, excellent amenities. Restaurants and shopping we both first rate.  The location is a bit far from the central part of Macau so every day started and ended with a 20 minute cab ride.",40
Generally the hotel is very good. But not as good as other wynn resorts. They charge 500hkd per person for sauna and pool!!! In my opinion this looks like cheating.. cause in hotel of this level you expect basic features to be included,40
"The room is spacious, clean and luxurious.  My daughter and I had a wonderful two day stay at this hotel.  The cable car ride and fountain show are a must in the evening.  It is a beautiful hotel and casino.  Staff are friendly and very helpful, particularly the service with the concierge, helping us made restaurant reservation and how to get around.  Would come back again!",50
"We've walked through almost all of the hotels and casinos in Macau and found that this was possibly the most elegant of them. The displays in the different lobbies will mesmerize and impress you. The casino floor is the nicest we've seen thus far, not only in Macau.  You should know though that while they will lure you in via the complimentary sky cab,  if you wish to use it to leave, it will cost you MOP100 per person. That is not something they tell you before hand.  Overall the experience was great, and is worth seeing.",40
It's very good place to enjoy .  Wynn Palace is very beautiful and decorated with Flower . It's really awesome to have pics with beautiful Flower and colourful .  Cable car is also awesome which will give you proper view of place and fountain .  Fountain in Night is like giving peace to mind .  Enjoyed evening very well !,50
The hotel decor is beautiful. Room is clean and very comfortable. The food and beverage do not have many choices especially breakfast. There is only one cafe serves breakfast buffet..The other cafe open quite late in the morning.,40
"Beautiful flowers all over the palace, clean and spectacular sights everywhere,  All those significant symbolic icon of WynnPalace Flower Ferris Wheel, Flower Carousel, Colored tulip creature, Skycab, Performance Lake show...Everything was wonderful and the suite room was splendid, luxurious and also equipped fully automated control panel..  Thanks for having a wonderful and luxurious experience with WynnPalace.",50
"Best hotel in Macau !! Great staff from receptions to house keeping. Enjoyed the services and facilities provided. The hotel is a little away from town but there is transportation provided, good to improve the frequency of the route.",50
"great hotel with excellent services, room was outstanding, the lake performance is amazing, skycab is additional value. will comeback for sure.the only disadvantages is casino not so many games, need to add more tables",50
"We stayed in a big room with great view , the staff is very polite ,the transportion is convienient by taking bus which the hotel offer, the interior is decorated with marble and creative design .if you are looking for a luxury hotel in macau taipa area, I think it is the best choice.",50
Location is comfortable. You can go easy through shuttle bus. Wifi is so fast. Like my home. And nice view with skycab. But... room service took around 2 hours. Even i called 5 times. They repeated  i will check.,40
"Really enjoyed our stay, however a few niggles are listed below: Preston Bailey carousel was out of commission all weekend, and my daughter was so looking forward to seeing them. Heated WC seat was faulty, as well as razor supplied Could not provide brown sauce or Worcestershire sauce at breakfast",50
"Amazing room, with amazing 2 big screen TVs. The room is excellently decorated to meet up the standard. Size of the room is also huge. The bathroom is nice with excellent amenities. Each room furnished with bluetooth audio speaker that can be connected to your smartphone.",40
"One of the best in the world, the hotel has a great perfum in the air, the staff is very polite and helpfull, everything is beautifull and carefully prepared. The lake show (with water fountains) is the best i've ever seen, the sound and effects are amazing (better than the Bellagio in Las Vegas and the Burj Kalifa in Dubai).",50
"We visited the hotel months ago and its really spectacular! the quality of the rooms and the casino are exceptional. The restaurant Red 8 its a good place to enjoy a good dinner, the only thing that i didnt like its that the casino doesnt have black jack only virtual one.",50
"Hotel is excellent and in a good location minutes walk to all the other hotels. The hotel staff were friendly. The fountains were brilliant, we loved watching the shows our favourite was New York, New York. ",50
"Very good service, we love the house keeping to clean up the room again every day we come back in the afternoon, and also set up the room for night time every time we come back in the evening. Also, The transport is excellent and make the trips so easy to Cotai and Macau city.",50
"This is one of the newest hotels in town with the biggest room size. I checked in on my birthday but was not recognized by the hotel, not even a greetings from the front office agent after seeing my id. It is well understood as I was not paying any rack or corporate rate but this can tell a difference from a truly luxury hotel. Guest room and bathroom is indeed spacious and fully functional. TV is huge and user friendly tablet is available to control lighting, curtain etc. There are 6 built-in usb plugs which are adequate to recharge my gear. Golden color amenities and decoration are used extensively in guest room and public areas, such as comb, tooth brush, razor, tissue box, speakers, carpet, which are too much IMO. Will I come back then?",30
"Our family go Macau to see water dancing show and stayed in Wynn Palace hotel. The feel of this hotel is super grand really like a  Palace. This hotel is very comfortable and clean. All those staff are very nice. And their facilities are high end. Feels very interesting that the minibar setting, once you take out the items from the cabinet and it will auto count the item to the room billing. The bathroom is very large and the living room so big. Our family is enjoyable for the room. And it is very convenience to go there from the ferry pier as they provide the free shuttle to many place.",50
"We stayed here for two nights with our main aim to spend time in the casino. The Wynn Palace is aptly named as the whole place is palatial. They have beautiful floral displays throughout which gives the hotel the wow factor. All the staff were polite, helpful and welcoming. Our room was amazing and I would definitely recommend booking a fountain view room, we could have watched the display all day! I wont list the amenities in the room as it would take too long however the towels were plentiful and fluffy, also the toiletries were delightful. We had a smoking room and we're reluctant to book this as they can smell stale, not in the Wynn though it smelt fresh throughout. I wont compare the casino to Vegas as it's not the same, it has a much more serious feel to it for example‚Ä¶",50
The Hotel is a warm place for family.  They have several attractions that the whole family would enjoy.    I like their show which is every 30 minutes. They offer free transport to and from the city.  I like the courteous staffs.,40
An place to remember. We booked a lake view suite with outstanding view interior and luxury what comes with it. The water dance in the lake is outstanding what we spent half of the evening sitting in the room enjoying it. Good choices of Chinese restaurants and  reasonably priced buffet. The stay was memorising enjoyed every bit of it and won a lot of money. You have to visit stay for few nights you definitely won't regret it.,50
"Even for Macau's opulent and over the top standard, Wynn Palace stands out as an overachiever. The room size were huge and ordained with the very best (and very gold!). The size of the TV was the first thing that shocked me along with three very unnecessary tablets for controlling nothing more than temperature, lights and curtains. Every details were thought of and the room really was 6 stars worthy. The deco in the lobby was probably a little ostentatious but I guess if you're trying to attract new money from China, it's got to be done. There was a lot of gold, everywhere and everything was really big. The choices of restaurants from the very casual to Michelin star level choices were decent. The cable car that goes around the fountain and front of the hotel looks amazing‚Ä¶",50
"This hotel was not that crowded and all steps were so frendly. Water show was great, also the sky cap made me feel very special. Room size was much more large rhan other high end hotels, beding was exellent too. But pool size was a bit small, but not enough steps were waiting.  Over it was all very nice and good staying.",50
The room was good size.  Turndown service at night but no mint.  TV inside the mirror in the bathroom was nice.  Heated toilet seat.  Opened in August 2016 so everything is still fairly new.  Casino floor was large with lots of Baccarat tables.  Most of the table minimums were HK$500 to HK$1000.  Only 2 tables of Texas Holdem.  Plenty of shuttles to the pier and Wynn Macau.   A good experience overall.,50
excellent service and very attentive staff.  Room was beautiful and relatively cheap for what it was.  The casino is pretty small but I would almost prefer that. Less people wandering around. Lots of great shops too.,50
What a fabulous getaway. The standard room was huge and the interior design and finishes amazing. Service from all staff was 6 Star! We ate at Fortuna for dinner and breakfast and the quality and variety of food was really good. Can't wait to go back and try some of the other restaurants. Thanks Wynn Palace for an amazing weekend getaway.,50
"Wynn Palace is very clean, nice and  impressive.  My baby likes many flowers..and I also like the fact that it has a very mild fragrance.  I hope staying your hotel once again.   It was most kind of you to meet my family.",50
"New hotel and room is in my Favourite turquoise Color. There's complimentary cable car for hotel guests but concerige staff did not hand it out during check in and expect us to ask around before giving it like we are free loaders (gave 2 pairs instead of one) which kind of offended me and is one thing that should be improved. Otherwise, staff are very nice and helpful :) Hotel is big and clean :)",40
Beautiful hotel and casino! We didn't stay at the hotel so stop reading if you want details on rooms. Gambling and eating at the Fontana Cafe was our plan. Be aware that several restaurants are located within the casino area and therefore are off limits to anyone under 21. That leaves only 3 restaurants available to families.    If you don't stay at the hotel the skycab ride is 100hong Kong dollar. It's a pretty short ride but the water display with accompanying music was really beautiful and you can loop around as much as you like. It's a good activity if you have kids you need to entertain while the grownups  gamble.   Shopping could also be a great pastime as they have all of the high end shops many love.   The floral displays and art pieces are worth enjoying too. We‚Ä¶,40
We have enjoyed our stay. The hotel service is excellent and the room is grand and super clean. The housekeeping team do an excellent job. They keep your room clean the whole day and will set your room to relaxing environment at night by adjusting the music and lighting. Good job!,50
"Customer service is impeccable! If you playing poker stay at Venetian otherwise the most comfortable 5 star experience is here! The staff are incredibly attentive, everything is fresh and new as it's just been recently completed so get in while it's fresh !",50
"Everything was great and perfect. Loved everything about this hotel including room condition, staff, food, skycab, location, etc. We will definitely recommend this place to everyone who's going to Macau in the future.",40
"As expected, s huge and luxury hotel. It is indeed a Palace. The cable car is just amazing but rather short. We were given 4 tickets so we rode in daylight and one in night time.  Do not expect personal service as this is a big hotel. We went around searching for their display artwork and it's fun. Done of them were placed inside their restaurant and you need to go inside and see them.  The heated if outdoor, the gym is relatively small but well equipped.  The display of food for breakfast is just unbelievable.",50
"The facility is modern, well designed and decorated with class.  English-proficient staff is everywhere including the buffet restaurant and the concierge, front desk, who were pleasant, helpful, and made me feel welcome and important.  Good job Everyone!",50
"The room is excellent, and the amenities that come with it. The staff are very courteous and provides information even before you ask about it. The transportation hub is very organized and even provides a service straight to Macau Central. ",50
"The hotel is very comfortable and clean, overall of the staying experience is great. Just the air purifier at lobby and common area was too strong smell and make us uncomfortable after inhale for awhile.Have not try the restaurant there because of the limited selection for the vegetarian menu. however did try the red 8 restaurant as they provided vegetarian option. Quite disappointed with the food that they provided for vegetarian, I had ordered vegetarian noddles and the source that makes from starch or corn do not cook well and it was too thick and like a glue with lumps on it. Very disappointed.",40
Excellent rooms with great view  Overall feel is good and with cable car rides  Location is good as well  Restaurants though could be better  Aircon could also be colder as well   Other than that the hotel is highly recommended and will go again,50
Overall stay was excellent but the price a bit high. But the massage room is an extra cause most people will not utilise it . The layout was a bit confusing initially but will be ok once u get use to it .,50
"Every detail you see in this hotel spells Luxury! We have stayed in  number of different hotel suites around Cotai and I must say, Wynn Palace is one of the best! True to its name, you'll surely feel like a Queen in this Palace.",50
"We stayed here for two nights and wished we could stay longer in Macau.  The complimentary skycap offers a unique experience over  dancing water fountain. For us, the dancing water show here is better than the Bellagio's in Las Vegas.  The outdoor pool is gorgeous.  The gym is clean and well-equipped.  The moment you step into your room, you won't want to leave: the color scheme is bright and inviting, floor to ceiling window,  king-sized bed with luxurious bedding and pillows.  Everything was meticulously detailed with 5-star amenities: tea set, tea kettle, champagne flutes, gourmet tea and coffee.    Bathroom is spacious with TV built-in mirror,  high-end soap and shampoo, conditioner, body lotion.  Everything provided spelled "" luxury"" even down to toilet tissue.  The Wynn‚Ä¶",50
"My friends and I enjoyed our visit to Macau in December 2014 so much that we decided to hold our joint birthday celebrations there. Wynn Palace was our first and only choice. It is relatively new, but, what got us sold on it is that it is a bright and HAPPY place!",50
"Hands down, the best and THE most luxurious hotel I have ever stayed at yet!!! Right from the moment you enter the hotel, the ambiance dazzles you!! everything is done to the utmost perfection! The staff is extremely polite and very helpful, they make you feel like you are the only important people there, the casino was more like a carnival! everybody seemed to have a really good time. the security guards (mostly Nepalese) smile at you everytime you  pass them, the decor is simply brilliant, the room.. actually more like an apartment! is spacious and luxurious to another level!! everything at the hotel oozes class!!   The only thing that the hotel didnt really meet my wife's and my expectation was the scarcity of veg friendly cuisine. With the world being slowly aware of the‚Ä¶",40
"All is good except for the location which is far from the other shopping and casinos. Should have more variety of food selection. More entertainment for families with kids. Stay is good, new and clean.",50
"Room is spacious and comfortable. There's wide choice of restaurant but the price is a bit expensive. However, service is good and value for money. Sadly, the swimming pool is closed during my stay and so I haven't tried it. One of the drawback is the location of the hotel which is a bit inconvenient when compared to other major resort such as Galaxy and Venetian.",50
"This is by far the most luxurious and best hotel I have ever been! Stayed at the Parlor suite , everything's awesome and perfect. The room's huge and the bed's very comfy. There'r great choices of diners, tried the steak house, ramen place and the gelato place.  All in all, it's a 10/10 !",50
"I see your hotel is newly opened soon, just my friend's birthday, so we will set your hotel to come to Macao play, the first time to live in your hotel, really did not expect your hotel room service so beautiful so good, my friends and I all love very happy, this hotel there is the most special sightseeing cable car sit, sit at night is really beautiful night, but this came too much time to catch up, we only stayed one night. Originally wanted to go swimming pool, but just did not open the pool renovation. The next time we have a chance to come over and play.",50
"This is my 3rd time to stay in Wynn Palace.  First, I think I might have chance to upgrade my hotel to see the water show.  However, the room faced to water show is full so I choose the room faced to the airport.  Also Chines New year, so the rooms are fully booked last week.  At first, my original plan was to have dim sum at Wing Lei Palace.  However, the server told me I needed to wait 1 hour.  I was so hungry as I arrived Wynn Palace at 1pm so I tried my luck to check in earlier.  Luckily, I can check in earlier and go down Wing Lei Palace to enjoy dim sum.  This flexible check in service impresses me because many hotels insist to wait check-in time at 3pm.    The washroom inside the restroom is so fabulous .  Two green chairs with beautiful chandelier.  It wows me and even‚Ä¶",40

"5 min from airport, friendly staff, room condition was really marvelous, best breakfast buffet (cafe fontana) ever! I enjoyed every moment during my stay, even starbucks was fabulous! Super recommend!!",50
"My wife and I stayed here for one night to take a break for our anniversary.   The entire experience was a luxurious pleasure from beginning to end. Every member of staff was very helpful, anticipating of needs and possesses strong communication skills.   Within a day, we had explored the city using the hotel's shuttle bus service, eaten an amazing steak dinner at SW Steak House, eaten a delicious breakfast in bed, watched the impressive fountain display from our room and as an added bonus took a ride on the resort's SkyCab.  The room was huge, perfectly clean, and had the most modern of appliances and technology. Decor was very pleasant.   The hotel and resort itself is huge! It would be easy to get lost but thankfully there is always a pleasant member of staff within eyesight‚Ä¶",50

Immaculate spacious lavish bedroom and bathroom , Great choice of restaurants to dine ,beautiful scenic gondola ride in the evening and top it all with an excellent management and top notch service by the entire wynn team right from bell desk to house keeping to everything else was more than perfect  Completely enjoyed our 3 nights stay at the executive suite ",50
"This is the most beautiful hotel I've stayed in! The performance lake was wonderful and it was great to be able to get free rides in the cable car above the performance lake.  The room we stayed in was very large, with a beautifully decorated bathroom with two sinks which was fantastic. Being a new hotel, everything could be controlled by the iPad so it was great that the room was so technologically advanced. There was more than enough space to simply relax on our holiday.   We went to the pool pretty much everyday and the staff were so friendly there. The pool area was lovely and you could see the performance lake from there too.  The Molton Brown bathroom products were a great plus too!  I would definitely stay here again if I come back to Macau soon!",50
We were on the 20th floor deluxe guest room facing the Cable Car railway and Performance Lake. Outdoor view look and guest room facilities were excellent. We enjoyed delicious foods at nearby restaurants and shopping at the Hotel Shopping Mall.,50

Wynn did not mess up my request and big thank you to Mr. Harris Dad! Great guy and very talkative.  Check in was smooth and was greeted by Harris at the lobby, the room was amazing ! we have a view facing the garden side and it was great for us, because I like peaceful and green thing. Room is huge comparing to Hong Kong!! But you gonna know the reason in between when comparing two cities. Bed is comfortable, bathroom is clean and all amenities were fully prepared. We had couple friends visiting us and we ordered few wine glasses, it took about 5 mins and a server showed up and offered assistance to open the wine bottle, great‚Ä¶",50
"Wynn Palace Macau is as grand as Wynn Las Vegas, which we stayed in 2013.  The service is very good, especially staff at housekeeping, bell-desk and poolside. They are even more enthusiastic than the supervisor/manager at the front desk. I can feel that they are really proud to be working at Wynn.  Security guards, who wear red jackets, are not polite. Staff at the reception of Chinese restaurant, Wing Lei Palace, are generally unfriendly.  Overall, it is still a great hotel.",50
"It's very nice to stay with wynn palace have a wonderful experience, from guest room to entertainment everything is perfect,will suggest everyone to visit wynn once..specially rooms with special designs. It's been great experience to stay here",50
"Came to Macau for a day, and spent the afternoon at the Wynn Palace casino- it was great! The interior is beautiful, the staff were friendly, and the atmosphere was welcoming. We aren't big gamblers, but found the roulette and baccarat games a lot of fun. This is definitely a step up from some of the stuffy, run down casinos on the main Macau strip. Would come back here again! ",50
"This is a real Palace feel hotel, it has cable car access to the hotel. The fountain show is very pretty and nice. The hotel lobby and corridor are so grand. The decoration is like living in the Palace. The swimming pool was not open when i was there on December. It is really a top grade hotel. The rooms are massive and luxury with nice fountain view.",40
"Booked a King Suite and the room was beautiful and clean.  The hotel seemed quiet and the service was amazing in the Wing Lei Bar.  The check in seeming to take a lot of time for all guests, including me.  The men's spa was gorgeous and the staff was professional and efficient.    I have always enjoyed staying at all of the Wynn properties and this one is no exception!",50
fairy tale....  nice to experience once in a lifetime...super lux room s...from the bathroom to the bedroom...high tech..in the room.all is controlled by a digital tablet..if you dont like the music they play in the common areas you are in trouble....haute couture shops stay open till late at night...Fontana restaurant offers an excellent lunch buffet at a very reasonable price..gym is big enough but not exceptional...complimentary shuttle buses to and from the airport is a plus...,50
"Just after midnight the room above us was probably using the spa pool, so we heard some mechanical noises for about 30minutes which was a bit frustrating. Overall, very nice new rooms, clean and spacious. Great audio system even in the shower area. Special arrangements for our wedding anniversary was done well. Only criticism: after 11am checkout no breakfast options anywhere onsite.",40
"Grand, opulent, over-the-top in a fun way. The upgraded room to a king suite is amazing! And the service is top-notch. We had dinner at the Wing Lei Palace, and views of the fountain show were great everywhere in the restaurant (which was also beautiful). The food was also incredible.  A Win Wynn all around. ",50
"The rooms are great but would cater towards adult entertainment. Families with kids who looks for children entertainment might not be suitable. Rooms are great and clean. Most staff are friendly except for some who are not very tactful in their communications. Reception and porters are good. They made an effort which is good to know. Gaming experience - absolutely terrible attitude of croupiers in the casino. They don't smile and get irritated even with the changing of chips.They speak ill of customers as i'm fluent in cantonese and understand every sarcasm said. They reply you with irritated look, a slight delay in your collection of winnings resulted in a death stare. Standards vary between croupiers.",40
"Everything was outstanding. The only comment i have is the lack of english speaking individuals. It's a hastle to get some information or help around. Other than that, everything was exceptionally amazing. We even got a free upgrade to a HUGE suite. Out of this world experience.",40
Room is very spacious and clean. Complimentary tea and coffee were really taste. Staffs are very helpful. Fountain show is wonderful and unlimited sktcap service also great. I want to stay here again with my family.,50
"We were pleased with the room and service in the hotel.  Just some suggestions in our mind.  Firstly, the check-in process, I thought the date (Thursday) we checked in is not the peak season and hours, but the check-in lobby just like chaos when we got there. It is better do something to manage the lines to check in.  Secondly, it is better to simple the way to check-out, such as, phone check out, TV check out, and email the invoice to the customers.  Thirdly, about the shuttle bus service, it is possible to create maps to show customers the accurate locations to find the shuttle bus stations.  Lastly, pay more attention to the minor service. For detail, please look at the photo I posted below.  ",50
"Room size are amazing !!!! Walk in closet , 85inch TV..a smart panel to control lights and curtain ... wow.. spent some time for in-room adventure  Decorations are very detail!  Bed is so comfortable for sleeping ~ ",50
"This hotel is the fastest one to get to from the Airport, which is nice.  Take the resort bus, it's free.   The rooms are amazing.   I'm a blackjack player and I'm always happy to see that they usually have at least 4 tables open even when nobody is playing at them.  If you are used to Vegas, then you should know that the minimum bets here are much more than you would expect there.  In Vegas you can find $10usd and $25usd minimum tables, but here the minimum is $500hkd, which is around $75usd.  Also, as far as blackjack in Macau, the Wynn rules offer the best odds in the city.   So if you are a good blackjack player, you can expect your bankroll to last awhile so you can earn your comps.   Make sure the first thing you do is signup for their Red Card.

This was a fantastic place to stay. I didn't want for a thing and I couldn't fault a thing. The hotel wasn't in the main part of Macau but we had private cars so it was no problem to get to the old town simply. Food was great and the best breakfast I have seen in a hotel.,50
Stayed in the suite for a night and was wowed by the exceptional services. Room is massive and everything was very perfectly decorated. I also went to eat the Wynn's steak house during my stay.  Food was exceptional and was delighted to see the laser show at the restaurant.  Definitely recommend to upgrade to a suite. Wynn Palace is one of the best hotels that I have ever stayed!,50

"A high-class luxurious hotel newly opened in Cotai, Macau, China.  The building is impressively decorative like a palace.  Spacious room, large television, quite and pleasant environment, with quality body care tools and facilities.  The staff are hospitable and pleasant.  Very good for holiday travel, slow living and enjoying life. But you have to be patient with the room cleaning service and guest service which takes several hours to complete.  May be I had come on a busy Sunday. Anyway if you stay in this hotel, don't miss to have a free travel on tram surrounding the lake to see the splendid fountain performance.",40
"Stayed only night.  This hotel reminds me of Bellagio in Las Vegas.  Music fountain lake, flowers (not sure if all fresh) and antiques everywhere.  Room was clean, spacious and nice.  One of the most luxury hotels in Macau.  Buffet breakfast was not impressed.  Dinner at Wynn Palace Chinese restaurant was super with a great view of music fountain lake.   Not a quite hotel however.   Difficult to get taxi in Macau is well known.   Shuttle bus between Pier and Hotel and also other locations.   Limo available but more expensive for advance booking.  By itself not well connected to other hotels/attractions except by cable car (not free of charge) or shuttle bus or taxi.  Now a bargain due to recent opening.",50
"Its the little things that can make a hotel stay memorable for all the wrong reasons.  Yes it is a well appointed hotel casino with all the glitz and glam that Mr Wynn brings to all his establishments.  My only issues were check-in guy kept telling me that i couldn't get Skycab access even though I was a Wynn-Insider member, had to ask another staff member the next day who fixed things up immediately.  No turn down service on the first night. Training issue it seems.  Put the 'Clean My Room' Light on at 8 am, no one came till I called after 2 pm.  Once the cleaner arrived, keeps the door open and other guests wandered in and out of my room to ask for additional items from her.  Luckily I was in there and I could observe where they went, but still an oversight of security in my‚Ä¶",30
"By any means this is an impressive newly built hotel, offering a outdoor pool area, a fountain similar to the bellagio in vegas including a cable car around the site. The rooms are very spacious and well equipped, technic freaks will love to play around with the room's ipad remote control, others will fancy the golden appliances or the tv built into the bathroom mirror. We had a great breakfast buffet and had good meals at the pool restaurant, service was always very polite and kind. If anything, the shops in the hotel are nowhere near to affordable but only sell premium luxury brands which really is a pity if your staying at the hotel for a couple of days In this case (assuming your not a hardcore gambler) I would recommend the venetian or parisian hotel or even a hotel near‚Ä¶",40

Visited most hotels in Macau but Wynn Palace is class apart. The cable car, musical fountain adds a cheery on the cake. Would recommend this for any family and couple vacation. Go for it to experience the best of comfort.",50
great room service prompt cleaning day and night lively casinos convenient designer shopping walking distance to other malls and hotels great views no complaints! wish price was a tad bit lower but all worth it!,50
I think it is the best hotel. I visited for my family trip my family members very like the room very lovely and clean  There is an amazing pountain show it is very impressed   and very beautiful i really want to visit there agian  Thank you!!!,50

The fountain view suites are great, my family enjoyed every single experience at Wynn Palace; the restaurants are immaculate and the service was devine. We will definitely recommend to all our friends and will return for sure.",50
Nice view and room condition. Clean and well organized. Fantastic fountain show. Perfect restaurant. Thank you for Cake for my elder sister birthday party.  Ihope visiting Wynn palace again as soon as possible.,50
I reserved fountain suite but the window was very dirty and the view was spoiled... I looked forward to it so very disappointed. The people at the hotel were very helpful and courteous so the service itself was great.,40
excellent place to stay in for the weekend. it's accessible if you want to go to city of dreams. it is a bit of a walk to the cotai strip itself but we liked its distance from it though. it seems less crowded inside the casino. our room package included a breakfast buffet which was pretty good.,50
I was really happy at the hotel Especially watching the fountain show in the hotel room This is the most impressive. If my acquaintances go to Macau I will strongly recommend. The gold hotel room felt like it was in a golden house.,50
"We were treated like royalty from the time we arrived until the time we left. We have stayed at fine hotels all around the world but nothing matches Wynn Palace.  Thanks to all staff for making this trip one we will always remember.  Everything was first class and, without doubt, we will always stay at Wynn when visiting Macau.  Cannot praise the hotel and staff enough in this short review.",50
Excellent service with great amenities and spacious rooms. Decor of the hotel is excellent. The fountain show is a great attraction. Free bus shuttle to city and other places is an plus point. The staff is very friendly.,50
"We stayed for 2 nights in Macau at the Wynn Palace. It's a beautiful hotel, modern but also extremely charming and inviting. There were decorations being put up for the Chinese new year which were also quite charming. Every little detail seems to have been thought of, from the architecture to the incredible service (i.e: we were very surprised to have a knock on our door at 19:30 asking us if we wanted our bedding and lighting to be prepared and arranged before we went to sleep - YES!!! ;) We were absolutely blown away by the service and the amenities offered. The staff was always very helpful. I strongly suggest registering for the Wynn insider program : free and you obtain minimum 15% off the room. We also had free breakfast at the buffet, which by itself is pretty much a deal‚Ä¶",50
"Stayed for 2 nights from 10 to 12 Jan 2017. Check in was smooth and easy, front office staff were polite. Room is big about 68 sq m. There was a mix up in their communication as the maintenance staff came knocking twice, to repair a non existence faulty light and housekeeping did not replace the toilet rolls. A plus is the warm toilet seat especially in winter. Check out was smooth, and overall a good experience.",40
My wife was pleased that it was a very nice room. I think that it will become more wonderful if these improvements are made. It's not easy to access  for sightseeing in Macao. There wasn't a staff who can speak Japanese.,50
"It was great  stay for  my family My room  type  was upgraded for  fountain view. It's view  was great and  skycap was also great. Room condition  was  very  clean  and  amenaty also  was  good because of kids amenaty.  If I visit again Maca, I choose again WYNN PALACE.",50
"We came to enjoy a night at the casino, and stayed in your wonderful spacious rooms. Everything was delightful and great, starting from checking in, taking by surprise by the awe inspiring decorations and wonderland themes, wonderful ! The place was so relaxing, the shops window were wonderfully designed and the artifacts on exhibition in the corridors were exquisitively chosen by the Wynn Family. The food after gambling was good and the breakfast the next morning a real treat. Shuttlebuses were available to go everywhere you wanted,and the helpful staff were always available, even at the places of destinations we wanted to go !! A great experience ! Thanks.",50
Thank for your service It was really nice experience I was with my family and they also liked The most impressive one was b&o speaker! It sound terrific My little sisters liked free cable car too Thank you again guys,50
"I have stayed in many hotels in Macau. Wynn palace is a new hotel which decoration is especially beautiful and with unique style. While everything appear beautiful, however it's disappointing the swimming pool is closed. But I can't find a notice of this on the website.",40
"We stayed two nights with our teenage girl in a ""simple"" room with two queens bed. It was so spacious and everything well organized. One could use the toilet in a closed ""room"" while the other two do the teeth brushing or shower taking in the same wash room of the Room simultaneously. Free excellent wi-fi ,usb charging facilities, blue tooth speaker, one button lighting, alarm, window drape ...controls of the room... Dining options abundant : from very fine dining to very casual ones. After all, you might feel that they charge a bit more expensive than other five star hotels. In addition. the ""floor"" of the shower area was a bit slippery when wet, so just be careful. Moreover, more exciting games / amusement options needed to be found in the area by taking free shuttle buses‚Ä¶",50
"This is the first time my wife and I stay in Wynn Palace. After we got married on the 06-Jan-2017, we decided to go to Macau that evening. Our choice is between Wynn Palace or Parisian, at the end we chose Wynn Palace, and I am glad that we did. First of all, thanks to the person who checked us in, Eric. After he noted we only just got married, he went to the second person I wanted to thank, Victoria. Eric asked if he could upgrade our room to a higher level room and Victoria approved his decision without second thought. Nevertheless, Eric provided a late check out for us without asking, which I think is very considerate, as we can enjoy the room until the last minute. Eric also asked the third person I needed to thanks, Bela. Eric asked Bela to show us the map as Wynn Palace is‚Ä¶",50
"This hotel is so grand and beautiful outside and inside.  The lobby has beautiful flowers and floral 'hot air' balloons it's such a pretty sight!  The hotel staff are very well trained and can speak English well.  Except for the inflexible and unhelpful staff from the Red Lantern noodle restaurant, all other staff here are great and nice!  The only problem was it was a bit difficult to cross the busy road from my hotel at Hard Rock to go to Wynn Palace.  There is no bridge link or traffic light to help us get across.  Be careful when crossing the busy road as the cars and taxis drive very fast here.  Overall, it's a great experience and it's the most beautiful nice hotel and casino I've ever visited in Macau! it's a MUST GO place!!!",50
"it wasnt just rumor! it's real!  one of the best hotels i've ever visited. service was good. enough bottles of water in the room. Nice lake show and the skycab-awesome!!! the room was so clear, easy, convenient",50
"Second stay with fountain view room booked. Good if you have time to watch the show at night. However, not sure if music of the show can be heard in the room. The area around the bath tub not clean properly, have something like plastic stick there. The fridge cannot be closed properly after open. Otherwise, everything are ok.",40
Almost of amenities were the best of my experience before. It really impressed me that their service was very good and nice. Thank you for making good memories in Macau. I hope to visit there again soon.,50
"We stayed here for a few days over the New Year and found the hotel luxurious. We had an upgrade to our room choice and ended up with a huge suite with very large bedroom and living room - very spacious and comfortable. Bathroom, dressing room, spa room, bedroom and living room with floor to ceiling windows overlooking the performance lake so we had great views of the fountain shows.  We enjoyed walking round the corridors and window shopping and had a very enjoyable, and mildly profitable session in the casino. We also enjoyed the show in the south foyer as the ""egg"" rotated and opened up so a bird could appear and ruse up from inside.  We tried a. number of the restaurants en-site including SW for brilliant steaks, Fontana for its buffets, Sweets for its ice cream, and the‚Ä¶",40
Like all the new casino hotels in Macau this one stacks up well. The rooms are huge and stacked with every mod-con you can think of. The decor is so gaudy and over the top it actually works. The pool was shut for refurb when we were there and the gym for the size of the hotel is disappointing although it was quiet. Buffet was ok although the deserts were spectacular and excellent by anyone's standards,40
"The room was beautifully decorated, food was fantastic & I thoroughly enjoyed the choice of music being played throughout the hotels corridoors!  I will definitely be staying at Wynn Palace again if I can get as good a rate as I did on this trip! üòÅ",50
"Being a regular to Macau, I have stayed at all the luxury hotels on the Cotai Strip. Wynn Palace is by far the most opulent. What sets these luxurious hotels apart from the rest, is the customer service.  This is my 4th stay at Wynn Palace, and I have only had positive experiences until now. The property, room, decorations, all elements of the hard products are simply breathtaking. Steve Wynn did an exceptional job designing this hotel.   However, the soft product, or customer service aspect, needs to be retrained and improved. Upon checkout of my recent stay on January 7th, I proceeded to the Registration. I gave my room number and key to the registration agent. She looked up my room and said ""Oh you have ordered a movie in your room last night. The charge will be 135 MOP.‚Ä¶",20
It should be informed that the swimming pool was under construction. My family was very disappointed. My wife also was very disappointed.  But This trip was very good except for that swimming pool.  Good facilities!,40
"The room was very wide, clean and nice. But the location is a little bit far from cotai central.  Regrettably, I stayed here when the swimming pool was under construction.   Anyway, the Gondola gives us good experience!",40
"I stayed a night at Wynn Palace during the weekend to enjoy the Thriller show in November 2016. I chose this hotel as the property was newly opened in 2016 and it was close to the Cotai strip. I can walk to Parisian Hotel and Venetian Hotel to watch the show and redeem my ferry ticket respectively.   As I joined the Wynn Insider program, I enjoyed 15% off in room rate and got unlimited complimentary SkyCab admission   I arrived the hotel at 4pm. The check-in was smooth and fast. Though I booked an executive suite. I got upgraded to the parlor suite. I was very glad and surprised by the kind offer.   When I was on the way to my room, I got fascinated with the floral art theme inside the hotel. I enjoyed the tulips most. When I walked around the hotel, I found the hotel was grand‚Ä¶",50
Not into this stuff but this was  best. Number of good attractions - dancing water every 15 min out front/ dragon and tree show every 30 min on the half hour (both shows in same place but rotated) . Overall a nice place.,50
"They must have studied the liking of Chinese. The property uses a lot of red and yellow colour for decorations. Lots of art pieces that make your eyes wide open. I like it as it creates a joyful atmosphere. But when I saw the golden toothbrush and comb in the bathroom, I had to say it's a bit over.   Spacious room, grand, huge TV.   Outside there are gondolas that go around the lake. Suggest to ride it at night, it will be great to watch the fountain show by then.   Overall I satisfy with the hotel property and services.  Check in was speedy and a bellboy awaiting to help with our luggage.  Breakfast was great as well and I would say it's a must if you'd stay there.   If you're not going to have fine dining there, you may go into the casino, the restaurants inside provide good‚Ä¶",50
"I got the suite room overlooking their lake and with amazing views especially at night.  Check in was slow and messy as their reception room was crowded with a lot of people. I had two negatives with them and both involves the refrigerator and the drinks inside. I found a half drank Heineken inside and couldn't believe that wasn't checked when the room was being cleaned out. They changed and fix that with no problems though. 2nd problem was during check out, they thought a Red Bull was drank but it was never touched! They were kind about it though but I think their sensor fridge need some fixing. The room and everything with is was comfortable and location was very near to other high end hotels. Inside the hotel, there weren't much things to do and limited stores and‚Ä¶",30
Overall this place is very nice to stay while in Macau. We had an awesome time and the staff was super friendly. However not everyone speaks english at the Wynn. Unfortunately the poker tables are not frequently opened so you have to be lucky to get a seat or wait some time.,50
"This is an amazing property.  It is so beautiful and the attention to every detail is just sensational.  From the moment we set foot on the property it felt like we were somewhere special.  The staff were all helpful and did their utmost to have us checked-in and in our rooms as quickly as possible.  The rooms were simply stunning.  We had a Fountain View Suite, which (as the name suggests) looks over the lake where the fountains dance and put on a water, sound & light show every 30 minutes, which is just as good to see from your room.  The room was enormous, with separate lounge area, super comfortable beds and a very large bathroom, with beautiful amenities (including a tv that projects from inside the mirror).  There is a cable-car skyrail to view the fountain show - or just‚Ä¶",50
Went to Wynn Palace to see what they have as the cable car and fountain attracted me. The casino is at the center of the whole building which is the same for the Coatai hotels. Hotel guests are having free ride of the cable car. Try it in the night will be nice. Most restaurants are located along the fountain to enjoy the show with their meal. They have two main flowers displays at two junctions. Now is having flower wheel and flowers balloons. Of course the outer ring surrounding the casino are the luxury shops and restaurants.,30
"To be honest, I arrived with no expectations because being also from the gaming industry, I know that service at these hotels will vary.  I also have to admit that I was somewhat doubtful when everyone was raving about how great Wynn's hotels are.  Well, after having stayed there a night, let's just say that it was a very enjoyable experience indeed!  First of all, the staffs were very helpful at check-in, from the bellboy to the check-in staff themselves.  Secondly, the room was definitely quite nice.  At first glance it might seem a bit bare, but Wynn is definitely all about the details without going over-the-top gaudy.  I'm quite impressed with the quality of the room and the thoughts that were put into it.  Now, I do find the bed a bit too soft in comparison to the beds at‚Ä¶",40
It was really nice to stay here and the staffs were nice and friendly. we tried the buffer Dinner there and was perfect. Will stay in Wynn Place again and recommend to friends. If can have some special price for the guest who stay here for ceremony (Like this time my husband birthday to stay but no discount) will be great.,50
"The stay at your hotel is generally very pleasant however, expecting a non-smoking room but with matches and ashtray inside the room.    My inlaws would love to try the pool but it was under maintenance.  They then wanted to try the cable car in the morning but was under maintenance.  That was a bit disappointing.",30
"The first thing one notices at Wynn Palace is the abundance of beautiful, fresh flowers. Lots of them. Before checkin, guests are greeted by a 12-foot flower-covered Faberg√© egg, with a phoenix inside that appears ever 15 minutes or so. Quite spectacular.  Our family of 4 had a NYE getaway at the newly-opened (August 22, 2016), 1700-room Wynn Palace in Macau. The checkin staff was polite, which helped - as few seemed to be able to get a room at checkin time. We ended up being given one of the two rooms we'd reserved, and then had to wait till 6 pm (=3 hours' wait) to be assigned another. Considering that we were there for just one night, it really was not so good a start. That said, we were thankful to the members of the staff, as we could see that they had tried their best. ‚Ä¶",40
"It was a pleasure to stay at this hotel, the staff was very friendly and everything looked marvelous. Nobody wanted to leave. This really is a palace. Even if you have to stay more time in the hotel(I have a baby) it is a fun and great place to stay. Everything was done to make us feel good.",50
"This was my second visit to this hotel as I like the sky cab and the fountain. I came with my family and they were unable to give us our rooms until 17:00. We had made our request for non-smoking rooms a few days before our arrival but the rooms were found with strong smell of cigarette. We ordered room service for breakfast in the next morning and was asked to pay cash despite of our room deposits. It took for about 15 minutes until he got permission from his superior before we could start our cold breakfast. The rooms were luxury  and the lake view were good, we also enjoyed the sky cab ride. However, good hardware should be supported by good software.",30
"It was holiday after ny2017. Expected and excited initially with staying at Wynn Palace, but disappointments set in as you step in to check-in.  Checking at 4:30pm ( 3pm check in time ) to be notified that there is no room yet available in the next hour. We urged and gave us a non-smoking that smells smoked.  We have to wait another hour to have another room arranged. We were kept waiting for that long with room service kept telling us that they will send someone to our room with new keys.  I was certain of the waiting time because we watched the fountain show for 3 times!!  Eventually got arranged a fresh room and went out around Taipa. We were amazed with other nearby hotels, and saddened with the fact that we are staying in this pseudo 5-star deluxe hotel!  Next disaster was‚Ä¶",10
"It was my first time to stay at this hotel and I have been staying at ther hotels in Macau many times.  Pros: 1. Room is very spacious and I enjoyed the fountain view very much! 2. Love the Molten Brown shower, and shampoo! 3. The bed is very comfortable and love using the tablet to contrl everything inside the room  Cons: 1. The staff who did the introduction to the room simply dun know where is the in-room dining menu. Anyway, I just called the in-room dining hotling and figured it out 2. No communication between the reservation agent and the check-in stuff. I stayed with my 14-month old baby and I have called the reservation agent that a baby crib must be available when I check in. The front desk guy said NO baby crib was available, which made me a heart attack. I was so mad‚Ä¶",40
"Excellent service, rooms are very comfortable and clean. Everything you see in the hotel is a work of art. Location is quite isolated and restaurant food and service is not so good.  Very disappointed with Misumi Japanese Restaurant where we had dinner with family, the service is bad",50
I sincerely hope that the restaurant staff and the dealers are kind and courteous.Also kindly explain the kind of explanation I would appreciate it if you could apply for a shuttle bus to the hotel late at night because the taxi fare was unkind and charged with exorbitant charges.,50
very good good hotel but what a boring place to stay in if you are not pure gambler  Only one very small quite bar No other entertainment at all very different with the real Wynn in Vegas full of lives miss all the nice bars in Wynn Las Vegas,50
"We took the fountain view room. It has the a lounge at the end of the bedroom. 3 tvs, 1 at bedroom, 1 at lounge and 1 in the bathtoom mirror. The bathroom has a bath, a shower, and a separate toilet. There's a small closet. The usb points are adequent for charging many device, And room comes with a USB connector cable. Becareful not to drink the Fiji water when there are lots of free Wynn water bottles. That toilet roll is so nice, soft and thick at the same time! About the view is good for the fountain show but you can't hear the music so it's not very spectacular. Doors can be shut in between rooms and you can technically watch 2 Tvs from bed. Hiwever the controls for the lounge tv are in the lounge unless you can use tge remote control.",50
"This trip is to celebrate my mother's birthday in Macau. Before the trip, I have sent email to the hotel mentioning the purpose of trip and the hotel kindly agree to arrange a complimentary cake for my mother. Eventually my mother discovered the chocolate cake in her room surprisingly.  However there is minor unhappy thing about  check-in. Since we all arrived at around 4pm,  there were too many people queuing up for check-in too. It implies the procedure is a bit slow. Then turn out there was only one room available for us at that moment but the other 2 rooms have not yet be ready. Finally we can get all our 3 rooms at around 8pm after dinner. Hence, the hotel agree to give us late check-out at 3 pm next day for compensation. We all then very satisfied with the hotel's service.‚Ä¶",50
"The first impression of the hotel was fragrance and flowers... then you are awed by the design and grandeur. Stayed in a suite and oh man it blows my mind out the second we step in. Space. Lighting. Design. Huge TV. Bathroom, Tub, Amenity. Everything was perfect.   Cons -  1) The shower room door allows water to seep through the gap with the floor.    2) The tub could suddenly turn on after you get in bed... and we learned it was a self-drying process. Nevertheless we were a little shocked by the noise in the middle of the night.",50
"The Wynn Palace only opened in the Summer so it was still fairly new when I visited at the end of November.  Consistent with the Wynn design esthetic, it is noticeably bright throughout and well decorated with art pieces and numerous floral arrangements.  The hotel, the shopping arcade, the casino are all lite much brighter than other hotels and arcades so even late at night walking around, you feel like you are in daylight.  Wynn Palace stresses flowers so it has a special floral presentation in each of its two small lobbies.  These change from time to time and while I was there, it was a mirrored Jack in the Box surrounded by flowers which pops open every 10 minutes or so to reveal a flower covered Jack and a Faberge like giant egg covered in closely embedded flowers that‚Ä¶",40
"Excellent Design, Functionality, great in-room Technology, Guest Service is A+ . The room was probably 150 square meters, so there was plenty of space to live in. Floor to Ceiling windows provided a great view to the fabulous fountains.  Bathroom was very well equipped with full shower and separate tub. Double vanity with excellent lighting included along with a great array of bathroom amenities. An in-room Massage facility is an over-the-top amenity.  Make a call to the spa to arrange the in-room massage. Its great to finish a massage and then find your way into the luxuriously comfortable bed, just a few steps away. Hallways leading to the guest rooms were exceptionally wide and and tall so that there was a feeling of spaciousness even before getting into the room.  All of the‚Ä¶",50

"Everything here is perfect. The food is great at red 8, wing lei, cafe Fontana. But it's hard to get reservations since the restaurants are quite small for the capacity of the hotel especially during lunch and dinner. We were able to get tables since we booked it way ahead of time. The easiest way to have dinner or lunch is at red 8 which serves one of the best Cantonese cuisine. But kids can't join us since it's inside the casino. So we end up taking out food from the restaurant and kids can eat at the room.   The rooms are spacious and nice with all the modern amenities like a tablet to control the drapes, lights, etc... it's also quite accessible considering it's a big hotel. My mom did't have a problem going to her room and the lobby to explore the hotel. There are two main‚Ä¶",40
"Have to at least stay once if u visit Macau. There's nth u can complain about. From the moment u step in till u leave the hotel the last day, u are well taken of.   Staff are friendly and helpful. The room is wonderful, the bed is so comfortable.   The only downside is the location. If wan to travel to attraction need to take transport but the provide shuttle bus.   I love my stay here.. will definitely come back to stay again on my next trip to Macau.",50
"We came after the Christmas holiday but still there are many visitors. The service at check-in was nice and upon entering the room we were quite surprised at how large the room is. Not only spacious, the hotel is very new and the control panel for lighting, TV, curtain, air-con and everything is on touch-screen, very high-tech indeed.  There is also a small room in ours which served as a private massage room, and we could arrange for therapist to come and do a private massage. But I guess this might not be very useful for most people.  Considering the room, the services and the complimentary shuttle services going to a lot of the main spots, the hotel is really of high value for money. On the day we also got tickets for the cable car ride which also offers a nice experience‚Ä¶",40
"Great hotel, rooms are very nice and spacious. We travel to Macau almost every other week and WP is always our first choice. A very special thanks to Mr. Alan Wong at front desk, very professional.  Keep up the good works !!",50
"Hotel condition is great and elegant. Rooms are very spacious and we have a good stay. However, we struggled to find the right restaurant (lunch/dinner) when travelling with a 2 years old. Almost all restaurants serve only above 5 while it is not likely to have seats available at the buffet restaurant (the only place for kids) for walk-in guests.",30
"The room is the biggest surprise to me, thanks to the nice front desk staff Mr. Szeto. It is HUGE (for 2 pax), high-tech and beautiful, especially the bathroom... I guess it's one of the suites they have. Totally amazed. There's a grand bathtub in the middle and every amenities that I'd need. Good water pressure in the standing shower. Comfy large bed. Can't imagine how gorgeous would a higher level room be like... lol  For the location, it is a bit far from the outer ferry terminal and the shuttle bus there was not quite enough for the no. of guests. I heard some people complaining - maybe more buses should be arranged.  We only tried one of their restaurants the other morning - 99 noodles, which is near to the casino. Food is quite nice and affordable.  Would love to come back‚Ä¶",40
"Super environment. Polite and friendly from all level of staff in hotel. Comfort stay ! I am travel to Macau every one to two weeks, first time stay in Wynn Palace and I rated best of the best in Macau so far. Keep up the good level of service.",50
The vacation was off to an execellent start the moment we stepped foot into the hotel. Convenient location to visit the places of interest. The staff's service at the hotel was execellent. Casino was great n we were well looked after. Good job !,50
"Good customer service, the receptionist and the ball boy did a good job in helping me to settle into the hotel. Very nice room and good amenities. However, the swimming pool seems to be quite small and lack of impact in comparison with other competing resorts nearby.",40
"Very nice hotel, tidy and clean.  Service is very good.  The skycab is very fun to see the view. The worst thing is the refreshment will be charged if remove for more than 60 seconds. We removed the drinks to put the kid's food in the refrigerator and found the notice on top of it and was shocked.  We have to call the front desk to help for reset and check. Hope is can improve.",50
Hotel is superb. Room is clean. Staff are friendly. Location not really good but there is shutter to transfer you to all location for free. Lots of dining area around the hotel. Shopping with lot of luxury branding. Everything is good.,50
"Since this was one of the newer ones, went with my mom to check the place out. They entice you to ride that ""flying gondola"" to enter for free and have a nice experience around the bellagio like like.    Interiors are great very very nice.  It really purposefully wants to entice you.  With anchor pieces at different corners.   Very small compare to Venetian or Galaxy  or Sands complex.  A simple square, its really for the mainland china gamblers clientele.  Tons of upper priced delicacies as well.   Beware: If you look Chinese well.. ..  I forgot there is no photo in the actual Casino, got distracted by this noodle place with a nice interior and took a shot. Then a guard starts screaming at you as if you are a piece of turd on the side walk and scream in mandarin to come over. ‚Ä¶",40
"The hotel was very grand with gorgeous decorations. Check-in was fast and staff were friendly and helpful.  We stayed there for two nights in a king-bed room. Room was very spacious with a large bathroom but there was no view from our room.  When we returned to our room after dinner at the first night of stay, we found two extra bottles of water and two small packed dessert on our bed side tables which was a nice surprise.  However, there was nothing for our second night of stay. Breakfast at Cafe Fontana was really great - choices of food, service and ambience. Location of hotel was quite isolated from the downtown.  All the shops in the shopping arcade were high-fashion and jewelry shops, there were no popular local souvenir shops.  We took the hotel shuttle bus to Taipa City‚Ä¶",40
"Good room service and excellent facilities. We can enjoy the dancing water show near by the hotel. I also enjoy the free ride of the cable car of the hotel. And, the customer service counter provided the professional service for us. I hope I can visit again the hotel in a short time.",50
Despite upgrading to the fountain suit one of the room with queen size bed was still filled with toxicating cigarette smell. The duty manager Rosanna was kind enough to upgrade us but we still got one room which is polluted with cigarette smell. New sleepers weren't provided on the second day of stay. Pool wasn't available which again is something the hotel should warned us when we do the booking.,50
Had a great time here... staff are friendly and can speak English. Definitely will come back and stay here again. Suite was spacious and elegant.  Would recommend this place to anyone heading over to Macau.,50
"The Wynn Palace is a fantastic hotel, like its sister hotel in Las Vegas it is highly sophisticated. Well trained and welcoming talents throughout the hotel, fine dining restaurants like the Steve Wynn steakhouse with 3D show and the amazing Andrea's Asian fine dining restaurant and others more. For us, the Wynn Palace is the best hotel in Macao Cotai. It also offers a fountain show similar to the Bellagio in Las Vegas and an awesome buffet restaurant La Fontana overlooking the fountains. Rooms are more spacious than the ones in Parisian or Venetian. Great shopping with all superbrands just next to the state of the art casino. Our first choice in Macao is the Wynn Palace.",50
"helpful and efficient of front line staff - Coco Mall environment is nice and special, smell good with loving atmosphere.  rooms for improvement: 1- i book 4 rooms by 2 seperate booking by different date thru travel web site. when i check in i ask the front line staff - Anthony that whether i need to check out and check in again on the second day. and he says i need to do so. so the next morning i need to spend almost 40mins for my 4 rooms. i think this can be improved as other hotel can take care too. 2- the cleaning of the room is poor. i find the stain on the coffee table when i check in but the next day i still find the stain there 3- the hair dryer is damage when i first use. i place it on the table and hope they will get it fixed. but the next morning i take it out again‚Ä¶",30

There is only one thing I would like to point out for future improvement. I checked in in the South lobby of the hotel. Upon arriving I immediately realised how small and how busy the lobby was. This would not have been a problem if the lobby was facilitated properly.   There were lots of people there yet I could not see any signs that instruct people where to line up and such. As a result, everyone ended up getting up to the counter in the front and from what I could see it was such a chaotic scene.   If the hotel could improve this situation it would be great and hopefully this would‚Ä¶",50

The performance, music, fountain, color from the Performance Pool was really impressive.  Very enjoyable to watch from cable car, from the pool side and even in the Cafe Fontana while having buffet dinner. The food served at dinner buffet was one of the best and high quality I had for some time.   Must try!",40
"Just post my review from google  Stayed here for one night in early Dec.  Got free upgraded to Fountain View King Suite at 18/F.  Room was big and clean, a bird eyes view from my room to the fountain. A complimentary round trip ticket for the gondola (not worth to pay a $100 to ride this but it is free if you get in from the fountain to the hotel)  Hotel staffs are super friendly and very helpful.  It is a truly 5 stars hotel, definitely will come back again.",50
"We had a very nice time at the Wynn  palace: beautiful flowers around the hotel, amazing fountains show, good service, very good breakfast,  only disappointed of the pool being closed and they didn t inform us.",40
We have booked 7 rooms and requested to stay at the same floor after we booked through the website. They are very helpful and arranged for us. The flowers arrangement in the hotel was so beautiful. The room was big and luxury. Food were good but expensive.,50
"Standard class guest room, sitting room, bathroom and spa room were bigger than other hotels in general. The room faced Performance Lake, swimming pool and Skycab. Great value for money !

Everything,really everything was perfect and left to chance! Also the best restaurants  for every taste!!!  Recommend to start your visit in Macau from this amazing place!!!",50
"Wynn Palace is really like stepping into Vegas with it's grand and luxurious design features.  Loved the Preston Bailey colorful flower displays as well as the overall floral theme running throughout the hotel.  Rooms are spacious and if you don't have a room overlooking the lake, I recommend the cable car ride over during the evening to enjoy the water fountain and light show.  Great experience and would definitely stay there again!",50
"One of the star attractions of this elegant and tastefully built 28-story hotel is the Mini Cable Car system that circumnavigate the other star attraction ‚Äì the Performance Lake (which is a replica of the LV Wynn's) - and goes around the perimeter of the building. Guests can take the cable car from its outer station to the lobby level for free, saving quite some legwork. But it would be a paid journey if one fancies taking the full tour.   The hotel is divided into the South Wing and the North Wing with two seperate lobbies so make sure you know which wing you are checking into or else it‚Äôs quite a walk from one to the other. A beautiful and huge mechanised floral display (currently a Faberge Egg that opens up periodically) adorns the lobby of each wing and is truly impressive‚Ä¶",50

"High service standards and beautiful decor, The room is large and comfortable. The beautiful musical fountain and the cable car experience is most  memorable. The staff at the registration and restaurant tried their best to accommodate our requests.",50
"Spent the last weekend in Macau and decided to check out Wynn Palace.  Overall experience was very good and by far the nicest hotel I have stayed in Macau.  Great value for money.  Service level was also higher than most hotels in Macau.  Everyone familiar with Macau knows that service levels can be varied even in most of the high end hotels.  The property was beautiful - loved the floral theme, the details in the very spacious rooms, the great shops, the cable car ride... and most of all the Fountain!  Really felt like it could be Vegas!  Highly recommend Wynn Palace and would recommend everyone to ride the cable car especially at night!  AND don't miss the fountain show!",50
A very nice & luxury hotel with a stunning fountain view that I have ever seen.  Received a free birthday cake on the date we check-in.  A little disappointment was no reply received from the restaurant regarding to the booking request made online.,50
It was a great stay. The staff were very helpful. Excellent service. Very convenient. The hotel was not too crowded and it was beautiful. Love the water fountain performances. The room and the view was superb.,50
"Hotel room condition was very good. It was a standard room, but it was upgraded deluxe room level of another hotel. Especially, the bathroom vanity was like the dresser of Hollywood actress. If you make a reservation for a hotel, make sure to make a reservation with the color of the room. It is so luxurious and fine.",40
"When I made this booking, I specifically stated that it was for my mom's birthday celebration.  When we arrived at the hotel, I was told that a birthday cake has been arranged, so we were all waiting till 2 am, but received nothing, my mom was disappointed.  Also I requested a room near the elevator as my mom can't walk very far, but we were given a room at the end of the corridor.  As a loyal customer at Wynn, I didn't expect this level of service.",30
Wow! Just WOW! This is one hell of a hotel.  So beautiful and really cool with its cable cars you can use to enter the hotel. We were lucky enough to get an upgrade and the room was absolutely amazing! Did not want to leave the room at all. Such an amazing experience visiting this hotel and we loved every minute!,50
You will not be disappointed! This hotel is amazing.. The rooms are stunning and have everything you could possibly need. Service impeccable and overall the guest experience is perfect. Room service food is really good and I honestly can't fault the place. I personally look forward to my next stay and would not stay anywhere else.. They have really upped the bar here. Other hotels in macau need to compare themselves to the wynn paiave.,50
"New wynn is amazingly beautiful, everything everywhere is perfectly designed, staff is very kind. Guest rooms are exceptionally beautiful and spacious . Overall it's a classy hotel and best in the town ",40
"Staff are so frienly, kind and helpful. Rooms are very clean and unique. Wynn Palace makes guests very comfortable and makes guests to stay more days.  I definitely will come again soon with friends and family",50
"Stayed in the last weekend for the Sunday run.  Never had stayed in the original Wynn on the Macau peninsula.  The promotional room rate was truly attractive making it irresistible.  The room is combined three separate rooms including the bathroom with golden colour amenities.  Generous supply of everything toiletries that should be in a luxury hotel.  The bedroom is in the middle with a firm mattress, fine linen and plush sleepers.  Opening the doors on the other side of the bedroom there is a separated living room with three seater sofa and armchairs, blue tooth music player and overlooking the Wynn signature fountain.  Two 60 inches flat screen TV and iPad control mood light epitomizes the enjoyment that you just won't think of wanting to leave the room.  The whole bedroom‚Ä¶",50
My stay at wynn Palace was Amazing. Everything is perfect there. From the lobby to the hotel room everything was awesome. I stay in many hotel before even luxury hotel in vegas but I can say it was my best h√¥tel experience. They even give me a free upgrade to the suite and also  a late check out. I Will definetely come back there again it totally worth it.,50
The room is very clean and confortable for sleep. The location is a little far from the other entertainment & hotels. The signboard is required to put more for access the gate and shuttle bus station etc.,50
I ordered a cheeseburger from the coffee shop. I waited 45 mins before it arrived. The chips were thin and oily. The bun was cold. The beef was lukewarm. It was the worst hamburger I tasted for a long time. Not to mention I was charged 230 dollars plus ten per cent device charge. But the buffet breakfast was very good. There should be a lot to improve for your a la cattle menu.,40
Everything in this hotel is just perfect. Luxury room with two huge TVs. King-size bed is very comfortable. Very nice view from the room. Definitely will book Wynn Palace when travelling to Macau next time.,50
Staff is nice and helpful. They can give us good advice how  to manage our holiday in Macau.  A good place for relax with family.  The restaurats in there are good.  Easy to walk nearby to visit different hotels and shopping mall.  The shuttle bus service is convinent. We can enjoy a good expereince to ride the cable car to enjoy the beautiful sight seeing.  Becasue we have the seniors the staff has upgraded our room with the lake view and easy for the seniors to take the lift. Our family sure we go t here again.,50
"We found out about Wynn Palace on our October 2016 visit when we got lost while looking for our hotel which is located at Macau Area. An elderly bell staff was so helpful so we thought of trying to stay in Wynn Palace. And we did ... without any disappointment.  The hotel is fascinating in all respects -- Our room was daintily furnished. The food was great. And, the quality of service by the staff was at its best !",50
"I spent one day with family. I liked the large room, the cable car, and the breakfast. The staff is very kind as well. It is true real destination for family and thr best quality new hotel in macau for now. Dinner at chinese restaurant was wonderful as well.",50
"Wonderful and worth the visit. Upholding the same branding, service, decor, and ambience as Wynn Las Vegas and Encore. Easily the best hotel in Macau at the moment. Only wish I could stay longer. Enough said.                                              ",50
"We stayed in the Fountain Suit and had a wonderful experience. Beautiful Fountain! The room is fantastic, clean and tidy. Many great restaurants in the hotel. Excellent and attentive service provided by hotel staffs. I would like to give a special thanks to Victoria (the front office manager) for making such a comfortable stay for us. She was very helpful, friendly and professional. She was there to assist us check in, help us to arrange car pick up and follow up our restaurant reservations.  I would recommend this hotel and will return again.",50
"The property is magnificant.  I prepared for walking from Entrance Gate East all the way to the North check-in counter, having brand name stores alongside the corridor.  The cable car ride is fantastic, over the water fountain.  Breakfast is good. Here I wiould suggest that choice of the mattress is vital when making the booking because it may be too soft for those aged.",50
"Let's get straight to it: The Wynn Palace surpassed our expectations!   For those who know Macau, you may know what I mean when I say that many of the hotels lack a certain fun, comfortable vibe. Wynn Palace has finally broken the stereotype! It is the closest to the Vegas feel we've seen in Macau thus far. People were having FUN on the gambling floor. The staff were friendly and knowledgeable, from the bellboy to the spa masseuses to the restaurant staff.  For reference, the hotel has been opened 3 months when we visited, and it was a random non-holiday weekend.  -- CHECK IN -- Done in a private enclave, away from the wider noise from the non-resident visitors to the hotel. The only true kerfuffle of the evening was that we were given a smoking room even tho we had asked for‚Ä¶",50
"I was staying in wynn palace to celebtrate my birthday,  choosing to stay in this newest hotel is the best decision made!   The wynn palace is well designed with a gigantic performance lake at the main entrance (quite similar to the setting in bellagio in vegas).  Inside,  there are different art pieces around the corner.    We are staying in the palace spa king suite and the size of the room is as big as venetian's.  Our room is facing Macau airport and Its a pity that i didnt realize the fountain suite that faces the performance lake.    One thing i would like to highlight is the service of the hotel,  this is definitely one of the best service i have had across the 5-star hotel.  Not only the concierge,  the staff in lobby and restaurants are well trained and service with a‚Ä¶",50
Everything is good except the breakfast place is too crowded and are not allowing booked guests to have a breakfast in the right place. Would you let booked guests to have breakfast in a separated place.,50

Wynn Palace is very close to the airport or ferry terminal. It was not that crowded. The room was very very clean. The spa had lots of menu. I think Wynn Palace is good for the persons who want calm and luxurious hotel.,50
"Everything is red / orange and gold, and it's bright everywhere. It's not everyone's taste but I like it, at least for a leisure trip in a casino resort. Room is specious and clean. Service is excellent, and buffet breakfast is great. I really like the bedside tablet that controls everything in the room, TV, curtain, lighting (in bedroom, foyer and bathroom), etc.  No need to look for the TV remote control.",50
"Decided to stay on the Cotai side and went with the Wynn. Upon arrival and a very crowded North Tower registration area, I was directed to the South Tower and was upgraded to an incredible suite on the 25th floor. The room was impeccable and had everything from a 72"" flat screen TV (1 of 3 in the room) to a jacuzzi bath tub. Impeccable service, great restaurants, and a overall wonderful experience.",50
Staffs speak minimal English. Found only one good speaker in concierge. It seems they think they will serve for Chinese guests only. Taxi stand staffs should know Macau better so that they can explain the location to the taxi driver. We had two bad experienced,50
"Traveling with my 7 months old can be very challenging, we didnt expect too much from this hotel from the beginning, but I was surprised with the level of services and thoughtfulnes the hotel staff has provided to my family.  Our family has a great time here, and I would recommend this hotel as a great getaway for family travel.   P.S. gotta try their chicken club sandwich and burger at the  Pool side cafe located at the 2nd floor.",40
"l loved that the room was pretty large with a king size bed. It was very clean and tidy. There was high quality of room facilities, complement and amenities. The environment was very quiet as I did not hear any disturbance while I was in the room.",50
It will be nice if buses will bring us to venitian for shopping and back. But the overall experience was fabulous. Room are very clean and nice. Front desk check in by Ms Bella is top notch. Casino was also fantastic,40
"I stayed a Wynn Palace for one evening in the Fountain Parlor Suite. We booked it as an anniversary staycation. Being a local, i know Macau very well and have watched all these Casinos and hotels develop over the last 10 years. My experience with staying at Wynn Palace was truly just that- an experience.   Check in was super smooth and many friendly and helpful staff were there to greet us and help us check in. Finding the room was painless and easy unlike some other properties where it can take 15 mins to actually get to your room from the lobby.   The room was huge. Its bigger than my apartment x4. It had a lounge room, huge bedroom, to toilets and a huge open bathroom with a chair ( ladies will love this) It had a private massage room which we sadly didn't use as we didn't‚Ä¶",50
"I stayed two nights from 23/11 to 25/11 with my wife to celebrate her birthday. We expected this brand new hotel would provide high end services. The front desk manager greeted us during our checkin which we appreciated. The standard room with said 68 sq.m which was spacious. However the room provided with very limited room amenities than I expected. There was no coffee maker, bath salts and/or bubbles powders. I made requests of bath salts from the guest services but with the answers that it was out of stock. But finally I knew that bath salts were only provided for suite room which I could not accepted. As I had same requests at Sheraton hotel, they provided the amenities to us without any hesitation. Furthermore the hotel official website should provide sufficient details‚Ä¶",30
"Comfortable room, tidy, excellent customer service, well logistics service.  impressive Skycab experience, nice and special decoration at ground floor shopping mall and casino.  Will enjoy Wynn Palace once again.",50
Will definitely return for future stays with family n friends. Best casino resort complex I've ever stayed. Much better in all aspects compared to other Wynn properties in Vegas n Macau. Hope Wynn Palace will strive to improve further.,50
nice room ( new hotel ) 2 times clean the room in a day good swimming pool  excellant casino good services  _  nice birthday cake good water show good buffet good price ( except weekend) near to airport ( 5 minutes  10 u$ ),50
Stay in the fountain suite to experience the most impressive fountain display.  The Faberge Egg musical display is a sight to behold.  Many good restaurants to choose from.  We particularly like the Wing Lei Palace.,50
Great rooms (very spacious and new) with a great vibe for shopping and walking around.  Main gripe I have with Wynn Palace is they were giving lots of vouchers to win free credit at the casino. So naturally my brother and I checked it out in hopes of some free gambling. Turns out you can't combine the free credit with other vouchers and there was a very high minimum for each bets (blackjack table was around 500 hkd) so it deters first time gamblers.   Location also wasn't the most convenient. The gondola ride around Wynn Palace was kinda cool though.,40
"When you go to Macau, STAY at the Wynn Palace...Pro: expect the best from Wynn.  I have always been impressed at the consistent service with all the Wynn properties.   Con: construction of the rail impedes travel around the area.",50
"I'm staying from 25-28 Nov 2016. Gave feedback on the first day on 2 to 3 occasions on the poor air conditioning. The Airconditioning temperature is set at 19 degree Celsius and the temperature remains high. Service staff, Peter, came and sounded defensive trying to manage us by saying and perhaps we need to take a shower or it will take a longer while. The fan speed was at auto and not high and the temperature was set at 20 and not 19 degree Celsius. At the highest fan speed, the aircon vent is not even blowing out cool air at all when I stand on the bench to feel the vent.   A very, very big disappointment. If service recovery is not done, it is the last time I am going to choose Wynn. There is no point apologizing if service recovery cannot even be carried out for a 3 night‚Ä¶",10

The rooms with all the hitech, the quality of the decor throughout is incredible. The restaurants are something to behold! This is the ultimate!",50
"1) Room is very good view with very big window.  2) House keeping service is good too.  3) Front desk - overall not very good as we expected. But not bad service. If this is not Wynn Palace, i already accepted.  4) Shuttle bus station to Cotai ferry is far from lobby. Quite hard for us to go there with  hand carry.",40
Checking in was a breeze. I was given a King Suite / Gold Theme room with a very nice fountain view on the 15th floor. The suite was huge but cosy. Everything I see & feel are of good quality. tastefully decorated in Gold even amenties came with a gold comb & shaver! Molton Brown toiletries are provided with a signature Wynn Cacao flavor. Everything in this suite is operated by a touchpad beside the bed & in the living room. Huge Flat screen TV adorn both the bedroom & Living room. Much efforts & details has been put into creating this suite. The room safe is so conveniently placed in a sliding drawer. Press & open & the door will flipped upside. U dont even need to bend down. Turn down bed service has reached a new comfort level. beside fresh thick slippers & water. The Mizumi‚Ä¶,50
"Wynn Palace is a hotel and casino which opened in August 2016. It's the first resort on the Cotai Strip and third skyscraper in Macau as Wynn Macau. It include 29 floors and a construction floor area of around 450,000 square meters. Wynn Palace feature a luxury hotel with 1,700 rooms, a casino, an 8-acre performance lake, cable car, pedestal gardens, meeting facilities, spa and salon, ten restaurants, and retail and dining venues. And Wynn Palace use the theme that is flower. In the mall, you can see something that is made by flowers like ferris wheel, Carousel. On the other hand, I have a suggestion that is taking the cable car combine the performance lake. You can choose the time that performance lake start and take the cable car. And enjoy the both feature of Wynn Macau.‚Ä¶",50
"Stayed at Wynn Palace for one night, and thus, want to stay for a whole week!  Very happy to have their kind upgrade to a King Fountain Suite. The suite is huge, it is 86 sq.meters (915 sq. feet), everything in the room is the best choice, even the slippers they provide is as soft as feather. My room does not include breakfast, we went and gonna have a try even though it cost MOP 220 per person (approx USD29) plus tax. It is quite expensive indeed. But if you are not very tight with your budget (who else would be tight in budget if s/he selects to stay at Wynn Palace, right?), I highly recommend you to try their breakfast.Not very crowdy, a lot of choices. Very delicious. And the skycab is good to see both in daytime and nighttime.",50
"Wynn Performing Lake is new place in Taipa. It attract many tourist to visit this place. There many brand store inside Wynn Performing Lake such as Chanel, Herm√®s, Cartier, Prada, Graff and Gucci. We can shopping very convenient. Also, there are many good restaurant inside Wynn Performing Lake such as Mizumi, SW Steakhouse and Hanami Ramen. I go Hanami Ramen to try ramen because I know that the chef of Hanami Ramen is very famous in Japan. I think that the soup of ramen is light but the ingredient is very good. Outside the Wynn Performing Lake, there is a pool, shows and music, it is the main reason that many tourist visit this place. However, I think that the transportation is not convenient.",40
Room is fantastic. New clean and very premium  Room Service was excellent and very fast given this is a very large hotel.  Best shopping experience will all the shops u need  On the improvement side....room is so big if they can make the bed bigger it will be more luxurious ,50
"You might have to prepare some cash if you order in-room dining. Because I was asked to pay in CASH or a Credit card without password.  And don't forget to check the minibar usage when you check-out. I was charged for almost 1000 HKD, which I did not even touched. (although it was adjusted, it was very unpleasant experience)",20
Our stay at Wynn Palace was a very pleasent.  The hotel is very clean specious and bright. The standard room is very specious both bedroom and bathroom.  The mattress and the pillows are very comfortable.  I da have a few complaints. I would be the size of the shower is too small.  The quality of the rope could have been better. And the food at your major restaurants should have better taste.  If you want your customers to stay and spend the money at your hotel for their entire stay. ,50
This was the fourth time I had been to Macau and this was by far the best hotel I have stayed with. The service  was fantastic  and the room was spectacular. I wouldrecommend  this hotel to anyone and I will definitely be staying here again when I go back to macau in 2017.,50
Staff services is the best. We got free upgrade without any asking due to wedding anniversary which offered during check in time. That is good surprise for us from Wynn Palace. Thank you so much and will consider to come back again,40
"Must see. Good place for a family visit or business travelers. Liked it better then Wynn Vegas. Good staff, friendly, international. Good location, but not a good shuttle drop off vs. Front desk. Did not like carpeting floors, marble or granite would be better in my opinion.",50
"I've been lucky enough to stay in some of the best hotels in the world and the WP Cotai surprised me: it  is up there with the very best of them. It is even Better then the Mandarin Oriental Bangkok, and that is saying something.  In a city full of 5 star wannabes like the Venetian, Parisian, Galaxy and so on, everything about the Wynn Palace was truly five star: The property is new and stunning, the service is personalized, thoughtful and eager to please and the facilities were top notch.  We were upgraded to a beautiful, huge suit which had everything you might dream of: Amazing design, huge TV screens in both the living room and the bedroom, a Jacuzzi bathtub, free coffee and tea facilities, free mineral water and amazing Molton Brown products..  The SPA is such a beautiful‚Ä¶",50
"Recently opened and is immaculate. Staff friendly and helpful. Courtesy buses will get you virtually anywhere in Cotai or Mcau. Brightly lit everywhere- possibly consuming as much energy as a small town!!! Decoration bright colours and gold. My room good size, clean, glittering everywhere but not all was gold... ( toothbrush, razor, comb, etc. turned out not to be solid gold ! ) Most guests will receive tickets for the cable car ride round the artificial ""lake"" next to the hotel . Do this when dark to see the fountain display. Personally, I was more amused than impressed by the whole style and decoration. The same applied when I visited other hotels here.",40
"We took our 1 yr old baby with us and had our room upgraded, we even got a late checkout at 2pm. The staff was nice and friendly. Our buffet lunch at Wynn was also nice. Would recommend this hotel to friends and relatives",50
"We stopped in the Wynn after a great day too of Macau. The facilities are top notch and the drinks go down easy. There are a number of bars and restaurants to chose from. Gambling is gambling, they offer a lot of that too.",40
"The Wynn Palace is one of the two latest additions to the Cotai Strip. This is the second Wynn property in Macau, being located just east of the City of Dreams property next to a future LRT station which will be located just in front of the hotel.   From the outside, Wynn Palace resembles its other properties with tall bronze coloured high rise hotel building. One of the things that makes this Wynn property unique, is that it is fronted by a large artificial body of water referred to as the Performance Lake, similar to what you might have seen at the Bellagio in Las Vegas.   The Performance Lake features a Light and Water fountain show every 30 minutes between 12-7pm and every 20 minutes between 7-12am daily. During the intervals, the fountain continues to burst smaller water‚Ä¶",30

Staff like Andreas and Joanne are caring, courteous and attentive. With a large variety of food, ranging from fresh seafood, roasted pig, noodles, salad, fried rice, fruits, etc., I found the buffet lunch at Cafe Fontana the best in Macau. Needless to mention, the attractive and delicious desserts displayed at the cafe really brighten up my day! Can't forget the amazingly wonderful taste of chocolate moose and chocolate lemon cake. Even when I left the cafe and was back home, I can still vividly remember all the food I have eaten this afternoon.

"Upscale casino and resort complex with spectacular water feature. Well appointed spacious rooms with good attention to detail and plenty of small thoughtful extras. Loved the touch pad room control system and yummy extras in the bathroom. Limited meal options for such a large place, with emphasis on statement restaurants.",40
"I think that Wynn Palace is the most luxurious hotel in Macau. The very unique interior was so beautiful, and many sculptures with flowers that located near the entrance are really nice. The fountain show in every night was more beautiful than Dubai's.",50
This hotel smells soooo good! You'll see fresh flowers in the lobby and around the hotel. Its performing lakes would give the bellagio las vegas a run for its money. It is magical! The complimentary cable car ride to the hotel's second level is a treat you shouldn't miss. ,40
"My wife took me to the Wynn Palace to celebrate my birthday.  Our stay was delightful.  The room (1565) was enormous -- we were upgraded to an Executive Suite -- tasteful, clean, and quiet.  In fact, the room was so nice that we found it hard to leave the room and enjoy the rest of Macau!!  The bathroom had two sinks, perfect for a couple, a powerful shower which allowed you to choose a fixed spray or a hand-held spray, a deep bath, and a separate toilet room.  The bedroom had a gigantic king-size bed that was ever so comfortable.  Management kindly provided us with a choice of pillows which was awesome since my wife prefers a different sort of pillow than do I.  There was also a wet bar in the entrance to the room -- making it easy to mix yourself a drink or make a coffee. ‚Ä¶",50

I spend 30 mins to check in the hotel and I spend 20 mins to check out. It's really waste a lot time to waiting for! Also I purchase the boat ticket and spend my 1 hour to wait front the counter! They told me that system is crash!!! After I check out the hotel and I found my phone charger might be forgot in the room. I ask them to check if my charger in the room and they said please wait here. I am wait for another 30 mins there and get the feedback is we don't have time to check your charge now. What about you go back to your rooms to check? OMG... what service they provide? I will not stay this hotel again!!!  But the room is clean and big. ,20

Heard about this amazing new hotel is opening in Macau; me and my partner decided to come for a staycation!   Shuttle service at the dock was confusing... we went to the Wynn hotel on the other side of the island given the signage was not clear enough at the station at Cotai ferry terminal; so we wasted a whole hour just went to the wrong hotel...    On the other hand; the hotel is amazing. Nicely decorated especially for the master piece with flowers they have all over the property.   Room was great; nothing too surprises but the amenities was definitely newly decided. We have a fountain view room however the material they use for the window make it hard for you to see the fountain show from room... that's probably because they have the cable car around the property and need‚Ä¶,50
"This is my first time staying at Wynn Palace. The building, structure, decoration, service is much above standard than any hotel. The room is very nice with lots of good restaurants.

"I'm a huge fan of Steve Wynn, his properties and everything he has accomplished in Las Vegas, where I love to visit reguarly. I was thrilled to find out Wynn Palace was opening shortly before my visit to Macau and had to see the latest evolution of the Wynn experience. Undoubtedly, as others have said, this is a beautiful and well thought out resort but I felt genuine hospitality was saved only for those with the deepest (VIP) pockets. Everything in the hotel is priced exceptionally high by like-for-like standards (and I have been lucky enough to stay in numerous luxury hotels around the world) to the point where, frankly, you feel ripped off.

I think the price is competitive with the other high-end casinos.  Poker players should note that the casino's poker room is not yet open.  ",50
"The staff of front desk, room service and restaurant or everywhere are very helpful, nice and politely.  We are definitely satisfied on the breakfast, it has many different items with high quality and fresh food that made us incredible.

"Overall, very good hotel to stay, room are nice and spacious, amnesties are sufficient, water show are very enjoyable to watch, but 2 downside of the hotel, the breakfast area a little bit small for the size of the hotel and the food selection are standard, nothing special. and secondly lack of shuttle bus to go around to city, unlike city of dream or venetian. but overall, pleasing stay.",40
"You will be brought on a trip to another level of quality experience. Takes a great vision, true visionary and pure staff commitment to make happen. A very high quality stay is provided, second to none, and to me beats many best-of-the-best in the world.",50
We were there last week to celebrating our 5th Wedding with our son-Felix. The doorman and reception staff was very helpful. I'm specially have to thank you a front desk manager Bruno. He is trying his best to fulfill  our needs. We are so happy to stay in a very nice suite room and spectacular dessert. He told us everything can eat. Wow~ my son love it!!! It was a really good experience to stay here. Wynn Palace is a very nice place and thank you for you kindness. ,50
"Wynn Palace has huge rooms with the perfect view. I was there celebrating my father's 80th birthday and have booked 4 rooms. The rooms were new, elegantly decorated and spacious. Service was great as we're greeted by the front service manager upon arrival, and every time we asked for something at guest services, they were delivered promptly and with great smile/ service. Definitely will recommend friends to go.",50
"Wynn Palace is so big that you thought that you are one of the special few staying at the hotel. With abundant space, you will enjoy the privacy and exclusivity. The breakfast buffet spread was very scrumptious! I enjoyed the gym best!",40
"Love the Wynn Palace!! It really gives you a royal feeling.  Cannot miss the sky can and musical fountain, it is stunning!    I travelled with my 5-month old baby, they have prepared everything that I need in the room.  The baby amenity kit is so cute.   Special thanks to Victoria, the front desk manager, she is simply the best!  Super helpful and friendly.  Her team, Carol and Mindy, at front desk are awesome, too!   Highly recommend hotel in Macau!! ",50
"Rooms are very big with perfect night view. I was here for business and forgot to bring my contact lens water, called to guest services and they brought one up to me straight away. Very good service indeed.  Just one point on the downside is that the room had a very strong cigarette smell when I first walked in. May need to look into better ventilation. ",40
"Excellent Service and rooms is big. I will come here again soon. Especially on cable car visit, hotel guest entitled free ride when you stay. Location need to think improve shuttle bus to cotai other resort.",50
"I enjoyed every single aspect of this magnificent resort. The room is spacious, and there is attention to every single detail. The bars and restaurants are first class, specialy Wing Lei Restaurant and bar. The casino is great with the most tables I have ever seen, and where well dressed people that reminded me of Vegas in the 80's played the night away. I trully enjoyed the experience of staying at this remarkable resort and I couldn't stop admiring the beauty of it all. ",50
"It is quite new hotel in Macau.  Opened almost together with the Parisian Hotel. But the rooms are bigger at the Wynn Palace.  The standard room feels like a suite.  The bath amenities are just beautiful.  The TV is huge.  Breakfast is nice but busy, you need to wait in cue.  The hotel staff is very helpful and professional.  Just beautiful hotel.",50
"Bear in mind, I'm not usually a high end traveler.  If I was, I'm sure this hotel would get 5 stars. I could afford the transport to everywhere else or I would simply be happy with staying here.   At the same time, the shuttles are very inconveniently located.  You have to walk a mile, it feels to check in from where the shuttle drops you off (or where the cab might drop you off, as was in my case).    They had a deal recently and I took them up on it.  It seemed a bit cheaper, given that it was the Wynn Palace, but it still ran me $186/night.     The restaurants didn't fit my taste buds minus the ramen restaurant which was quite impressive.  I got the best one which cost me $21 a bowl, but you get used to meals costing $15-25.  So, it's no surprise.  It was tasty though given‚Ä¶",40
The room is very spacious. All curtains and lights are very intelligent as they are computerised. My room is facing the lake so I can enjoy the fountain show every 20 minutes. My wife spent quite a long time inside the bathroom as there is a small TV in the bathroom which is not easily found in other hotel.,40
"Great feeling and great room! Love the decoration, and can enjoy the free SkyCab Ride when u stay here. The swimming pool is pretty nice! And the service is fantastic! You can also enjoy shopping here. ",50
"The rooms looks 6 stars, but the furniture, toiletries and amenities is really 3 stars. I checked into the hotel at 14:00 and my room was ready until 16:00. Will I come back again? No! For the price, there are  better hotels in Macau.",30
"Super nice rooms and excellent service, certainly would go back if visiting macau again! Also went for lunch at Wynn Palace (the Chinese restaurant), food was great but portion is a bit small. The fountain was under maintenance for a while but resumed later. Try to get a table at the centre so you are able to see the full scene. ",50
"Location: - Very near to Macau Airport and city area  Amenities :- (1) Casino located centrally within hotel and accessible via many entrances. Offers many games including blackjack, baccarat, jackpots etc.  (2) Shopping Arcade located at 1st storey level surrounding the central casino. High end brands including Chanel, Prada, Rolex etc.  (3) Restaurants surrounding central casino which includes a cafe serving breakfast/lunch/dinner international buffet, Chinese restaurant serving chinese cuisine, Japanese restaurant etc.  (4) Cable car tour fronting the hotel; hotel guests are given complimentary tickets for the cable car ride while others may take the ride at RMB 100 per person.

"Let just begin with the check in where it is extremely chaotic. Only two sofas with 50 people queueing. So I waited 20 minutes before I was able to check in and they say the room is not avaliable until 3pm, which is not the end of the world for waiting under 55 minutes.  Finally, when I got my room, I requested the front desk to request bath salt for obviously taking a bath and they said they ran out of bath salt because too many hotel guest request bath salt. I stand firm and requested to talk to the senior manager and they called back and said they made a mistake, which means that the front desk lied. It was complete non sense to say they ran out of bath salt.   Then, we book the Wynn Lei Palace chinese restaurant at 2:15pm for 2 amd the front desk said it is possible as they‚Ä¶",30
"I have to admit the colour scheme is a bit over the top; my kids described the place as Disneyland without Mickey. I particularly didn't like the scent in the public areas, giving me a terrible headache.  Still a bit of kinks that need to be ironed out. Overall a pleasant stay in a huge room overlooking an impressive fountain. Wish I had time to try the pool and gym.  Food was surprisingly good. My wife had lunch at the coffee shop overlooking the fountain, and she thought it was splendid. The whole family ate at the Steak House, which was full on a weekday night and with great vibes. Food and service were both excellent. Room service was quite good as well, despite costing an arm and a leg....  Overall, not a bad experience. But with so many new hotels in Macau, it will take‚Ä¶",40
"Wow! What a place! Crazy beautiful and the rooms where so big and super clean! I'm in loved! You'll definitely feel like a king or queen. The staff is amazing and very service minded the hotel has everything! so you don't really need to leave the hotel If you don't want to. The only ""bad"" where that the bet on the casino where very high to play, the lowest bet where around 500 hkd for each round. Anyways if we ever come back to Macao I would love to stay here again. ",50
"Got upgraded to a fountain view suite.  Everything is over the top in this hotel but in macau, they can pull it off.  Picture a huge room with 2 mega TVs that looked bigger than 60 inches and gold combs and razors as part of the bathroom amenities.  And everything can be controlled electronically by a ipad sized bedside screen.  Overall very nice room.  Felt a bit isolated from the rest of cotai and the casual chinese restaurants and lunch buffet were just average.  The Hanami noodle restaurant was solid thought.  Overall recommended hotel at reasonable prices.",40
"The room is big and with modern facilities, especially the control panel. However, there is no free beverages expect bottled water.   For the services, the staff is nice and proactive. And it will be better if there is a clearer instructions for querying in the check-in coubters.",40
"Check in organize was poor, no lines to line up, ppl all jumping around to get check in, left me  wait for long time to have staff to notice me waiting. dis pointed that waterfall was not operate on the day.  reason to book the hotel and restaurant was the waterfall, but it was not operate. bad experience.     Room was great and design is detail with design.  Fitness room great , equipment updated and staff are helpful and friendly.  ",30
"After 5 visits with Cafe Fontana since its opening, my impression and satisfaction level with this Ritzy cafe has come down hill overtime. Why do I rate this cafe shop as poor currently ?  My initial ratings on the first 2 or even 3 visits were average or even above average. The dining room has been decorated uniquely with a magnificent view of the performance lake. The background music jives in with glamours dining pleasure. The servers and the team manager were helpful in accommodating diners' needs.  The poor part was the food variety. The cafe only offered buffet and very limited A La Carte. The food in general was near average but I think its performance lake and service lifted up its reputation more above average.  The price was in general OK for upscale dining.  Here is‚Ä¶",20
"Right from the front desk to the lobbies to the room and above all the service at every step of the way is just 5 star. The Bellagio like Fountain show in the front and the season inspired Display's are just impeccable. The restaurant and the views especially in the evening are out of the world. It was a cloudy day when we went, but still this is one place I would recommend in Macau!",50
Top price but not provide top service. Not graden or playground for kids. Cable car rule not standard for every staff: some is ok if only show the room card but some need to get the free tricket first.,30
Staff are helpful and polite. I hope there is a bigger bar and lounge with snacks. I was amazed to find  patrons from next premium brand name stores came to order drinks and ask them to be delivered to the stores they are visiting. Do that Bar served guests of those stores rather than hotel guests.,40
This is my 2nd time to stay in Wynn Palace. I m so amazed that my room was upgraded to the suite with fountain view. I m out of the bkue that there is massage room. I m also so warmed to receive boxes of macaroons and chocolate as welvome gift. Those desserts are delicious. I wish i will have chance to stay in this hotel for third time!,50
Our family came here for a short weekend break to celebrate my dad's birthday. All 4 of our rooms got upgraded to executive suites and we have unlimited rides on the skycab. The room are spacious and clean with all toiletries that you need. Staff are very friendly too.,40
"Once entering the hotel, you are welcomed by  a wonderful, colorful world of flowers. The coloring, the lighting will lead to a heartfelt gratitude of Wynn spirit. Probably, in your heart, you will scream out ""what a wonderful hotel"".  Your room is specially designed to have a palace alike environment. Wynn claimed that ""I build a palace for YOU"", and with all the automation control.  Hong Kong goers will be upset by the TV stations without TVB J2, TVB news, TVB J5.   I strongly recommend all Macau goers MUST stay in the Wynn Palace to enjoy the superb details of this Palace.",50
"The water fountain and the cable car is unique in the city amongst all other hotels. I was fortunate to be upgraded to a suite facing the centre of the performance lake.  The room is big and nice as expected, the main theme throughout the stay was of corse the water show.  We took a lot of pictures from the room, next to the swimming pool, along the outer fance nearby the cable car station on the ground and up from the cable car ride.  It was just quick and stunning.  I noticed that there are different patterns of the water dance that made you never bored with viewing it repeatedly.  The only thing that disappointed us is that we were not able to make the reservation to the SW Steakhouse for either evenings we stayed there.  Looking forward to the next visit.",50
"Great new hotel with beautyful great rooms.  Excellent service, freindly staff, and fun place to stay.  A perfect distanetion for the weekend trip.  Can't wait until when the bridge from Hong Kong Airport opens.",50
"Hotel is beautiful, the fountains are even bigger then The Bellagios in Vegas, the rooms are nice.  Loved all the automation of the whole room... but for 4.1 billion, I'm not impressed.   I booked the suite with the  fountain view.  The room is orange.... very orange.   Not my taste.   It was a smalish size suite compared to many 5-star hotel suites.  I stayed 2 nights prior to this stay at Banyan Tree at Galaxy Resort, so I have much to compare, suite vs suite and amenities and price.  But I had to stay at the new wynn palace and feel all the glamour.   Banyan is a better hotel room wise.  Yet this is not a comparison review so I'll state why I wasn't impressed with wynns latest resort.  Bathrooms are very small.  It has a mini tub, compared to the suite standard.   The shower‚Ä¶",40

Skycab is nice experience, Starbuck, Dessert restaurant all very nice, Noodle restaurant inside casino offers great quality soup noodle and congee.   The only thing is about the luck draw coupon offered after skycab ride, took long process to get the win coupon, which at the end is of no use, as if use need to double up the coupon amount, meaning guest need to pay equal amount as the cash coupon to enjoy the value, and only for gambling.",50
"My friend stayed at Wynn Palace and advised me to check with them on the TV channels provision as she found lack of choices. As my hubby is a big TV fans, I would like to do some research before my stay. I sent message to Wynn Palace via its official facebook page, the admin replied me within 1 day and promised to get back to me asap. Then after 1 full day, the fb admin told me to call direct to hotel enquiry or send another email to its inquiry instead!!! My goodness!!! All I am asking is what TV channels they provided, it should be an easy questions I assumed.

And it did not disappoint - absolutely stunning hotel/casino.    We loved the white/gold theme and thought the decor was modern and amazing. Very bright and open feel everywhere.  The amazing staff was nice enough to upgrade us to a fountain (pool) view room which was stunning at night when the fountains were going.  Our room was perfect.  Nearly 1000 sq ft at a great price.  2 huge HD TVs.  Every detail is perfect.

And two sets 65"" HD TV inside a suite with every 30ms window fountain show view which is amazing!",50
"Centrally located with Gondola rides on the main entrance. Beautiful fountain show every 30 minutes. Look for this in the evening once its starts becoming dark to enjoy the light & sound show . Lobby area quite small but excitingly decorated with flowers. You can find staff every 100 meter to guide you through the hotel. They have a restaurant facing the fountain pool . The best time to enjoy is during the breakfast and Dinner time. Nice spacious rooms  with gold polished hair comb, tooth brush etc. Feels like you are the King in that palace.  The only negative is the use of too much of Red Color in the entire property but still it looks good and makes the hotel looks bright.",40
"I am a Macau resident. I stay in this beautiful palace to celebrate my girl friend's birthday. This palace is luxury but not just only that, the staffs are very friendly and helpful. Thank you for your hospitality and the birthday cake. We will definitely visit here again and again!",50
"It was my parents who wanted to check out this newly established property since they both had stayed in Wynn a number of times.  Faye from Front Desk was friendly & accommodating, she couldn't give us our rooms assigned on the same floor when we got in around 3ish although the request was placed before arrival (but I did understand as we arrive during peak time & each floor has a certain number of room types). We returned at night to see she has my request arranged with one of our rooms upgraded to a suite & with the help of Bela we were able to check-out at 13:00 the next day. We got free cable ride tickets as well all thanks to them :)  There are many high-end shops & restaurant outlets to offer on the Ground Floor, quite a walk to get around unless you walk through the‚Ä¶",50

Stayed two nights in the sumptuous Fountain Suite, overlooking the pool, SkyCabs and performance lake. From registration (check in), to meals at 99 Noodles (within the casino) and Cafe Fontana (breakfast), drinks at Wing Lei Bar, the gym staff, pool attendants and bellboys, service was impeccable throughout. Even if casinos are not your thing, there's enough here to keep you busy and entertained for a couple of days. Oh and there's the art!! Jeff Koons' Tulips and the Qing Dynasty Buccleuch Vases are not to be missed. The rotating floral windmill in the South lobby is rather eye catching too!",50
"Overall:  Though pricing is in line with other similar 5* properties in Macau, Wynn Palace is just ok.  Location isn't at the most happening part of Taipa.  Service is below average probably due to training issues.  The pool is so-so.  The decoration is way over the top with too much gold and bright carpeting.  Please turn off the music in all public areas!  Location:  15 minutes from Taipa pier, 30 minutes from Macau pier, shuttle bus runs frequently and a few other places (Venetian, Taipa town).  There is no much around the hotel's immediate area--nothing is truly within walking distance.   Reception:  Check-in/out service is inefficient.

The staff are polite but kind of green.  It's across Citydream and 15 min walk to The Parisian/Venetian  The gimmick cable car is surrounding the palace for a round.  The view is wonderful at night when there is fountain show.  But not worth to pay for the ride.    However, it is not family friendly.  As children under 18 are not allowed in casino, the design block family from easy access to hotel, shops and restaurants.  The swimming pool is awfully small like those business hotels.  There isn't any children kind of playground.  So, if you are going to Macau with kids or teenagers, I do not recommend you to stay in‚Ä¶",40

My wife and I had an great vacation in Wynn Palace in last weekend. We stayed in a Fountain Suite facing the lake. The Suite has a living room separated it from the bedroom from there we had panoramic view on the lake and the fountain show. The fountain show scheduled in every 20 minutes in the evening. The vibrant changing light coupled with the stunning fountain performance make this fountain show one of the best in the world. The Suite is not only spacious close to 90 sqm it is also elegantly decorated and equipped with two large screen LED TV sets; one in the living room and one in the bedroom. It is worth to pay the extra to stay in a Fountain Suite.  The breakfast at Caf√© Fontana is impressive. There is good assortment of food particularly a full collection of French style‚Ä¶,50

We had to wait an hour to be seated for breakfast. I've never had to wait for breakfast in any hotel. I was with my grandparents who are 90 and 88 (one of them in a wheelchair) and they would not help prioritize us and let other VIPs cut before us.,20

The swimming pool is small compared to other hotels in the area but is good enough for sun bathing.  We got free one-way skycab tickets to the hotel (casino) at the front end of the lake.  Besides the free transportation from the piers, guests can take shuttle to certain Cotai hotels every 20 mins.  Also, unlike other Cotai hotels, the signs are in traditional Chinese, which makes it very special.",50

The breakfast at Cafe Fontana is superb, and probably one the best breakfasts for that price given the wide array of food, chocolate, pastries, fruit, ice-cream, you name it. We did some gambling but mostly took in the beautiful scenery. In the evening we went to The House of Dacing Water acrobatic show that is just across the street.

The breakfast selection and quality was wonderful too. Finally, the pool and jacuzzi area, overlooking the fountains was really good too!",50
"The long-awaited Wynn palace finally grand opening ! I as Wynn's loyai fans in The opening day to experience a! The general feeling of The palace of The entire building more than Wynn Macao on a grade ,service personnel are very enthusiastic ! palace outside The green project is very good ,music fountain performances are wonderful ,The atmosphere! Just start to feel a bit redundant gondola ,after careful observation to understand the boss's intentions ! The palace flowers only works vety love , flowers can bring out the splendid and luxurious palace! lnside",50
"If you stumble where you should alight your transportation, no worry, there're two check-in areas, and you can check-in at either one. Upon arriving on your allotted floor, you'll see a small waiting area with a sofa in the centre, and the fragrance of flowers fills the entire floor. Even though the hotel is huge - with 1,700 rooms and suites - signage and directions are very clear. You just don't need to worry you'll get lost. The fountain suite I stayed this time is spacious, with separate bathroom, bed room, and living room, all equipped with doors for highest privacy. You'll be greeted with chocolate lollipops at the bed room under the gigantic, 65-inch HD TV. (There's one more in the living.) All equipments - sheer, curtains, lights, and air-con - are controlled by two‚Ä¶",40
"I was upgraded to Executive Suite and the in-room amenity is at the best quality that I have ever seen - Nespresso machine, Starbucks VIA instant coffee, shoe-shine kits, well-equipped bathroom amenity with Molton Brown shower kit, oversized TV & B&O speaker etc. The room is simply WOW!  The view from the breakfast restaurant is fantastic and remember to sit aside the window to enjoy the magnificent fountain view. I believe the night view will even be unbeatable with the signature fountain show.   Another way to enjoy the fountain view is to ride on the SkyCab cable car. Frankly, the ride time is shorter than expected but it is good enough to enjoy the show. It is a smart move that the tickets are included in the room price or otherwise it doesn't worth spending $100 for each‚Ä¶",50
"A truly lovely place with joyful and colourful lobby and surrounding areas.  Room is spacious with excellent lighting that you'll find very comfortable and enjoyable. Lodged in the fountain side room and can see the fountain show outside the window, it's nice.",50
"This is the best property in Macau, hands down. Like Vegas, Steve Wynn doesn't mess around. It's not a property intended for everyone. It is at the pinnacle of 5 stars.   Just like every property , it will have a few teething issues at opening.  However, there is a reason that Wynns other macau property is one of the most profitable in macau. Because customers keep coming back for more.   The pool deck, with macau as the backdrop is fantastic. The rooms are large and very tasteful.  The restaurants are a good as they get in Macau.   If you want to get away from the masses and insanity of other macau properties, this is where you should head.",50
"First of all: the hotel is new and the style looks fantastic. Nice suites, newest technical gimmicks and a great selection of shops around the casino. However, the staff at reception and guest relation is useless, lies to guests and causes anger and confusion. The good: Spacious rooms, great design, brilliant amenities Fountain and music show almost as good as at Burj Khalifa (Armani Hotel) Koon decor amazing Nice casino with elegant atmosphere   Great service at the pool restaurant  The bad: Disappointing gym facing walls No access to the pool area to watch the fountain after 8 pm A lot of tourists running around and disturbing guests The ugly: Reception can't handle the amount of guests checking in, level of English could be better Useless guest relation: my TVs didn't work‚Ä¶",20
"Spent my birthday here last week. Pretty impressed by the service and of course the lovely setting. First time staying here and was a pleasant stay. Will def come back.   PS.thanks for the complimentary cake, that's sweet. And also the Skycab experience.",50
"Upgraded to Executive floor. The room is new, big and modern but without a good view. Everything during my stay is good except the pillow is too soft. Besides, I think they should do something as there is no cover to walk out from the hotel to the main road. The performance lake and the Skycab is good  and all the staff's attitude are good too.",40
"Overall service quality was poor, especially the attendants on the floor. Staff were poorly trained and lack spirit to serve customers or the capacity to greet customers with a smile.  I am unlikely to stay with Wynn Palace again if there are no Craps table.",30
"* Great location. Near The Venetian and the City of Dreams  * We were given a free room for just playing in the casino, how cool is that?! 10 stars!  * They have free flowing drinks in the casino too when you play!  * Room is sooo lovely. Very spacious and the bathroom is super luxurious. It has wide and well lit hallways  Overall, much recommended as it is a lovely hotel and would love to stay here again!",50
"We were given an upgrade to a beautiful suite with a stunning bathroom. The flower arrangements throughout the hotel were beautiful, and the staff unbelievably friendly and helpful. We were there at the time of my 30th birthday and because they noticed this on my passport we were given a beautiful birthday cake which was sent to our room. I think it maybe lacked options in terms of places to eat but you are only a short walk to other hotels if you fancy something different. Overall a very luxurious experience but maybe lacking some of the amenities of the other hotels. ",50
"Stayed here for two nights in a suite overlooking the fountain lake.  + super new + design stuff everywhere (actually a bit o.t.t.) + nice pool area with ok service + fountain show at night is pretty cool - good steak house + great wines, extremely knowledgeable sommelier + sky cab ride is fun  + great spa  - OMG it's sooo bright everywhere inside. Something went wrong with the lighting. This goes for rooms, restaurants and public areas - partially extreme kitsch - weird choices of room colours like turquoise-white or super gold everywhere  - Doesn't have the cozy feel of the old Wynn - Big property: I felt like I was always walking and my room was already close to the elevator! - Even after Wynn insider discount rooms are expensive for Macau",40
"A big WOW! Our experience with Wynn Palace is awesome... Big hallways with beautiful decoration in Victorian style and the rooms are also cozy. The blending of colors of the decoration is well done and the wall paintings going to the spa and pool is a state of the art. We'll definitely come back! Oh by the way, special mention to Ms. Yan from the front office who facilitated our request as originally we booked for twin bedroom and was initially given us a double room. Ms. Yan has gracefully rectified it! Good job Ms. Yan!",50
Great place for me. I really enjoyed the roulette and the blackjack. It's just opened so it has a lively feel to it. Feels like you are in a palace. You feel overrawed initially but once your nerves settle then it's time to gamble ! :-) good luck,50
"Good and polite staff, big and clean room, Great Lake show and cable cars is also must try.  The cafe fontana has a great view also, and the food is good also.  My family has been arrange to a good seat so that we can eat our buffet with the preformance lake.",50
The entire property felt a little suffocating. The ceilings were oddly low and the foyer areas was small and serpentine.  Rooms were opulent with a very garish flare.  Different color themes in different rooms but the one I had was a crimson orange hue.  A little uncomfortable to the eyes but these fairly luxurious digs.  The high limit gaming areas were nice and grand but had a severe lack of smoking lounges/areas.  Business was slow compared to the newly opened Parisian.  Nice boutique feel but not exactly my style.,40
"The performance lake is spectacular and just as good as the one at Bellagio.  We ate at Caf√© Fontana for lunch buffet, Wing Lei and Andreas for dinner and dare to say the taste and experience was better than many top tier 5 star hotels in Hong Kong and at better price.  Special note to the lunch buffet there is a huge section of desserts with homemade ice-cream and chocolate which we liked a lot.  We stayed for one night with our baby and the staff were very helpful setting up our room (surprised that bottle steamer was provided) and helping us book restaurants which are age restricted.  A Guest Service Director even visited us twice during our meals to check if everything is OK.  Definitely the best resort we have been to in Macau.  Mindful that most staff are Chinese so expect‚Ä¶",50
"My husband took me to stay at the new Wynn Palace 2 weeks ago and we had an amazing stay there.  Therefore, this week I took my mother who is visiting from overseas to experience it and she had a fabulous time too!  The room was spacious, clean and hi-tech and the staffs especially at the receiption (Kayla & Kianna) when we checked in were very friendly and helpful.  On my second stay we managed to try the breakfast at the Cafe Fontana and it was awesome - the asking price is very reasonable and the food was delicious.  I will definitely come back again next time I visit Macau and recommend my friends to stay too!",50
The room we stayed in was spacious and the accommodation inside the room are great. The food in the hotel is nice. Shuttle bus services from the ferry and around Macau is provides. The staffs at the hotel were nice and helpful.,40
"I stayed there for one night & I wish I could have stayed longer. When I got into the hotel room I was amazed by the dressing room. And it is 1/4 of the room only. There r bathroom & bedroom of course. There is also a work/study room. So the room is very spacious compare with other hotels. There is a cable car which is only like 2-3 min ride, but still, an attraction to visit. Also, there's a huge fountain which can be seen from the swimming pool. I enjoy the music fountain very much. The restaurants inside the hotel are really nice too. I tried one Japanese ramen restaurant & one Chinese restaurant. Both are fancy and therefore expensive. Also there's Wynn Macaron. They are so lovely as they have the very elegant packing, you can refer to the picture. Should try this hotel‚Ä¶",40
"It's a great trip and make me feel comfort, when I getting in this hotel, the first image is a grand place and high performance about all staff service. The front desk staff said apologise about make me waiting long time!",50
"Enormous, super-bling, mega hotel. Our orange room was bigger than our flat! Good service but could do with more casual dining options.  Love the detailing and artwork spread around and all the fresh flowers everywhere.  Cool cable cars! ",40
"Visited here as I was in Macau for the Parisian opening, and so only made use of the facilities on a Day Trip basis.   Wynn Palace is in part modeled on the ""Encore at Wynn"" in Law Vegas. Eg floral kinetic sculptures, the carpet, the red and gold decor. However, there is an over-emphasis on high end shops  and not enough attractions which are more accessible. This is thinking appropriate for 2013 / 2014, when there were lots of Chinese high rolling gamblers, but not for 2016.  The cable car mode of arriving at the hotel is a gimmick. It's not worth the HK$100 to take the trip. Many guests appear to be pulling there luggage from the Main Street by hand.   The hotel is poorly located although it's next to a Monorail station, running through the Taipa area (unfinished) and so it's‚Ä¶",30
"The room was large and it was luxurious and gave an impression of cleanliness, and sweets of the every evening were very good. The quality of the buffet is good, but a price is high. The entrance of the hotel is far when from the outside. Because the pool is small small, it is not a product for families.",30
This hotel is an luxury hotel Located in Taipa Macau. New Wynn Palace is very amazing. The lighted are so awesome and very luxury and very Romantic place. Me with my friend having a good time to ride some cable car with matching fountain show. It's my very first time to ride and go look around Wynn Palace. The cable car in Wynn Palace a Little bit expensive around 100MOP per one ticket but an awesome experience. Recommended who visits in Macau to visits this place and go look around. ,50
"My friend and I were having lunch in Cafe Fontana during Mid-autumn Festival. Although the restaurant was insanely busy, the food and service were always remain at a high standard. Manager Mr. Chai and his service team were excellent, they always quickly responded to guests' needs and shown their care and passion to us. A dirty empty plate can never be found on the table, beverages were always served on time. And we definitely love the view of the splendid performance lake, it was a highlight to our dining experience.  You can never find another buffet restaurant like Cafe Fontana in town, which provides excellent food and at the same time, high quality personalized service.",50
"We walked on a warm and humid day from City of Dreams to Wynn Palace. It was worth the walk. Wynn Palace is amazingly beautiful. As soon as we entered the hotel's side entrance, we were awed by the artwork, the flowers, the interior design, the carpet, and everything else they had. Wow! They had a carousel that was moving and was all decked with fresh beautiful flowers.They also had a ferris wheel also decorated with flowers all over. One of their staff, Kelly, was kind enough to offer to take our picture. We told our other companions about this awesome hotel, and they all went the next day. That night, all they could talk about was how beautiful this hotel was and how different it looked from the other hotels.",50
"I went to make a complaints here regarding to my bad experience as I can not find your hotel e-mail address from website. I had stayed in your hotel on 11th-12th Sep, room no.1776 Ms. Tang. I had given feedback and complaint to the duty manager at the hotel lobby when I was check out yesterday and I hope the duty manager had followed up my complaint regarding to my bad experiences at swimming pool yesterday morning at 11:30 am. I checked in the swimming pool, no staff escort me to the sunbed and I had to found the space to seat by myself and finally I had found a sunbed in the swimming pool. But I sit there more than 15 minutes, no one provide towel and water to me and my friend. Therefore I had looked for the pool staff to give me a food and drink menu. I had ordered some food‚Ä¶",10
"I had stayed in Wynn Palace with my family and overall experience is good. However, the services in the swimming pool is very bad, no staff doing services in the pool deck and the pool staff attitude was very bad and not caring the guests. The facts, I was enjoying the sunbath in swimming pool and I was asked the pool staff Cesar for water, towel and food menu but the staff was trying to ignored me as he was playing his mobile phone until I had raised up hand 3 time to ask him for services. When I was leaving the pool, he was not allow me and my son to bring the towel to back to the room. During the conversation, he was very rude and no services at all.

"2 weeks ago, I booked the hotel room which is the lowest price and write down the request that I would llke to have the room faced with fountain show.  At first, I think this request cannot be fulfilled but I still try to write.  When I checked in this Mon, I am so amazed that staff in Wynn palace read my request that they can give the room faced to fountain show without paying extra money.  My dream came true!! Originally I bought the hotel package only includes buffet breakfast but they give me 2 free rides of cable car to see the fountain show! WOW!  When my mum and I entered the room, we are so wowed that the room is very big with excellent quality of interior design.  Even the kettle is bought from Kenwood! We are so excited that we see the golden brush in bathroom. There‚Ä¶",50

Last wednesday me and my family visit wynn palace and decided to have dinner in cafe fontana. it was busy that time. the view of performance lake is so cool my daughter loves it. One of the server catch my attention Even though the dining is so busy he still accomodate us and check what we need.His name is ALDES/ALDRES and he told us his a filipino keep it u man. You have a wide future on your skills.I rarely give some reviews but wynn palace deserves a 5 star.. nice hotel and reasonable price with good customer service. we will surely visit you soon!,50
"  Had a great stay at Wynn Palace. We went for a family trip and enjoyed everything during our stay. The rooms have so much space and beautiful decoration. The staff made me feel at home. The front desk agents were very fast and friendly, the bell boy took the luggage to our suite very fast and gave us a tour of the room. We loved the view of the lake and we enjoyed riding the skycabs too. We went on it twice because we really liked it.  One of the bell boys, Evan helped me find my way to one of the shops, they are so courteous and helpful. My checkout was quick and the ladies were so nice we can't wait to go back to Macau and stay at the Palace again!",50
"Rooms are very beautifully decorated, very large TV and extremely comfortable bed. Very spacious and lots of cool and elegant amenities.  Very nice and attentive staff  Service was excellent, food was very good and the ambiance is elegant and whimsical. Must take the gondola ride, it goes around the lake and has a great view of the fountain show.  Next time I will upgrade to a fountain view room, I could see the airpot and villa pools from my room which was nice too.",50

It surprised me when i arrived to the hotel, that is full of flower. The fountain show is awesome!  Especially when you are in the cable car.  The room is huge and clean. I love the deco.  There are free shuttle bus from the hotel to everywhere. ",50
"We stayed in the suite for 5 days, the hotel and the room itself is very beautiful with views towards the fountain show and swimming pool. However the service in that place is very poor!   Firstly, when we arrived the hotel we got told by the staff our room wasn't included breakfast and asked us to go somewhere else to eat. (We had double checked with them many times as we remembered we booked a room with breakfast.)  Secondly, we wanted to take our clients to afternoon tea on the other day and the staff told us there's no reservations allowed and you have to just WALK IN by luck as they only have ""20 sets"" of afternoon tea a day with hundreds of guests waiting!

" This brand new ultra-high end hotel grantly opened in the last week of August.  The casino is really nice and cosy.  The decorations and image of the ground floor is the same as Wynn,  Macau but I like the casino here when comparing to Wynn Macau.  It was a disappointment at Red 8 where they did not serve the sliced Peking style duck and the northern toasted bun here. The Chinese restaurant was full at 5:50 pm,  the setting is more breath taking than the pictures in the net. We ate at Andrea's serving zichuen food,  the chief chef surprisingly is an Australian but the food does not give you surprises,  portions are very small,  like you are ordering a dish for one person.  Pretty expensive though,  if you do not selectively order and order a fish less,  I reckon you should‚Ä¶",30
"Since when a luxury resort has this habit of changing policies for their own convenience instead for patrons?    Not accepting reservation for any meal sessions and telling you to walk-in?    Is it because you can't control the floor and  balance the flows? So to make sure your in-houses have enough seats, the walk-ins have to be the ones to suffer?  I made a reservation at the buffet restaurant few days after your opening, then called in to cancel on 31 August.  I called again this evening, wanting to keep my reservation and I was given a ""NO"".  But why didn't you people tell me the ""NEW POLICY"" when I called to cancel?  I could have just cut down the capacity then cancelling the whole booking as we are actually going to celebrate a birthday.    The Birthday Star likes buffets,‚Ä¶",20

We were excited to book the newly opened Wynn Palace which opened just 4 days before our Check in.   The rooms were 10 on 10 and it Shows that hotel management has huge experience as they have provided just everything a guests  may need in a hotel room.   Like Las Vegas rooms are very spacious & bathrooms are most modern.   The staff all around were very courteous & warm.    Special mention of front office staff Ms Gabriella who was a constant  help on check in and check out with patience as we were a group of 14. She deserves a raise.   Happily Recommend this hotel.  üëèüëçüëåüòÄ,50
"This is a fabulous resort . The dining shopping gaming are over the top. The performance lake with its water shows set to music is truly amazing and fantastic .The sky cabs that transport you from the street into the property offer amazing views of the lake . There are so many restaurants to choose from , even a western steak house SW ,my favorite. The  shopping promenade encircles the casino and includes too many brands to name . The rooms are huge with LOTS of extras . Heated toilet seats !This resort is aptly named for it is truly a Palace",50
"Very nice hotel rooms and casino. However they need to improve in a few areas. Firstly the front office staffs are too inflexible and rude. We checked in to 2 rooms, but one of the passports was not with us and they do not allow us to get the key first and follow up with the documentation although we can show other form of identification, and also when we suggested to fax the copy over, until we insisted then the higher authority approved it. I reckon hotel should try to help solve customers problems and make sure they have a good and unforgettable experience during the stay, however this is otherwise. 2nd the staff attitude need to be trained further. After doing a mistake, she doesn't even has the courtesy to inform the customer until we have to discover it ourselves.  3rd,‚Ä¶",30
Wynn Palace is truly beautiful. It feels luxurious and elegant. Well worth a visit. The Garden Villas are sensational. Never saw a private pool so long. And the SW restaurant has some entertaining surprises. Wing Lei Bar is intimate and cozy. The pools and Spa are lovely. The Presidential suite has pure gold fittings. Luxury!,40
"Just back from a four day stay at the new Wynn Palace in Cotai, Macau.  Steve Wynn poured USD 4.2 billion into the building of this place, and as you can probably imagine at that price, he has done his usual spectacular job at giving life to what is without doubt the flag ship of all properties currently operating along the Cotai strip. Elegance and opulent luxury can be witnessed around every corner. The standard room we stayed in was spacious and outstandingly well appointed. You know when you have a Bang and Olufsen A2 bedside speaker that the design team has left nothing to chance!   The service and F&B side however leaves a lot to be desired. Its true the hotel has only been open for four days, and one has to allow that they need time to get things right, but I was left‚Ä¶",40
"Wynn Palace seems to have been designed to making sure guest would have an exquisite experience all the way. Starting from the outside with the stunning show lake, and gondola ride to the 3 main entrances being flowers the main theme: the 2 Atriums, both with special mechanical features (a merry-go-round like a huge music box and the bus and taxi entrance where a tulips sculpture by Jeff Koons is displayed. We can find several art pieces all around the property that were carefully integrated into the design where we can appreciate some quite good quality works of art while strolling along the retail promenade. There are over 40 high end retail shops alongside with some food and beverage spots. The Starbucks is probably one of the most refined of its chain. The hotel offers over‚Ä¶",50
"Just back from new Wynn palace, where had booked a standard palace King room, should have paid a touch extra and got fountain view, but yopu need to get 12th floor or above to see over the swimming pool. You enter via the wings of the hotel, either to North or South lobby entrance, as the fountain dsplay dominates the entire front of the hotel, facing the City of Dreams complex. At each lobby there is a huge flower display, either of a life size carousel or a small ferris wheel. Generally the hotel is full of light yellows, and golds, with large flower  and expensive art/antique displays everywhere. Less red tones, than the other Wynn in Macau,  but similar oppolulent feeling,with deep carpets, and venetian glass chandaliers. Checking in at 3.30 on a Saturday was a total mess,‚Ä¶",40
"This is a place with countless staff but no one willing or able to help you. It takes multiple exchanges with the staff to get an answer to even the most basic of questions, they nickel and dime you on every corner, and the facilities are not very clean or well maintained. Do Not Waste Your Money Here! (unless you have children there are seemingly more children than adults). This was supposed to be a romantic birthday getaway for my Fianc√©e, however now our perception of Macau is forever tainted.",10
"This just opened up 5 days ago, so everything is new, clean, bright and shiny. The casino gaming floor is huge. The shopping had all the big brand names you would expect to find in a casino. The fountain show is very impressive at night, like the Bellagio in Vegas! This has a gondola that goes over the fountain show. If you are in Macau, you should check this latest casino to open, it is very impressive!! ",50
"Wow!  This hotel is amazing!  Only been open for 4 days!  The guest experience exceeded our expectations.  Definitely 5 star environment and service.  We were walking to Red 8 restaurant and we saw Steve Wynn walking right towards us, checking out his new place.  He should be proud!  We love it here! ",50
