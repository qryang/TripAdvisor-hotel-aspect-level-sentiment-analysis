"I celebrate my anniversary with my boyfriend in Conrad, I was totally surprised by the service provided by them, the bell boy Dylan and Regan very proactive and helpful. The FO Dayo also provide detail and friendly introduction of the room and facilities and thanks for his upgrade and the cake.  My package included a 60 Minutes spa service and we pay extra $200 to extend to 90 min, both therapist are very professional.",50
"All the staying experience is great, and the location is good to reach many spots. The service and food is good and the staff is very warm to welcome the customers.  Lovely golden ""Conrad bears"" makes the trip even memorable.",50
"The staff was exceptional treating us the best way possible, at all times. The suite we stayed in was phenomenal, making you want to stay inside as long as possible! We loved that at the Lounge the breakfast was up until a bit later (11.30) giving us time to go to the gym and still enjoy great food! Even being GLuten Free intolerant, they brought me GF bread and were very helpful! At the pool, great quick service and staff very caring!",50
"It's our third summer to to spend time at Conrad Macao before school starts for kids.  The facelift of the Sands Cotai Central for the upcoming Londoner hotel has temporarily suspended some of the facilities that Conrad has to offer, including the pool and in room dining.  However, there are reasons to come back the third year in a row, even with these temporary disadvantages for the property -- services count!  We were upgraded to a sweet queen deluxe suite as a diamond.  It's the same great team at the executive lounge, Ivan, Frand and Sarah, to name a few familiar faces.  Although the current reconstruction project has made it a little bit disadvantaged in location and availability of amenities, we are still very very happy with our recent 2-night stay.    Check-in in the evening was swift, the front-desk team was kind enough to include a few coloring kits for my children as a welcome gift, these little gifts proved to be handy at dinner later to keep them busy before meals arrived.   Our room was pre-arranged with all we asked for before arrival --- a firmer pillow, kids' bathrobes, slippers.  The extra bottles of water were answered almost immediately after a phone call.    We received complimentary access to the St Regis pool while the Conrad pool was closed for reconstruction, another good gesture to make up for the temporary disadvantage.  Breakfast was served at the Executive Lounge which recently came back to business.  A la carte, instead of buffet style, the breakfast offering had everything we needed, and quality was excellent!  Ivan and Sarah kept us entertained while we waited for our food and before we left, the kids got a big surprise with the cute bear and signature duckling toy.   Ivan and Sarah answered every need during our breakfast, offering attentive service and most important of all, with a warm feeling of being old friends.  There are names that I forgot, everyone at the Conrad Macao team I met this time has been excellent.  We look forward to our fourth visit soon!…",50
"This room was truly awesome and I was upgraded to it as a Gold member! Huge living room, media room, and a ridiculously large bathroom. Highly recommended!  The hotel itself is located in the Cotai Sands Complex which is a complex of three hotels (Holiday Inn, Sheraton, Conrad) that share a common casino/shopping mall/eateries. The complex was recently completed in 2012 and is located directly across the street from the Venetian and the City of Dreams.  The Conrad provides a free shuttle bus from the Taipa Ferry Terminal. I took the Cotai Water Jet Ferry from Hong Kong to Macau which was a pleasant trip. At the ferry terminal there was a staff member from the Conrad holding a sign that said ""Conrad."" I identified myself to the staff member and she walked me to the shuttle bus. The shuttle bus would not have been easy to find without the help of the Conrad staff member.  It's pretty easy to get to the old town of Macau via a taxi from the Conrad. Taxi's were about $10 to the Historic Centre, and were readily available at the lobby entrance of the Conrad. For those that are extremely cheap, there is also a free shuttle bus that runs to the Historic Centre from the City of Dreams hotel complex next door.…",50
"This hotel won't fail on giving you nothing but excellence!  Stayed under one of their offered promotion and it was such an amazing experience. I have to say, it's my second visit but the expectation is still beyond.  This time it was for my nephew's birthday. I would like to express my big ""THANK YOU"" to the Head of Front Office-Elvis for kindly arranging everything for our stay, from the provided information needed with package clarification and most of all the flexibility on pool access at the St. Regis.   We were greeted by Ada and Elvis upon arrival with a little welcome birthday gift for my nephew. They were very professional and kind with processing the check in until we were escorted to our room.  To our spa experience I highly recommend to try, we were welcomed by…",50
"Thank you Conrad Macau! My friends and I met an awesome team of Front Office, specially thanks to Troy on his warm and professional services. We had a wonderful stay in the upgrade deluxe suite with gorgeous view of COTAI Strip. We also enjoyed the spa and delicious food in dining outlets. The most remarkable restaurant was Crystal Jade, best Xiao Long Baos in town! Thanks to all team members of Conrad Macau to make our visit so special. Definitely we will visit you again soon!  Cristina S.",50
"Just returned with my 20th visit to Conrad Macau, my second home in Asia, for my  birthday celebration.  The full professional team of the hotel greeted and treated me with warmth and happiness.

"Had again a PERFECT visit to this wonderful hotel! Like I have written in my previous reviews, this hotel is something that most hotels are just dreaming of achieving: the hotel itself is lovely, the swimming pool area is beautiful, the suites are gorgeous and, what is most important, the service here is top-notch!!!  I want to express my great, big thanks to all members of the executive lounge; Ivan, Emman and Frand from the guest relations, head waiters Tyra, Tina and Sarah, waiter Ryan etc. Also, a huge thanks to wonderful head of front office, Mr Elvis!  You guys are such amazing individuals, all of you! And it feels just like coming home when I get there to Conrad Macau. From the bottom of my heart: thank you so much!!! Can't wait to get back there soon! Actually, I already…",50
We were there for business trip a year back and was taken care of very well.  first we were give an upgrade for a suite. 2 bed room suite with a living room the size of a mansion.  we loved every minute of it and didn't want to go down stair.  To top that off. They gave us a comp time for our Martinis for the party of 4 of us.  very impressed with them and caused myself to switch from Marriott to Hilton in 2020.,50
"This review is to thank Conrad Macao for unproblematic refund of non-refundable booking that I cancelled because of coronavirus outbreak. The virus prompted us to postpone indefinitely our planned vsiit to Hong Kong/Maco in mid February. The hotel responded to our cancellation request very quickly and did not have any hesitation to offer refund for cancellation, even though we booked non-refundable rate. It also communicated timing of refund very clearly including about one-week delay caused by hotel finance department being closed until mid-February because of the virus outbreak. I appreciate the whole process a lot, particularly in this difficult time for hospitality business. I will make sure I will book and stay in Conrad Macao when I come to Macao hopefully in not so…",50
"Wow, wow, wow! - We have stayed in Conrad properties through out the world and this hotel really sets a very high benchmark for other hotels.   We have stayed in this hotel and number of times and each time we stay, we really are left in awe of the hotel and its staff.   The hotel is located directly on the Cotai strip and it is very easy to get to. On our most recent visit we took the coach from the Macau Taipa Ferry Terminal and it took us just a matter of minutes to arrive at the hotel.    On arrival the doorman and luggage porters assisted us with out luggage and escorted us through the BEAUTIFUL lobby to the front desk. Here, they handed us over to one of their front desk colleagues whilst they took our luggage to our room - amazing.   The staff on the front desk were…",50
"Having stayed in numerous Conrads around Asia from Maldives to Koh Samui, Conrad Macao sets a new benchmark for service levels. Before arrival, the hotel reached out to us to enquire about our arrival timings and other minor administrative work. As we did mention we were coming as new-weds, the hotel prepared a surprised cake for us during arrival and upgraded our rooms to one with a perfect view of the ""Eiffel Tower"". Annie at the front-desk is a true gem and, we were glad she was the one checking us in. The executive lounge had one of the best spreads and the same can be said for breakfast. Unfortunately, our stay was just one night and we look forward to the next trip here.",50
"For a family reunion, we picked this hotel mainly because it's not sitting on a casino like other grand hotels.  The concierge staff helps a lot; they know everything and even booked jet ship tickets for us directly.  You don't need to wait for anything. I like their breakfast as well.  Comparing with their sibling in Hong Kong, the Conrad Hong Kong, this one serves great breakfast selections.  I prefer western style while my family prefer Chinese cuisine. If you want to engage yourself to a casino, just walk for hundreds of meters; we also enjoyed a great dinner at Parisian as well, within walking distance. 位置很不错；我们选这个酒店是因为它底下没有赌场，会安静一些。但如果想去试试手气，只需走几百米即可。巴黎人、威尼斯人等都可在室内抵达。 酒店的葡菜餐厅、巴黎人的法餐都相当地道，尤其喜欢他们的白葡萄酒，葡萄牙的ZLLO。",50
"This hotel does everything right, thanks primarily to the incomparable Diana.  We contacted her prior to our arrival and trusted that she would provide us with another exceptional stay.  During our entire five-day stay, we were pampered by the entire staff.  We were allocated the same lovely suite (with Eiffel Tower view) where we stayed in 2017.  We left much of the planning to Diana.  She recommended the House of Dancing Water show - easily the best show we have ever seen and comparable to a Cirque du Soleil production, but better!  We also followed her restaurant recommendations, both on and off site - all delicious.  We were very happy to see Yumi again.  She was quick to satisfy our requests  with a smile.  We recognized many of the team members in the Exec Lounge.  We…",50
お値段、立地、お部屋、サービス、期待以上にステキなホテルでした！ コンラッドマカオ コタオに初めて宿泊しました。今回はホテルを探す際にインスタグラムで探したところ、コンラッドマカオのアメニティ(アヒルとクマのアメニティ)がとても可愛かったので、これが気になりアゴダから予約をしました。  ホテルのお部屋はエッフェル塔ホテルが見えるキングデラックス。ゆったりと広くて部屋サイズはゆとりがあり、景色は最高です(^^)お風呂もバスタブとシャワーが別なので、お風呂にゆったり浸かりたい人にはおすすめです。  そして楽しみにしていたアメニティ！部屋に入って探したら、洗面台のところに緑色のダッグがおりました(^^)ちょっと欲しい色と違っていたのでホテルのスタッフさんに伝えてみたところ、その場でハウスキーパーに連絡をしてくださり、快くOKと快諾！夕食を食べ終えた後に部屋へ戻ったら、欲しかったコンラッドダッグに加えて、コンラッドベアまでサプライズギフトが♪さらにホテルスタッフから直筆の温かいメッセージまでいただき、とても丁寧な対応に一流ホテルの真髄を感じました！  ホテルの場所もウォーターショーが観れるシティオブドリームや買い物に便利なベネチアンの近くだからアクセスも便利です。そして部屋でパソコンや携帯を充電していたら、コードをキレイにまとめてくださりバンドまで付けてくれるという、、とにかく親切丁寧なホテルでした♪  気持ちよく宿泊されたい方におすすめです！  The Conrad Macao cotai hotel exceeded my expectations.  The room is nice view and large size room(king delux twith Eiffel tower view) relax and comfortable.…,50
"This is my second time staying at the Conrad Macao.  Staffs at the hotel provide excellent services, especially staffs at the executive lounge.  Also, location fo the hotel is near the center of Cotai strip",50
"The Macau Conrad Hotel services is incredible experience. We stayed for 2 nights during the New Year holiday. The location is great (in Sands Cotai Central) and the room was peaceful and relaxing. I like to chat with my family in the living room. It is the best hotel I’ve ever stayed in, the service was impeccable. We appreciated the outstanding executive lounge team, such as Ivan, Sarah, Tina, Tyra and Ryan that helped my family with high service standards.  The Front Office Manager – Guest relations, Ms. Diana Brewer is very friendly, trustworthy and helpful person. She help us to prepare my family member some special care, such as wheelchair borrowing and room arrangement. This is a very special place! We cannot say enough great things about this hotel and it’s staff. Highly…",50
"Stay 1 night only. I got room upg to Eiffel Tower view. Huge bathroom and room. Easy to go everywhere and big shopping mall etc all connected. Staff friendly, clean and nice room. Free macau hotel bus etc etc Not too expensive, good value! ",50
I am currently staying in Conrad Macau. I will be checking out tomorrow...but i am so impressed by the hotel that i could not resist writing a review. Fantastic service and  grt suite. Wht a lovely view from my room of eifel tower.  All the staff are ready to do anything to make u feel special and at ease. The evening turn down service is a lovely touch to its overall package of luxury and top class service. A fantastic option in macau...and i would definitely return back without any doubt. Conrad macau stays true to the Conrad legacy.,50
"I enjoyed another amazing stay at the Conrad Macao from 11/10/19-11/17/19. Seeing familiar faces upon check-in made it feel like returning home. Much thanks to Yumi, Emman, Ivan, Lee, and the rest of all the Conrad family for another memorable stay! My friend was with me on this trip and she was extremely impressed! While she is excited to bring her family with her on a next trip, I am looking forward to another stay soon!   Conrad Macao definitely sets a high bar for other hotels to follow! ",50
"The Conrad Macao is located at the centre of Macao, which is can be accessed within 15mins of taxi when travelling by ferry (via Taipa Port) and by air.   Conrad Macao especially values its frequent travelers and HH members. The Guest Service Manager Ea Enriquez emailed me one week in advance to my stay. Staffs of the executive lounge are extremely friendly and professional. It is very nice that they are able to recognize me because of my past visits. As always, they upgraded me to a suite.   The dinning services provided by the lounge are also fabulous. The afternoon tea deserts are fabulous when compared with the other same-level hotels. Its breakfast also features an a la carte menu fron which we may order.   I am also impressed my the management and the construction team of…",50
"I stayed at Sheraton which is just next door the night before, and I found Conrad being a much better option - relatively newer and cleaner decore - smaller hotel (with less rooms, and much shorter queue during check-in and check-out) - better decore Reception staff is friendly and professional.  Bear in mind that they have some renovations - but it didn't bother me much.  I would recommend this hotel to other fellow travellers.",50
"The room, room service, staffs were all superb. Every single details was very well attended, that sent decorated cake for my birthday. They also assisted with my last minute transportation request, front desk and concierge always available all the time with all my arrangements.   I had stayed in many five star hotels around the world but this was thus far the best experience I ever had !",50
"We spent two nights in this property using our HHonour Points normally one would expect the run of the mill room and services, but to our surprise our stay was impeccable.   Starting from our check in experience: as soon as we got out of the taxi the bell hop and the receptionist made a point that we were welcomed and at the reception we were offered a better view room and the duty manager took us to the room and offered us a welcome drink in the Executive Lounge, this was refreshing after a long trip. When we reached the room all the amenities were all at right places and some welcome tit bits. In the first day, the Duty Manager Ms Ea Enriquez noticed that our stay was celebrating the birthday and she offered us a small birthday cake and two tickets to ride the Gondola in the…",50
"We had an overnight stay here in Conrad with my family. Staffs were very corteous and will always guide you on the hotel facilities. Have lots of amenities to offers. Definitely worth it !   Sauna, Jacuzzi and Swimming pool :)",50
"The Executive Lounge is wonderful, the club team has shown a superior level of care to us. The stay was very good overall and the Conrad Macao has illustrated what should a luxury brand offer to its guests.",50
"I stayed here before and loved the service thinking, next time I will bring my family. All 6 of us stayed in 2 rooms for 2 nights and the service is phenomenal. Troy made sure our son got a treat for his 21st bday. Nan and Glenda at the pool were awesome. Dayo in the breakfast place was just wonderful. I am impressed with the services. My son wants to go back.",50
"Our second stay at this Conrad was as memorable as our previous stay two years ago. As a Hilton Gold member, the Executive Level service team provided outstanding service by remembering us personally and addressing us by name.  The hotel is not new, but is kept in excellent condition and the rooms and suites are spacious and luxurious. The Executive Lounge is accommodating and service oriented. This Conrad is on par with any Ritz Carlton and Four Seasons.",50
"Have stayed here many times already and always want to return! The hotel itself is wonderful but it's especially the amazing staff that works here that makes this hotel so special.   The staff members remember me by name (even when it has taken me several months from my previous visit), the suites are gorgeous, the atmosphere of the Hilton Hhonors lounge is cosy and nice, the pool and spa areas are beautiful... What a lovely it is!  I want to express my most sincerest thanks to all the wonderful members of the executive lounge staff: executive lounge front office gentlemen Emman and Ivan, head waiters Tyra and Sarah, waiters Sunshine and Dome... what a great individuals you have working for you!

Great location and very convenient to travel around in the city. Walking distance to explore the shopping. I would like to Nominate Achin your team member whom took a great care of us feel like I come back home!,50
"In the middle of the main casino action, therefore perfect for walking around other resort attractions, after visiting the others in the area the Conrad is maintained to a higher standard and the staff are much more attentive without being overbearing. Pool area is lovely and is peaceful which was surprising. All the restroom, changing, gym facilities are very well run and maintained. F&B is very good with great selections for dinner and breakfast, a buffet that serves hot food by the time you are back at your table is rare.   ",50
Have a high expectation and you will still get more than your expectation! Room was perfect with updated TV sets. Staff also carried out their duties perfectly. Definitely one of the best hotels in Macau! ,50

"Me and my wife were invited to pay a visit to Macao on 05Oct to see the fireworks festival and to spend a weekend there for foods and leisure. We stayed with the Conrad Macao which is located in the center of the casino areas and surrounded by all the famous hotels. Taking a walk around the area by night is really wonderful and relax in comparing with the excitement inside the casinos.   The room we had was in the 13th floor and with a good view of the area. The room is huge, clean and quiet and with all the things we need. The staff at the front desk and we met in the corridor were very polite despite that the room could only be released to us after 3pm. Eating at the hotel may not be a good idea as the famous street for foods, Rua do Cunha (官也街), is just 20mins walk from the…",50
"Not our first time in Macau but our first staying at Conrad. Well, am glad we made the correct choice of staying at Conrad after reading about the rave reviews for this hotel. The property is located in the central cotai strip which interlink a few hotels together. Needless to say, it is also directly link to all the different shopping areas. Not your average shoppings though as they are all high end luxury. The famous Venetian is also around 2 mins walk. All the malls are sheltered so is a good thing if it rains.   Now coming to the room, we were upgraded to a King suite. Wow, it blew our mind away upon reaching the room. It was huge! There's a separate movie room, a dining area good for 4, big sofa in the living and a separate bedroom with a very spacious toilet. Even the…",50
"Hotel was great. Service was first class hotel has great facilities nice pool. Hotel is in an easy location just outside the hustle of Orchid Road where we have stayed previously. Easy access to the metro, there is a great mall across the road,  the hop on hop off buss starts around the corner. Would recommend for families or couple’s. ",50
"This has much larger rooms than Sheraton just a walk away and the interior n exterior look great. The location is perfect for a walk around many attractions in the area. The food is great, staff is helpful as well. There is a great shoping area on the ground floor.",50
The Hotel is well positioned in the main strip of hotels. There is a free shuttle pick-up from the airport as well. There are lots of public transport options from which to explore the delights of the City and Macau's historic Portugese past. The hotel is very nicely appointed and has one of the best Executive Lounges we've ever been to. All of the staff were extremely friendly and very helpful. I would like to make a very special mention for Executive Floor Reception as they provided an execellent service and made our stay extra special. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again.,50
The quality of service and good standard of the facility always met my expectation. All the staff at executive lounge are polite and welcome guest with sincere attitude.  Very helpful to all the guest and for sure I will book this hotel again.,50
"Staff we encountered at restaurant, front desk and Housekeeping were very friendly and helpful. Room was spacious and beautiful with variety of high quality bathroom amenities. Cleanliness throughout the room was excellent!",50
"This is our 3rd stay at the Conrad Macau. We stumbled at this property while touring the Pearl river delta in January 2019. We were so impressed that we made a detour in April 2019 during a tour of northern China, just to have an opportunity to stay there. We stayed at the Conrad for the third time and again we were more than impressed. Ivan greeted me by name as soon as I walked in. From that moment, I knew that everything will be better than perfect. Emman also greeted me by name when he appeared later while I was still checking in. In the club lounge, we were again greeted and welcomed by name. The staff there were wonderful as ever, Ryan, Tina, Dome and Sunshine. Sunshine even remembered bits from our conversation during our previous stay. It was very nice to see that the…",50
"This is my first time to write comment to a hotel after my little girl just asked me when we will go Macau again and mentioned a staff name there, yes she still remember, even   though our last stay in Conrad Macau is almost 1 year ago. To be honest Conrad has qualified but not super good hardware rather than other 5 stars hotels. But for me as a travel love, the main way to remember a hotel is the service and hospitality I feel from hotel staffs. We met a receptionist Miss Charlie there and was taken care by her. My daughter and wife like her a lot by her humor and sincere way of communication. After she knew we were going to spend 2018 Christmas holiday in Paris, she also wrote me a little memo with her recommendation of scenic spots and tips of traveling there based on her…",50
Stayed for 2 nights end of Aug and was really impressed with Conrad Macau. Okay as a 5 star hotel you would expect the usual standard but the Conrad staff really impressed me alot. All of them are really professional and nice and I have to especially thank Fiona at the front desk who has make me feel so welcome and make my stay in Conrad a wonderful and special one. ,50
"Thank you for the kind service of the front desk reception!  He kindly spoke to me in English He asked just enough questions He showed me to the room and the Conrad bear and other hotel gifts in the room  Moreover, he unveil the Tour Eiffel to me by pulling the window curtain He remembers reserving restaurant table for my dinner after showing me the way to the hotel room and to give briefing about the room  For those who like Entertaunment, the hotel is just next to the casino.    For those who love eating and shopping, there are many in the shopping mall just next to the hotel.  It costs about PTC93 from ferry pier to the hotel  ie USD12.6 for single trip.  It is among the new hotel cluster in Cotai, away from the centre of Macao but comfortable shopping environment.   ",50
"I arrived with my family to our 1st stop of 3 weeks holiday.  From the moment we went out of the van they recognized us and used our name it was amazing.  Than at the reception and the executive lounge on so on, it was a true luxury feeling.  The view from the room was very nice, excellent lounge nice pool and fitness center.  The hotel has a direct access to the mall and it’s very convenient. ",50
"Spent three days here in an a suite (diamond upgrade) after one night in the Sheraton and two nights in the Venetian. Of those, I actually liked the Sheraton better than the Venetian, but the Conrad won hands down in all regards. The service was amazing in the Lounge and by housekeeping. The amenities such as the robes were also top notch. My ""room"" had a huge living room, separate room that was sort of a rec room, bedroom, and large bathroom. Was perfect for business meetings. I stay in Conrads several times per year and they are always classy, but I was truly impressed with this one.",50
Nice service for our couple occasion. Room is clean. Bed and pillows are very comfortable. It’s a REAL Nonsmoking room! I would like to come back to Conrad Macau next time. Thanks for the Conrad duck and the candy.,50
"If you are looking for an unique experience for a special one or with loved ones, Conrad is the one among all!  The room was super clean and tidy. I appreciate their traditonal that their staff will put your bed sheet down at the evening and a Conrad bear sits on your pillow.  We had a lovely stay at Conrad for a birthday celebration.  Thank you Yumi Onuki and your team for making our trip memorable and special.",50
"I was a gold member and when I check in, no room upgrade was given - which was perfectly fine if the hotel was full but the way that receptionist told me (frank? I forgot the exact name) makes people feel so bad and not respected.  Room was clean and had a good view. Gifts were cute yet 1. Handy phone was not working, no internet connection when it was brought out of hotel 2. Shower head holder has to be fixed, it falls suddenly when I was taking a shower, luckily I was not hit on my head  Hopefully the experience will be better when I come next time",30
"The place is very homy yet elegant. It helped me unwind in such a short period of time. That was a very relaxing.and comfortable experience.Accessible to everything you could possibly need, shopping is just few steps away.",30
"Just finish 6 weeks long vacation in China, China blocks everything on Internet  so i have to wait until now to write a review.  We have a great time stay at this hotel.  Thank Ea Enriquez and the staff making our stay unforgettable. A cake was sent to our room for our anniversary.   I am also  diamond member and travel with family of 4 got upgrade to a suite with huge connect room at a lounge floor. The rooms are very clean, bed was very comfortable, huge selection in breakfast buffet.  We will definitely stay here again next time visit Macau.",50
"As a Conrad, it lives up to it's name. Location is ideal for those venturing in yo the casinos.. that's virtually everyone. The entrance of the hotel is a bit confusing with all the stores and casinos around. But that's a drawback that can be easily ignored. The rooms are beautiful, clean, spacious with a lovely view of macao. The reception staff was kind enough to give us as early check in because of our long journey to get there ",50
"Like all the other reviews - this hotel is perfect. Its not cheap but its worth every penny. The check-in was super smooth with the check-in agent then escorting you to the room and giving you are rundown of the room (you can deny the service if you want) but it was a nice touch.  the room was immaculate, clean and crisp. the room had free water a toiletries.   the room was quiet and i had a nice view of the Parisian hotel.  Another excellent feature was the turn down service at 8pm. A hotel staff member comes in and places the slippers next to your bed, on a small mat with water and a glass on the side table. its a small attention to detail that is a really great touch.   Worth the money !!",50
"We needed a place to stay for a 2 day business trip. A colleague recommended the conrad having stayed there before. We was not disappointed, the hotel is amazing. Very luxurious and clean throughout.  The room had a great view over macau on the 34th floor.  The hotel has everything you need and all the staff were very friendly and helpful.  We had a good trip.",50
"Stayed at this hotel and felt like a king by the way the staff treated me from the first step to my last step inside this establishment.  As a Diamond member, you will check in upstairs in the executive lounge and have snacks in their executive lounge.  Ea Enriquez and their staff will take great care of you, whether it be getting you into a nicer room or booking your fares back to HKG airport.  The hotel itself is situated in a great area on top of a mall full of anything your wallet wants to buy.  There were many restaurants as well.  The breakfast buffet they offered is operated by a restaurant inside the mall, it's about a 2 min walk indoors from the hotel lobby and is bigger than a lot of place's dinner buffets.  They had absolutely everything you could possibly eat there!!…",50
"This hotel is absolutely wonderful, perfect location, close to all tourist attractions and the airport and the rooms are incredibly spacious and luxurious but where this hotel really shines is the service, everyone is friendly and incredibly helpful Luffy on the front desk was especially helpful in my stay.   The executive lounge is in a class of its on, such a wide range of high quality foods in all hours of service (plus the mojitos and orange juice were really delicious!) But the service is lovely the staff  were very friendly and always exceeding my expectations, glasses cleared instantly and staff were always so interesting to talk to, I especially liked Sarah and Frand As they were particularly friendly and helpful.(Frand knew I was leaving early and even had breakfast…",50
"Recently spent 3 nights at this amazing property on the strip in Macau.  This was our 2nd stop on a 7 city 19 day whirlwind holiday taking in Asia and Europe.  We were very fortunate to be upgraded to an executive suite which was  unbelievable - wow. The suite had 4 tvs, 3 lounge suites, 2 toilets and 1 dining room table - 104sq metres of luxury.  The team at Conrad are so welcoming and are always willing to help with any request. Yumi and her team looked after my family and we were treated like royalty. Glenda (at the pool) would welcome my son and I every morning with a glass of warm water with a slice of lemon -  a little touch that meant so much.  We didn’t want to leave however we had to continue with our trip and i cannot wait to get back to the Conrad and experience that…",50
"The impressive point of the stay at this hotel was the club lounge. As a diamond member, we could use the club lounge during our stay. From check-in to check-out, the service at the club lounge was so special. The staffs at the lounge always mentioned my name whenever I went there or met them. Especially, Emman made us happy and fully supported us. The birthday cake for my wife was so special and very delicious. The quality and the taste of foods at the club lounge including breakfast, afternoon tea, and evening cocktail were better than outside restaurants. We’re highly satisfied.",50
"Conrad Macao is at Sands City, Cotai Central. It is one of the three hotels, including Sheraton and Holiday Inn, at the Sands City. It is a nice hotel and good service But, it is not my cup of tea. I had stayed at this hotel about 8 months ago and came back mainly because of the Hilton Group Loyalty Programme or otherwise, plenty of good hotels around for choices. I enjoyed so much my stay with Conrad in particular the benefits and member's privilege as a Gold Member in my previous experience with but not on this recent stay. I am no longer interested in the Loyalty Programme and prepare to quit my Gold Membership. I won't come back again. Last but not the least, I would to say thank you to the waiters and waitress of the Executive Lounge.  They were nice and courteous. Their…",40
"Conrad Macau is one of the best Hotels and the most fabulous Conrad Hotel I have ever stayed and hotel. Their service meets all of the standards of being a luxurious Level hotel. Even though my stay was during the Chinese Labor Holiday, they still upgraded my room as the recognition of me being a Hilton Gold Member. Even though the occupancy rate was nearly 100% during my stay, I didn’t see any part of their service that is lower than my exceptional level. Special appreciation to Ms. Onuki-the Head of Guest Relations-who greeted me at Checkin. I will definitely visit that hotel in the near future and will recommend it to my friends and family. ",50
Everything is perfect. Breakfast is really food. They really emphasize on quality over quantity. Will return for sure. One of the best hotels in Macau for sure. Nothing to complain. Staff are always eager to assist you. Thank you.,50
"Room clean, staff provided good service and fast response if any requested, staff always have smiling. The location is good and convenience to get transport and shopping, walking distance to few casino.",50
"We stayed at the Conrad Macao recently and it was one of the best hotel stays we have experienced. From our arrival at the hotel and being escorted to our room, to our departure with the concierge, all our encounters with the staff showed that this place really cares about their guests. Can't wait to come back for a longer stay. Rooms are somewhat dated though well maintained, and food and beverage offerings can be a little ordinary. ",50
"Spent 2 nights at Conrad Macao. I arrived with Cotai Waterjet from Hong Kong and took Contai Central shuttle bus which just took around 10mins. The shuttle dropped us at Holiday Inn lobby which is just next door to the Conrad's lobby. At the moment the resort is renovating and loud banging noise can be heard if you are standing at the porte cochere of the hotel.  Check-in was very swift with Vincent and since the room was not ready when we arrived at 11am, we decided to roam around Cotai Central which was linked to the Venetian. After late breakfast, we asked concierge for bus option to Coloane and he gave all the information. Bus system in Macau is easy to navigate and pretty cheap at MOP6 per ride per person. Upon returning, we are glad to get our room. As a Hilton Honors…",50
"Conrad really impress me with their hospitallity and their  wonderful room and room services.The room is spacious and clean. The host personally lead us to the room and showed us the room facilities is a nice surprise. A cake in the room with lighter and candle for my brother's birthday is beyond my expectation. At any rate, I will recommend this hotel to any person I knew.",50
"There is a reason why this hotel has a perfect 5 rating on TripAdvisor and is a Forbes 5 star rated hotel. Simply extraordinary service, especially at the Club Lounge. All associates of the hotel should be very proud of what they have created here.",50
"This is a great hotel and the staffs are so friendly and make our stay very unforgettable. I traveled with my parents to celebrate their wedding anniversary. As a diamond member, I contacted Yumi Onuki San first to ask about the benefit we can have in this hotel and she responded so quickly. When we arrived, they upgraded our room to a spacious suite and we got access to the lounge and also get the chance for two of us to try breakfast downstairs in the grand orbit cafeteria. Breakfasts both in the lounge and cafeteria are wonderful. We also try the hotel's Chinese fine dinning restaurant, Dynasty 8, which is SO GOOD. I'll definitely recommend this hotel if you visit Macau!",50
"We have been 4 times now in Macau Conrad, and every time our stay is more fabulous than the latest one !! We still wonder how they do it !!!! From the very first time the Staff was unbelievably, warm, thoughtful, friendly, helpful, bringing the famous Oriental Hospitality to a top level !! Every year we celebrate our anniversary at the Conrad, and of course every year it is even better !!! we celebrate it the whole stay !! The Staff is master in pampering HHdiamond members. They all treat us like we are close family !!! And this time, I arrived with a broken elbow. But no problem, Yumi, head of Guest Relations, together with Alex who translated when needed, took us (me and my wife) to the hospital. Beside arranging doctor's appointments, they took care not only of transportation…",50
"The Conrad Brand is the same anyplace in the world.  It doesn't matter where you are.  You get the same service, same amenities, that you expect from Conrad.  I stay with Conrad everyplace they are available in the world as I know I they will meet my expectations.  Macau was certainly no exception.",50
"This was a point-redemption getaway with family and despite it was a redeemed room, the hospitality I received from the hotel is no-less than a paid customer.   As a frequent traveler, I have been to many luxury hotel around the globe and the stay at Conrad Macao was definitely one of the best ones.  Special call out to Ms. Enriquez from the Guest Relationships team; she has made my stay beyond expectations. Her attention to details is top notch and her efforts on ensuring everything is highly appreciated.  Conrad Macao is now my top choice for accommodation whenever I am back in the area.  Thanks again to Ms. Enriquez for making this a remarkable stay.  這是與家人的積分兌換之旅，儘管這是一個兌換的房間，我從酒店收到的款待不亞於付費客戶。  作為一名經常旅行的人，我去過全球許多豪華酒店，而澳門康萊德酒店絕對是最好的酒店之一。  特別感謝來自客戶關係團隊的Enriquez 女士;…",50
A brilliant hotel. Welcomed by Ivan and the Club team.   The hotel service was impeccable. The team really couldn’t have done enough. Extremely attentive.    The suite was just perfect. The club lounge staff were all amazing and the food and drink offerings were good.   Another hotel that is definitely up there!   Thank you guys for a brilliant trip. ,50
"I had my first conrad experience at the Conrad HK in 2013, but didn't get the joy of the Conrad Macau until 2015 and couldn't have been more impressed.  It is a terrific property with great staff and the best executive lounge of any hotel I have stayed in world wide.  Service is impeccable, upgrade availability is terrific, and the rooms are spacious and wonderful.  My biggest complaint about this property is having to leave.",50
"Visited Macau while on a trip to Hong Kong.    Took the Catoi SHuttle over to Macau.   Short walk to the bus/ shuttle that took us to the hotel.  (Macau's Pier Terminal signage isn't good.  NOT the Conrad's fault)  Arrived to the hotel... It's located on 'The Strip'.  Was taken up to the Executive Floor to be checked in. (I'm Hilton Honors Gold)  The check-in was fast, efficiemt and very professional.    Kudos to Owen & Lee.     They even upgarded me to magnificent suite.  (And, i'm only Gold) The suite was incredible.  The food in the Executive Lounge was very good.  The staff... even better.     Shoutout to Tyra, Ryan & Sunshine.   Tyra is a Hilton GM in the making.  (Seriously.)  Her attnetion to detail in unmatched.   I will definitely return to the Conrad on my next visit…",50
"An excellent hotel. The lounge was great this included the breakfast, high tea and cocktail drinks, the staff there were fantastic...  The gym has everything you would need and its open 24 hours a day, which was ideal for me.  The guestroom was very spacious and clean.  I would definitely recommend the Conrad Macau Cotai, and I'll be looking forward to getting a similar experience from the Conrad Singapore when I go there in August... ",50
"We stayed here previously and had an excellent time. The facilities are good and fancy. The buffet menu are also good they serve new and fresh dishes that are cooked by their awesome chefs. Their staffs are very accommodating, friendly and easy to talked to, especially Lenie and Jervis they are the one who assist and bring what we need, they also assure that our lunch experience was be a memorable for us. Lenie seems to be pretty and kind, she always smile and she has a jolly personality. I like her. Other than her, all staffs are good and nice. Thank you Conrad for a great lunch experience! I hope you continue to serve better.",50
"I read good reviews of Conrad Macau n looked forward to it. However it does not have the wow factor.  I was here for 2 nights in April. Upon checking in at 11am, the room was not ready which was fine. I only wanted to get the portable WiFi as we were going out but due to some hotel policies, the exec lounge staff were not flexible about it. They insisted that they can only give us the portable WiFi when we are checked in and they can't check us in until house keeping us done which will be like after 2 hours.  The other negative is the marble floor on the bathroom is very slippery and rooms are a bit dated.   Apart from that, the upgraded room given was hugh and has a good view. The Dynasty 8 restaurant serves very good food. Breakfast is served in a restaurant which is a short…",40
"We stayed here previously and had an excellent time, but when we returned over Easter, it had unfortunately taken a turn for the worse.   Pros: hotel room was great, functional, with lots of space and very quiet. The gym and pool were fantastic, equipment was aplenty and worked well, sauna and jacuzzi was great as well. Glenda and Shirley at the gym reception area were fantastic.  Cons: Food and beverage.  First, room service was terrible, which is a shame because it used to be very very good especially for vegetarians. Now, the portion sizes have drastically reduced, and so have the vegetarian options. Despite informing Arthur, F&B director, he apologised and we were still charged the full price of the meal upon check out by Tony, the front desk manager. Second, breakfast is…",30
"I took this trip with my parents. My mom knows about the nice treatment I get when I am at this hotel such as the huge room upgrade and extra amenities. I am a Hilton diamond member and frequent guest of this hotel. However, on this last trip, I felt it was average in some ways. Ivan who is like a dear long lost friend can’t be faulted. He has always been very kind and he is the only one who remembers me every time I go back to the hotel. It says a lot about the other employees at the executive check in lounge and the F&B staff of the lounge. Besides Ivan from the executive team, no warm welcome or recognition from the others.   Even when we were having an afternoon snack in the Conrad Lounge, we were ignored the whole time. It seems that they were busy attending to other…",30
The very best Conrad Hotel I've stayed in so far. The lounge staffs are friendly and happy to fulfill your needs at any minute.  High quality food provided both in lounge and breakfast. Great location for entertainment and shopping.,50
"Visiting Macau over a long weekend. Having arrived early at 11.30am I reached out to the Club Lounge who were very accommodating and found me a room for earlier check-in. Thank you to Owen.   The room was spacious, clean and my requested high floor had a great view of the Eiffel Tower of the Parisian hotel. The afternoon tea and breakfast were also very well presented.   Special thanks goes to Ivan Zhong upon my departure I needed some help with my large boxed purchase. He kindly helped find some tape and ensured it was securely fastened for my onward journey.   An enjoyable and memorable stay. Exceptional service from the Club Lounge.",50
"位於金沙城中心，地理位置非常的好。 一樓就是賭場跟購物中心以及餐廳，下樓就可以逛街。 接送部分可以直接做機場的車子，非常的方便。 早餐，以及行政酒廊的餐點品質都很好。 特別感謝顧客聯繫的Ea，可以針對我的需求調整出對應的房間。 聯繫的非常好。 Location in the central of Cotai strip, right accross Venetian.  Basically locate at Sand Center with shopping mall and restaurant in the lower floor.  Very good communication before check in to confirm my requirement. Able to identify my reward night and paid night and arrange appropriate room according to my requirement.  Breakfast at Orbit buffet, variety selection and quality food.  Also great for happy hour food and beverage selection.  Special thanks to guest relation supervisor Ea Enriquez to help arrange prior check in.",50
My second stay at the hotel was just as good as the first. Excellent service by all the staff and they were always there to help. Special thanks Ea and Owen since I had some prior requests. I am looking forward to another return trip soon.,50
Wonderful hotel! We were upgraded to a lovely large suite and exec lounge access. Room has all the amenities and more that you would require.   Staff really went above and beyond the expectations. Central location for all you would want to see in Macao.   ,50
"Great hotel with amazing staff. Great shuttle service from the Macau Taipa Terminal after on a hour trip from Hong Kong. The team at Conrad Macau was so welcoming, caring and helpful. The service was perfect and the upgrade to the Eiffel tower view were most welcome. The room was huge with a turn down service. Located near all the casinos and a great free shuttle located into Macau located nearby. Overall an amazing hotel that I will be recommending to friends.",50
"As same as the previous review of St. Regis Macau. Conrad Macau is also located right at the centre of Cotai area. Inside a huge resort complex (Sands Cotai Central), no matter stay there simply for shopping, entertainment, huge range of dining options or just relaxation.  Since I arrive the hotel quite late around 8pm. And ask to request late check-out. FO mentioned the rooms will be quite pack on the next day so that no luck to extend my stay.  The room is decent. But it’s have a strong smell once I step into the room which I guess is the in-room dining of previous guest. So I call FO to look for another room for me. It’s take around 25mins. The hotel staff bring another set of key for me for changing a room on the lower floor. It’s already 9PM something when I can settle down…",40
Overall good! The reception staffs and Concierge staffs are very helpful.   The food quality in their cafe just average but the staffs are very polite and attentive.   The only bad thing is the security officers in the lift area. Quite impolite！,40
"Convenient and free shuttle from Cotai Harbour to Hotel.  Fast check in and nice welcome drinks at the Conrad Club Lounge. It was a pleasure the staff Emmen introduced and helped us a lot during the stay, we had a great experience to celebrate our anniversary.   Highly recommend for the trip in Macau.",50
"I, my wife & son (20) spent a couple of days in Macau in March and chose the Conrad. As a Hilton Honors Gold card holder we always get free breakfasts as a perk plus usually an upgrade. But this time we ""struck gold"".  The reception at Check in was very friendly and speedy, all good and so we went to our room with a bellboy in tow with our luggage. However, when we entered the room, the room had a heavy smoke smell which we hated. As non-smokers all our lives, staying in a room like this was unacceptable so we all went back down to reception to ask for another room.  Luckily Renee, the Reception Manager, was there and she apologized and upgraded us to a 2 Queen Bed Deluxe Suite which was unbelievable! I don't need to say too much but just look at the pictures I posted with this…",50
"I made a reservation of two beds room with view of Eiffel Tower (Macau). Positive: Staffs are very helpful and nice. We can feel that they pay attention to guest, like simple say ""Hi', ""Good Evening"" . You can feel that they express in sincere. This make us feel comfortable from check-in process, personal services, check-out, dining experience. Negative: The price of room is quite expensive and the 70% of view from room is the room of another hotel. So made us half of curtain keep close. Overall, we enjoy the time in stay.",30
"It has been one of the best and most memorable hotel stays. The team at Conrad Macau was so welcoming, caring and helpful. The service was perfect!  I would especially like to say a big thank-you to Ms Yumi Onuki, Head of Guest Relations, who took excellent care of my family before and during the trip. My family and I feel so warm. Thanks to Yumi,  our trip was very pleasant, enjoyable and full of surprises. My family, especially the kids, enjoyed the trip a lot.  Another big thank-you to the staff at the executive lounge and front desk, who was very welcoming and helpful. Also, I would also like to compliment Mr Forest Ma, who works at Orbit Restaurant. His service was excellent -  served with heart and with his smiles. It is indeed the first time I have received such good…",50
"This was my fourth or fifth time staying at Conrad Macau. As usual, we got upgraded to a double bed suite due to our Hilton Gold status. Room was big and well appointed. Children were provided children amenities set, which included baby shampoo, bath and toothbrushes.   We celebrated my Son’s birthday and Conrad Macau has kindly provided us a complimentary chocolate mousse cake.   Again, the executive lounge team never failed to impress us every time we stayed at Conrad Macau. The staff were very friendly and breakfast, while limited in selection, tasted great! They served made to order eggs and noodles as well as dim sum. Will definitely stay again the next time I visit Macau.",50
"We stayed at Conrad Macau in January 2019. We were so impressed that we decided to come back in April 2019. Yumi and Ea are very helpful liaising by email prior arrival. Stephen from concierge kindly explained how to transfer from HKIA. On arrival, we were greeted in the club lounge reception by Emman, who informed us that as diamond members we were given an upgrade to a deluxe suite. He then tried to find us a suite with view of the Eiffel Tower (double upgrade! Thanks Emman). The club lounge is amazing. Tina, Tyra, Ryan and sunshine are always so pleasant and always address us by our names. They even direct us to our table each time we went up there. They also remembered our drinks. The breakfast in the club lounge has a nicer feel to it as it feels more cosy and private. The…",50
Stayed in the hotel for 4 nights and it was great experience. Room is very clean and quiet. Staff was super helpful and friendly and I felt very grateful. Room service is very frequent (although a little too frequent to me...). The casino downstairs is not fancy but I wasn't there for gambling and there are a few others in the Sand mall anyways.,50
"Went here for a 3 day business trip. The check-in was a nightmare, as I was told to wait until 3pm (2 hours) though I had arrived for the event. In the end I was given an upgrade, apparently not given to anyone else. Until my colleague told me he received one too- but into a room that was clearly converted from smoking status.  the staff were aplenty, but customer care was quite lacking. There was no acknowledgement of personal preferences/names- you were lost amongst the numbers.  The breakfast selection was decent, but nothing particularly notable.   Though it shares the building with a Holiday Inn, the location was otherwise good.   Their casino(s) also didn't have English speaking staff and it was just unnecessarily difficult to navigate.  For Conrad, I really had higher…",40

"Suite is well maintained, very clean and comfortable. Amenities are nicely scented. The bath duck is a nice touch also. Staff are very pleasant and welcoming, focused on making the guest comfortable. Great location within Cotai.  ",40
"I enjoyed another amazing stay at the Conrad Macao from 04/07-04/10. It was just unfortunate that we could not stay longer as all the rooms at the Conrad Macao were sold out on 04/05-04/06. As a Hilton Diamond member, I received a complimentary upgrade to a Deluxe Suite. When I checked in on the 39th floor, I was happy to see familiar faces. As always, the Executive Lounge staff are personable and professional. They represent the epitome of hospitality. My nephew had a special treat waiting for him when he arrived to stay with us. Thank you Ea, Emman, and Ivan for making my stay a memorable one once again! See you soon!",50
"We have visited Macau many times and this has been the best hotel we have stayed at. The staff are wonderful, the rooms are spacious, very comfortable and the executive lounge on the 39th floor truly represent the premium hospitality.  From the moment we arrived until the moment we left we were treated extremely well. As a Hilton Diamond member, received a complimentary upgrade to a King Deluxe Suite and were guided to the room. The room was top-notch with great amenities.  Well done to the GM to have such a strong team of motivated staff giving their very best on the job. Special thanks to Ms. EA Enriquez, Yumi and Tyra for going the extra mile to ensure we enjoyed our stay the fullest. We will soon be returning Conrad Macau for our 4th stay.",50
"Conrad Macao is located between St Regis and Sheraton, and the same building is shared with Holiday Inn. Rooms are spacious and in prime condition, only wish there were more power outlets at least on bedside.   Service and staff was excellent. We were impressed by the cleaning lady and the way she cleaned and organized the room after our mess. Breakfast is bit of a walk away on mall side, but the selection of food is really good.   Conrad is part of the Sands Cotai and if you booked on hotel website you are eligible to buy a buffet pass from the concierge (wechat account needed). It’s a 24h pass that let’s you eat four meals at Conrad, Sheraton, Parisian and other surrounding hotel buffet restaurants at a fixed rate of MOP688 plus tax.   I gave one short of five stars as the…",40
Thank you to Yumi san & Mr.Zhou for another outstanding experience at the Conrad Cotai. Our entire team truly enjoyed the wonderful experience. We look forward to our next trip. You think of everything and your guests really appreciate it!,50
"Everything in this hotel is almost perfect, including location, facilities, and service quality.  I would give maximum rating, but recommend to have at least  one bigger swimming pool instead of multiple small ones, but the pool facilities and service exceeded my expectation.  I definitely hope they could be found in more cities or locations, this is our first experience with Conrad.",50
"Dear Owen and Kyile,    I was stayed for 1night from April-1st to April-2nd. I would like to appreciate for deeply care during stay in hotel. We have that your kindly instroduction and share detail of information about hotel facilities, so our family trip was perfect during spend for our vacation in Conrad. It makes us feel that would like to visit in the future.  Once again, thankyou for warm greeting and deeply care.  Thanks, Areum",50
Hotel is centrally located.  The staff were very friendly and always eager to please.  The breakfast was sumptuous.  Our suite was very spacious with beautiful furnishing.  Enjoyed out stay at the hotel very much.,50
"The service at this hotel is outstanding, despite being a relatively large hotel. Although I have never stayed at the hotel before the staff in the Executive Club lounge recognised me the moment I walked in and even the staff at the ground floor restaurant knew my name. Rooms are very comfortable and food is of a very high standard. I really enjoyed staying here and would recommend the hotel to anyone.",50
"Every aspect of our stay was perfect, from the excellent check in customer service staff who followed up all during our stay, the attentive concierge, and housekeeping to the spacious rooms, room cleanliness and facilities, excellent gym and so on. The location is superb, connected to all of Cotai and walking distance to the real , old world delight  of Taipa Village with its excellent  Portuguese restaurants, and Taipa town",50
"Ms. Yumi Onuki reached out soon after I booked a stay to celebrate my parent's 35th anniversary. She was very courteous and genuine. When I told her I would be arriving later than my parents and their friends, the front desk staff took care of my party at check-in. It's rare these days for a hotel to reach out to guests to personally welcome them, far in advance of the arrival date. Ms. Onuki does a stellar job as head of guest relations. There are tons of luxury hotels in Macao, but I highly recommend Conrad Macao!",50
"I guarantee that No whrere is better than Macao Conrad.   Delexe Suite(Upgraded as a loyal member of Hilton)   It was my 3rd experience in Macao. I will choose again and again.  View toward to Venetian Hotel though. Still It was fantastic experience.  Clean, Well arranged, KInd, Polite attitude, Quick in a rush, Professional  Neat check-in service for the loyal member. Nice afternoon tea time and Cocktail time   I can't forget about the Hotel's support to customers, My mom lost wallet in Casino. But, The member in Hotel helped us find the wallet. Thank you again.   For sure, I will choose Macao Conrad again for my next trip to Macao. I definetly will visit again when the Water show in there.   안녕하세요 한국에서 온 여행자 입니다. 다시 선택해도 마카오 콘래드에 숙박할거 같습니다.   한국 트립어드바이저는 한국어 리뷰를 남기지 않으면 등록이 되지…",50
"This was our best ever visit to this Hotel which is one that we already loved. Still it makes such a difference to have reached Gold status and to have been upgraded to the Club level. This was fortuitous as we could totally enjoy our 28th Wedding Anniversary. We loved the suite that we were upgraded to (3326). It had so many appealing features and even boasted fine views of the Cotal Strip. There was a spacious TV room to the side and a large bathtub with pint sized TV above in the large walk in ensuite bathroom off the bedroom. However, what really made our stay totally special was the kindness and thoughtfulness of the Club Lounge staff s well as the general excellence of the food, beverages and service there in the Club Lounge on the 39th Floor. Ms. Ea Enriquez was amazing…",50
"This is really a 5 star hotel. “The” place to be in crowded ( mostly weekends) Macao. Located at the Cotai, equivalent at Las Vegas Strip. Shopping centers, restaurants, lot of action around. Some shows too. Of course casinos at the hotel and at all around, but these Casinos are mostly for oriental customers ( mostly Chinese) in my opinion. The Conrad: Great restaurant, service, pools, gym, spa...etc. Big and clean rooms with all the amenities. As an elite Hhonors member I received a “royal “ treatment, Ivan received me with a cold drink and escorted to my (upgraded) luxurious suite. The executive lounge is really one of the best I have ever been. The decoration, ambience and service outstanding, breakfast superb, happy hour with great food and selected wines, in one word,…",50
"A simply fabulous stay at the Conrad! There are so many good choices to stay in Macau, but we are so happy that we picked the Conrad to celebrate a weekend getaway for my parents anniversary and their best friend’s birthday. Location is fantastic...just close enough to the major casinos, but quieter and more elegant. Service was fabulous! And so many unexpected surprises to help us celebrate and create lifelong memories....I honestly can’t imagine staying anywhere else in Macau. From the moment we arrived until the moment we left we were treated to 5 star service across the board - Absolutely top notch care from the arrival, to the concierge team helping us pick out restaurants and sightseeing to the friendly team who helped carry our many bags to the shuttle.

Found me a huge suite even though I was on a reward night. Great view over the Venetian. Room was extremely clean and luxurious.   Afternoon tea, the evening reception and breakfast were first class. Open bar in the evening with an enormous buffet of food both hot and cold. Afternoon tea was also very good with wonderful pastries. Breakfast had both western and chinese items.   Was addressed by name the whole time I was in the lounge which is a first in a Conrad.

"I visited Macau with my parents for a short stay since we were visiting Hong Kong. I had never heard of Conrad before but expected great things as part of the Hilton group. I wasn’t disappointed. Impeccable hotel and staff. We were fortunate to check-in early and were given a room with a wonderful view of the Eiffel Tower. Great location near other hotels, connected via walkways so we didn’t have to go out in the rain. Thank you Scarlett and all the other staff behind the scenes who made our stay so enjoyable.",50
This was my second visit to the Conrad Macao and as the first time they wowed me and my family yet again.  All was arranged in a timely manner with so much into details.

"It's my fifth time to stay in Conrad Macao, Cotai Central. I believe that Conrad Macao is the best choice for traveler in Macau! As a Gold Member of Hilton Honors, I was upgraded to King Deluxe Suite. I am really appreciate Mr. Emman of Executive Lounge, he helped me for several times of my stays and helped me to reserve a table of Dynasty 8. And all the staff of Conrad Macao, especially the staff in Executive Lounge are very professional and kind, with their perfect hospitality, it make me feel like home. And the suite is really huge, and also quiet. They have turn-down service and you will get a special Conrad Macao bear toy.",50
"A warm welcome by the super nice and attentive Mr. Gary Tong, who went out.of his way to introduce the hotel facilities and services in detail for our party of 10 pax. He is extra patient in responding to our repetitive inquiries and had shown clear instructions on how to get around the property, as well as the city of Macao. Gary's prompt and intuitive assistance was offered at every necessary contact point, especially when we are a group of elder lies, his attention to our needs was undoubtedly one of the best I have experienced in my life.  On the other hand, the Handy device was on the spot. It is certainly convenient for travelers who would require WiFi on the trip, as you could carry the device with you inside and outside of the hotel. The only downside maybe the toilet…",50
We stayed one night as wedding anniversary. The front staff is very gentle when we checked in. I don't remember their name. The room is very spacious and beautiful. We enjoyed the flavors of many foods at breakfast.  Thank you very much for giving special gift.  We highly recommend this hotel.,50

I hesitated as I did not wish to take risk to spend Valentine’s Day at a place where we may feel awkward.  After much contemplation we decided give it a try.  We have no regret from the moment we step foot to this property. In fact prior to our arrival, Ms Ea Enriquez wrote me a personal email welcoming us.  I thought it was some usual pre-welcome writing but whatever she asked I answered and she does responded positively.

From the moment that we arrived to the hotel, all the employees were helpful and accommodating.   Scarlett handled our check-in. She has to be the friendliest and most helpful receptionist! She was so lovely and extremely professional. What a great first impression of the hotel!   Our suite was beautifully appointed with an amazing view of the Cotai Strip.

初めてのマカオで2泊しましたが、Suiteにアップグレードされました。  Hilton Honors GOLDでしたので、チェックイン時の対応からloungeでの朝食・カクテルワワー等、全てにおいてエクセレントな体験ができたと感激しました。 今回の滞在は過去最高と断言できるほど素晴らしいものでした。スタッフの対応から清潔さ、施設充実度まで全て最高です。 今後も是非利用したいと思える程の感激できるものでした。  PS. Thank you for Mr. Lei. You are the best and excellent servicer. ,50
"We stayed in a 2 queen bedrooms suites for one night. The room was very big, the beds were comfortable.The hotel is in a great location to all the shopping, food, attractions. As a diamond member, we can access the club and get 2 breakfast for free.  The breakfast doesn't have a lot of selection, but good enough. Will stay again next time in town!",50
"The hotel sits in a large complex housing a shopping mall and casino with 5 hotels rising from within....Conrad, Sheraton, Holiday Inn, Sands, and St Regis.  The mall is very nice and houses many luxury focused retail.  Its easy to get lost in this massive conplex with its many entrances.  As a diamond member, I was able to checkin on the 39th floor club lounge and was given an executive suite, which was large, clean and inpressive.  The staff were all on top of their game and any issues are quickly addressed. I was later moved to an even larger suite, which was gigantic and gorgeous. The buffet breakfast at Orbit is huge and inpressive.   I was able to use the sauna, steam room and jacuzzi in the spa which is small but very nice. The location is quite good with a short walk to…",50
"It is pretty rare nowadays to find a hotel that offers both value and luxury. Well, I got both from the Conrad Macao Cotai Central. We travelled from Hong Kong by Turbojet and used the shuttle buses offered by the hotel, picking us up at the ferry terminals. Everything worked as they are supposed to be, from the ease of check-in to check-out, the comfort of bed to the cleanliness of bathroom. There's an in-room portable wifi unit which we used for internet connections both in and out of the hotel and throughout our stay in Macau. Very convenient. The health club is a gem! It has a gym, sauna, steam room and jacuzzi. The attendant gave me a electronic key for a locker which contained clean towel and a pair of sanitized rubber slippers. There's a dryer of which I dried my bathing…",50
"They offer for me fabulous room, and all smoothly.  Always they do it detailing service also gentle.  Specially I visited club lounge, all of staff greeting me and caring all the time.  Sarah, and Lei did wonderful serve for all guest and very polite.  Now I have a reason visit macau again, only for stay Conrad Macau.  If you choice here, you wont regret.",50
"I was very pleased with my check-in experience, the wornderful quality of the room, the friendliness of the staff and the presence of very happy families all over! I Orbit resataaurant, Bene and the lobby lounge were especially friendly",50
"Excellent experience with everything and arrangements!!! First of all, I would like to special thanks to Yumi Onuki from Guest Relations, she helps us to arrange our early check-in and a very delicious chocolate cake for our anniversary, especially for the ROOM UPGRADE, that's a big surprise when we open the door, it made our stay at Conrad Macau unforgettable, really appreciated everything she has done for us. Secondly, 5 stars for the team at the executive lounge, especially thanks to Sarah and Dome, such a sweet team member at the lounge, with their big smile and sincere welcome, make us feel very special like their VIP, thanks for the hard work to keep the lounge always clean and tidy. If we can vote for the 5 stars employee, we would like to give them a vote, management…",50
"On reaching the hotel we were not very impressed but on entering we were astonished by the size of lobby. The staff were friendly and helpful. Communication is no problem as they speak English, Chinese,Portuguese, and maybe other languages. The room was really large containing of course a bed, cupboards, a writing desk sofa and coffee and tea making facilities. This room is more than twice the size of the room we stayed in Hong Kong and cost almost the same. Most of the attractions here are within walking distance. Within the complex itself are shopping arcades, casinos and a food court which serve very good food.The breakfast was one of the best i had. The hotel also provides shuttle services from the airport and the ferry terminal.",40
The reason we selected Conrad Macao for our 2 night stay was based on its outstanding customer service and perfect location. We were more than satisfied with the service we received. The staff at the Executive lounge is super attentive. Special thanks goes to Fred for his top-notch service and many great activity recommendations. We will be back.,50
"Conrad really exceeded our expectations this time. When we arrived, my family including my little boy of a year old were well taken care of during the entire 2 nights stay. The room was spacious and clean. The coffee machine was great. The room slippers quality was luxurious, bathroom amenities were from Mandarin Tea. They even prepared a special box pack for my little boy which contains wet wipes, baby toiletries set, baby cutlery set, baby room slippers and a bear! Very thoughtful. Location was excellent allowing us access various hotels like Parisian, Venetian and City of Dreams easily. Will stay there again.",50
"The rooms were a big highlight - spacious and large, and greatly decorated in the finest of things. It was pure luxury. Bathroom was huge, loved the big bath tub and shower. We had a superb view of the ""Eiffel Tower"". The location was perfect, a walking distance to shopping, casinos, and the other hotels. Cannot fault it, and they gave me a cute ""travel bear"".",50
"the hotel and room is nice. price is reasonable, but got smoking smell in my non~smoking room.:(  the hotel staff was friendly and helpful, and even guided us to the hotel lift lobby. the buffet breakfast was  good and lots of choices ;)",40
" I stay 2 night  in Macao at Conrad (cotai) the service it’s  wonderful I am a diamond member and I got a suite upgrade  The Longs on the 39 floor it’s also very nice the wine  is good and the food also, personal in the lounge are very kind and most of them remember  your name Marco Caza",50
"We were 5 guests, the management of our company, coming to Macau for a couple of days, combining business and pleasure. Emmen received us at the executive floor lounge. Although I was the only Diamond member, he offered a great deal allowing us all to have one day use of all the executive club facilities, and next day afternoon generous use of the meeting room. On the next day it was Frand who offered us just as friendly and attentive service. Definitely will use Conrad Macau for future business and pleasure visits to Macau. ",50
"New rooms great attentive service, very amazing infrastructure. All th details accounted for, and the location is perfect. Can walk to any of the other hotels in th Cotai strip very fast . Will stay here again when I return to Macau.",50
"Putting the hotel itself aside for a moment, the staff here were on TOP of their game. They anticipated our needs, made certain that we felt special and helped us to maximise our short 2-night visit.  A special call out to Ea Enriquez (Guest Relations Supervisor) for having a personalised cake brought to our room for my wife’s birthday!  What a lovely way to recognise her but not make it public and potentially embarrassing. Well done!  The room itself was incredible!  We were upgraded to a fantastically large suite with a view of the Eiffel Tower at the Parisian. Truly wonderful!  Thank you to the entire Conrad Macao team!",50
"The hotel is five stars from top to bottom. Inside and out!! Food, service and everything in between!  We enjoyed an AMAZING spa by two extremely professional and very TALENTED staff members - Marley and Rachel! A big thank you to you both!!  The spa facility is over the top amazing. A touch expensive but well worth it.   The only one thing that was really “cool” that I would mention is the temperature of the water in the outside pool. It was freeeeeeeeeeezing.  Hats off to all the staff for the great service ",50
"We have been staying with Conrad Macau for many times and I must say service and room have always been great!  And the food at this executive lounge is one of the best among so many Hiltons.  The staffs in the executive lounge is always very helpful, friendly and service is excellent.  Especially Sarah, Ryan and others!  will definately recommend this place and will come back again.",50
"My dad, sister and I were tired because of the flight and just needed some rest  Robynn Chen took care of us as a perfect Host. It is amazing to get this kind of warmth and assistance from her. Our room was the best in all the Hiltons we have stayed - I mean I am comparing to London, Milan, Edinburgh, and Dublin.  Yes, we often got assistance from other Guest Officers as well but none like Robynn. She made us feel special and that is so important in a hotel in the midst of thousands of buzzing people. That is an experience we shall always remember. Hope she gets a promotion soon and she will be worth it.   Thank You, Robynn Chen.",50
"We stayed one night at this hotel for on our tour of China. We received an upgrade to a Suite as a Hilton Honors Diamond member and it may have been this stay (or the subsequent one at Conrad Beijing) that flipped me over to a ‘Lifetime Diamond Member’. As in all the Conrad’s that we have stayed in, the service (both hard and soft) are mainly impeccable. We had a massage in the Spa that was excellent and my wife and I both enjoyed and felt a positive outcome from this. We had breakfast in the breakfast room which is a bit hard to find as it’s buried in the shopping complex, but once we found it it was very good. The room was impeccable and in the room we received a free Conrad gold bear and duck!!! As a diamond member we received access to the executive lounge and the staff did…",50
"Despite being an extremely frequent international traveler, I have never felt compelled before to write a review. The staff at the Conrad Cotai Center have dramatically exceeded all expectations for several years now.  The facilities are modern and well maintained, there's a 24h gym, heated outdoor pool and a classy lobby bar. But that looms small in comparison to the service.   The staff know and remember me everytime I visit. They take the time to speak and get to know guests in a genuine manner. And they provide local context to make any trip to Macau memorable.  Specifically, Edmund Tan, the head concierge is the type of concierge fictionalised in films like the Grand Budapest Hotel, but that you never imagined could exist. He makes every trip memorable and is the reason I…",50
"visited macau 2 days 1 night before christmas, and Conrad is a good choice of staying. location is good, with all the shops around and it's not far to have a relax walk from hotel to Rua do Cunha for dinner and buy snacks.",40
Greeted by Blau from Front Office and was very helpful upon check in as we wanted a smoking room but none was available.  She was exceptionally patient and tried to help us but couldnt as we arrived late she explained   Although we couldnt get a smoking but the check in experience was great.  We would definately come back again  Nichole,40
"Like I have said in my previous reviews, this is one of my top 3 favourite hotels in the whole world! And, I was so happy to notice that it still has kept it’s quality level and top-notch service. I can highly recommend this hotel to anyone who appreciates personalized, pampering service in a luxury setting. I am a Hilton Hhonors Diamond, AccorHotels Platinum and SPG Gold member, so stay quite a lot in different hotels. This hotel really stands out from the rest, in a really good way!  I want to thank all the members of the hotel staff - they are just amazing! My biggest thanks go to front office supervisor Mr Elvis Wen - he always goes the extra mile (or even two!) to make sure that everyone is enjoying their stay at the property! Also want to give big thanks to executive…",50
"As a diamond member I was checked in on the executive lounge floor by Emman, and he personally escorted me to my upgraded king deluxe suite.  This room and entire hotel has a wow factor to it that most USA based Hilton and Conrad's lack.  The suite has its own TV room, huge living room with a curved couch, large floor to ceiling windows, a hot tub, and a huge walk in shower.  I've been upgraded to suites before but this one blew me away.  A nice bonus was they gave me a pocket wifi so I could be connected wherever I go in Macau.  The happy hour was fantastic, and the breakfast was extraordinary with lots of variety of Asian and Western foods.  The gym was amazing for a hotel gym, since it included barbells so you can properly bench press and squat instead of on a smith machine. …",50
"We stayed 3 nights. The hotel location is ideal to venture to Taipa, Coloane and Macau island by taxi or public buses for a (flat) fare of $6 MOP. You can also walk from Conrad to Taipa village and this takes 15 mins. Note - no change will given on public bus services so make sure you have the right change before boarding the bus. Room is spacious for 2 adults and 11 yo. Bathroom had a separate shower and a large bath tub. Overall the service from check in to check out was warm, friendly & very efficient.  Special thanks to Cliff who spoke good English and has provided us with very helpful suggestions during our stay. His cheerful assistance has enhance our stay at Conrad.",50
"There was a very warm and thoughtful service when I was checking in, and all the staffs are so nice especially the girl called Blau at the front desk, she was so friendly to Introduce the facilities in the room intimately, and the bedding in hotel is very comfortable! The room is  so big, quiet and tasteless! There are also gifts of bears and socks for the baby, which are very cute, I will be choose the Gonrad again for my family trip in the future!",50
she made our stay very nice the hotel was so nice!! fast wifi nice view of the parisian and good staff whit a nice smile delicious breakfast and many many more!!just pick conrad and you will not regret it!!see you nxt time,50
"The team made our stay impressive from the very beginning when Mrs. Enriquez detailed for us every aspect of our long way from HKG airport by email, when a doorman runs on the street to help us with our baggage, when we check-in with Mr. Lee and he and the rest of the team managed to get us an upgrade to a suite even when the hotel was fully booked (and we know that for sure), and when Mrs. Sarah brougth a Christmas tea as a welcome drink and for taking such a good care of us, she's an asset on the team.  We loved how all the staff took care of us every single day and every single visit to the lounge  We have not enough words to thank you for everything.  Sorry for remembering only some names of the staff  (Dome, Ivan, Lee, Sarah, ...) but all of them we're incredible, and…",50
"We were so impressed with the staff at the Conrad Macao Cotai! From the first moment we walked in, the bell service chased us down to help us with our luggage, and guided us to the front desk area to check-in.  The front desk even walked us to the elevators after checking us in, and since we are Hilton Honors gold members, they upgraded us to a suite (nice perk!) I don’t think I can go back down to a regular deluxe room after this experience! Our suite came with a Handy device which is a cell phone that is also a wifi hotspot for our cell phones as we can take it with us throughout Macao during our stay.  Every floor in the Conrad has an air purifier, and our suite was equipped with one as well.  The staff here were amazing! Fiona greeted us immediately as we walk into the Club…",50
"I booked three rooms and when we arrived at 1.00 pm two of the rooms were available which was good. However the third room which was to be available at 3.00 pm the designated time, was not ready until 4.30.  I was not impressed and was offered weak excuses for the delay. I managed to get free transport to the ferry terminal as compensation. The room my wife and I occupied smelt of smoke even though it was a non smoking room. They offered fruit for each room however one of the rooms didn’t receive any.  All in all, it was an OK hotel but not the five star service I expected.",40
"We’re quite surprised of their staffs’  friendliness and kindness of service team, room was really cleaned and comfortable( cleanness is really important to me as a neat  freak!) good quality of bed and linens, we’re really enjoyed and relaxed!!  很棒的飯店，從大廳到樓層的服務人員臉上永遠保持微笑😊～ 很親切的協助我們！ 特別是房間整理的很舒適乾淨！絕對是我每次到澳門住宿的優先選擇之一！",50
"I came with a friend hgere in October again and we had a fabulous time. The Pool Service was outstanding, espevially from the highly friendly Filipina attendant. She was so professional and helpful! ur adljoining bedrtooms were well appointed.",50
"Conrad Macao located in the prime area of shopping. Very close to airport and you can take free shuttle bus to the hotel. Staffs are nice especially concierge, when we asked her for suggestions and she also offered us a drinking water as well because it is very expensive of drinking water at outside. When they know this is my birthday trip (I did not give them an info before) they sent me a Birthday cake in room, I appreciated their surprise. Cocktails at executive lounge is super good, staff is friendly. He always asked us for the second drink. Breakfast is fantastic, a lot of choices and of course staffs are always great. However if you need pool for swimming it is not here, pool’s here for relax and let’s your kids enjoy. (Sorry I could not remember all staffs name) ",50
"Big shout-out to the Executive Lounge team, including Fiona, Frank, Achin, and the girls staffing the evening cocktails.  Conrad Cotai Executive Lounge makes it worthwhile to keep your business and personal spending to within the Hilton brands.Very personal and professional service from the lounge team, but without being intrusive at all.  Nice place for breakfast if the  Grand Orbit gets too busy.  Evening cocktails make for great early evening snacks.  The Handy phone also worked great---as an Android user, I was able to ditch my own phone.  Nothing beats having free 4G data access while roaming about in Macau.",50
"The Conrad service is commendable. 2 of our family members who were on wheelchairs would have problem getting wheelchairs at the ferry terminal prior to checking in.  The hotel service staff managed to arrange for a smooth transition by arranging a bell captain to follow us to the ferry terminal so that he could bring them back when we were done. Kudos to the hotel staff (Mr Stephen) and all the service staff for taking the initiative to help solve our problem.  All the while remaining polite, efficient, and friendly.   I always thought of Conrad as a business hotel, but it's more, it makes us feel so at home.",50
"First stay with Conrad and the service was commendable. Went with my family and booked 3 rooms. Not only were the rooms on the same floor , they were side by side. The early check in and late check out arranged by the hotel were a big plus and very much appreciated considering we have 3 kids and 4 elderly. Baby amenities provided includes the sterilizer too which was a pleasant surprise. Stella who was receiving us at the hotel was very friendly and she even led us to our rooms , indeed a very welcoming gesture. Staff at the bell counter were very helpful in assisting us many ways; giving directions , getting the taxi arrangements to suit the number of pax, bringing our luggages to the shuttle bus upon our departure. Overall all the staff we met at the hotel displayed good…",50
"Very helpful front desk! We got 2 rooms for the family weekend trip. Lots of restaurants in the complex. Convenient location with lots of shopping and you don’t even have to go outside. Rooms are spacious, the suite is big! Very quiet even though there were casinos near by! ",40
"We loved the hotel! Such great reviews all over... we had to try it and it didn’t disappoint. We upgraded to lounge access and really enjoyed it. Thanks to Owen for his help getting situated. Great location for seeing all of the Cotai strip, and still not far from the sights like ruins of St. Paul’s church. We will be back!",50
"From the moment we stepped off the free shuttle bus from Taipa Ferry Terminal, we were mesmerised by the grandeur of this hotel. Friendly staff helped take our luggage and escort us to the check-in counter. Every staff member we encountered in the hotel would smile and say hello. We have never experienced such amazing service in a hotel before.  We stayed in a Deluxe King Room with views of the Cotai Strip. Looking outside the window, we could see the Eiffel Tower at the Parisian Hotel, Studio City and the Venetian. The bathroom was spacious and clean, and the room just exuded luxury. We had access to a mobile phone that we could take with us as we explored Macau - this included free calls within Hong Kong, Macau and mainland China. We could also use it as a hotspot to continue…",50
"Quick shoutout to the team at Conrad:   - Edmond, concierge service. Quick and responsive for information regarding Zhuhai Macau Bridge from HK to Macau. Also very responsive in booking reservations at Michelin 3 Star restaurant.  - Vincent, check-in staff. He escorted us to our room, but found issues with the room due to housekeeping and previous guest. We were then escorted to the club level to rest while he change rooms and keys. Wished the property recognize Hilton Diamond and did the check-in at the lounge though.  - Arthur Lim, thanks for your recognition while we were at the Lounge. Pleasure to share my experience with you regarding my experience at Grand Orbit. Also thanks for your understanding.   Tips for well traveled guest with Hilton Honors status. Skip the Grand…",50
"We only stayed at this hotel for one night due to a short time to spend in Macau, but we wish we could have stayed longer! We were upgraded to a suite and it was absolutely marvelous. The room is incredibly spacious with it's own little separate den with a third TV! The lobby and the grounds are spotless and so beautiful. Every member of the staff goes out of the their way to help you and we truly hope to be back again!",50
"Dayo, who welcomed us and gave us very professional,kind and practical guide made our stay at Canrad Macau a very pleasant one. The good impression given by him was followed by continuous care and human touch. I deeply appreciated his personal advice on newly launched bridge crossing adventure out of security and time concerns. His detailed intro of the new mobile technology that we could enjoy during the stay wad also very impressive. Afterall, what distinguishes a hotel's service from another's is this kind of personal human touch and feeling of being cared. Thank you Dayo, I am certaibly looking forward to seeing you again in the future. Respectfully H",50
"Stayed there for 3 nights and received an upgrade to a Suite as Diamond member.  Overall service was superb, but I really need to commend the Executive Lounge and staff there.  Sarah and Ryan really took good care of us and made our stay extra special.  I know there are many other choices in the Cotai area, but for me...the Conrad is the place I will always stay due to the superb service. Definitively a 5 Star hotel!",50
"My boyfriend and I recently celebrated our one year anniversary in Macau and the Conrad made our stay truly memorable.  The staff was super friendly and went the extra mile -- whether ensuring we had an excellent suite with an unobstructed view of the Eiffel Tower or sending us a delicious chocolate cake (perfect complement to the bottle of Dom a friend generously gifted us).  My boyfriend coordinated flowers with the concierge before my arrival, and upon entry to the room, I was wonderfully surprised by the bouquet and the accompanying ""Happy Anniversary"" display!  The Conrad is well situated and also gave us the opportunity to visit the Parisian and Venetian and the nearby restaurants.  We can't wait to celebrate another milestone at the property, and thank Conrad for making…",50
"I don't really have a basis to evaluate since I've not stayed in the other hotels in the Macau Cotai area, but based just on my experience in Conrad, everything is just marvellous. The concierge was very attentive to my needs when I explained that I needed to travel every morning to Macau University, and called me up to ensure I knew my way.  The rooms were very big for the price you pay. The beds and pillow were exquisite. The sofa in the room was so comfortable. The leather chair for use with the desk was exactly what I needed to work on my presentation late into the night. I ordered an in-room dining dinner, the food was very very good. I didn't want to leave my room in the morning.",50
"Picked 2 Queen Bed with Eiffel Tower view for 2 Adults, 2 young kids, sit besides the window, enjoy snacks, coffees with stunning view. Superb! (1 think, sound proof next door, corridor, can be better)Spend time with kids at their warm water pool, hot tub. Superb!Distance from hotel to any nearby attraction, good.Overall, try this, when you travel next times.",50
"I stayed here for almost a week on business trip, and it was such a memorable experience!  Located in the center of the entertainment, and it was very close to the airport, which made everything very convenient.  The room and service was top quality. This week made me feel like home.  It definitely made my Macau trip unforgettable!",50
Travelled recently and everything in Conrad is wonderful! Special thanks to Fidella for providing her exceptional services throughout my stay. The lounge and the in-room dining services are also at the best. Definitely the best stay ever! Hope to see you guys again in the near future!!,50
"This is my new favourite hotel to stay at in Macau. The service I received from the moment I arrived at the property to the moment I left was impeccable and could not be faulted in any way. After a long 9+ hour flight and ferry transfer from Hong Kong Airport. I was ready to just check-in and get to my room to settle in and relax. I was warmly welcomed by the check-in counter staff, given the option to check in at the reception desk or up at the executive level check-in facility, given my key card and hotel information relevant for my stay. It was at this point I realised the service at this property was going to be different – the check-in staff member then escorted me through the lobby to the elevators as it was my first time staying at the property. A small gesture but a nice…",50
"The conrad is one of four hotels that share a common first four floor. The whole complex is called the Sands Cotai Central. The reception area for all four hotels are separate but are all on the same floor and you can walk from reception area to reception area, which felt a little weird.  The 2nd and 3rd floors houses a fairly large mall that is mostly high end fashion but there is also a food court and convenience store.  The whole center is connected by an over road walkway to the Venetian  Each hotel has its own lift shaft as they are separate towers after the 4th floor.  This can result in new visitor wandering into the wrong elevator wondering why their key cards won't work.   The rooms for the conrad are spacious and fitted out to a high level.  Elements that I appreciated…",50
"Been looking/comparing hotels to stay and to celebrate my parent's anniversary, and I would say I made the right choice! A superb luxury hotel!! Room: (2 king deluxe) very big and spacious. Very clean! The staff really clean it so well. Bed: you can sleep all day, so comfy! Location: just walking inside the mall going to four seasons, parisian and venetian hotel. You will really enjoy your shopping!  Free shuttle bus going to all the casinos. 😀 Food: a lot of varieties to choose in the food court and resto.   Thumbs up for all the nicest and caring staffs, most especially to Ms.Yumi, (I dont know how to pay back your kindness) for upgrading our room and for giving my parents a surprise gifts for their anniversary.

This hotel is a must for all travellers looking for a little bit of luxury. Cannot speak highly enough of how attentive ALL staff were. We will come back and only ever stay here. Thanks to all the staff involved.  Rooms are beautifully presented and very quiet. Did I mention how comfortable the bed was....I want to take it home....love this place.,50
"Service was excellent. Scarlett guided us through check in with a breeze and was very professional and friendly. In general, all the hotel staff that we have met at the check in area were very friendly. I have been to Macau on many occasions and this was the first time that the service standard was consistent throughout my stay. Check out was fuss free as well.   Rooms were great, huge comfy beds and nice scenery outside. You can’t really fault anything with the in room amenities.   Although prices for Conrad is not cheap, the experience is comparatively way better than those among similar price range. At fairly nearby hotel chains, the lobby were packed with throngs of tourists. Thankfully, there were no tour groups at the Conrad lobby when we were there. Seeing those tour…",50
"The Conrad is situated in the heart of the Cotai Strip offering very comfortable and clean rooms, and this is one reason why I have returned to this hotel on a number of occasions. The hotel pool area is located on the fourth floor between buildings so great if you want to sit in shade, but not great if you want to sunbathe as the sun is often behind one of the buildings.",40
"I had an exceptional experience during my stay at the Conrad Macao. Prior to my stay on August, I reached out to Conrad Macao staff with requests in July. Conrad Club Guest Relations Officer (CCGRO) Almarez responded and very helpful with responding to my questions and requests. On the day prior to my arrival, CCGRO Almarez reached out to me to prepare for my arrival. I felt valued by the staff.   I checked in on the 39th floor and we all received delicious welcome drinks. As a Hilton Diamond member, I was upgraded to a suite for my 8d stay. The Executive Lounge, which offers breakfast, afternoon tea, and happy hour, was awesome. The reading room also serves all day soft drinks and cookies. All the Conrad Macao staff that I came across were hospitable.   I am visiting again in…",50
I would say that Conrad is the best hotel so far I stayed in a Hilton Property. Stayed in Conrad Hk and Manila before everything was great but Conrad Macau is exceptional! Upon arrival staff greeted us and recognised our names which makes us felt so welcomed! Room was so spacious and neat! We tried the Crystal Jade and Dynasty 8 and it was amazing:) Spa team are awesome too.  Good job to all the staff that assist me and family. See you next year!,50
"My fiancé and I are currently staying at the Conrad in Macau.  We just got engaged a few days ago and this hotel has made us feel like we are already on our honeymoon even though they had no idea about the engagement.  My fiancé is a Hilton Gold member which provides major perks, including a special place to check in and a lounge with breakfast, tea and evening drinks.  The food in the lounge is spectacular and so is service!  Emman checked us in and upgraded us to a king suite with a great view.  He answered all of our questions and was extremely professional and kind.  We happened to go to tea before walking to our room and when he realized we had walked to our room on our own he called just to make sure everything was to our liking.  If you want to be treated well by people…",50
"We decide to stay at Conrad to celebrate my mother’s birthday. Before our trip, the hotel provide us recommendation on restaurants, as well the activities and latest shows in Macao. And I am most impressed that they have assisted on all the restaurant booking during my stay!  Special thanks to Yumi Onuki and her team to provide me all the recommendation during our stay, and Tony Wang to assist on my room booking, my mom is so happy for all the arrangements and of course the surprises (the birthday cake) that you have prepared for her! Thank you very much and you are the one who make our trip memorable!   ",50
My love for the Conrad brand extends here to Macao. Excellent service upon reception and definitely went beyond and helped me navigate around the property. They were polite and professional. As a HH member i was well taken of the team at Conrad Macao. I will definitely come back in the future!,50
We enjoyed every minute here.  Beautiful hotel with lovely attentive and helpful staff.  Lovely interior.  Treated like royalty.  Possible most comfortable mattress we've ever had.  Lovely exterior and convenient location.   Upgraded to beautiful suite with Cotai Strip View.   Highly recommend staying here.  We used points but prices were very good.,50
"This is my second stay in Macau Conrad and this hotel still provides excellent service. Ms. Tina in the APEX executive lounge is the best staff I've ever met and other staffs were also great. Ms. Tina was very friendly to my family, she remember us and always willing to help us. Her sincere service made us feel very comfortable and happy.  And Ms. Ea Enriquez was also amazing. She was very professional and answered my inquires via e-mail very well. Moreover, when we met her finally, she gave us warm welcome.  The room condition was superb but smoking smell came from somewhere in spite of changing to other non-smoking room. Also, we have stand by call back for the room change almost 2 hours (2 hours is important during the travel). Finally, new non-smoking room was arranged but…",50
"We visisted this hotel one year ago in September snd were so impressed that we decided to return this year in October.  We arrived early and were welcomed to the lounge for check in. As it was 10 am there was some wait for the room to be ready. We were then assigned a room and it was a 100 sqm suite with a gorgeous view! The suite was very well designed and a great surprise.  As an HH Gold member we got access to the fantastic lounge. We tried the Afternoon Tea and Evening Cocktails both days and the selection is great. The biggest asset of this hotel is its staff. Sarah, Emmann, Ryann and all the rest are super and even remembered us from previous visit and offered service beyond expectation. We are certainly looking forward to our next visit!",50
I have just had an excellent stay in the Conrad Macao. The service has been by far the best I have had in a hotel. The staff knew your name at all times and nothing at all was too much trouble. I would recommend the hotel to anyone.  Perfect location. ,50
"One of the hotels I keep on coming back to is the Conrad Macau, not because it is the best Conrad but because it is fantastic service,  great elite recognition and it is easy to get to. Some of the best hotels in the world are Conrad hotels, however a lot of them are difficult to get to such as Conrad Rangali and Conrad Bora Bora. Another big benefit with Conrad Macau is they seem to be able to retain staff, and they remember you, which makes it a more personal experience. I always get excellent service and great room upgrades. The breakfast buffet is magical with everything you can image and the afternoon tea and evening drinks and food are top notch. You also have casinos, restaurants and shopping within the hotel complex. Getting here is easy, fly in to Hong Kong and take…",50
"Great hotel and fantastic service.  One of the best in Cotai area I believe Conrad is the best one! I’ve traveled the world but so far this is the best service I ever received. Staff all are friendly and very welcoming, especially from the front office team. Breakfast restaurant was just too crowded, it served a wide range of breakfast buffet selections.  My room was upgraded to a suite, insanely spacious, and it’s very clean, great job to their housekeeper, keep up the good work!  Highly recommended and will be back very soon !",50
"A wonderful hotel with staff that consistently go above and beyond. The rooms and bathrooms are huge and beautifully fitted out. The layout can be confusing with a separation between the lobby, the room lifts and the main restaurant. The complex is huge with everything you can imagine and plenty of things for kids to do. ",50
"After a week long trip to China, we stayed in Macau at this property for one night, en route to Hong Kong.  This was the most luxurious hotel that we stayed at during our trip.  The property is easily accessible via the Sands Cotai Central shuttle which stops in front of the property.  We used the shuttle both from the aiport and to the ferry terminal.  The staff were very friendly and helpful to provide any recommendations of things to do in the area.  Additional complimentary water and nespresso capsules were provided on demand.  Note however that I was approached twice by random women in the hotel lobby....Beware.",50
"An excellent choice to stay in Macao. The location of the hotel is on Cotai strip in the luxury area. The room was big, very clean, with a comfortable bed and with a great view to the Parisien and the Eiffel Tour replica. In the night was awsome. The hotel is very well connected with all the others hotels and commercial galleries in the area. The staff was very helpful and customer oriented and they succed to make us an excellent experience staying at Conrad. Thank you and congrats! ",50
"The room was perfect. We were upgraded to a suite, the living area is comfortable, the view is great, and the bathroom is the best, especially the big bath tub. The staff in the lounge is very very good and helpful. We really had a wonderful stay there. Thank you. 房間很棒，我們被安排到套房，客廳很寬敞舒適，浴室很棒，特別是有一個豪華浴缸。酒廊的服務人員非常棒，非常貼心，讓我們感受溫暖。",50
"all staff is friendly and approachable , especially thanks to reception staff : Fidella, all my rooms arrange well, check in proceed was quick and clear  room tour explanation . kids amenity and Conrad bear sooooo cute.  ",50
Absolutely the Best hotel I have ever stayed in.  My apologies for not remembering the names of the staff.  But that doesn't matter.  From the front desk to the concierge to the executive lounge they all took care of us at over 100% of FANTASTIC service.  I just can't say enough good things to properly describe our experience.  I will return here in the future as well as being on the look out for a Conrad in all future travels.  Thanks for a wonderful stay!,50
"I've stayed at other Las Vegas Sands properties and this one is a one of the better ones.  The room was very large, quiet.  I had a partial view of Paris.  Nice amenities, there were small gifts from the hotel, rubber duck, candy and stuffed animal.  They were kind to give me a late check out.  Staff was courteous.  I'd stay again.",50
"Fabulous 3 night stay experience, first time visiting vibrant Macau!  Long 15 hour flight from Los Angeles to Hong Kong, took the new bus over bridge to Macau and arrived late at 11pm. Scarlet at front desk was attentively and helpful.  While unable to offer room upgrade for us as a Hilton gold member, she was able to offer 39th fl lounge access for my 21 year old son who is traveling with us.  I am so thankful that she made this arrangement!  Then she proceeded to escort us to our room on the 22nd floor.  What an outstanding first impression and awesome service!   Our entire stay has been flawless...diligently clean housekeeping, elaborate health center gym, super variety breakfast in lounge with cooked to order items and fresh juices.  I would also like to thank Sarah for her…",50
"Thanks Mr Isac's arrangement for the birthday surprise for my parents. They were so surprised and touched for that. The other staff of the hotel were helpful and friendly too. Also, there was a great variety of food at Grand Orbit, the buffet was great value of money. We will be back again for sure!",50
"Conrad Macao has kept the standard of Conrad brand with spacious room, nice Chinese traditional decoration and the most important is the amazing Eiffel Tower view! From our room, we can see the whole Parisian hotel with shining Eiffel Tower! It was amazing! ",50
"9/10 - excellent! Would like to specifically mention Sofea, Bency and Stephen on the front desk/concierge staff who were so helpful with checkout times, and recommendations and directions to various places in Macau - keep up the good work!  Normally I reserve top tier impressions for the Mandarin Oriental, Peninsula and ShangriLa hotels but for Conrad Macau, you are right up there with the very best - well done!  Location at Cotai Central perfect for the gambling and convention crowd  A reason why I didnt give you a 10/10 is more your hotel systems - the conrad website is awfully designed for someone who wants to give feedback - get a better UX designer than the ones you have..I shouldnt have to give up in frustration and leave this commentary on tripadvisor - same with your…",40
"The room was spacious and comfortable.  But boring in the midst of all the exotic hotels in Macau. There were nothing special and the service was not superior.  Food was terrible, both conference catering and the lobby lounge. ",30
"This hotel has nice rooms. We stayed in this hotel twice within a week, and while rooms are nice, the hilton member experience is lacking compared to other Hiltons worldwide. The lounge food is quite limited, while the staff taking care of the lounge serving area are very nice, especially Tyra and Sunshine. For members, there is no welcome fruit platter or complimentary welcome snacks unlike at other Hilton hotels. Members will not get top floors as well, as preference is given to casino guests. Casino guests will get better priority and service than Hilton members.  Overall, this Conrad is a lower standard hotel than Hiltons, Conrads or Doubletrees around the world as preference is given to Casino guests. While the staff tries their best to be accomodating to members, we know…",30
"A very nice hotel with excellent service. Especially thanks to the Japanese staff, she is very cheerful and polite. The room is very comfy and big. Love this Conrad hotel, definitely will come back again! ",50
"I spent two nights at Conrad Macau. Already at arrival the staff provided me with a very warm welcome. All of them were so friendly and helpful. The room on the 20th floor was spacious with king size bed, couch and all other amenities, a hotel of that cathegory provides. The marble Bathroom was also very generously equipped with large separate shower, double sink, oval bathtub and large mirrors. Very comfortable bathrobes!  Breakfast buffet is very large, offering an extensive choice. Connected to the Hotel is a large shopping aerea. Due to lack of time I could not experience Spa, Pool and Casino. Would come back with great pleasure!",50
"We've stayed in a suite here, but this last week we stayed in a regular room and it was spacious and well laid out.  First thing we did was to unpack our bags.  There were plenty of drawers and closet space for our clothes.  The bathroom had a large bathtub as well as a shower.  There were two sinks.  There was drawer space and ledge space and a makeup mirror.  Shanghai Tang supplies the shampoo, soap, conditioner, and bathgel.  I loveed the bathrobes too--warm and soft feeling.  On one end of our room was a floor to ceiling, wall to wall window which let in a lot of natural light.  Our room was well lighted with fixtures in strategic locations.  We stayed on the 35th floor and rarely had to wait more than a minute for a lift to take us up or down.  The hotel is well located…",40
"First time stay at this hotel. Had stayed in Holiday Inn Cotai & Sheraton Cotai Hotel in previous trips. For compare & contrast, it's another exceptional good hotel with full facilities. Enjoy the in-room Nescafe capsules. The room is also larger than the other ones at the other 2 hotels.",50
"Macau is full of upscale hotels, and there are probably many that are even more luxurious than the Conrad, but considering the very reasonable rates here, the value you get is just outstanding.  My stay here is one of the best examples of above-and-beyond recognition of Hilton Honors Gold status I have ever encountered. Personalised check-in at the club lounge, upgrade to a suite and access to the best club lounge I have had the pleasure to visit so far. The lounge is not only very comfortable and inviting, but also offers a wide and delicious choice of food in all of its daily time slots. The staff at the lounge will greet you by name and will go out of their way to make sure you are well looked after, e.g. by refilling your drink or recommending options from the buffet, even…",50
"This hotel is fantastic. The rooms are spacious, clean, and we were lucky to have a great view of the strip. The entire staff (from reception to housekeeping) were courteous and willing to go beyond what was expected to ensure we had the most comfortable stay. Fidella Tee deserves special mention as she made our stay perfect from start to finish.",50
"This is hands down one of the best hotel we have ever stayed in. It is strategically located in the heart of Cotai Strip and well connected by complimentary shuttle buses to ferry terminals and other parts of Cotai. Being a Diamond Hilton member, our check-in happened in the 39th Floor Executive Lounge, complete with the welcome drinks. We were upgraded to a King Suite which comes with a very comfortable king bed, a separate living rooms, huge bathroom and all amenities that ones would need. The service was impeccable and the staffs were very friendly and helpful. Nightly turndown service came as standard for our suite, but the attentions to details were exceptional. Foods, beverages and services in the Executive Lounge were high quality. Although we could have our breakfasts in…",50
"Pure luxury and you left waiting for nothing, because of my status with Hilton we were upgraded to a King Suite with access to the 39th floor lounge. I could not find any fault with the room, it is massive and has all the little things you need tucked away somewhere umbrella, ironing board etc. The lounge offerings were delicious with a large selection of beverages to choose from, the staff in the lounge were especially very attentive to all the guests. As mentioned elsewhere the Monkey King is well worth going to see while staying here. One last thing that impressed me: the speed of the lifts is amazing!",50
"One of the best hotels we have stayed at. All elements refined in detail, we felt like a Royal Family. I am convinced that we will return to Macao and the Conrad Macao Hotel which I’m sure is the best. We are Thank you to the staff for a great stay.",50
"Thanks to Conrad to make my Macau stay a real pleasure. I feel always so comfortable to come Macau as I have the real feeling that I will be home. I like the prime location of the place,rooms are also nicely decorated with nice size. About the service nothing I can write here as I’m scare that it will be below the reality. Just can say : amazing. Special mention to front desk team and 39 floor executive lounge team. I will come back home for sure   Thanks again ",50
"My family went to travel Macau for my parent's wedding anniversary.  We've got warm welcome from all Conrad's staff especially Miss Charlie. We'd got upgraded room to the larger one and the great view . At night , we got a surprised cake for celebration in our room. My parent were so happy. For this hotel, it's so convenience. You can go very where by free shuttle bus or taxi. The show ""Monkey King"" is worth for your money. We feel satisfied with staying at Conrad Macau.",50
"The Hilton brand is already great, but this property in Macau's Cotai Central is superb! First, a shout out to Sarah and all her colleagues in the Executive Lounge. These folks have perfercted the art of Hotelling Hospitality - hence, Hilton be proud! The room was a gem - we had an upgraded suite on a quiet floor that included a bedroom bathroom area that had to be at least 800 Sq Ft! The pool-health club was spacious. Back to the Executive Lounge - Sarah, the chef, the wait staff al spoke in English and could not do enough for us, providing food, drinks and goodies for breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktails. Co-located to the Vegas of the East - Cotai Central has lots of well known casinos and associated shopping - all within walking distance.",50
"Glad that i choose Conrad for my wife Birthday trip & also our first visit to macao. Me & my wife would like to express our thanks to Troy Wang at front office , thanks for making my wife birthday a memorable one. Appreciate for the complimentary cake , greeting card and also decoration. Our appreciation also to the house keeping team who leave a birthday wish msg & always keep our room clean.  ",50
"My aunt, mom and I stayed here during our short trip in Macau. We really chose a hotel within Cotai area. I actually liked my stay here better than other hotel in the area. There is a big mall with vast selection of shops and restaurants below the hotel. We stayed at a Junior Suite and it was perfect!",50
"My wife and I just had our 20th years wedding anniversary in this hotel. I had contacted the hotel before I checked in for a suite on a two nights stay for help on arrangement for this special occasion. Yumi from CONRAD had replied and did an excellent job in arranging everything including the dinner booking, a cake for celebration, special room cards and even walked us through the room when check-in and came down to greet and farewell before we left. We can find a clean and classy hotel easily everywhere but it's really the people, the service and the extra care to the customer that Yumi and her colleague showed which really make a difference for CONRAD. I will definitely come back again!",50
"The staff are very nice, serve with professional and great attitude. I love the room is very comfortable, clear and quiet! The service are very nice when we requested something, they usually deliver ASAP. We arrived the hotel at 12:00 pk which was before the standard check in time (3:00 pm). They arranged a room for me! Most of the hotels will only keep my luggages and come back at 3:00pm, but this time i can get into the room earlier and I have more time to rest in the hotel! Ms Mizuki was serving us with very good attitude and she made me feel very trustable when staying in the hotel.",50
"I had a memorable birthday stay at Conrad Macau! Thanks for the birthday cake and birthday card.   Conrad is located at Cotai Central which you can find many shops and restaurants over there making it an ideal one stop resort location. The room is spacious, clean and comfortable.",50
"The hotel is located within a large shopping mall (Cotai Central), and is part of the Hilton Hotels Chain. and As a HH Gold member, you get the benefit of lounge access where you can check in privately there, and enjoy afternoon tea, and evening canapes.  I got a suite, the room was really spacious, with nice views of the city, the service was good. The only disappointing thing was the breakfast which was offered at a restaurant in the shopping mall and was shared with another lower level hotel not part of Hilton Chain (cant mentioned, as post will be removed). The food there was terrible and way below standard for even a Hilton hotel, let alone a Conrad! The executive lounge had an extremely small breakfast setup, and can be improved significantly.",40
"The Conrad is a grand destination which offers some very fine service. This time, I was particularly impressed by the young men from Room Service and Housekeeping for thge shoeshine service. Both embodied helpfulness and professionalism. The Pool and gymnasium here are also noteworthy.",40
"Stayed in Conrad Macao for two nights to experience the Forbes 5-star rating hotel and was totally impressed by great service and warm hospitality provided by the front office staffs especially Fidella. She managed to fulfill the request in our booking and went beyond that by offering to help out and took initiative to ensure the room set up was of our preferences. Room was spacious, extremely clean and bed was super comfy. They even have a ""Pillow Menu"" for guest to choose their preferred pillow for a good night sleep. Well maintained and wide range of facilities can be found in the gym. Truly a memorable stay. This is definitely a not-to-be-missed Conrad Macao experience!",50
My wife and I recently celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary at Conrad Macao and had a fabulous time. We were overwhelmed by the kindness of the hotel staff who made our stay and celebrations extra special. Thank you so much!,50
"Hilton Hotel back again  The mood and majesty there still remain. I visit here every year for healing holiday but this time it was even more special. My wife was preparing for a secret birthday present for my birthday. But the real surprise gifts were from the Hilton Hotel and lounge team.  They gave us the happy birthday celebration with so many big smiles and calmness. it made me feel like I was back in my childhood.  Moreover, the suite room they upgraded surprised me once again, and in the lounge, the lounge team, who showed interest every time, they treat and talk to us like a friend of a friend next door. This trip was a journey full of healing, some other special care, and a trip that was worthy of pride for a lifetime.  Thanks again, Especially the Conrad Macau lounge…",50
"A quick little getaway to this hotel is exactly what we needed. I have stayed at this property several times and the level of service is always the best. The team at Executive Floor - Tyra, Archin, Sarah, Emmen and Jody are simply amazing; They remember every guests preferences and always up for a good chat.  I got to meet the Guest Relations Manager Jasmine upon check in and she was so friendly and nice. They treat everyone as friends, not as guests. If you are considering of upgrading to executive floor benefits It is a must! Best hospitality and great food and drinks served!  The rooms are huge! Before we entered the room they had all my favorite amenities in the room and also called just to make sure everything was ok.  The fitness center is great and the pools are amazing…",50
"I have stayed at the Conrad Macau many times over the past two years for business travel.  The hotel staff is wonderful, always going out of their way.  Facilities are great, but  even better is the staff, they are really really special.  Conrad - my first choice in Macau.",50
"The hotel facilities are great, the rooms are big and cozy and the hospitality is outstanding. Even though it's a huge hotel - everyone knew my name since I got there and did everything they could to make sure I enjoy my visit.  I highly recommend this hotel.",50
 Well equiped spacious room ensured our cozy stay in Macau.Well equiped spacious room and staff's hearty hospitality ensured our cozy stay in Macau. Location is just the centre of Cotai area and convenient for visiting any interested place in Cotai including Eiffel Tower and Water Dancing.,50
"We had the pleasure in staying at the Conrad Macau and had the warmest welcome from Scarlett at checkin and she was just the best I have personally witnessed in all my travels in welcoming guests and giving us all the info we could ask for and even walked us to our rooms to show us all the amenities available which were just Awsome :)  I definitely recommend staying at the Conrad when ever visiting Macau for its central location, beautiful spacious rooms and 7 star room amenities and showing the kids with gifts.  Enjoy ;)",50
Everyone in the hotel is professional and caring. Great services and cozy room. Hotel provides small packs of gift to kids so that they could focus on drawing and painting while parents are tidying up the stuff. Location is convenient since it's right at the cotai strip in which we can visit different spots by walk. Lots of restaurant and shops around.,50
"Ok this is my 2nd attempt to write this review.  Let's see how it goes.  I was given a recommendation by a friend to stay at the Conrad Cotai Hotel and I am very pleased (pleasantly so) that I did.  At first I was concerned that it is part of the same 'Sands' resort as the Sheraton (next door) which I had previously stayed at and did not have a great experience (But that's another story).The staff who greeted us at Check-in, Amila and Kevin were super friendly and helpful, Amila even took us to our room personally and showed us around.  The room was very spacious and clean and most importantly did not smell of smoke (unlike some other hotels).  Amila even arranged for a birthday cake to be sent to our rooms after realising the reason for our stay.The gym facilities are great!…",50
"We stayed at Conrad Cotai hotel for 3 nights. First, the room was spacious and extremely clean. Second, we were impressed with a wide variety of breakfast. Third, the staff was helpful, friendly and polite. Finally, the hotel located on the center ; there were many shops and entertainment for family and kids. We travelled to many countries around the world ;Conrad Cotai hotel is one of our favorite hotel we recommend to our friends.",50
Check in process was silky smooth with the attentive staff. Hotel facilities were well maintain since my last visit couple of years back. I got offered a room on high floor with a stunning view. Will definitely have conrad on the top list for my next visit to macao,50
"Wow! A fantastic experience from start to finish. If I could give more than a 5 out of 5, I would because my stay here was way beyond a 5 out of 5. The staff was incredibly warm and helpful. The room was incredible. It was so nice that I almost didn't want to go and explore the rest of Macau. And the view was gorgeous, especially at night, because the hotel overlooks so much of the Cotai Strip. Definitely my best hotel stay ever!",50
"I don’t even know how to express my sincerest thank you to the front office team in Conrad Macao! From the warm welcome back at the door, to a flawless check in, to the nice touch of room introduction highlight, to the upgraded massive suite, and always excellent club lounge service! Don’t mention the cakes and lovely arrangement for our birthday celebration! We were absolutely spoiled by the team, every staff we encountered were outstanding and they exceed our expectations each time we stayed here! We felt so special and taken care of like superstars! Kudos to the team’s continuous effort to keep improving their customer service no matter what, simply, Conrad is the best in Macao!!",50
"We've been impresed by this hotel, rooms are very spacious and if you are lucky to have this stunning view we had at Parisian hotel ut will be one of the best experiences! Service is on very high level, they even have iphones in every room with internet service which you can use for navigation in city, very useful! And its close to most of famous places in Macau you must visit, you can literally walk to them. And lobby! It's amazing, all these quaint designs!",50
"Excellent all around. Room size is big. Staffs were attentive, despite lack of proper greeting at the driveway. The hotel is connected to other other hotels and shopping malls, very convenient in bad weather. ",50
"Had a wonderful stay this past weekend with my husband and 2 adult kids.  We were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary.  Lots of nice touches,  upgraded to a suite, champagne and cake in room when we arrived, bedroom and bed decorated with balloons and flower petals, and fabulous service from all the staff!  We were a little worried about choosing to go to Macau as we have previously found it to be very crowded.  The Conrad is different.  It is quiet, calm and elegant.  The lounge is excellent.  We had breakfast and evening drinks there.  Would stay here again. Definitely recommend it!   Thank you for making our stay so special!",50
Some guests do not have lift level access card but able to get others to help them to access to their level. They do not know each other.  Every guest access lift level card should only can access to their level which they stay. Bodhi Spa is not a good choice for me. I would prefer Studio City Zensa Spa in term of skills. ,30
"The Conrad staff made every effort to look after my needs and seemed genuinely to want to do as much as they could to help. Even a simple request for directions was met with a ""follow me"" to make sure I was indeed on the right track. Free phone come Wifi hotspot was great too. Very comfortable bed, nice view, safe environment in a good location.",50
"We have been to this hotel 3 or 4 times now and we are always impressed.  This is the second time that Ivan, at the check in desk in the Executive Lounge, upgraded us to an AMAZING room-140Sq meters, with a separate media room, living and dining area, and massive bedroom.  The staff is amazing, the lounge is great.  The pools are heated to different temperatures and have different depths, which is convenient for young children.  We love coming here for a quick weekend giveaway.  Highly recommend!",50
I was there for 3 nights and everything was perfect the room and specially the kindness of the staff at the Conrad lounge it s always a pleasure to be there the best hotel in Macau!!! I can’t wait to go back! ,50
"A relatively new hotel located in the heart of Macau .  Staffs are friendly but like all the other  hotels in Macau it’s quite noisy above a casino ... there was one time a drunken + rude mainlander followed us (2 girls) in the lift and made us to tap the card in the lift for him.  Pretty scary but glad the security was observant so he sorted him out for us.  Anyway , the room was clean and spacious , with enormous toilet too.  But the reception forgotten our morning call on the last day.    Generally it was a good stay.  I would go back again if I ought to visit Macau again.  ",40
"Check in was very smooth with no waiting. You are then escorted to your spacious room which in our case had a view of the Eiffel tower of the Parisian Hotel on the Cotai strip. The hotel is furnished to a very high standard and the design of the rooms is very well thought through. There is a free coach to take you from the airport or ferry terminal to and from the hotel and the City of Dreams is next door which has coach to take you to downtown Macau, all are complimentary. The Grand Orbit restaurant which serves breakfast has a very large selection of food to suit every taste. Staff are really friendly but most are struggling with English which is not a big issue in general as the majority of tourists seem to be chinese.  The Bodhi spa is great and to a very high standard.  The…",50
"Had another amazing stay in this wonderful hotel, which is one of my ultimate favourites in the whole world!  I want to express my deepest and most sincerest thanks to front office supervisor Mr Elvis Wen, as well as all the wonderful staff at the Executive Club Lounge: receptionists Mr Emman and Mr Frand, head waiter Ms. Tyra, waiters Ryan, Madan and Phia... Thank you all for making my visit again an unforgetable one and for making me really feel like coming back home! I was also so touched that you all remembered me from my last visit - that felt so nice and touching! Can’t wait to get back again soon (already made a new reservation for early January, just because of you guys!).",50
"3 night stay in a spacious, well appointed junior suite on the 25th floor. The Hotel is well located on the Strip, connected to Holiday Inn and Sheraton/Sands, with great views across to Venetian and Parisian Hotels. Restaurants and Bar are all shared but very good, the Pools are well equipped and spotless and there is a very nice Spa on site. Reasonably priced, there are all of the 5star amenities you’d expect, in a great location, and very friendly courteous staff. Recommended.",40
An expected large room with living room; however the sofa on the window side is too soft and not firm enough. The flushing system is almost broken down on my check-out date of 3D2N stay.  Service responsiveness is acceptable as a whole.,30
"The check in process was fast, pleasant and very efficient considering we where a large group. Loved my room clean, fresh with a bed so comfortable. The hospitality of the hotel staff is not only verbalized but felt. Try their breakfast buffet and enjoy the variety of choices. The hotel itself is connected to 5 other hotels where you can go on a food trip,a shopping spree and entertainment for all. Great stay and experience.",50
One of our best stay we ever had. Warmly greeted and welcome at the check in desk. All staff are very friendly and helpful. Truly memorable stay and highly recommended hotel to those who are looking for the best service and hospitality in town. Surely comeback within this year...  ,50
"Eric, our bellhop, and Annie, at the reservation desk were especially welcoming, professional, and friendly to us. The entire staff was accommodating, but I hope that the two of them get a special acknowledgement.  Our room was well appointed and comfortable.  We needed a crib and when it arrived, we also received a “baby gift box”...essentials like soap, diapers, and a plastic meal tray and fun things, Baby Conrad slippers and a gold teddy bear!  The restaurant on the ground floor offered an excellent breakfast at a fair price.  The workout facility is very nice with a sauna & steam to enjoy.  The pool is quiet, lovely.  I enjoyed their delicious spring rolls poolside as well!  The shopping area is okay, a little dated...but good stores.",40
"We stayed at Conrad Macao to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We stayed at the premium suite and it exceeded our expectation. I usually don't sleep well on the first night if I stay at a new place, but I slept really well at Conrad. The bed was so comfortable. They even had a pillow menu for you to choose from. I chose the lavender pillow and a whole body pillow. The circular bathtub was the bomb. Everything is so clean and totally premium. The customer service of this hotel is awesome. I highly recommend this hotel.",50
"I have stayed here for 3 nights. The executive lounge staff are excellent. They not only greet guests with big smile, but also remember my name and my preferences. The whole hotel is stunning from customer service to amenities. The room is spacious. The executive Lounge team is the best. The two ladies one with glasses and the other not are super attentive. I was impressed. Also I would like to personally thank Ken Xu to take care of my mom as I did not see him and thank him in person. I would come back again for sure. This hotel from any aspects is second to none in Macau. ",50
"Overall, it was pretty good. I enjoyed the upgrade on the room and the service provided by F&B in the lounge. I had a fantastic time watching the Monkey King with my friend. It is always a nice trip in Macau given its special take on endless shopping and entertainment. Yet, I must say that I did not like the ending part of my stay which started with the checkout process. The best service part of the lounge check in staff came from Ivan, who was the only one who remembered me from before and he did do his best to make the all guests feel welcomed. Charlie was also very helpful and kind. Yet, on the day of checkout, July 5th in the afternoon, I must say that I hope I would not need to experience it again. I was proactively offered the day before to use the lounge as a courtesy…",40
"Upscale hotel and with usual 5 star hotel amenity. Comfort bed and large bathroom, both bathtub and shower. nice working desk and Wi-Fi is great too. there is a curve shaped sofa and good view of outside via window. ",50

first stay in Conrad Macau with my friend and met Dayo upon Check in who upgraded a very nice room for us and gave me very details restaurant recommendations!!  i also want to share with you that the breakfast was so so great and lots of choices for the guests!! love this hotel so much and definitely with come back for Dayo’ good service!!!!,50
"The service here is so good and is only equaled by the quality of the rooms which are huge.  We had a private check in service, and many special touches like the laundry basket in your room. The buffet breakfast was huge and had every type of cuisine from local Chinese to Indian to Portuguese and European.  It’s part of the Sands resorts so is attached to a casino and massive shopping malls connected to replicas of Vegas hotels such as the Venetian, the Parisian etc. It’s like Vegas on speed.  Old town represents many UNESCO heritage listed buildings from 4 or 500 years of Portuguese ownership.  The Portuguese tarts are a must.  It’s a surprise place and this is one of the better hotels. ",50
"Specially highlight to Front office supervisor Fiona, which she is very patience and friendly. My family arrived at Conrad before me, Fiona helped my family check-in and brought them to the room and teach them to use in room facility. We felt very welcome. Definitely will come back next time.",50
"5 star hotel at its standard but few highlights and feedbacks. Loved the breakfast spread however the restaurant being in the shopping centre side, if u r not familiar with the establishment, could be confusing without any signs or label on the door or venues to locate the restaurant. Some of its lobby bar staffs in early morning didn’t even know where was the breakfast restaurant which was shocking to me. Took a while to locate it after finally directed by a shopping mall staff.  Given a feedback to the reception counter and was welcomed. Maybe Conrad should print a direction or locality map of its restaurants on a paper to put on the guest room desks.   Guessing the bathrooms extractors maybe only located above the shower boots?nevertheless it’s suffocating and with poor…",50
"Exceeded my expectations. Thank you so much for making this experience such memorable one, Achin. Very impressed with their professionalism, and going that extra mile to make customers happy. The room is very clean, location is perfect, and service was excellent. Highly recommended!",50
"It was the second stay at this hotel and once again the Staff made it to an unforgettable one. At the Lounge, Lei, Sarah, Achin, Emman, Yvan, Sunshine, Ryan and Tyra make sure your are being trated like royals !!! You don't have wishes since they pamper you so well, you cannot wish for more. At the pool Miss Glenda was taking care of us like we were the king and the queen in person. Floor Manager Gloria and Club Manager Diana may be proud of their extremely friendly and well trained Staff. Everybody at Conrad Macau is doing much more than is ecpetced from their job description !!! We surely go back !!!!!",50
"Conrad is one of my favourite hotels, as service was good and remained. However, cleanliness did not remain as before that an used tissue was found on the table next to the bed when we first went into the room after check in. ",30
"Brilliant stay for company meeting. Event managers arrangements and organisation was magnificent. Exemplary follow up, late notice requests met efficiently. Meeting rooms and catering were very good. We were only a small group but given the high roller treatment. ",50
"Before arrival, I emailed the hotel letting them know it was for a special occasion. Edmund Tan responded to my email very quickly.  All I can he was most helpful and attentive to our needs prior and during our stay. Once checked-in we settled in our room. Not long we were surprised with a whole cake and a note. Very nice touch..  Stayed for the night and asked Edmund to recommend somewhere for lunch. He booked and again he made sure the restaurant looked after us. Another surprise cake:)  I have stayed at a number of hotels in Macao but I must say Conrad is the best so far...in terms of attentiveness. But of course the location great and the room was immaculate. If you are looking for clean/modern interior I would recommend Conrad. ",50
"Highly recommend this hotel, great location with a short shuttle bus ride from the airport and opposite the venetian. Staff were excellent and very helpful, great lobby bar and choice of restaurants. The rooms were very comfortable with great views and impressive bathroom.",40
"We had a brilliant stay here recently and were delighted to learn that the standard of the Hotel is even better than before. And my God! ..it had been magnificent back then two and three years ago, too. We loved our higher floor room and just basked in the comfort. The Pool area was outstanding and the service from the attendants there was so caring and solicitous. The gymnasium was as comfortable and well-appointed as ever as well.",50
"I know this hotel might not be the latest and greatest in a sea of hotels, but I must say I really enjoy my stays here each and every time.   Service is always excellent.  Staff are very helpful and great.  The rooms are always a real nice touch. The suites are a real nice size and very comfortable.  I love the robes here, super soft and maybe the best from all the hotels I have stayed in so far.  The spa experience is wonderful.   They pay attention to detail and communicate well to let you know what is going on and professional ",50
"You can come to the Macau Conrad to gamble, shop, or relax. We came to have a romantic few days together in a nice hotel.  The Conrad is connected to a mall that connects to another mall.  So much to do without going outside on a hot day. We had a two room suite (included some pictures) that was well designed and comfortably elegant.  We had executive lounge privileges and that allowed us to also have an included breakfast downstairs at a restaurant with a more expansive buffet.  It is a nice property and we would stay here again. ",50
A relatively small hotel that provides excellent personal service. While located in the center of the new Hotels / Casinos it provides a respite from the mob scenes the  Winn / MGM etc are. The concierge desk is fantastic made my every wish happen. ,50
"The Conrad Hotel is one of the 5 star hotels in Sand Cotai Central among the Sheraton and Holiday Inn Hotel. It's quite near the Macau Airport and Cotai/Hong Kong Ferry Terminal about 10-minute drive. Not only providing free shuttle to and from both the Airport and the Ferry Terminal, it also offers transport free to the Macau/Hong Kong Ferry Terminal and the China/Macau Border. The hotel is also connected with the Four Season Hotel, Parisian Hotel ...etc. The hotel's recreation facilities includes three beautiful swimming pools and a gym. The hotel room is spacious and clean, and bed comfortable providing very good sleeping quality. I visited Macau 3 to 4 times a year. I consider  the service in the Executive Lounge being second to none among the 5-star hotels in Macau.I was…",50
Wonderful front desk staff & the rooms are brilliant.  free shuttle bus to & from the Macau ferry terminal. Cotai Central provides high end shopping with a mixture of good restaurants & a large food court on level 2.  It also offers air conditioned walkways to the Venetian & Parisian casinos,50
"The modesty and humility of the staff at Conrad stood out for me. High service standards are a given at any luxury property. What makes the experience at Conrad remarkable is that you don't see the effort, there is no pretence and none of the guest interactions look forced. Every staff member I interacted with came across as someone I've known for sometime...almost like a dear friend or acquaintance. I was there for a business conference so except the lobby bar and the banquet service, I did not get the chance to try any other hotel facilities. Nevertheless, this experience has left its mark and I'll certainly look forward to visiting a Conrad property (hopefully with the same service experience) for a family holiday.",50
"My official travel took me to Macao very recently & I got the chance to stay in Conrad. Must stay that this is one of the finest hotels i have stayed in. The highlight was the friendliness of the Hotel staff. Although being a foreigner in the land, hotel staff made sure that i felt at home. Housekeeping was excellent & food was awesome.  While I could not stay for long to experience the spa & other facilities, I would like to come back on a leisure trip & will definitely stay at Conrad. The bed in the room was absolutely perfect with right cushioning which rest of them do too much or too less.",50
"We stayed 4 nights at the Conrad Macau earlier this month (13-17 May), our second visit this year.  It is our first-choice hotel of the four hotels in the Sands Cotai Central resort (the others being St Regis, Sheraton Grand and Holiday Inn).  We like the hotel for its quiet, understated elegance and the impeccable service from the hotel staff.  Each time we visit, our queries and emails to the hotel were promptly answered, our room requests (shower chair, etc.) were honoured, and all the staff we encountered during our stay were always helpful and friendly.  We would like to commend especially Mr Owen of the Front Office who handled our check-in on at least two occasions.  Owen was very professional, helpful and accommodating, and we appreciated the efficient and hassle-free…",50
"Ofcourse like any other hotels in the area, they have free shuttle service. What we loved most is their spa and pool deck. The suite we stayed in have very spacious walk-in wardrobe, little space for toilet and bath area.. but it was fine. The room also had a separate entertainment room. It was an unforgettable stay. Staff displays superb customer service.",50
"We stayed for 2 nights and wished we stayed longer.  As soon as we arrived we were welcomed warmly, and was escorted to the front desk, where our receptionist, Fiona, checked us in and escorted us to our upgraded suite since we were gold Hilton Honors members. She explained the supplied cell phone we could use while in Macao and was warm, attentive, friendly, that made us feel truly welcomed.  The Executive Lounge was especially wonderful, Ivan, one of the concierge and the entire staff need to commended for their outstanding service.  The food was wonderful as I was informed by staff everything was made in-house.  I would recommend this hotel hands down,",50
"We have stayed at all the Sands Cotai hotels except St Regis. In terms of ranking, Four Seasons standout ahead of Conrad in terms of luxury & service quality.   Check in experience was excellent.  Room was clean, comfortable & spacious. The Conrad is located in the same tower as the Holiday Inn but has separate lobby.  The elevator banks were not as exclusive as one would expect of a five star hotel.",40
"This is what you would expect of a Conrad property. Room was spacious, clean and comfortable. Only issue was the breakfast. The breakfast was located some what away and looked a bit chaotic. They did have some amazing range for breakfast which  included a Roast Beef station for Breakfast!!! You should also know that this property is within a shopping complex shares with 3 other hotels (6 if you include the Venetian which is accessible by a overhead bridge)",50
"The Conrad Macau is a beautiful and luxurious hotel conveniently located right in the centre of the Cotai strip.  I was amazed on all levels from the moment I made the reservation for my stay from 17th – 19th May 2018.  A couple weeks before I was due to arrive, Stephen the Concierge reached out to me via email and welcomed me back to Conrad.  I had previously stayed in 2012, so was surprised this was recognised and added to the level of feeling welcome before arrival.  On day of arrival, the staff at the check-in lobby recognised me by name and also thanked me as a diamond member for my loyalty.  I was immediately escorted to the Executive Lounge to complete my check-in and also provided with welcome drinks and food.  I was given a room upgrade to a suite which was very…",50
"I spend one night at the hotel from a quick getaway from Hong Kong.  Upon arriving at the Ferry terminal in Macau, there are free Shuttle buses going to Sands Central which include the Conrad Hotel (First stop)  Check-in Upon check in, I was informed that as Diamond member I was upgraded to a one bedroom suite. However, there room would not be ready for a couple of hours. However, they took my bags and advised that they would be taken directly to the room. I was invited to use the Executive Lounge where Breakfast was still being served. Check in staff was extremely professional and courteous which created a great first impression   Room: The one bedroom suite was stunning. Not a single fault. It was a beautifully decorated living/dining room with a toilet and a separate bedroom…",50
"Stayed 2 nights last week in Macau. Monday and Tuesday nights and the rate was very reasonable.  From the moment I walked in the door until I left the service was outstanding, from being recognized and addressed by name, to the quality of the Lounge, the room which was an upgraded suite with 4 rooms. Sara in the lounge was very helpful as was the gentleman who checked me in. Location is great and there are 2 connected casinos. It was raining the whole time I was there so I could not use the pool, gym was really great.",50
"This is my second stay at Conrad Macao. The location, facility and food are definitely good. What I want to address this time is that the staff at front office and others made my stay fantastic. When checking-in, I was impressed by the charming smile and professional service of Marcia, the front officer. The gift she gave to my son made him happy and also made us relaxed as he spent the whole evening on drawings. I was also surprised by a birthday cake prepared for my mom-in-law by the front officers. Really appreciate this very thoughtful gift! Moreover, the staff also prepared the wash packages for my kids, which made our stay quite convenient. Thank you!",50
"Stay one night at Conrad Macao, this is my second stay at this hotel. This time, I select a suite room for my wedding anniversary. Troy arranged a romantic set up for me. Although the set up is so simple, I like it. Before I arrive, I send too many email for request, Troy and ada are so helpful to solve all issue. I am veryAppreciated of their professional service.  This hotel will provide the smart phone for guest in room. The guest can take this out for using during staying period. The smart phone can dial international phone call and domestic phone call, and provide wifi, all the phone call is free. It is so impress design. Upon the Check in, so smooth check in, not too crowded in lobby. It is very peaceful. In Macao, all hotel lobby is so loud and too crowded. I collect my…",50
"Quiet and conducive for a holiday, staff are always helpful and polite. Check in and check out procedures are quick and simple, convenient access to airport and ferry terminal. Will be hotel of choice if I visit macau again.",50
"Our group was marvelously impressed with the serviced offered at Conrad Macao, staff were very friendly and accommodating.   If any companies are planning for future corporate event, Conrad Macao is surely a good pick.  We will hope to return soon with our upcoming company anniversary:)",40
"Hotel was good, and the room was great.  There are too many other options in the area though for me to give 5 Star.  The value isn’t there when you could stay at another property with better amenities for lower cost.",40
My wife and I had a good time in macao thanks to the Hotel and it's staff.  Concierge is one of the best we have experienced.  They go out of their way to make guests happy.  Trista in particular is excellent.  The room was spacious/ clean and did not smell like smoke which is prevalent in Macao.  We were able to sleep well. The bed and pillows were comfortable.  There was a Nespresso machine in the room and a Handyphone for our communication needs.  What else could anyone ask for?? Perfect weekend!,50
"The location is good, right in front of Venetian, I like to stay in Cotai instead of the city. The room is BIG. Bed and pillows are comfortable. Amenities provided are more than you need. Water bottles are small, but dont hesitate to ask for more, they are more than happy to give you (I asked for 3 more, they gave me 4). Lots of welcome gifts (I love gifts, I`m sold ;)). Friendly and knowledgable staff, special thanks to Mr. Stephen Feng and Mr. Yao.",50
"Overall: It’s A wonderful 3-night stay at this establishment with its lovely staff. I’ve booked 3 rooms (while traveling with two infants). The staff makes you feel right at home. Such impeccable service. Top notch.   Location:  Situated in Sands Cotai - which is connected to a many other hotels such as Sheraton, Holiday Inn and Venetian. You are able to enjoy indoor shopping and food at your own pace. There’s a food court at the mall attached to the hotel at level 3. If you’ve kids - there’s a huge store for kids items next to the food court.  * The good thing about this hotel is that you’ll find more privacy than the famous Venetian across the street.   Check in:  It was a smooth transition. There was no queue like other hotels with the queue poles. It was how one should feel…",50
"This place is highly recommended, I've visited this place for two days. it was a very good experience. I enjoyed staying there, the staff was friendly, and very helpful in anything. It's from the best hotel i've stayed in.",50
"This is probably the most luxurious hotel I've been in. The ""de-luxe"" (ie standard) rooms are huge and gorgeous. That said, I didn't like where it was, in the midst of all the other Vegas style developments. The staff fell over themselves to be helpful but sometimes I wished that they would just calm down!",50
"We bought last minute tickets to the Bruno Mars concert in Macao, and reserved this overnight stay with Hilton Points.  This is a great hotel if you are coming to see an event because it is attached to the arena via the shopping mall and sky bridge.  It's easy to catch the free bus from the ferry terminal, but we were tighter on time so we took a taxi right outside.  The cost was about $45 Hong Kong dollars.  We did take the bus back to the terminal on the way back to the ferry.  Check in was smooth, the person at the check in was fast and efficient and escorted us to the elevators which is a great example of the details that make Conrad great.  The room was very comfortable, two relatively large beds, awesome bathroom, nice space.  They have a small android phone in the room…",40
"Excellent Services, Spacious Floor area with 2 bathroom, great for families and friends when queuing up for bathroom could be a nightmare. Also there a complimentary mobile phone that can be use to make phone calls and also act as a hotspot(4G extremely fast) when out of hotels area.  One bad thing is that the wifi coverage in the room is terrible as I had trouble connecting to the wifi while in bathroom.  Lastly, the services by the staff is excellent and in mine aspect this is a very important point in determine a good and great hotel.",50
"Warm and nice hotel. Counter, Anki is very nice and friendly. I have a baby and she provided a quick response for us so that I don't need to wait so much time. After I reach my room, it is big and comfort. The view is excellent. Anki called and asked if I satisfied. It is very warm. Hotel provided a welcome candy, shower duck and baby package with cute bear.  As it is my birthday, Hotel served a birthday cheese cake for me. It is really surprise and I will stay again when I visit Macau.",50
"Great hotel with good facilities and location, but the biggest ""high five"" goes to the staff. All of them are so genuinely helpful, friendly and professional. We have received such a warm welcome along with such a flawless service that we cannot wait to be back! You guys are truly inspiring! Thank you for your hospitality!",50
"We visit Hong Kong quite regularly and always like to spend a few days in Macau, mainly because of this wonderful hotel.  It’s such a pleasure to stay here.  This visit was just a delight.  The staff are truly lovely people.  Our experience of the executive lounge was enhanced by Tyra who attended to our needs seamlessly, she really is a treasure.  We were checked in on the executive floor and this was perfectly handled by calm, pleasant and professional staff.  I don’t know how they do it but even though the accommodations are great, as is the location, it’s the people they employ which makes this hotel spectacular.  They actually make us feel like valued family members.  Extraordinary!  As Diamond members we’ve stayed in hotels all over the world and this is our favourite.   …",50
"Amidst the many IRs in Macau, especially on Cotai, there are many options. With one exception, the Conrad stands out with a beautiful facility, but with an even superior service culture. From the moment your arrive to the moment you depart you will feel valued and known as a guest. Definitely worth the slight premium. looking forward to my next trip to Macau so I can stay at the Conrad again!",50
"Conrad Hilton, in Cotai Central Macao is a great luxury class hotel located in Sands. The level of service meets an unforgettable stay. I had an experience of hospitality at its finest service as a Hhonors member. My suite had all amenities  and a beautiful view over Cotai. Will be back. Thanks guys.",50
"What an amazing experience, we were given 5 star service at every turn and would highly recommend anyone coming to Macao to stay at the Conrad. All the staff were spot shined and polished and the managers were really organized and on it!",50
"Beautiful hotel with exceptional service, gorgeous rooms, and a terrific spa that actually has availability and focuses on the client the whole experience. Concierge was very helpful, especially for getting to and from hotel from Hong Kong airport.  The housekeeping staff made me feel as if I had my own special valet (even though I made no specific requests). They consistently organized my many charger cords, arranged my robe, slippers, and personal items to enhance efficiency, and provided a delightful turndown service, including nightly placement of slippers on a white cloth and a fresh water service next to my bed. Meanwhile, I paid less than USD200 per night for the room.  Wonderful experience all around!",50
"Stayed at the Conrad for the 1st time with family and 2 rooms. It is indeed the biggest  Conrad hotel in the world with over 600 rooms. A real “monster” of hotel. It is connected with St Regis , Holiday Inn, Shetaton and Venetian, all owned and managed by Sands. The ground floor has a large Casino of course and plenty of shopping malls all interconnected. Rooms are very clean and spacious. All rooms to have a mobile phone with internet roaming that you can take out of the hotel and connect WIFI to your mobile . This is very convenient. The service staff at the Executive Lounge are great and a good food selection. If you though go with children , not that many things to do though. ",50
This is one of the few properties in the Hilton chain that know how to treat a diamond member. They are genuinely welcoming and warm. Great breakfast in the lounge and evening cocktails are superb. Room service was the best I have had and served in room like you are dining in a 5 star restaurant. Staff very knowledgable of the area and let you know what there is to do besides Casinos. Outstanding value as well. Much appreciated to all at the Conrad.,50
"My stay was during April 3-5th.  The check in process was smooth and professional with Vincent.  He pointed out all the amenities for the Conrad and made sure everything was in order after we settled into our room.  The club lounge staff were also exceptional. They made sure my stay went smooth by helping me book hard to get reservations (Tasting Room) and booking last minute ferry tickets during the holiday rush.  I would like thank Emman, Charlie, Tyra and Frand for their friendly service and hospitality. It made a big difference for our stay.  The room was spacious and clean. Perfect for a relaxing stay. I can see why this is the top hotel in Macau.",50
"We had a very great time staying at Conrad Macau. It was our Honeymoon trip, so the Hotel gave us upgraded room which has best view ever; Parisian with the ""eiffel tower"". We also been surprised by the basket of fruit and yummiest cheese cake not to mention the compliment Conrad-signature-teddy bear. The front office lady, Ms. Fancy was very helpful and giving us lot of information during our check in. She also took us into our room and explained about the room facilities. Surely gonna comeback to this hotel.",50
Good service  Nice room  Good food What else one can ask for ?  Conrod won't let you down   Bath tub ducky is cute   A teddy bear for you to hold in bed   Awwwwwww.....  Their slippers are high end quality silky-satinish feeling   Love it ! ,50
"We stayed at Conrad for few days during our first trip ever to Macao and Hong Kong. Off the bat we experienced excellent service from Amila during check in process and to great advice on what to do in Macao, Since it was our first trip to Macao, we had many questions.  After checking in, Amila walked us to our room and showed us around and also explained how to use the in room free cell phone. She was extremely friendly, professional and courteous. Most of the staff that we encountered at Conrad were all very friendly and spoke english well.  We had a 2 queen bed room, which was quite spacious and clean. Bed is comfortable to sleep on. Overall, very satisfied with the room.   It was located at center of town, right in the Sand's Coati Central. It has a shopping mall, food court…",50
"The hotel is located just a few minutes from the Taipa ferry terminal where we arrived with frquent shuttles, about every 5-10 minutes. Just look for the lime green bus operated by Sands with Conrad, Holiday inn and Sheraton on the side.  It is a little confusing upon arrival at the hotel as they don't really announce what hotel you are arriving at but first stop is holiday inn and Conrad and just walk to the right for the Conrad entrance. The two hotels share the facilities within the building.  Check-in was extremely friendly with offers of any information or help we could need. We were upgraded to a nice suite as Hilton Diamond members, one of the better upgrades you will ever get.   The suite was extremely nice and well maintained with Nespresso machine and a loaner mobile…",50
"The staff at the Conrad alway greet me by name - I used to be a Hilton Honors Diamond member, now just Gold - but they still greet me by name.  I figure they must put arriving HH members pictures up in the staff area because it has been a year since my last visit and still the staff recognize me.  The Club Lounge is very nice and always has a decent selection of food for breakfast and of snacks for cocktail time.  The only challenge is that when here I often work until 8pm or after and Club Lounge closes at 8pm - it would be nice if it was open until 10pm.  The rooms are great, if you manage to get a suite they are awesome.  ",50
"We stayed at the Sheraton hotel in the Cotai Central complex in early December 2017. Most nights we would have a nightcap or two at the Hotel Conrad Macao Cotai Central bar. We found the staff to be very welcoming, friendly and they provided excellent customer service. Big call out to Jenna and Mariz for looking after us so well.",50
"I stayed in this hotel for my family’s Easter break.  We stayed in a 2 Queen bed suite. The room itself was good. It was spacious and nicely decorated.   The bathroom was also spacious with good amenities.   However, the internet connection was really bad. The signal was very weak and most of the time if I could engage it, it was very slow.  It created inconveniences to my family and myself.  Hope they can improve next time ",40
Simply amazing hotel. Great service in all areas and the rooms are very well thought out. The location is amazing and great casino complex. Will stay here again when in Macau as value for money is great.,50
"Pleasant stay. Every guest has different experiences. Maybe room upgrade, maybe some cakes, basket of fruit, or another things for their celebration. So enjoy your own stay. Thanks to Mr Tony Wang for gave us the best view & nice view from room during stay, show & explain to us about the room. Polite, kindness, helpful, friendly hotel staff. Clean room. Good location. Good hotel amenities.",50

"I have been to a number of hotels in Macao and tried many hotels around the Cotai Strip area, and Conrad clearly stood out from the rest.  Firstly, the check-in experience was wonderful. I was attended to by Owen, warmly welcomed as it was a returning stay for me at Conrad Macao again. Owen also provided me with lots of information about the places I can visit in Macao and also shared much information about Zhu Hai, which we went the next day!   Secondly, the concierge at Conrad is really top notch as compared to the experience I had from the neighbouring hotels within Cotai Sands Central. Stephen attended to us at the Concierge and provided very good directions and recommendations to the local foods, they were all spot on, and my family liked them all, eg. 成记粥品 for the most…",50
"A absolutely 5 star property!!! superbly designed rooms, full of comfort n luxury. The views from rooms was just excellent. We had a very pleasant stay. The cleanliness was exemplary. The free shuttle service to the ferry pier and within all other places in Macau leaves u carefree and at ease.",50
Beautiful facility with consistently outstanding service . . . was upgraded to a 2-room suite as a Gold member and was one of the nicest hotel rooms I have stayed at in my life.  Every hotel staff member provided outstanding and attentive service.,50

"I enjoyed their indoor jacuzzis very much, the staff was very nice and attentative, especially Shirley from the Philippines, she even offered to have my swimming suit spin dried while I was blow drying my hair. 👍👍",50
Despite the sheer size of the hotel we were very pleased with the very personal service we received. We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a small suite which was beautiful and very spacious. Concierge were incredibly helpful with our onward arrangements and with all our questions. A special mention must also go to the staff in the Executive lounge who looked after us so well and were so friendly. There are a lot of hotels in this area but we were very pleased with our choice.,50
"Pure class, in an area that I consider quite flashy. Stand out hotel; from the entry through to the very spacious rooms. The little treats of personalized items were just devine, and are well loved. Robes are the best ever, so much so we bought one. ",50
"Macau has a big choice for 5-star accommodation, all in close proximity. Even in the Cotai Central complex, there is also the Sheraton and St Regis (as well as a 4-star Holiday Inn).   I chose the Conard as a Gold Hilton Honors member and based on its Trip Advisor reviews, and while I can't comment on other hotels, I was very happy with the Conard.  On check-in as a Gold member, I was upgraded to a junior suite with a view of the Macau version of the Eiffel Tower. The suite was large, comfortable and nicely furnished, and included a big bathroom with separate shower and bathtub, and double sink.  Staff from check-in and throughout the time of my stay were always helpful and friendly. Food from room service and in the hotel were great as well.  Location wise, the Sands Cotai…",50
"A truly amazing experience in luxury and customer service. From the moment we arrived, the staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome and looked after. Everything was designed to make us feel at home, from the menu in our room allowing us to choose the type of pillow we wanted on our beds to the turndown service leaving a cute little teddy bear on our pillow. The spa complex was so luxurious, we found it hard to leave our hotel! Extra points for Charlie, who went above and beyond in making sure that we had everything we needed to make our trip enjoyable. Booking made through a third party service. ",50
"This hotel reminded me why it is great to be loyal to Hilton.  As a Gold member, I received room with a view of the Eiffel Tower, fantastic food from Executive Lounge.  The room is huge with all the top amenities.  The staff (Mary, Achin, Tyra, Sofea) from the Executive Lounge provided top notch service.  The pool is well heated (kudos to Kristina for always remember what I need).  The complementary duck and bear are cute. I hope I will return to Conrad Macau in the near future.",50
"Staffs are professional and friendly. View facing to the cotai street is stunning. Room is very well-maintained and has a comfortable environment. Executive lounge is enjoyable for all the breakfast, after tea, and happy hour. For HHonor high tier member is very generous. The suite is very very high CP to stay.",50

We had the most pleasant stay possible, even though the hotel was fully booked during the Chinese New Year, the quality of their service and the hospitality of their staff exceeded our expectation as always.",50
Unfortunately i wasnt able to get an upgrade but i got room with Parisian view. Breakfast and evening cocktail on 39 floor was very nice. I loved the guacamole and shao mai. Staff were all very very friendly. I would also recommend this hotel to my parents. ,50
"Spent a weekend there with my husband and our 8-month old baby. The staff were very friendly and helpful in assisting our stay! The room was spacious and the beds were amazing ( baby slept very well and didn't wake up at night!) and the bathroom, pools, saunas ... were very nice. I strongly recommend guests to stay at The Conrad if they visit Macao!",50
"I've heard that there are no bad hotels in Macao.  With that being said, I can imagine the leadership team at the Conrad have only minimal fear of the competition. Service:  Front Desk associate Emman was extremely hospitable and thorough with his explanations of the various amenities and options; many of which I did not expect. Room: Room 3412 faces north and has an excellent city view with the pool complex below.  The room was spotless with everything in working order as I would imagine.  What I did not expect was the free use of a cell phone permitting free calls to the US that doubled as a Wi-Fi hotspot,  choice of different spa products upon request, and the number of gifts, convenience items and beverage choices in the room. Location: Walking distance to the other Cotai…",50
"Came to Macau to visit family who works here.  This is the finest hotel we’ve stayed in.  Period.   The rooms are huge for Asia and perfectly appointed.  Smoke free and comfortable.   The staff is overly helpful but once you understand they are helping and not looking for extra tips, then relax and enjoy.    ",50
"This is a luxurious hotel which also knows how to make their guests feel most welcome.  The level of service is ""legendary"" and the staff can't wait to assist you in any way possible!!  The quality of sleep is ever so good--- and that makes one's stay in Macao all the better!!!  The restaurants--- especially the breakfast buffet helped start the day the best way possible! I am sure that you will find this hotel as delightful as did we!!!  And it provides excellent ""Value For Money""!!!",50
"Exceptional service and we had a wonderful birthday celebration, lucky we had Eiffel Tower and Parisian hotel view, romantic!! The birthday cake was really really delicious and beautiful, the room was huge with a comfortable sofa, the bathtub also nice with a Conrad ducky bathing together, we love the Conrad golden bear as well, every single details was attentive and lovely, thank you Conrad Macao, and we will definitely come back for sure.",50
"This would have to be the best Hotel we have ever stayed in.  We would actually rate it 6 star compared to other 5 star Hotels we have stayed in. The positive reviews are spot on. The level of customer service is second to none. A special thanks to EA Enriquez for going that extra mile. Exemplary customer service. The room was spacious and beautifully presented with fantastic views. It was cleaned spotlessly with a nightly turndown service.The use of the handy phone is a brilliant idea as it saves mobile phone data usage, and allows the traveller to have access to the Internet and Google Maps everywhere they go.  Other features that make it special are the complimentary teddy bear, duck, slippers, and sweets. The dressing gowns provided for the rooms are made of silk.  We…",50
"Since our first stay in Mar 16, we have stayed here many times and always rated the hotel and staff highly, and been strong advocates recommending it to many friends. Unfortunately, our most recent stay was spoiled by a petty dispute on checkout, that was unwarranted, dragged on for almost half an hour and just unpleasant. We left with no resolution, the hotel refusing to budge. We have been patrons and advocates of this hotel, but not any more. Very unfortunate but lots of other great hotels in Macau, so looking forward to trying others.",20
"I stayed here with my two kids (age 3 and 9 months) and our helper in the end of January for a family long weekend in Macao.   The rooms were clean and beautiful as expected.  The conrad ducks were an immediate hit for the children.  Loved our view of the ""Efile"" tower right outside of our window. The location perfect as the hotel is well connected to the shopping and other major casinos.  All famous restaurants in Taipa are also only a short taxi ride away.  There are walkable but we didn't want to chance it with our kids. One thing that was exceptional that drives me to write this review and share our experience was the service staffs in Conrad.  We were checked in by Mandy, who was super polite and speak excellent English.  Upon learning that we are travelling with two…",40
"It was located at very convinient place and very kindndess staffs and good room condition,,,etc  I really recommend The Conrad was the best place ever in MACAU But the weather was really colder than i expected.It's better check weather condition before leaving",50
"1. Get free upgrade for room, let us check in even is 1pm only. 2. Very helpful staff, Diogo did a good job. 3. Very clean room, bed are comfort. Room is big 4. Good view, facing Parisian tower. 5. Some walking distance to take shuttle bus for cotai connection, but still acceptable.",50
"A beautiful hotel with exceptional quality rooms.  Teddy bear and silver rubber ducky are complimentary treats.  Very comfortable beds, quiet, nice turn down service.  We asked for extra pillows, and ice - ice was provided the next night before we could ask! Nice service at concierge...recommending a great local restaurant in the old town... A Vencedora was a nice local treat - thanks.",50
"Well located, great rooms, professional & helpful staff: it even has a shopping mall connected to the hotel. Moreover, there is a shuttle from and to the airport, as well as from and to the ferry terminal. For the quality you get, it is really worth it.",50
"My family and I had a wonderful stay at the Conrad for 4 nights.  The hotel was conveniently located to other casinos and accessible to Ferry and Airport thru shuttle bus.  Check in went smoothly and we were upgraded to a Suite.  The rooms was huge and we loved that there were 2 bathrooms!  The beds were immensely comfortable which made it all the more difficult to get out of bed each morning.  The facilities were nice and I had a relaxing day soaking in the Jacuzzi and hanging out in the Sauna.  What made the stay most memorable were the people and service.  As a luxury hotel we expected great service and we were not disappointed.  Staffs were so attentive and warm that they remember our names, including the names of our kids.  The attention to detail was impressive and…",50
"I highly recommend this hotel.  The service is fantastic.  The staff makes an effort to please you.  I recommend paying/qualifying for lounge access if possible.  The lounge provides breakfast, tea and happy hours.  The selection and service is impeccable.  I cannot say enough good things about this hotel.",50
"The hotel is great.  From check in to check out the staff are very nice and helpful. Despite being a busy hotel, they have managed to remain very clean and the rooms are excellent.  The rooms are very comfortable and amenities very good from bath robe to shampoo, etc...",50
"We had the pleasure of staying at this beautiful property last weekend whilst celebrating our 25th Wedding Anniversary during our visit from Australia. It is a well located hotel located along the Cotai Central. From the moment we arrived and were warmly greeted by Yumi at reception we had a great feeling about the hotel and service standards.  Yumi escorted us to our suite which was of an exceptional standard, very spacious and impeccably clean (congratulations to the housekeeping team for your amazing high standards).  The little touches including personalised teddy bears signifying our 25 years, a massive fruit platter just helped make the stay that much more memorable.  We enjoyed the wonderful club lounge access and the staff in the lounge were also so warm and helpful, a…",50
"good location, 10min from the airport only. free shuttle provided .staff is friendly since we alight from the shuttle all the way to the room. room is spacious, clean n having all necessary amenities. given a Eiffel tower view room, it's awesome. really enjoy for the stay.",50
"Stayed in the Conrad for 2 nights in Jan17. As a Diamond member, I do expect great service - and the Conrad did not disappoint. Very helpful in getting us tickets for the Sound of Music show as well as booking us tickets for the ferry back to HK - very smooth. Also, the service in the Lounge was outstanding. The hotel is well located on the Cotai strip, walking distance to Venetian and Parisian. Lots of places to eat in the area - covering all budgets. The nice thing about the Conrad is that it is quite quiet as the hotel itself does not have a casino.",50
"I and my big family ( parents, brother family.. total 10) stayed at Conrad Macau for  days. we (specially my parents) were so happy to stay at Conrad. I know there are more new hotels nearby Conrad. But Conrad is worthy to stay. Conrad people shows very gentle and warm attitude to my old parents and took care of them very well. I specially thank you Mr. Achin. He is so good man and considers us like friend's family. All facilities was well arranged and clean. I hope to stay Conrad macau again sooner or later.",50
"Macau offers so many new, excellent hotels that difficult to understand some reviews here. I think US guests have low standards. Old fashioned room , bit smelly, with not comfortable bed at all. This hotel needs a serious renovation. However it was clean that cant complain. Orbit restaurant for breakfast suggest to come early to avoidt people push you out at the buffet. Service staff was good and friendly which was positive surprise for this kind of environment. Also nice and attentive service in the ground floor bar . Iam also wondering why there is an ashtray in non smoking room :-)) and why no cream for a coffee. Just a small box of milk in minibar ? ",30
"Beauty beyond picturesque of Macao. This hotel excels being hospitable from their concierge, reception and gym staff who are all very helpful and friendly. The receptionist even took an extra mile to advise the places of interest to visit and how to get there. Rooms are big, clean and luxurious! Definitely would come and book again in this hotel. Big thanks to JC, Shirley and Steve!",50
"The Conrad Macao on the Cotai Strip is amazing. We stayed 1 night here in 2015 and we loved the room. We booked a Junior Suite that has 2 double beds and a sofa bed which can sleep 2 people each. The room was spacious, clean, modern, and luxurious! The hotel grounds were also amazing as they have a very large shopping centre at Sands Cotai Central with plenty of food options. Also, Sands Cotai Central is connected to Venetian via an enclosed skybridge which links you to even more shopping! I totally recommend this hotel and I hope to stay here again when I come to Macau!",50
"On this trip, my wife and I stayed in five Hilton properties, three of which were Conrad's.  Conrad Macao Cotai Central was by far the best experience.  Emman not only checked us in, but he escorted us to our room, showed us all of the amenities, set up the WIFI hotspot that we could use while in Macao, and made a dinner reservation for us at Antonio's (We highly recommend this restaurant).  The staff in the executive lounge always made us feel welcome and were very attentive.  The rooms are modern, spacious, and they have a menu for pillows ranging from soft to firm.  You can travel to The Venetian and The Parisian without having to go outside.  If you plan on visiting Macao, be sure to stay at Conrad Macao Cotai Central.",50
"Reserved two rooms for our family of 5 (all adults) for one night.  One of the room got upgraded as a gold status member to a 1 bedroom suite.  Both rooms are on the same room right next to each other (appreciate that arrangement).  We also have access to the executive lounge on the 39th floor.  We had a late morning tea and breakfast up there.  Breakfast is one of the best I've ever had in a hotel or resort.  It's in great quality and service is outstanding.  Anything you need, you just have to say the words.    Shuttle to the pier and the airport is available and very convenient.  I also used their workout facility.  It has a good mix of machines and free weights, smith machine, and cable exercises.  There is a door with an ""EXIT"" sign, and it actually goes to the Holiday…",50
"I just had my 1st stay with the Conrad Maco (Cotai Central) hotel for one night. Besides of its very high rank, the hotel was very closed to the airport and heard that using the hotel shuttle bus is very continent, so this hotel came up in my list.   On arriving the hotel, it was a difficult to locate where the lobby is as the hotel (as well as the other 3 hotels) is integrated into the Cotai Shopping center. However, checking in is smooth as there are many counters to take care of guests, and the staffs are very friendly and kind. The check-in time is 3:30 pm which typical for Macao area, and since it was holiday period so my early check-in request cannot be grated. Although we were invited in wait in the executive lounge and enjoy the afternoon tea, we deposited the luggage…",50
"I'd read about how ""generous"" this hotel is from all these reviews, and they sure live up to that hype during my last stay there.  Definitely exceed my expectation as a diamond member of the Hilton.  Besides the little things (complimentary teddy and duck), the service is excellentiae!!  Special thanks to Isac Pakan (front office) and Sarah (lounge) who showcase their professionalism and customer care above the beyond.  Trust me, you will be impressed and their staff deserve the ratings.  Great job Conrad Macao.  And Thanks again for the great experience!!",50
"這次的澳門之旅是為了慶祝我父母30週年結婚紀念，在出發之前，我Email給Conrad Hotel協助安排好一點的景色。抵達後，從外面的Doorman開始，每個人的服務都非常到位，態度都非常親切，臉上也會保持笑容。 尤其我需要稱讚當天幫我們C/I的Receptionist-Anki，She is very professional,而且態度非常的好，對於澳門當地旅遊問題，都能馬上給予幫助，且在辦理C/I的過程中，不時的會與我們聊天，詢問我們的行程，也主動問我們最後一天回去的班機是幾點，讓我們能LCO。 房間的部分，我只能說，打開房門時真的很驚訝，在我爸媽的床上特別佈置，灑上玫瑰花瓣並擺上Conrad的Pink Bear搭配上氣球，而且也真的幫我們安排景色很棒的房間，可以從房間看到巴黎人酒店的，晚上非常的漂亮，另外還特別贈送蛋糕慶祝，蛋糕我爸媽很喜歡!  總體來說，這次的住宿非常的棒，幫我們的澳門之旅增色不少，下次有機會一定會再入住!",50
"The service of the hotel is the best that I have even had among my trips to Macau. I am very impressed for the efforts and courtesy of the front desk staffs. Even though I visited the hotel during Xmas time, it is amazing that they could maintain such a high quality of service. However, I felt a bit disappointed on the room condition. Even thought I stayed at the non-smoking room, there was a strong cigarette smell throughout the whole trip.",40
"This review is a couple of months late but I just wanted to post something on TripAdvisor about the amazing experience we had at the Conrad hotel in Macau recently.  My wife and I were celebrating our anniversary so I decided to surprise her with a short trip to Macau. In the past, I’ve contacted hotels before about surprise room decorations and/or complimentary desserts for birthdays so I assumed Conrad would help me in planning something out.  Boy did they go above and beyond all expectations.   On arrival to the impressive hotel, we were greeted by the awesome front desk staff and Ea Enriquez - quite possibly the nicest hotel manager I’ve ever come across.   Ea personally escorted us to our room after check in and chatted us up along the way.  But as soon as we walked into…",50
"We stayed at the hotel for 4 nights and were very impressed from check in to check out. We stayed at a suite - and it was very spacious, well designed and technologically savvy. The breakfast at both the Club Lounge and restaurant were great, with  lot of choices. Concierge services are great. We dined at the Dynasty 88 restaurant - and loved the service. Some of the team members who made our stay much more memorable and enriching were Emanuel from Front Office, Achin And Tyra at Executive Lounge and Jency.",50
"I can't say enough good things about this hotel.  Great experience from arrival to departure.  When you arrive at the ferry terminal, there is a hotel shuttle that can take you to the hotel.  We end up taking another shuttle but still made it.  The front desk was very friendly. We got upgraded to a suite.  The room was huge with 2 bathrooms.  Probably the size of 4 regular hotel rooms.  Room was clean and nicely decorated.   The hotel is connected with several other hotels with shops in between.   There is a free shuttle back to the ferry.   Concierge was super helpful.  I will definitely come back again.  ",50
Provided free usage of phone with internet connection during stay! Easy access to nearby amenities. The staff bring us to our rooms after checking in and provided very detailed explanations of all the facilities. Very impressed with the good services!,50
"I booked room under my friends name , 2 times stay at Conrad Macau  Arrival experiences was good , hotel has enough staff in the main entrance , lobby and reception ...majority of staff very attention to guest .  Lobby ambience and atmosphere very boring and no sense of luxury   Hotel building integrated with shopping mall and casino , my personal experiences about the hotel complex is boring and not suitable for young people ... good for family or old people.   Room feature , first visit ""Evian"" water provided in all deluxe room , 2nd visit no longer evian water in all  room.   every room has teddy bear and in the bath tub has a duck toys which is good and I like it .   Lobby lounge located in the middle of high traffic area where many people passing around in this building…",30
"It was my first trip to Macao and it was also my first solo trip. I wasn’t familiar with the place and was a little apprehensive. However the Conrad staff made me feel very welcomed and I definitely did not regret my decision to stay there despite the higher prices. The staff in the executive lounge are fantastic. They bother to come up and chat with me even though I do not warm up to people easily. They have lots of suggestions and would help me to find out more information about the places I was visiting.  They also paid special attention to my likes. After having my breakfast there on Day 1, the staff could remember what I want and asked if I would like to have warm milk and room temperature water the next day. I was totally impressed.  As a gold member, I was also given an…",50
This was my 2nd stay in Conrad Macao and i felt very special by the staff specially club lounge and Front office team as the majority recognized me . Very special thanks to club lounge team Tyara and Andy for smooth Check in and Upgrade .,50
"I have spent the weekend with my family at Conrad, this is the first time we stayed at this hotel at Macau. The hotel is new and nicely maintained and the room is spacious.  There are lots of facilities at the hotel such as restaurants, swimming pools and gym. We all enjoyed our stay at Conrad.",50
"I used to live in Macau and have visited regularly over the years, however, this was my first stay at the Conrad.  I was checked in by Fiona, whom was really friendly and efficient.  She escorted me to the elevator and offered to escort me to the room, but I declined.  Then upon arrival, she called to ensure that everything was to my liking and if there were any problems - of which there were not.  The Junior Suite was tastefully decorated, with a wonderful view of the newish Parisian; a really beautiful sight.  The room was very spacious and in good condition.  The only slight negative is that I was disappointed with the shower; the shower head was not easily movable but did offer good pressure.  The air conditioning, lights, TV and mini bar were all easy to use.  Otherwise…",50
Just the word fabulous from top to bottom ...  Rooms are royal like a prince stay..  Tv has pay per view which is a class act so there’s never boredom  It’s right opposite the biggest casino hotel in the world the Venetian  It is connected by a tube so like no issues of walking on the road in the night even which is supposedly not an issue in Macau considering cops patrolling always but anyway  Staff is friendly helpful and over cautious to your needs so as to not spoil the Hilton brand name in Macau which is highly appreciated.  Aaaaaamazing is the only word  P.s: For a Macau it’s pocket friendly 😉  ,50
Loved the hotel. Great location and great services from the team. Room is super spacious. Connivence as taxi are readily available at all time while there are shuttles available to different places of interest.  Definitely my hotel of choice in Macau ,50
"I stayed 1 night to celebrate the wedding anniversary with my family. Room is spacious, clean and tidy and glad the check-out time can be extended. Front-desk staffs are kind and initiative. The only improvement is the bathroom's fixed shower is so inconvenient, it would be better if change to handheld shower.",50
"There was shuttle bus service from Taipa Ferry Terminal but was a little confusing as we had a bit of difficulty looking for the shuttle bus to Conrad Macao - be sure to look out for the ""Sands Cotai Central"" shuttle bus! Check-in was swift and the staff was very attentive to our needs, and provided detailed explanation such as breakfast venue, wifi, etc. We got a room with a great view facing the Parisian with the Eiffel Tower in sight. Room was very very large and the bathroom was big as well which really impressed us! We loved the amenities as well - the signature Conrad bear and the rubber duckie! Even though it was just one night, was a very comfortable stay and the service truly demonstrated Conrad's luxury service. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone heading to…",50
"We have stayed at the Conrad in Cotai a couple of times and it never disappoints, whether the service by the staff or cleanliness and quality of stay. Only this time we realised they need to refurbish the mattresses after some time! Otherwise very good hotel with great service and good location.",40
"Overall more information with the facilities would have been helpful at the hotel, or website.  Free shuttle is available but not advertised. I had breakfast booked but had to ask where it was available.  As with the pool and gym.  But these were the only negative parts of my stay.  Everything else was excellent.  Personal escort to room by Louis was a nice touch. He was very helpful  Also I extended my stay for one more night, but downsized as I did not need the space of a junior suite, so when i booked through the conrad/hilton website, I paid less and the reservation guys or front desk kept me in the Same room! I packed to check out for nothing but it was not a problem as the junior suite is huge.  Thank you for a brilliant stay. My friends and family are jealous of the room…",40
"The Conrad Macau has wowed us in many ways possible during our short stay with them during our Asia Trip. The arrival experience cannot be any better, we were checked-in by Ivan at the executive floor and has been the most professional executive lounge employee we have come across with. He made his interaction very personal and was very helpful.   The suite was spectacular! We were pampered in every way possible. The entire experience was very detailed and personalized, the standard of service was excellent and it created a lasting impression on us and will be treasured. By far one of our best hotel stays despite having travelled so much over the past 3 years and stayed in different hotels. The amenities were luxurious, from the bathrobe, slippers, toiletries and tea/coffee…",50
"I visited Conrad Macao to celebrate my wedding aniversay with my family.  As a diamond member of Hilton honors, I fully satified with everything from Conrad Macao, such as room condition, service, foods, location, etc. Especially, the service in the Conrad club lounge is really awesome, so that I am strongly convinced to recommend to the others who are considering to stay Conrad Macao.  If possible to reach Renee or Frand working in club lounge, they would be a good liason for you to enjoy the service.",50
"This is by far the best hotel we have stayed. Just a week before we depart Mr Edmund sent us a note to check if we need anything during our 1 night stay. We have tried Venetian and Galaxy, none does anything like this. Before we step into the hotel, the staff sincerely showed us the way in. During our check-in, we were greeted by polite reception. We could see the great CONRAD SERVICE CULTURE! Great job! The room is clean except we found strands of hair in the bathtub. Bed is super comfortable. We will be back!! ",50
" Stayed one night last weekend and from check in, Diego (front desk) gave me a very warm welcome back to the property. He escorted me to the lounge as my room want ready thank you Diego!  My experience from the lounge was awesome! Tyra, Achin, Ivan, Michael (chef) and the rest of the lounge team was so attentive.The food and service was simply amazing thank you again.   The room (3511) was spacious and I love the view!  Also to Stephen Feng many thanks for the email explaining everything I need.",50
"Very good staff in lobby, room very large, very good housekeeping with good english. There is a parade for kids at 4 pm. the breakfast very large quantities and so many variation, but the taste just enough/no good but no bad.  And just one more, i have looked many pics before booking this hotel and i saw shower that can move, but actually our room not get it.why we are looking for shower that can move?because we do not use toilet paper,we need water for clean  after use the toilet.",40
The hotel is near Macau International Airport. They provide free shuttle bus. They also have mall so we can shop and eat easily. The room is very good. They gave me a room with Parisian macau view. The night view is very nice.,40
"Loved the experience with Conrad Cotai. Most staff are extremely helpful, with the exception on express checkout lady, who stood next to elevator, doesnt seemed interested to answer question (maybe she has been standing there too long, maybe let her sit on a portable chair?). Staff in executive lounge are really the highlight in my stay. Wonderful and extremely eager to offer help.I wish I could use 11 points instead of 10 for executive lounge staff. Breakfast was wonderful, small selection, but we all loved it, tasted really good! I would pay for the breakfast. Definitely top 3 for all my conrad experience around the world. Recived prearrival message which is nice. Noted our anniversary weekend, gave us a cute dessert, really appriciate it. Asked about when I will arrive etc..…",50
"One of the nicest luxury hotel in Macao. Suite is huge with nice amenities. Great service. Hotel in very good condition. Plenty of restos downstairs. Complimentary shuttles to airport, ferry terminal and downtown Macao. ",50
"Have to say, when we visit Macau again, we will stay at the Conrad Macao Cotai Central, AGAIN. We normally stay in and love boutique Hotels, small independent run Hotels, because of the awesome service they offer, and simply because there unique and have a character of all there own. So when we planned a 4 day visit to Macau, just to check out the diversity and cultural history of Macau, we took a chance and booked the Conrad Hotel / Casino, in the Cotai Strip in Taipa Macau. We were simply blown away, after arriving from the Turbojet ferry and and free bus ride to the Conrad Hotel, we were treated like royalty, Check-in was very nice and pleasurable. Ea Enriquez  was such a pleasure, meeting her and working with her, in our check-in and the belated birthday gift of the Conrad…",50
"I’ve stayed here well over a dozen times and as a HH Diamond member am well recognised by the Executive Club team.   As a Diamond am always upgraded to a suite which are large, well appointed and comfortable. The gym is in great condition with a very large range of machines.   The breakfast at the executive lounge has a good variety with eggs and noodles cooked to order. The only criticism I would offer is to consider varying the menu for the evening cocktails - it’s literally been exactly the same for the past year.   Overall though a very solid property with a great team. ",50
"I have just finished my survey the hotel and as a silver HH member, I am just mad. This was our second stay and to be honest it will be our last in Macau. Points are you know what. The toilet clogged, we were not treated as members, the floors and carpets are awful and the worst...what is with the water situation? Like two small bottles for each person? I had to go the gym to get more water because there is no 7-11 to get anything because that is what the casinos have done in order for you to pay top dollar. Totaly unacceptable. I LOVE the Hilton and Conrad hotels but I am not staying here again.",20
"The room is good, checking-in a bit slow. Luxury than the Sheraton Macau. The room is nicer than Sheraton a lot. They providing lounge service for Diamond HHonors members, the lounge services, breakfast, and cocktail, the food they providing is good. Staffs are nice.",40
It was nice to get away from hot Singapore.  Macao temperatures of 15-20 degrees C is nice.  Cotai Central is decorated with Christmas lights.  The hotel airport shuttle coach stand was easy to find.  It stops right in front of the hotel.  The check in receptionist was friendly and helpful.  I booked a room with king sized bed which had all the necessary amenities - even iPhone cable and a handy phone.  Apart from airport the hotel provides complimentary shuttle to the Maritime Ferry terminal if you have a ferry ticket to Hong Kong.  Thank you Conrad Macao for making my stay in Macao so enjoyable! ,50
I enjoyed my stay here. Very good property and well spoken staff. They know customer service well. Indian food was very poor except that I recommend this place as it's not much crowded as well. From Macau Tapia Terminal it was bit difficult to find the right bus as compared to other hotel buses which had a person standing at the right spot to guide their guests but none from Cotai Central(this is the bus to ask for) who server 3-4 properties.,40
"If you want a luxury hotel with all the amenities in the heart of the Cotai Strip in Macau, Conrad it the place to stay.  Great location, friendly courteous staff, and reasonable rates.  Plus, you have room to enjoy yourself, unlike the Venetian across the street, which was wall-to-wall people.",50
"I have wonderful stay with Conrad Macao from their per-stay service till check out, their friendly and caring responses are really help and made my day in Macao although it was a rainy day. The caring turndown services also very surprised.",50
"The best hotel under Sands Cotai group. It's within the same complex as the Sheraton, Holiday Inn and Regis. The rooms are luxurious compared to the others with a lounge area with beautiful sofa and a Nespresso machine for your convenience. Complimentary capsules and milk is provided. The advantage is no queues on check in/out or valet service for baggage storage. Restaurants within the complex are numerous; from fast food , Italian, to buffets/a-la-carte. The service is really superb at the Conrad.",50
Impeccable staff!  Specially thank you Charlie from Front Desk are professional and friendly! and Frand from Lounge also providing first-class service!  They are beyond the level that i have experienced before.  I am so satisfied with 2 night stay! ,50

"Probably the best hotel in Macau.  Most expensive one, too.   Very friendly and dedicated, smart staff.  How much more can you ask from a hotel staff?  The guests looks very descent compared to other hotel.  I wouldn't go anywhere else in Macau.",50
"Amazing amazing service that blew me away! Checking in was a breeze with Fiona. She also gave my 1.5yo a little welcome gift bag which has Color pencils and paper!  Later on a staff brought baby toiletries, bathtub and another gift box filled with things for my little one.  For dinner we ask for recommendations at the concierge and Trista and Bency helped us book a place at Zi Yat Heen which was yummy and not too expensive. They showed us how to get there too (very simple to follow instructions and map given). When we are heading out to Explore, Herbert gave us guidance and recommendation for breakfast options.  Lastly at checkout, Sammy help us booked tickets to the ferry back to HK.  Wish I book more days in Macau to stay in Conrad!! Highly recommend and will come back for…",50
"This was one of best Conrads I have stayed in. As a Diamond member We were treated like royalty. Stella, guest relations, went out her way to make our stay memorable and Ivan made sure our needs were met. It was because their genuine sincere attitude, we wiill definitely return.",50
"Spent a one night stay in a one bed suite (upgraded as Diamond) , Lounge , service and sleep quality all fantastic.   Cant comment about restaurants as only a short stay and with lounge access you do not need breakfast.",50
"Only a word ""excellence"" what i think about Conrad.. From the time we arrived in the hotel, check in, the concierge guide me to my room.. their services, The room, everything is awesome.. 10/10 definitely the best hotel in Macau.. All my thanks to indonesian staff in conrad for giving me greatest stay experience in my life..",50
"Zillion thanks for the special arrangement for my birthday by Guest Relations Team, I did have a memorable one.  Besides, the Concierge always shows helpfulness and fulfil our requests, so that we could always enjoy our stays every time. ",50
"This is amazing hotel in a great location. The staff are very helpful and they speak English. We booked online directly with the  hotel and we got a great room overlooking the pool and  Macau's city  lights. Also we had a great view of the copy of the Elfel tower which lights up at night like the real one. The room is huge with great decor and furnishings,  amazing bathroom and very comfortable bed and linen.  Thank you to all the staff for making our stay so special, particularly Yumi. Highly recommended Great value for money.  Andrew and Liz Burt ",50
"I love all the Conrad hotels especially in Asia.  The hotel in Macao is great, from service to rooms and more.  Some real minor issues like internet was bad, but the handy phone they provided made that a non issue, but still had to log on through the phone. Very minor issue. Staff is excellent and service is great.  Can not wait to go back again.  Convienent location from Taipa Ferry Terminal and location is across the street from the Venetian.  Room service is available 24/7 and is a plus because there are no other free standing restaurants in the area, only at the casinos.  Seriously can not wait to go back soon.",50
"It is difficult not to go over the top in Macau. It is a place of excess. A Las Vegas clone that surpassed its original. It must be hard to manage an understated (in Macau standards), tasteful and relatively quiet and dignified atmosphere next to the monstrosity of The Venetian and the audacity of The Parisian - together with the faux-Eiffel if you may. Conrad manages to be that. The scene was set with the meet-and-greet of a young Portuguese named Diogo (I didn't misspell that - Diego is the Spanish version) a young man of immaculate grooming and manners who channeled the Maitre D's of the '60s Paris and London (showing my age, aren't I?). A first rate 'mein host' of the Cesar Ritz breed. If Conrad management is reading this, please note that I have a combined 42 years of…",50
"We took a ferry from Hong Kong (Cotaijet) which was fast and efficient and takes you to the Taipa terminal) and on arrival there are many buses you can take to your hotel. The Conrad is part of the Sands estate in Cotai, so on we got a bus and it was the first stop; easy. Check in was very efficient and quick, we managed to get 2 rooms earlier than expected. Reception staff were all very pleasant and professional.  The rooms felt a little tired, but ours was so large that bit was forgotten! We got a bear and a duck from the room which are lovely souvenirs.  Only downside is the breakfast queue: they share the breakfast with Holiday Inn and the queue gets very long with everyone wanting a table.  ",40
"Super nice and helpful staff especially Ms Jasmine XU helped preparing my proposal to my fiancée! The room was spacious, clean and with nice view! The hotel is well connected with other hotels and restaurants. We enjoyed the stay so much! ",50
"Located within walking distance to all the major attraction in Cotai Strip but away from the crowd, the personalised service started off immediately upon checking in. I was a little early for the check in time so the room was not quite ready yet, so I was told that I will be contacted my phone once the room is ready. The check in staff personally walked me towards the direction of the hotel restaurant where I was planning to have my lunch. Not long after I sat down, to my pleasant surprise, the same staff came all the way to my seat to personally give me the room access card! The hotel room was tastefully designed and decorated with oriental decor. The room was quiet and an absolute pleasure to stay, whether it was watching the TV, taking a dip in the large sized bathtub and…",50
"We had an excellent stay here , comfortable and clean , just like home, nice location to get to any place ! The front office staff Charlie is great ,check in was quite easy , the excitement , she has a good attitude to help us and answered all of our questions ! My schoolmate is first time stay at Corad , Charlie offer a lots informations for him , such as how to use wifi ，out phone , room facility ,shuttle services , Macao city tour , foods and so on ~ Thank you again ! I'll choose next time !",50
"In all our years of travelling and international hotel stays the Conrad Macao ranks right up at the top and we have been left with some very special memories to take home.  We was celebrating our 22nd wedding anniversary and were left speechless at the kind gestures that were extended to us.  Every member of staff went out of their way to help us.  I could list so many names of the staff who went above and beyond but must say a special thank you to Yumi and Diana from guest relations who were exceptional and worked with so much energy and enthusism to provide a flawless stay, they really did take things to another level.  I cannot rate the hotel highly enough and if you are unsure of where to stay in Macao I recommend you give the Conrad a try you will not regret it.",50
"I had a King Deluxe Suite and it was very spacious and comfortable. However, the hotel is showing its age but the location and how it connects with Four Seasons, Parisian, Venetian was excellent. Many restaurants and food courts so you really don't need to go far to eat.",40
"The location was good.  Lots of shopping and eateries close by.  Close to the casinos but not directly linked.  The room was very comfortable and spacious.  Staff were lovely.  The high tea in the lobby lounge was good and definitely worth a try.  The breakfast at the Grand Orbit was disappointing - the choice offered was good but the wide choice meant that food stayed for a long time in the serving dishes and was therefore a little cold and stale.  But apart from that, it definitely was a great place to stay.",40
"I usually spend a night at a macao hotel on my birthday. All these years, none of the hotel would consider the day they check-in as a special day of their guest, except this time. It was a big surprise that the hotel gave me a birthday cake and a small present. Will definitely back",50
"We stayed at this lovely hotel for 3o nights & enjoyed the elegance of this lovely hotel. The staff were always so helpful, the room sizes are amazing & loved the luxurious bathroom. Was easy to walk between the hotels & visit all of the casinos and shopping.",50
"Conrad Cotai is located within the Cotai casino region, and it's easy to access and walk around from hotels to hotels. Staff are pro! Very helpful in explaining nearby attractions with a personal touch. Room is big, especially restroom is good. I would recommend this hotel and revisit again.",50
Guest Relations Supervisor Ea Enriqueza was very responsive when I emailed her before our stay. She arranged a complimentary cake to be delivered to our room at designated time for my husband's birthday. Spacious and clean room. Staff at the hotel are polite and helpful. -Wong,50
"From free airport shuttle service to check-in to a personal guided walk-through of a fabulous suite upgrade by Jasmine, our overnight stay at the Conrad Cotai Central Hotel in Macau was outstanding.  The only negative was that we only had one short night to experience the Conrad's definite 5-star accommodations and facilities. We did, however, definitely get a good night's sleep in-between two travel days in the comfy bed!",50
"Although the hotel opened for a long time, but the maintenance is pretty good, the service as always good, just want to experience the 25 sets, finally only given 26 sets, multiple video room, less toilet, also worth recommending!",40
"We got a very nice suite. Everything was provided. Very comfortable bed. Turn down service was provided. Good TV channels. Great wifi. Very clean. Would be nice if there was a TV in the bathroom so can watch while soaking in the tub. Free shuttle bus provided is very efficient and regular to Taipa Ferry Terminal, airport and to Sands Macao Hotel. Location of hotel is fantastic.",50
"Specially thanks to Ea, who arranged sweet gifts, decoration and a delicious cheese cakes to my parents for their wedding anniversary! they both are very touched! Room clean service is perfect, and we love the taste of the hotel with elegance and comfiness, definitely will visit Conrad again next time!",50
"It was short visit to Macau to attend conference and hotel was selected by conference organizer... Great location of the hotel in short distance to the airport or harbor with ferries to Hong-Kong, supper spacious lobby, very attentive front desk personnel... and than starts challenge of how carefully you are following signs within the hotel... way from reception to lifts was a first challenge. Room on 35th floor was spacious and with the view to some city highlights or just another hotel windows... very spacious room, with great sleep quality! Rooms was also very tidy and clean!!  Another challenge was to find the restaurant for the breakfast - you need to go through the shopping center and than voila - very diverse offer of different breakfast meals - Asian, Indian, European or…",50
"I have approached Ms. Ea Enriquez from Guest Relations via email before my arrival. Everything was arranged great. As a diamond member, my room was upgraded to Room 26. The room is more than enough for just two of us.",50
"Had booked Queen bed deluxe suite.. Fantastic room, great service and central location of the hotel made it a very memorable stay...overall amenities in the hotel were also great.. Definitely recommended",50
"On the second day of my stay typhoon arrived, it was not possible to go out as it was raining heavily and the public transport did not function. Nevertheless, a letter was posted to my room with all the necessary information, so I knew what to expect. The rooms were big, nice and comfortable. WIFI was a bit slow. Breakfast was good but nothing remarkable. Spa was good and I would recommend it.",50
The most comfortable hotel among the three hotels in Sands Cotai. Rooms are spacious with high range facilities. Really feel comfortable and relaxing in staying in the hotel.Staff are polite and well trained.,50
"Starting from checkin at the counter , we felted willingly welcomed by this hotel. Unlike the overwhelmed checkin counter at Sheraton, the environment and service here is just wonderful. The turndown gift Conrad bear is so cute and they even have welcome candy for us. The club lounge is also very nice. I don't think this hotel consider cost : ) the food and wine they provided all in high quality. Overall, we are amazed by the entire experience there. And as a luxury five star hotel, it's only a few hundred Hong Kong dollar more. Very good deal!",50
"I stayed in this hotel only for one night and I have to say that it was an amazing hotel, from the front desk check in process to the free upgrade to the suite due to Hilton Honers Gold member. I loved it, the lounge for breakfast was great especially the lady who worked there I forgot her name but she was working on the morning of september 26th. She was very polite and extremely nice.  I highly recommend this hotel and next time will stay here rather than Wynn palace.",50
"Me and my wife book this hotel to celebrate our 10th anniversary in August. We wanted a special place, and after taking into consideration the reviews and some friends recommendations we decided to book in Conrad Cotai. As soon as we arrived we were greeted by a front desk staff, called Diogo, who explained us everything, showed us the room and made us feel really welcomed. I also asked to talk with a Concierge, Stephen, who took our reservation and whom I secretly asked, before, to prepare some special thing in our room to surprise my wife. And he really exceed our expectations! The room was wonderful, with a view over the Cotai Strip, and with a beautiful surprise setting on top of our bed! Besides that, he also surprised us with a cake and sparkling wine for the…",50
"My friends and I have stayed at this hotel several times and everytime we have stayed it has only gotten better!  As a Hilton Honor Member I often get upgraded to an amazing suite! The hotel is fantastic and the location is brilliant. But what makes it amazing is the team.  A huge shout out to the team on executive floor! Trya, Renee and Ivan are  amazing! they are always so friendly and helpful with everything! they treat us like friends, Remembering our names means everything. On the restaurant side Archin and his team are superb! they remember what we like everytime!  Coming back to this hotel is like coming to a haven! The hotel is great but the team members there are Amazing !",50
Awesome experience! The Conrad Macao exceeded my expectations. Breakfast was amazing as well as the gym and gym facilities. The room was incredible and the service just as good! One of the best Conrad hotels that I have ever stayed!,50
"I stayed at the hotel along with my son and his family.  They were very inviting, the service was great, the rooms were really large, and the rooms and common areas were clean and well kept.  They really went above and beyond by surprising my son with a birthday cake when he returned to his room one evening.  They must have noted his birthday when they saw his passport and went out of their way to help us celebrate.  It was a nice touch and made me like the hotel just a little more.  It's a great place for adults and kids too since the casinos are totally separate from the hotel spaces.  I will definitely stay there again if I go back to Macau.",50
"We stayed at this hotel in mid September for a couple of nights and arrived with the airport shuttle. From the drop-off spot it was quite difficult to localize the hotel as many hotels are connected in the Sands group.  We were given a high floor room and got access to the Club Lounge as Hhonor Goldmembers. The room is very large and have a nice bed that guaranteed a good nights sleep.  We tried the hotel SPA/Sauna that came with a jacuzzi, dry sauna and turkish sauna. Very friendly staff that remembered our names at the second visit! They showed us around at out first visit there which felt very welcoming.  If you are Hhonor gold/diamond-member you get access to the Club Lounge that is simply amazing! The afternoon tea was impressing with nice minisandwiches and scones and…",50
"I had made several stays with this hotel when I came to Macau these years, the staff of this hotel could provide high quality of service, generosity and attention to details.   Highly recommended to everyone who wants to visit Macau.",50
"We were spoilt by the luxury hotel suite. It was at least 60sqm with separate living and bedroom. Amenities everywhere from Nespresso Machine to mobile phone, welcome fruit, sweets and cute little Teddy Baer on the bed. The bathroom was massive with luxury towels. Only criticism I have is that the shower has no hand shower in the cubicle. Otherwise it was perfect with super comfortable bed.",50
"After the near perfect stay at Grand Sheraton Macau Hotel, we moved to Conrad Cotai Central which was at the next tower.  Our opinion was that Conrad provided us with even better overall experiences with better personalised service and attention, mainly because it had less rooms as compared to Sheraton which meant for mass market. Our stay at Conrad was so enjoyable and we did not leave the hotel at all for our short 2-nights stay. We enjoyed our stay in the Suite room and Club Lounge, Spa and Health Center. We considered it was a perfect value-for-money stay.",50
Excellent facilities and service. Great location and very easy access to every where. Always enjoy visiting Macau and staying at the Conrad. Definitely recommend Conrad to all of my friends around the world. ,50
"Excellent staff and service. Free shuttle bus to pier and to other Sands hotels with handy wifi cover. The room was very tidy with lovely welcome gifts. My wife and i enjoyed the day in Macau. Definitely, i will stay again if i travel next time.",50
"The very best in all aspects, from hotel facilities to everyone on the staff.  I always look forward to my stays here and thoroughly enjoy all of the luxury.  The staff is the very best I have met anywhere and the facilities are superb.   ",50
There are full of hotels in Macau. But You won't be disappointed with this Conrad hotel If you choose it.  convenient located hotel and wonderful staffs are awaiting. I hope I could visit the Conrad again soon. ,50
"Its the Conrad what you expect is what you get . the hotel is not as expensive as other world wide locations so a suite was a treat .  Size was the biggest I have ever had the decor and the room was 5 star plus the room was lounge separate bed room Bathroom Oh La La it was huge the bath was small pool exaggerated but it had TV and my wife used it the shower was probably half sixe of a hotel bathroom , then a separate toilet off lounge , coffee machine N espresso and fridge . as hotels go it was probably close to best you can get ,  Macau is fantasy land its like Disney land theme park in Cotai area its situated in megga complex with shops like Channel Rolex and every brand you desire but lower branded as well it as food courts on top floor even Mac Donalds but it as loads…",50
Though initially confusing you soon get used to the sprawling Conrad. The rooms are defenitely larger than your average hotel room and very comfortable.   The shops are part of the hotel and there are walkways to the Venetian and Parisian which make this very convenient.   The staff are really friendly and helpful. In particular the concierge. Everyone we spoke to was knowledgeable and willing to go out of their way to help.   The orbit has a fantastic buffet. ,40
"From arrival to departure, the staff smiled and were happy to assist in any request. Rooms are large with comfortable bed and great bathroom. Elevators are fast and quiet....with security monitoring all guests on main entry level floor...and direct access to ""850 Shops""...and casinos...all indoors which was good as outdoor air quality was ""dangerous"".",50
"Beautiful, quiet and very spacious room. Comfortable beds, Polite and helpful staff. Elegantly furnished. Free fast wifi. Lots of wardrobe space, super-comfy slouchy robes and luxurious toiletries (Shanghai Tang). Several charging points which are so important when travelling. Nespresso coffee maker with complimentary pods, plus kettle. Large bathroom with double sink, big bathtub and walk in shower. Complimentary duck and sweets a nice touch. So cute to find the teddy bear at turn down too!",50
這次是透過第三方預訂入住。Check-in的時候還是有識別到本人Hilton Honors的金卡會員，被帶到行政酒廊進行Check-in，十分厚道的將本人的房間由King Deluxe（52 sq.m.）升級到King Deluxe-City View Suite（104 sq.m.)，當然亦可享用行政酒廊的福利:D  Conrad本身作為Hilton最高級別的酒店，各項設備、用品均是豪華級別，例如用品是Aromatherapy Associates，源自1985年，是英國皇家經典芳療品牌。Conrad本身的禮物 小熊及洗澡鴨子當然亦可作為紀念品。房間內有可在澳門上網及打電話的手機，對旅客來說十分方便。行政酒廊可享用Happy Hour、下午茶及早餐。Happy Hour亦有Cocktail Menu選擇及部分小食，送酒一流:P早餐較為簡單，亦有各類蛋料理及面選擇。,50
"We had problems with noisy maintenance and lack of sleeping time made us exhausted. Almost a real ""five star"" hotel. But compared with Conrad in United States this is a ""six star"". hotel :)  I am very spoiled and have an eye for details so I see absolutely every single detail that can be better. Så I think everyone who stays here will be very satisfied. And are you like me, I think Four Seasons can be better. But Conrad i still good.   ",40
"I have stayed in Conrad for 2 nights. Compare to The Venetian hotel I visited last time, this hotel is much quiet and neat.The gym and sauna area is comfort.  I would highly recommend this hotel in Macau.",50
"Very good service all round. Shuttle bus to the Taipa ferry terminal is at the main entrance. This is separate from the other shuttle buses, which is further away. The Hong Kong airport Skypier to Macau ferry service desk closes by 21:30. If you miss it, it's a nightmare detour to CENTRAL, Hong Kong island.",50
"Wherein Las Vegas is a city where the hotels operate casinos, Macau is a city where Casinos operate some hotels. Honestly, don't bother going to old-town of Macau, it's the new island development right next to the airport where everything is happening, everything is located. Conrad is AWESOME - comfortable, clean, and very thorough service. The room is tidied twice a day - and for as much traffic that goes through the Conrad, one can't tell that it's ever been occupied. The gritty corners, bumps on the edge of furnishings are all kept up VERY well. Would I stay again? Absolutely.",50
The Hotel deserves a perfect 10/10 for every aspect. Perfect location and connectivity with all the major destinations. Extremely polite and co-operative staff. Infact we had an upgrade for our room as the room we booked wasn't available anymore. The rooms are very spacious. The shopping arcade is attached to the hotel and open quite late. ,50
"We stayed for 2 nights, from the moment we arrived at the counter it was great, the service was outstanding, even the reception lady took us to our room and showed us around. A lovely touch. Room was fantastic with outstanding views. Lovely big bath tub, great touches with complimentary sweets, duck and teddy bear. Room service was more than once per day. The swimming pools were lovely with good service. Free shuttle bus from hotel to Taipa ferry terminal. Close to City Of Dreams, which is a must to see The House Of The Dancing Water Show. Can't say enough about this place.",50
"A wonderful short stay at the Conrad Macao!  From arrival to departure, was greeted by friendly helpful faces who made my stay very pleasant.  Staff was helpful in providing tips for tours on my visit to Macao.  Check-in was a breeze, and my room (Room 2010) was impeccably clean with strong hot water pressure and a comfortable bed.  Was not able to use the pool due to bad weather, but I was able to use the fitness center - which includes a sauna and hot tub.  I was absolutely stunned on how wonderful this amenity was!  This is a nice way to decompress after a long day, and the unique rain shower really helped me to refresh and revitalize to overcome by jetlag.  Definitely my first choice the next time I am in Macao!",50
"the location was in the center of everything, I guess, very convenient to attractions, breakfast buffet was very nice too, the airport shuttle service was very fast, took 5 minutes to get the hotels. friendly staff!",50
"The room is clean, elegant with a lovely sofa. Checked in the room in late night and found out that the room has a good view of the night scene of Parisian. Unfortunately, I did not have much time to enjoy the service. Still, I enjoy my night in the bathtub with the duck.",50
I stayed here for one night with friends. The service at check in counter and express check out counter was good. They were very patient to explain to us. The house keeping department was also quick in response to our request. The room was big with good view. It is very convenient as it has free shuttle to and from the piers. I would like to stay here again next time.,50
"A nice hotel, great room, good service, but only let down by the breakfast at the Grand Orbit.  Lobby lounge staff deserve a special mention for great service.  The high tea is worth a try.  Overall, the Hotel is very good value for money.  We will be back!",40
"Everything in our stay was perfect! From checkin to checkout, it was flawless! From rooms, ammenities and services, it was all immaculately perfect! Fo staff EA (not sure if I remember it right) made it more memorable by anticipating all our needs and giving us all the things that will be useful during our stay. Kudos to this staff! Really world class service! No wonder  Conrad Macao is number 1. I highly recommend this hotel. You wont regret it. ",50
Staff friendliness is always top notch when I visit. Rooms are always comfortable.  Being an Hhonours member has its privileges and I have found downloading the app gives an option of customizing your stay. It was my first time trying their buffet breakfast and it was excellent.  There was a good variety for all nationalities & the quality is excellent at the Orbit restaurant.  ,50
"The staffs are really nice. I spent a day with my kids there, they have prepared everything the kids needed. The staff also gave us a lot of suggestions on kids' activities. The outdoor swimming pools are good too, we went there in the morning, only a few guests were there, it's just like a private swimming pool.",50
Fantastic place fantastic experience perfect staff every one was so friendly did not want to leave. Food was amazing well priced the hotel itself was gobsmacking would definitely recommend and would love to go back.,50
I chose Conrad after reading the positive reviews on Tripadvisor. This hotel is not a luxury hotel but it is definitely a good for price hotel. Our room was not ready at 3pm and the front desk staff was trying hard to find us another room. She upgraded our room into a bigger suite and provided us a complimentary extra bed. She took us to our room and she was really attentive and kind. (I recall that her name was Jasmine) The swimming pool area was clean and well maintained. Great hotel to stay in Macao!,50
"Excellent service at the Conrad Macau, the moment we arrived from at the hotel. Conceige all the way through to club level. Special compliment to the bell boy, Gary. He was very helpful and patient with all the details.   Perhaps the team at conrad Macau should consider preparing the room eg turning on the lights, Aircon while the guest was checking in. Evening cocktails at club level should be improve with more variety of main course eg noodles, congee  We had 2nights in conrad and moved over to Ritz Carlton for another 2nights. Service in conrad was 4* vs ritz Carlton that was 6* ",40
We were allocated a room on a non smoking floor that smelled of smoke. It took the staff nearly an hour to find us a new room.  Watch out for the charges they levy if you pay by Amex. They are not upfront about these.,20
"I reserved classic room in 2016. Conrad upgrade us to suite without charge. As a wedding ceremony, Conrad gave a cake and fruit. All of us can enjoy lounge. There were a variety of refreshment for us. However, swimming pool was pity small. It is smaller than that in holiday inn. Staff count number of guest when entering the swimming pool. We can enjoy breakfast buffet near lobby. THe view is good. You can use jazzuzi in Room No. 26. Room No. 26 is the largest suite in Conrad @ Macau.",40
"We spent a wonderful time in a huge suit at the 36 floor. The suit is very convenient with everything you can wish, great queen bed, huge bathroom (including bath and shower, different international plugs are already in the whole, super convenient!), big sofa, nice view on Macao... The buffet style breakfast is amazing with anything you want ! People are very friendly.  I just hope the food waste is not too important...",50
all great thanks the lovely team at the reception. Overall is a gorgeous hotel and I wish to go back once again! A la cart restaurants are both great. The location is perfect based on what you need. close by many other place to see and walk around.,50
"FO and Concierge staff warm welcome, as golden number get room upgrade. Breakfast and dinner in lobby bar was great. Executive lounge Frand very friendly and give us good suggstion for stay.My family and me really enjoy stay.Thank you very much.",50
"I have nothing to complain about this hotel. It's just exceeds your expectation. The front office staff Charlie was very helpful and sincere. Their welcome amenity for babies and kids are excellent--including a set of Mustela bathing kit which really surprised me, toothpaste and toothbrush for kids, coloring book and pencils, balloon, kid's slippers). They have both warm and cool swimming pool and provided life jackets for kids. My kids have a great stay there. The room is very spacious and quiet. The only thing I dun like are their pillows which are too soft.",50
"Easily one of the best hotels I have stayed in. A combination of excellent service, hotel quality, and location. They gave me a room with a nice view, overlooking the Eiffel tower in the Parisian. Had a little check-in issue but smoothly resolved in an instant. The level of service is really what makes it stand out. Each staff really go the extra miles to make your stay well and personal by putting high attention to details, such as wrapping my laptop & phone charger cord and remembering your name on your 2nd visit to the gym. In addition to the service, I especially love the room size and amenities. The only downside perhaps would be the pool size, which is small, but it doesn't stop me from choosing Conrad again the next time I visit Macau.  Special mention to Fiona in the…",50
Stay and be pampered at Conrad Hotel Macau... it's relaxing and the Tebby bear and little duck gifts are a special reminder of the wonderful stay. The staff are always so warm and serves with a big smile. Makes ,50
"One of the best hotel stays I have had, even in spite of Typhoon Hato.  Frand and Troy in the executive lounge were incredible in sorting out a new booking for us to stay an extra night in the hotel after the typhoon and getting us ferry tickets.  The hotel itself is very well maintained.  The rooms are generously sized and they have excellent access to the Venetian, Parisian, Sands Cotai and also the City of Dreams across the road.  The lounge was of a high quality and HH members are treated very well here.  Ranks right up there with the Four Seasons and Mandarin Oriental, both in service and room quality.  Would stay again on next trip for sure.",50
"I stay at several different hotels every week for business but my experience at Conrad Macao by far exceeds all other hotel experiences I've had. Excellent care and service!  They find ways to help you before you ask them what you need help with. Charlie was exceptionally helpful. She could have only done check-in at the front desk but offered to explain how to use the handy phone in my room (I didn't even know in my room was this phone I could use to make free phone calls to US and Korea!). While checking the phone, she noticed a problem and immediately fixed the issue by sending a technician over and followed up with a phone call to make sure all is taken care of!  Can't ask for more as there were other details of great experiences at this hotel.  If you like food, their…",50
"Good hotels are worth recommending to friends and relatives. The cost is reasonable, the software services are good as a whole and the hardware facilities are good The only shortcoming to be fastidious is that the swimming pool is more suitable for children, and it is too short for adults. The whole swimming channel is a little too short",40
"This is na outstanding hotel, I stay over 100 nights a year in hotels Andre this is one of the best I've experienced. As a Hilton Diamond I was upgraded to a suite, room was large and very well appointed. Pool deck is fantastic with lots of space and good service. The Club Lounge staff were fantastic, remembered me by name the second day, extremely attentive service and both the breakfast and evening cocktails were of a high quality. Every staff member, everywhere was friendly, approachable and provided great service. It's also the little things that differentiate the hotel - like wrapping your mobile phone charger cord and putting a towel under your toiletries bag when thye clean your room - just a very high level of attention to detail. Highly recommend, this is the best hotel…",50
"This is our second stay in this hotel in Macau and it's getting better.  Big room, cosy bed, great accessibility to the surrounding areas.  Great service from all the friendly Conrad staff.  We had a small baggage issue but it was professionally handled by the team.  ",50
"Conrad Macao is a wonderful hotel amongst the busy and crowded large properties on the cotai strip. The staff is friendly and attentive, the facilities are of high quality and we'll maintained. We had a lovely suite that had everything one could dream of. Very comfortable bed, huge bathroom. The bathrobes are super soft and elegant. Lovely views over the strip and the Parisian hotel. Staff at the pool bring iced water and ice popsicles. We had a wonderful time and I would highly recommend this hotel!!!",50
"This hotel is attached to holiday inn; which is odd since Conrad is suppose to be a 5 star luxury hotel and holiday inn is more a budget friendly selection.  The Conrad offers a free shuttle ride from the ferry port, but only from the ferry port near the hotel. make sure you check with the hotel website to make sure you get on the correct ferry port if you want the  free shuttle ride. We stayed at a queen suite. It was a very large room with a living room and they had notes for our kids welcoming them, which was a nice touch. you can walk from Conrad to the Venetian. the hotel pool is terrible! its 4 VERY small pools next to each other. not sure what the heck they were thinking when they designed it but  it looks like 4 kiddy pools next to each other.",30
I love the view of my room and specifically the coffee machine.  The staffs and facilities of the health club is also good.  I will really stay with conrad again and will highly recommended Conrad to my friends.,50
"As I have been travelled around the world for over 35 years, I stayed at the Hilton hotels most of the time and I'm very satified with there locations, services and facilities. I'll continuously using Hilton as my business address, and my family address as well!",50
"First off, the staff goes above and beyond.  Being a Hilton Gold might help, but I feel the staff really puts an effort. Check in was seamless.  The executive lounge was nice place for a snack. Due to an illness, I was room bound for my first day as well, so I had to test the room service and it met and went beyond my expectations.  Also the rooms are huge.  I was upgraded to a suite that was almost silly for one person.",50
"　ラグジュアリーな宿泊を期待して行って、期待以上のものが得られました。 　部屋のしつらえ、広さ、ベッドルーム、アメニティ、スタッフのサービス、朝食、いずれも過去に宿泊したことのあるホテルで最高峰であり、（Hオナーズのベネフィットを差し引いてもおそらく）コスパを加えると第一位です。 　クラブラウンジアクセスなどを加味するとスイートへの宿泊を強くお勧めします。プラス1万円くらいになると思いますが、ラグジュアリーを期待するならばその価値は確実にあります。 　1泊の短い滞在でしたので、次回はもう少し滞在したいですね。  　Especially, Thank you for Ivan.    His kindly service makes our macau trip happy&delicious memory!",50

"Awesome reception people , huge beautiful looking rooms , heart warming welcome , excellent service , what else to say . They have given there best in each department. Any time Macau again it has to b CONRAD",50
it was a very good experience. Huge rooms and equally huge bathrooms. Very good and humble staff. If you are with a toddler they pay very good attention making the child feel special. View from the room is amazing.,50
"I booked the hotel as it was number 1 in Macao and I have stayed in Conrad hotels before. It is spotless, the staff are brilliant. I asked for advice on getting there before we set off and hotel staff emailed me to say that there is a ferry terminal in Hong Kong airport now, which I knew nothing about - that was really helpful. You get a bright green bus from the ferry terminal in Macao. My son said there was no way that our bags would make it to Macao from Manchester airport  without us seeing them but they were there- we were very impressed. They got your bags off the plane in the airport and put them on the ferry which is really clever. It is the little touches that make it at the hotel, for example when you are by the pool the staff cannot do enough to help you with towels,…",50
attended a Conference at the Conrad Hotel Macau fantastic experience very helpful staff always smiling and happy to cater for your needs Fantastic complex as you have no need to go outside as most of all the hotels are attached via a walk way which is covered so no fear of getting wet the restraunts were amazing expensive but fine quality,50
"It was a nice experience to stay in Conrad. Front desk Mr. Louis is very attentive from the very beginning, even I had difficulties in opening the membership account that was created and suggested by him. The room and the hotel facilities are clean. It is very pleasant to stay in the hotel with their gym and swimming pool facilities too. I would recommend my friends to stay in this hotel too.",50
"We stayed for one night only and it made our time in Macau really special. We arrived and were upgraded to a huge suite and offered late check out by the very helpful and friendly Vincent at the front desk. The suite was one of the biggest we have seen and for the price of around £125 it was a bargain! The bathroom was huge, well decorated and well stocked. The bed extremely comfy as was the sofa in the lounge. Nespresso machine facility in the room always useful. We received a beautiful anniversary cake courtesy of the lovely Vincent again. On leaving the porter carried our two very large suitcases and two holdalls all the way to another lobby to the bus stop, found which bus we needed to take and loaded them into the hold of the bus. He could not have been more helpful if he…",50
"I think highly of the Conrad and Hilton properties in Asia, but the Conrad Macau is amongst the best of these.  The staff are superb.  The anticipate your needs and wants, respond immediately to any query, and simply make your stay more fun.  We were staying there with two small children and they arranged gift bags for the arrival then kept the special focus by delivering two child-sized robes when they heard that we were taking them to the pool.  The staff in the executive lounge took the time to make the kids feel special and meet our extra needs (our son still remembers Sarah.)  To top it all off the rooms are luxurious (we were upgraded from a junior suite to a deluxe suite.)  If you are heading to Macau for any reason, this is definitely the place to stay.",50
"I had the pleasure of staying in this hotel two years ago, completely by chance and was thoroughly impressed. So when I once again had the opportunity of staying in Macao i was naturally drawn to this hotel. My wife son and I stayed in a King premier suite for three nights at the beginning of June. It was the most spectacular hotel stay of our lives. The excellent service for this hotel starts long before you check in. I received a personal email from the concierge three days prior to checking in asking me if there was anything they could do help me on my stay, we were able to sort out transportation issues prior to arrival. The same concierge met me upon ur arrival and made sure we headed in the right direction. Upon check in at the front counter (which is seamless and quick)…",50
"From the front desk service is very fast professional, the staff are very cordial, the hotel pattern warm and comfortable, air conditioning is also very good will not be too cold or overheated. Bed high bed soft pillow, can sleep well every night. Elevator to use the room card, high security, people live more assured. Open bed ceremony often surprises, so that children are also very happy.",50
"Probably the best hotel in Macao.  Clean, efficient.   Attending, professional and hard working staff.  Much better than Sheraton.  Double the price, too.  I like the Executive Lounge very much.  The staff really take care of the guests.",50
"I work in a hotel industry that is why it is hard for staffs to please me much. I did express check out and forgot some things inside the room.Amazing service by Charlie from Front desk. Her smile and excellent service took away my bad mood. The first I entered the reception, she just got my attention since she greeted my so nicely and making sure I am very welcome in the hotel. This kind of service will surely be remembered. Conrad should be proud of having her on the team. Good job! ",50
"I took an extra day on my Hong Kong trip to explore Macau and the Hilton Conrad made it easy. The complimentary cell phone made exploring the city simple and the fabulous staff made sure all my trip logistics were taken care of. I would definitely go back, and make sure you try a couple egg tarts!",50
"This was our first stay at a Conrad and we were delighted. Located in the centre of the Cotai Strip, it is an easy and under cover walk to almost all of the Cotai hotels and malls. Our check in experience set the tone for our stay. After having experienced the crowds and the queues of other Cotai hotels, the Conrad was smooth, personal, courteous and super efficient. Never rushed with attention to detail. Our room was just perfect. Complimentary candy,  satin his and hers slippers and a small Conrad teddy. The cherry on the cake was a tray placed in our room on our second night with a bottle of wine, a slice of delicious cheesecake and a personalized ccard wishing us a happy anniversary which had obviously been noted during the check in banter.  A balanced review is not complete…",50
"We only spent one night at the hotel but really enjoyed our stay. As gold members we were upgraded to a room with a view of the Eiffel Tower. The room was large and nicely decorated.   For Hilton members the executive lounge offers a nice spread for cocktail hour and breakfast.  The staff was friendly and attentive both at reception and in the executive lounge stopping for a chat and offering recommendations.   The pool area was pleasant with cabanas, sun loungers and love seats.  The hotel is connected to both the Parisian and the Venetian making it easy to explore the strip.  Taxi cost about 70HKD to the old town.  We would definitely stay again. ",50
"Our family decided to splurge on the final leg of our summer vacation and booked a suite at this marvelous hotel.  This hotel is counted as one of our top hotel experiences, and the five stars here reflect how satisfied we are.  The staff really showed they care about giving their customers the best experience.  Their attention to details is exceptional.  It was two days before my birthday, and they sent me a cake to celebrate.",50
"The stay at Conrad Macao was a once in lifetime experience. The overall package would be very difficult to surpass. The staff were friendly & accommodating, the suites were incredible. The breakfast/lunches & dinners were amazing plus the extras - cocktail party's, Thriller, Iceworld were all fantastic. The best time, thank you!",50
"stayed there in end of april for my mom's birthday celebration. they offered us a room upgrade to twin beds room and a birthday cake which was arranged in room at 22:00hrs as requested. my mom was real surprised after seeing that and its taste very good! concierge team is professional and rsvn team as well as the GRO team are very good. they replied my email promptly. even ive some issues in room during my stay but hskp did response and fix them in time.   the bathrobes are veryyyyyy comfy. really wanna bring it home. are you guys selling that?   can feel some staffs are new but at least they are patient and willing to assist. there were some ""CONS"" but well nevermind. service provided from most of the staffs coverd them all. you have a great team. keep it up. special thanks to…",50
"The whole experience was way beyond my expectations. It is as amazing destination with the old and the new to explore. Sands Resorts are incredible with the utmost attention to detail. Staff are wonderful, food exquisite and lots of lovely shops to explore and they are not all high end shops which is good for the average traveller.  All the hotels are different price ranges to suit your budget. It has the feel of Vegas without the sleaziness of the strip. Highly recommend.",50
You go to Macau for gambling & we could not do any as the minimum betting was USD500 and just a few tables with USD300. I would not suggest it as a place worth visiting. There is nothing to see when out on streets like Vegas which is full of action.,50
"I've stayed at several Conrads around the world. The quality, care, service, and granular level to details sets them apart.  Our room on the 37th floor looked north with great views of the Eiffel Tower and golf course in the distance.  The quality of furniture was spectacular and the room ambiance was entirely relaxing.  Achin in the Executive Lounge during breakfast was very kind and attentive.  Emily in the lobby bar lounge was friendly and enjoyable to speak to while Xing Xia (sp???) was also extremely friendly.  Nice people!!!    The staff always made us feel appreciated and welcomed.  Thank you!  See you in October 2017. ",50
"It was my first stay at this hotel and I stayed at this hotel for one night only and was very impressed with the look and high level of service of the hotel.  From my feedback in various areas below and even though I enjoyed my first stay, given the large number of choices of nice hotels, I would probably stay at other hotels that offer similar rates but different experience. As expected, this is a highly competitive service industry in Macau.  LOCATION & CHECK-IN: The hotel is very conveniently served by frequent complimentary shuttle buses from the ferry terminal. The transfer takes about 20-30 minutes depending on the traffic and the stops at other hotels along the way.  The hotel is well located within the casinos' area and connected to some of the other large hotels and…",40
"Conrad Macao is the most wonderful hotel experience in the Cotai Central area.. Every single staff member is friendly, caring, and genuinely nice. The cheerful environment, helpful employees, and amazing people help achieve the ideal hotel stay. This exquisite establishment lacks no amenities for people to have an impressive vacation. No words or pictures will ever give this property justice. You really need to see it to experience it. The staff here will do everything human beings can possibly do in order to make your stay a flawless and memorable one. Glorious and grand are the words that popped in my mind when we stepped our feet into the entrance at the hotel.  Yumi and bellhop staff greet customers with a smile when we walk in; she greeted us specifically with her warm…",50
"Highly recommended place with friendly people (Maiko, Anastasiia, Diogo keep up like this!), quick and reckless service, tastiest food. Spray with mint and cucumber at the pool is such a cute curtasy! Big choice of different cusine on breakfast, tasty lobster and steak plate at Lobby Lounge. Good for both business and pleasure:)",50
"We stayed at the Conrad in Macau. The Staff pampered us like VIPs. Food was stunning. The Spa was incredibly good. Concierge advised us the 'House of the dancing water'  show, and it really was worth it !! Our room was perfect, the staff unbelievably warm and efficient. We really could not wish for something more !!! We definitely go back !!",50
"Always a wonderful stay. Service is always perfect . Executive lounge is well staffed and great choices for breakfast , tea service and afternoon drinks. Check in and check out us very fast and efficient. We will come back soon! ",50
"Having completed my 6th Stay at the fantastic CONRAD MACAO, I again experienced a delightful stay in being in total elegance and superb attention. If I were a millionaire I would take all my family to the Conrad Macao!!!! Elegant, superb service, comfortable, unique situation, and all the extras: a real fantastic hotel.",50
My worst stay in any 5 star hotel. Start with check in. The staff was a trainee we needed for check in over half an hour. Breakfast is right for a 2 star hotel. The internet was breaking down again and again. The air condition I was not able to control.,10
"My family stayed at Conrad last Saturday, and this is my third time staying at Conrad Macau hotel.  Staff's services have made my stay a fascinating one, and I would like to express my gratitude and appreciation to lounge staffs Mr.Achin, Mr. Ivan, Ms. Sarah and Ms. Tyra Jiao.",50
"I have stayed in numerous Conrad Hotels- this is the best one. They treat Hilton Honors members like royalty. Honors Gold got me upgraded to a huge suite-as big as my apartment, with executive access. Check-in was done at the lounge- the staff seemed to know my name wherever I went. Welcome drink was refreshing.  Room- one of the nicest suites ever. Amazing view of the Eiffel tower. Huge bathroom. All modern amenities. THey also provide you with a smartphone that is pretty handy. Has 4G data and free local calls.  Executive lounge- one of the best I have been to so far. Tea has such a huge spread. You can easily skip lunch.  Staff- best part of the hotel is the staff. Special thanks to James at the concierge - thanks for helping me plan my day. Thanks to Cliff and Eric for…",50
"Greeting and service during stay were all great- Faculties were friendly and dealt with several issues with smile face- facilities wetr generally satisfying, especially sauna at health club. As other hotels in macao, shuttle bus was convinient for tour- I'd go to this hotel again if I have a chance to go to Macao~",50
"I visited the hotel on 31/5. I sent an email before my visit and Miss Jaycee handled my requests perfectly. As a diamond member, I received room upgraded to a deluxe suite and a complimentary cake to celebrate my birthday...:)  When I arrived, Miss Anika greeted me friendly, provided wonderful assistance to my visit. When I checked in my room, I missed a call as I didn't know how to use the ""wireless"" phone in the room! 15 mins later, another call was received and it's Miss Jaycee, as she wished to ensure everything was alright. That was warm.  I went to the Cotai area later. When I backed at night, my room was packed nicely and the cake was ready on the table, together with a greeting card that was written by Miss Jaycee.  The club lounge was good enough by the way.  Besides, I…",50
"I went to Macau for both business and personal purpose.  I chose to stay in Conrad Macao.  I were greeted by a young man, Ivan Zhong, who gave me warm welcome and kind hospitality throughout my stay.  He is smart, attentive and thoughtful.  He explained to me about the hotel service and amenity clearly.  The location of the hotel is good.  It provides complimentary wifi and shuttle bus.  Room is clean and spacious with fantastic view. I like the rubber duck and teddy bear very much.   I enjoyed the afternoon tea in the club lounge.  Food is good and staff are also very nice.  They are full of smile!   With this fantastic experience, I would have no hesitation to stay in this hotel again not only because the hotel is great but also the staff are excellent that makes me feel like…",50
"We went to Hong Kong for sightseeing and decided to stop by Macau for couple of days.  We used our Hilton Honor's points to stay at Conrad Macau.  Overall, we received excellent service from Conrad.  Excellent customer service, friendly staffs, felt welcoming.  Hotel was very clean.  Staffs addressed all my requests with quick response.  Executive Lounge staffs were excellent.  Excellent experience overall.  Thank you.",50
"Truly 5 star hotel.  Loved the location, amenities, staff and their attention to detail. This hotel is opposite the Venetian and the Parisian. Holiday Inn and Sheraton is on either side and they are all connected. After check in, we were shown our room but it had such a mouldy smell that we had to change it.  We were given another room straight away and the hotel even gave us a fruit platter to apologize for the inconvenience.  Our room was spacious and the beds were very comfortable. Don't forget to use the pillow menu on the bedside table. Only got to use the Gym and it was fantastic. Would have liked to use the swimming pools but ran out of time visiting Macau attractions.  The bar was on the ground floor but we would have preferred one on the roof top.  Nevertheless it was…",50
"Just finished a two night stay at the Conrad and to say we were impressed is an understatement.  Service was exceptional with some great touches 'never 'experienced anywhere prior in this beautiful property.  Upon check-in Charlie was able to upgrade us from a standard room to a junior suite.  She also provided with a great overview of the hotel and Cotai Central complex at the desk, then she took us personally to our room (the first of 'never' experienced).  She walked us through the features of the room, which was a nice size sleeping area with two queen beds (with great linens), large living space, and beautiful bath.  Plenty of amenities with a few signature touches...super cute rubber duck and Conrad teddy bear.  Plus was surprised with a non-prompted turndown complete with…",50
"The first experience when arriving by bus from the ferry terminal was a little bit chaotic as it's necessary to walk through a fairly busy shopping mall to the reception desk, and it's really necessary to look to the signs hanging from the roof to find the way to the slightly hidden away check-in area. Once there, we were assigned a room even though this was really early in the morning. And because of HH Gold status we were upgraded to a fantastic suite with great views and access to the wonderful executive lounge. We really enjoyed our stay at Conrad Macao - but we didn't spend much time in the hotel casino, as there are many better casinos in the area.",50
"This is a wonderful hotel on the Cotai Strip with superb facilities and professional personnel. We loved our room. It was both spacious and luxurious.The Hotel lies between the Holiday Inn and St.Regis on one side; and the large Sheraton Macao complex on the other. It is thus very handily placed to access the large shopping mall, restaurants and shops below. An idyllic stay which we will want to repeat soon!",50
"Near perfect experience @ Conrad Macao.  We're given the room with the best view towards The Parisian's Eiffel tower, so it's the highlight of the stay because the tower lights up with various lights in the evening and it looks so pretty in the evening.  The bed size is huge (even for the 2 beds room). The toiletries and amenities are top notch.  Love the complimentary candy and Conrad bears provided. The location is also the most convenient one cos' it's right in the middle of Sands Cotai area (with Sheraton, Holiday Inn and St. Regis next door) and the Venetian + the Parisian across the street and can be reached by a bridge or simply taking their shuttle bus between those hotels.  The free handyphone provided is a highlight since you can connect your mobile phone to it's wi-fi…",50
"Excellect customer service from Concierge & Lounge. Special thanks to Edmund from concierge for the prompt action and professional arrangment. In additional,  Tyra &  Actrin from lounge showing their care and providing their service straight from heart. The best services & food among all the Hilton and Conrad hotels. :)",40
"The customer service at Conrad was top notch. Reception staff, Stella, was swift at both check in and out and even guided me to the lift upon check in. The gym staff, remembered my name upon my second visit..very impressive. Wifi was another story..probably one of the worse wifi connections I've experienced in a 5-star hotel. Both hotel wifi and ""handy hotspot"" were 3/5 at best.",40
The Conrad Macao is a must when traveling to Macau. The service was outstanding. All the employees were so helpful. Bar in the lobby is great place to have a drink. Each room has an individual portable phone that you can use as a hotspot or to take around Macau to provide a hotspot for your phone.  ,50
"Recently, my wife and I stayed at this hotel for three days.  Overall, we were very happy with the experience.  A few things to note:  1) location is in Taipa, so it's a little ways from downtown Macao.  A taxi ride takes about 20 minutes and was approximatley $75 MOP (~ $10 USD)  2) the club lounge has somewhat restrictive hours so convenience was limited.  3) the service was very pampering but could feel a little suffocating at times  Lastly if you plan to depart via ferry from Taipa ferry terminal to HK airport, you can get the ferry tickets from concierge.  Note the recommended departure times.  We did and we were lucky because there was a big tour group right behind us when we checked-in and it caused a significant delay for all those that came later.",40
"Great, spacious and clean hotel, meet its 5 stars rating. Comparatively quiet then the other casino hotels in Macau. I really enjoyed the stay after years to visit Macau again for the Thriller show!  Front desk staffs were very helpful and nice, especially Diogo. Walk through me during the check in and check out process. Definitely  will recommend the hotel to the others!  ",50
"Really really thankful to Stella And Gary who helped me check in ,as I was really tired and exhausted they made my check in quick and easy and even helped me send my luggage which was stored at Sheraton to bring it to my room. Thank u once again n keep up the good work much appreciated.  ",50
"This hotel provides a level of service that eclipses any large-chain hotel I have ever stayed at. The service is personal, genuine, helpful, and never-ending. I recommend it for anyone looking for a special experience such as an anniversary, etc.",50
"I stayed at the Conrad Macao in November 2016.  It was my first time there, but I would gladly return.  The staff was most gracious and always went the extra mile even though they were not asked.  Very nice hotel, with good amenities in a good location.  They offered to help with ferry reservations and assisted with directions.  I would return any time.",50
"Reception staff who helped perfectly from check-in to check-out. (Rachel, Su, Katarina, Miyako) Employees who smile brightly and say hello every time they pass the door. (Glenda) A lounge staff asking if there is not a shortage or if there is anything to help. (Sara) The room condition is for the year-round Management is good. (Carpet condition is good). Sound insulation is also good. It is also a good hotel for accessibility. It is a very good choice especially for children accompanied by children.",50

"Hotel is nicely decorated; the room is spacious, clean and even coffee machine is provided in the room.  It has good shopping and big foodcourt connecting the hotel, and also to other Hotel. Swimming pool is not child friendly like Holiday Inn's, but has warm water pool. Staff is courteous and helpful.",40
"Our stay was extremely enjoyable! From personalized check in services to the clean,spacious rooms to fast check out, their service was impeccable. The beds were truly made for sleeping! I will definitely stay here again!",50
"Experienced the amazing Conrad Macao during Easter. Shuttle service from the temporary ferry terminal to Conrad was easy to locate. It's a short 5-10min trip to the hotel.  Upon arrival, we were greeted by the bell service and our luggage taken care of and shown the way to reception. Dayo checked us in and recognised my Hilton Honors loyalty and promptly escorted us to our magnificent suite! He took the time to explain the room, the free InFocus phone/wifi service and confirming whether it was at the right temperature. The InFocus mobile phone is a great idea for visitors on short stays as it allows them to tether to their phone for data service and even includes free international calls to a number of countries.  Next morning, we thought of trying the breakfast at The Grand…",50
"Conrad Macau is pretty OK choice for family trip at Macau. Comparing to Sheraton, Conrad is less crowded while sharing all shopping malls and restaurants with Sheraton, Holliday Inn and Sands. Very near to Studio City mall and City of Dream center in 10 minutes.  Good: Most rooms are pretty huge and well maintained. Hotel provides a smart phone for free which is so much useful for making local/ international calls, and also as hot spot where ever you go. Very caring and kind staffs at reception.",40
"An excellent stay as side trip to Business in Hong Kong.  Also would be am excellent destination trip,  Facility and staff are exceptional.  Location is great.  Easy access and lots to do in the area.  Staff was extremely helpful and genuinely friendly.  Hilton Honors benefits great.  Highly recommended.",50
Our families are very enjoy to staying at Conrad Macau. We have travel to there 2-3 times every year and Conrad is our priorities hotel. Bcoz hotel location is very convenient and many shuttle bus has provided from Sands. Room facilities are enough and great service in front desk and concierge. But the shuttle bus station is located in basement then to ferry terminal directions also unclear to Macau Island or Cotai. You must ask and check b4 you get on the bus.,40
"We booked two rooms. Upon arrival, one of us discovered that she had took the wrong suitcase at the airport. The concierge at Conrad, Herbert took the matter into his own hands, contacted the airline to report the incident and managed to retrieve the right suitcase within a couple of hours.   Alva at the front desk should also be commended for her professional and efficient handling of the  check in process. She was kind enough to explain to us in detail on how to use the HANDY in our room. Now I know, there's no need for roaming anymore as long as I stay at the Conrad. I can just take HANDY with me whenever I go out and still stay connected all the time, which does come in HANDY!",50
"2nd stay here and it was not as good as my previous stay. The positives are that room upgrade for Honors Gold and was excellent large suite like my previous stay. The staff was also exceptional and the best I've experienced within the Hilton Chain. Isaac, Fenny, Sarah are a few names I could remember.  Negatives to be addressed by management   The communication quality on the phone was really poor while contacting in room dining and conrad guest services, unlike my last stay where the English levels were great.  The food spread at breakfast, Lunch and Evening Canapés in Executive lounge was really poor and slightly limited compared with other Conrads and even Hiltons I have stayed at. Dishes are more geared towards Chinese than Western tourists as well.  In-room dining has…",30
"It's only a quick visit to Macau; however, a memorable one. I am also pleased that I chose to stay at Conrad Macao hotel.   The hotel shuttle is available at the ferry terminal, and it's only about 40 minutes traveling to the hotel.  Once arrived, the check-in process was quick and efficient. I have been escorted to the Executive Lounge for refreshments.  The room is spacious; I have been upgraded to one of their suites, of course with Executive Lounge access. The breakfast is served in the Executive Lounge as well as the complimentary drink and snack sessions throughout the day, plus an evening canapés and sunset cocktails. Thank you for this wonderful experience!  The staff here is all friendly and very helpful. My ferry ticket back to Hong Kong on the following day was booked…",50
"I never stayed at a Conrad property before until I stayed 4 nights at the Conrad Macao Cotai Central. The staff in the main lobby and especially on the 39th floor lounge were fantastic. My suite blew away all the high-end suites I have stayed at from Mexico City to NYC to Milan to NYC. I was truly impressed with the staff, the food and decor.  Conrad Macao Cotai Central has set the bar very high. Keep up the great work.",50
"Stayed here for one night with wife and two kids, 8 & 6 yrs. from the moment I check ed in till check out, I feel very happy and secured for the accommodations and amazing services from the staff. Definitely I am coming come to Conrad Cotai. Two thumbs up!!!! Especially Archin from the business lounge and Glenda from the pool. Thank you!!!",50
Have had a wonderful stay here. Great staff from Yumi at check in to Achin in the lounge. All very helpful and friendly. Pool deck is 4 pools with 2 heated. All pools have an attached spa. 24 hour gym for those that way inclined. Lots of food outlets of course. Free fast WiFi,50
Stayed in a suite which is well laid out and very comfortable. Staffs are very polite and helpful. The check in was very fast. The only down side was the water pressure of the shower was not strong enough.,50
"We were in Macau for one night on the Easter long weekend with no accommodation booked. We couldn't get a ferry back to Hong Kong so needed to find a place to stay. All the hotels we tried were booked out. Lastly we went into the Conrad and was able to get a king suite. The reception lady was so helpful and spoke excellent English. We were were trying to find a room at 1am in the morning, which I'm sure isn't a normal thing. She walked us to the elevators and also organized a wake up call for us so we didn't miss our ferry back to Hong Kong.  The room itself was amazing, opulent, well decorated. The Bed, linen, bathroom all high quality. Also a bath in the room and nespresso coffee machine.   If I ever came to Macau again I would definitely stay here.  Even the concierge staff…",50
"We spent one night at the Conrad Macau with our little 6 months old daughter.  It's a huge hotel - like most in Macau - but at least we could enjoy a more personal service than other hotels we stayed in. In particular the lady at check-in - Rachel - was extremely helpful and nice to make us feel welcome, and arrange all we needed for our baby daughter. She even sent a small bag of amenities for our baby daughter, which was a very nice and unexpected gesture!  The rooms are big and very confortable - although the quality of material used is certainly not for a 5-star hotels (but again, expect this from many other 5-star hotels in Macau!).   Overall we had a short but enjoyable stay at the Conrad, and would consider staying here again in future",40
Great location for the Cotai strip.  Impressive rooms on executive floor. Well equipped.  Decent spa - willing to accommodate.  Wonderful concierge service and advice on local restaurants.  Recommend a trip to old town.  However Macau ideally caters for those with gambling or shopping interests.,50
"This was the perfect stay. Even before check-in, the chief concierce (Edmund) got in contact and was really helpful with my request about the arrival and transportation. During check-in with the lovely people (Mandy and Kaycee) I found out that I got upgraded to a deluxe suite (hell yeah!) which was really amazing and one of the best rooms I ever had anywhere. The lounge is a perfect place to stay and the staff there is very nice and helpful. I got some great recommendations about what to see in the city, how to get there and what to try. It perfectly fit my needs :-)  I had a wonderful sleep in the super-sized bed and enjoyed the hugh bathroom. The breakfast and the ""happy-hour"" in the lounge ""put the cherry on the cake"" :D  Please stay as you are and keep up the great work and…",50
My wife and I had a wonderful stay at the Conrad Cotai. Lobby reception staff were very efficient and helpful and upgraded us to a higher floor (Hilton Honors). Room service was good with very friendly staff and accommodating. We would stay here again as the hotel is a touch higher in standard compared to the Sheraton next door.,40
"This is my first time Stay with Conard.  Before a week of my stay, the hotel staff sent an email to me about my stay, I've told them that it's my daughter's birthday trip, then, they upgraded our room to suite and prepared a birthday cake and toys to my daughter. My daughter was so surprised and said thanks hundred times to me.  The hotel also arranged a lounge access to me even knew my Gold tier has just expired on 31 March 2017.  Room is amazing, food is very good, all staff who we met were pleasant and gracious.  My family had a wonderful stay here.    I want to say thank you to Ivan Zhong of Conrad Club Lounge Guest Relations Officer, he and his team make it happen with me. He gave me such a warm welcoming like my lovely home with the upscale services which it meaningful for…",50
The Conrad Hotel We stayed at the Conrad Hotel Macao and from the minute we got off the ferry our great experience started. The bus was waiting and took us straight to the hotel. When we arrived we were greeted like royalty and the best was Fancy the young lady who checked us in. We spent much time asking her questions and she was so attentive. She was great with letting us check in early and stay later the next day. She brought us  to our room which was amazing and had a great view. Everything about our experience was amazing. When we went to the pool the next morning they even remembered our names. I will be bringing my husband the next time I come back to visit my daughter.  Don't miss coming here if you are in Macao Martha from Atlanta Ga,50
Spectacular and very friendly staff and a great place to stay. Rooms are very good and pleasant and the service is a plus. Good location surrounded by the main casinos and lots of transportations services for piers and central macao. ,50
"With the help of a kind Korean employee, Rachel, I checked in. She greeted me with her parents and me in a beautiful smile.After check-in, he explained to me all the instructions to the guest room. I also checked every single one of them individually.  I was able to make good memories in Macau's Macau. I'd like to get help from rachel again. Thank you very much.",50
"Exceptional service experienced from the moment I checked in until the moment I departed. Very accommodating check in from Fancy, escorted me to my room and then arranged for me to move to a room that had a bathtub. Room was very spacious and most comfortable bed. I made use of the lobby bar and again staff were very accommodating and friendly. I was able to get a late check out which was much appreciated and the stay ended with the concierge helping me out with my luggage and getting me a taxi. I would definitley return to this hotel again. Oh and the Conrad duck was a lovely touch 🐦",50
"Maybe you will think from outside that is better the Parisian or Venetian but trust me this is the place you want to sleep or stay first before arriving they contact me giving detailed information on how to arrive , we miss our ferry and they help with detailed explanation where to get the bus how to reach the lobby etc, then our kids were greeted on arrival by name , no waiting time on check in always try to help , one day they arrange booking for our kids show and dinner at the steakhouse, we walk thru the corría and saw at the Parisian long lines for everything checks in iut bus etc so believe you will feel like heaven here ",50
"It was our first time on Cotai strip and this hotel was perfect in every respect. Most courteous staff, good English, every little detail in the room was taken care of. Even got it right which side of the bed my wife would sleep and me for placing our bedroom slippers. Ms.Soong the front office manager was most helpful at checkout. Very quick check in and check out. Bags were in the room very quickly. Continental breakfast as part of room service is great value. 1 breakfast was enough for 3 of us! Book through Sands Resorts web site for best value and promotions. ",50
"We got upgraded to a suite and it was amazing. Came with a movie room, lounge and dining area.  Enough room for a family.  Had breakfast on the club floor, used the spa... totally worth it. Would definitely stay here again.",40
"This is certainly our favourite Macau hotel, with excellent hardware and service.  As Hilton Gold member we always got upgrade to their very spacious and comfortable suite and were granted access to their Executive Lounge.  Service at the lounge was superb, in particular Renee who always took care of us so well.  Other members like Ivan, Yao etc were great too.   Our most recent stay at the hotel was a one-night stay in March one week after our wedding.  I emailed the hotel in advance about this mini-moon trip.   It turned out they arranged a tasty cake, decoration of the suite with rose petals, a handmade congratulations card, and even a customised key card with our photo as the cover. What a pleasant surprise to us!  Our suite facing the Cotai Strip was great as always, and we…",50
This is so far the best hotel I've stayed in around the world!! The customer service is second to none and the attention to details is second to none! When we arrived at the Macau terminal the hotel courtesy shuttle coach is right across the road (it's lime green so you can miss it). The bus also goes to the holiday inn and Sheraton so all the hotels names are on the shuttle bus. The shuttle bus journey only takes about 5-8 mins and upon arrival we were welcomed by the receptionist Stella who was very polite and helpful and our room was ready despite we arrived a bit early at 2pm (check in time is 3pm)- checked in was smooth and we were given out monkey king tickets as that was part of the hotel deal (only minor point is that we were meant to be given VIP tickets but we were…,50
"Best hotel I have stayed at thus far. I really loved it. They truly know how to make a diamond member feel welcomed and the Conrad Lounge staff make it a point to remember the guest by name and face. Best room ever and best upgrade ever given without even asking. Lots of choices to eat at the lounge for breakfast and a lot of alcohol to choose from during cocktail hour. I loved it so much that my first day I just stayed at the hotel and I did not leave to go out until the next morning after breakfast. Shanghai Tang and Refinery amenities. Loved the Conrad teddy bear and enjoyed the Nespresso machine. I really enjoyed talking to Ivan and Ryan. It may even be that I come back just to talk to them, haha. I really do want to come back to Macau just so I can stay at Conrad and…",50
"I visited Macao and stayed at the Conrad Macao over a long weekend.    Days before I arrived, the hotel reached out to me to see if they could make any special arrangements for me. I let them know they could pick me up from the ferry landing, which they did.  Only about 10 minutes from the ferry, the Conrad is in the heart of the action, with the Venetian and Parisian across the street and a multitude of shops and hotels in the area. For me, the location was great ...and provided a great place to base my daily walks around the ""strip"" there.  The Conrad shares its structure with a Holiday Inn. From a branding standpoint, I found this disturbing and was concerned the Conrad experience would be downscaled to a Holiday Inn-like atmosphere. However, the Conrad has its own lobby…",40
"Excellent rooms and facilities and great staff. However, the executive room views are blocked by adjacent buildings. The food in the executive lounge could be better. Also gym was OK. I guess people go there to enjoy casinos and other entertainments and really no time for gym",50
"last time i went, i stayed at holiday inn which is right behind conrad.. they share the same building... this time my husband wanted to stay at conrad.. we stayed for 2 nights.. the spa is a must try! excellent service... room is spacious.. and since we were there to celebrate our wedding anniversary, the guest service team surprised us with a cheese cake and a very lovely note... buffet breakfast was nice.. alot of selections to choose from.... basically we had brunch there, skipped lunch and went straight to dinner...  the lounge is also quite big.. packed in the morning for breakfast, but not that many people are there in the afternoon. So you can go get a drink and relax before going back down to the room. There's also a jaccuzi in the gym change room.. so you do not need to…",50
"Is it possible to go bear hunting in a hotel room?  YES, this hotel made it possible without any animals being harmed in the process.  Ducks can also appear unexpectedly.  Suffice to say that this hotel has the most imaginative and creative staff.    We spent three wonderfully memorable days at this hotel where the daily surprises had me laughing and swearing (in a good way - as in ""Holy Crap!  This is awesome!"")  Typically, one hotel staff member stands out.  At the Conrad Macao, everyone deserves to be recognized - including Bede, Rudy, Diana, Yumi, Cecily, Jaycee, etc.  We will be back with promises to be very low maintenance on our next visit.  :)",50
"I had been to Macau few times these years. Conrad Macau is the most impressive I have experienced: stylish decor, spacious room and excellent service.  Definitely I will be staying at Conrad next trip to Macau.",50
"I say that as a person that travels A LOT. It is not an overstatement to say you will be treated like royalty here, especially if you have access to the Concierge Lounge on 39. Arriving here from the airport or ferry is a snap with the free shuttle buses that run continuously in a loop between the Sands complex and the terminals. When I arrive at the lobby I just tell the doorman I'm a Hilton Diamond member & I'm whisked upstairs to 39 to check in. Cool drinks are offered as you check in and any arrangements or reservations can be made at this (or any) time. Of course you will have gotten a welcome email and offer of any assistance about a week prior to your arrival. Just incredible customer service.   I have stayed here twice in the last 2 years and hope to return again soon. I…",50
"It's my second time staying at Conrad and have chosen to upgrade to junior suite this time. Everything is up to standard but somehow this suite looked even duller than the room i stayed last time. It was also a bit dated with some stains on sofa though the room itself is spacious. Two TVs in our room, which is good, and the view of venetian was stunning. They also accommodated my early checkin and late check out requests. I stayed at wynn palace the night before, so I couldnt help comparing the two. Complementary candies and dolls are still available at Conrad but maybe the hotel may have to introduce new 'surprises' and the no. of shuttle bus routes is limited from Sands as compared to Wynn Palace / Studio City.  However, overall, room is very clean. Staff are polite",50
"It was a splendid staycation we had in there. As a diamond member of Hilton, we had been upgraded to a suite which is very spacious and comfortable. Due to the fact that it was our anniversary the hotel even prepared a cheese cake as a token of appreciation for having us there to celebrate our anniversary. I am very thankful for that. Job well done Conrad Macau, I am sure I will definitely revisit it in near future.   I have to mention that the staff Ea Enriquez from reservation team, she was very professional as the email was responded with great details. And due to my special request for the non-smoking room, the lounge staff had making sure that the room was smoking free for numerous times, I was very touched by that. Thank you. ",50
"A few weeks back I did a short stay at the Conrad Macao Cotai Central and we absolutely loved it. The property itself is very beautiful and spacious. It isn't as extravagant as some of the other hotel/casinos in Macao but it was certainly an impressive piece of architecture.  The room was very large and classy, one of the nicest Conrad rooms I've seen. We had a nice view of the Venetian Macao from our room The amenities were excellent as well.  The main thing that made this property stand out was the excellent staff. Everyone we encountered was super friendly and accommodating. The following staff members in particular made a great impression:  - Edmund Tan. Edmund contacted me before the stay to confirm arrival time and see if there was anything we needed for our stay. He was…",50
"This hotel is one of several in an attached mall.  Without ever going outside you can eat at a variety of restaurants, gamble in multiple casinos, and shop.  the views of the flashy casino strip are spectacular from the high floors.  the rooms are luxurious and well appointed.",40
"Great stay at the Conrad. The check-in staff took the time to show us our room and explained the room facilities to us. We were assigned a room overlooking the Parisian with great night view of the Eiffel Tower.  Room was spacious and clean, with ample water and toiletries provided throughout our stay.   Staffs were attentive and helpful.  Would definitely stay here again should we return to Macao in the future.",50
"What a fabulous stay at this wonderful hotel in Macau. Absolutely faultless from start to finish.   We check in late and are warmly welcomed by Gary, the Head of Front Office, who personally escorts us to our upgraded King Suite on the 24th floor (a perk of being an Hhonors Diamond member). Gary explains all the gadgets and functionality of the room before he hands us our key cards which have our photos imprinted on them - very impressive!  The room itself is huge, over 100 Sqm, with separate TV room, separate living room, and separate bathroom, with a huge bath and walk-in shower, two basins, and 3 different brands of amenities. The obligatory Conrad bear is on the bed, as is the duck (with a pair of dice) adjacent to the bath tub.  After a restful sleep in the King-sized bed,…",50
"This was my first time at the Conrad Macao.  The service during my entire time here was excellent. From the moment I arrived, the gentleman at the front door and the lady checking me in were pleasant and professional. The hotel lobby and registration area are absolutely beautiful and immaculate. The staff at the restaurant where I had breakfast and the lobby lounge, especially the lobby lounge staff were excellent.  The club lounge staff were also first class.  For me, what determines whether a hotel is first class is the quality of service because providing a high level of service is harder than providing beautiful facilities. I liked my stay so much that I will be staying here again within 12 months.",50
"It was our second visit. We were here almost a few years back and the service is still impeccable, the staff were very helpful and every requests were met very quickly. The room was tidy and very comfortable. Definitely will come back again!",50
"I was staying with my wife and my friends, we are all impressed by the tidiness and the comfortable environment of the room. The service was impeccable and the breakfast was also very nice. Definitely will come back again!",50
The Conrad Macau is one of the finest hotels I've ever had the great pleasure to stay.  The staff was impeccable from the moment I arrived until I departed.  I recommend this specific hotel and all Conrad properties as they treat their guests like royalty. ,50
"I arrived after a red eye to HK followed by a ferry and was not in the best of moods.  The staff was very patient and friendly. Kudos to Yumi who was the supervisor when I checked in and made everything good.  Good gym with seperate room for yoga, etc. Lots of machines and weights. Dressing room and sauna only open til 9PM but gym itself is 24H  There are a few pools but none seemed to be more than 15 meters",50
"I arrived hotel by shuttle bus from Cotai Pier around 12nn and immediately went to the reception for check-in.  This time we came to Macao for the musical Three Phantoms at the Parisian Theatre.  The staff greeted us offered great help and assistance.  She informed us the hotel was full house and no available room at that moment.  She offered us placing the luggage at the concierge so that we could go out for lunch and the musical before coming back for the room.  She said she would try her best arranging us a room facing the Parisian Hotel Eiffel Tower.  We came back hotel at about 3pm and the room was ready.  The luggage was already in our room before we came back.  The room was large and spacious with view facing the Eiffel Tower.  Size over 500 sq ft, with a L-shaped sofa, a…",50
"Just visited this hotel for the first time, with my parents. All 3 of us enjoyed our stay there very much from the beginning to the end. We received warm welcome and nice room upgrade upon check-in. Both the gentleman and the lady who helped us to check-in were very courteous and considerate.   I told the the front desk lady at check-in desk on the exec club floor that my parents were celebrating wedding anniversary during this trip, she then kindly arranged a cheese cake (sent directly to the room) as a surprise gift for my parents - very pleasant gesture indeed.   Guest room itself is 5-star quality, with good amenities & good view. I was happy to receive yet another Conrad bear (had it from Singapore, Bali, and Hong Kong from my previous travels). Mine was damaged by me by…",50

"As my first stay as a HHonours Diamond member, I was disappointed when comparing it to the Sofitel Macau and previous Accor Platinum experiences.  I was certainly happy with the upgrade to the suite, however, that was about it. There were numerous small issues that added up to make it not such a memorable experience I mentioned these issues at check out and the lady was very understanding. As Mr. Xu was not available at the time, he sent me a follow up about the issues I encountered, however, I never received a reply when I gave more details and asked when my bonus points would be credited. I sent the e-mail 6 weeks ago! So I am concerned that Conrad Macao has not taken my issues seriously. Here are the issues listed in my e-mail of 3rd February 2017:  Thanks for the follow up…",30
"Luxury hotel with convenient location at Cotai Central in Macao. As a Hilton Gold member, felt welcomed by staff and had a complimentary upgrade to Jr Suite. What really stood out was the attentive service of all the staff members, particularly those working at the club lounge. I came here with my wife and parents in law and we all felt welcome. They kindly extended club privileges to everyone during our stay although the benefit is for one additional guest per member. The gym was also spacious and had lots of equipment.",50
"Have stayed here quite a few times in recent years, and multiple trips have reinforced my positive view. Conrad offers lovely, spacious rooms with subdued, tasteful decor. Service is excellent, truly 5-star -- the gracious staff consistently go out of their way to greet you and anticipate your needs. The location is very handy, right in the middle of the Sands Cotai Central complex, and close to the overhead walkway that leads to the Venetian.",50
"This is my 4th stay in Conrad Macau and everytime I am there I am greeted by a friendly staff and a warm welcome. Alva whom I met on my last visit personally checked our reservations days before our scheduled arrival and our special requests, as we decided to check in to Macau side on our first day in Macau. She even surprised me by sending out a birthday cake to my room which was a nice gesture since my birthday is still 2 weeks away;)...We had access to the club lounge and eventhough Gallant, the assistant manager who entertained us at the lounge before was transferred to the Grand Orbit, we met him by surprise on the way back to the hotel from Parisian. He greeted us at the footbridge of Venetian and Sands, and I am still surprised that he remembers us quite well since we saw…",50

As soon as we arrived we were very impressed with the level of service from all the Staff.  We were escorted to our room by a Staff Member and shown the amenities of the room. The room was amazing, they upgraded us to a Suite which was absolutely stunning and we had a view of the Eiffel Tower with the nightly light show.  In the Bedroom they had decorated the bed and had the 2 Conrad Teddy Bears for us. It was such a lovely touch and we felt very special.  The bed was super comfortable and no noise to be heard from anywhere at night time. We loved the room so much we never wanted to leave it, but did to explore!   We also used the Pool and Spa area one afternoon to…",50

Hotel location was great to access sand cotai central shopping area & restaurants. Beside, there was a bridge that linked with Venetian & Four Season Hotel...",50
Was there for a friends 40th birthday party week.  Huge rooms with spa-like bathrooms.  The concierge staff coordinated so many details for our group and it all went very smoothly.  Sing (?sp) in the lobby bar made fantastic cocktails. A special thank you to Edmund of the concierge staff for all of his attention to the details!,50
"Went to Dynasty 8 with Family for dinner. Easy access with car park and located on ground floor. Iconic red lantain as ancient Chinese appearance. Love the environment as it's not lousy and packed so we got some good nice time. The presentation and incredient are not commonly found in other Chinese restaurants in Macao. If looking for a little spice-up while following the traditional family dinner, Dynasty 8 is the place.",50
"A connecting room was arranged and we had already heard a man talking on the phone next door loudly once we entered the room. However, the officer said that their rooms were fully booked and they were unable to offer room change which we were disappointed. However, believed that they called that guest and informed him to lower the voice as it was quiet afterwards. The room was spacious especially the bathroom. I like the shower a lot and haven't used the bathtub. Coffee machine with complimentary coffee was available. Breakfast was nice but we needed to walk a bit to the restaurant which is not that convenient.  Overall, it was a nice stay.",50
"I have booked my stay in Conrad Macau this coming April in celebration of my son's first birthday. As my son is still an infant, I emailed Conrad to see if baby cot bed and stroller etc can be arranged. They said they couldn't find my booking (I booked through those common hotel booking website) and would get back to me as soon as they can.   As one of the world's most famous hotel group, I am surprised they need to take more than two weeks for just checking my booking and up to date, I still have not heard back anything from them, not a single reply or follow up email. My request was made as early as mid February.",30
"Having had a disappointing stay in the Conrad Macau (in an entry-level room) before I have decided to give it another try. This time I have taken a Deluxe King Suite. Check in was uneventful and smooth as expected of an international five star hotel. The only slight disappointment was that my suite was situated on the 9th floor and when I asked for one on a higher floor I was told that such was not available. Imagine that - a suite (and not an entry-level one either) on the 9th floor, with no view nor sunlight... The suite was decorated in a sophisticated and elegant theme in line with all Conrads but slightly dated comparing to some of the newer hotels in Macau. Comfortable nevertheless. It is of a good size (about 1000 sq.ft) with a very comfortable sofa in the living room -…",50
"This hotel lacks a grand lobby, and there are not enough sofa / seats. There is no hand-held shower and it would be quite inconvenient to wash a kid. The toiletries are made in China. Other than these aspects, this hotel is very good.",50
"Have you ever been given money by a hotel concierge to take a taxi? Yes, I have at Conrad Macau, which is certainly the best hotel in my life.  Actually I intended to take a free shuttle bus from the hotel to the ferry terminmal, but due to a small trouble I missed the bus and needed to take a taxi to the ferry terminal.  But it was the last day of my trip and there was no Macau bill left in my purse..... Right after I told it to the hotel concierge who helped me with the small trouble, he rushed to the staff room and came back to me with some money in his hand, saying ""you can take a taxi with this"".  I have not expected such a treat and I gratefully accepted his so kind and flexible offer. Thank you so much, Cliff!! I was pleased to hear that the hotel have paid money back to…",50

Marvelous hotel with incredible rooms. As a Diamond member I received a complimentary upgrade to one of their lovely suites. The staff is extremely well trained. I loved my stay and all of their staff. Thanks again for making my stay perfect!,50
"Contai area is the best to stay in while in Macau Make sure to check your country's visa requirement before arriving in Macau ( although it's a 55 min ferry ride from Hong Kong but it needs a separate visa ) Be at the ferry terminal 45 min before departure time ( this should be enough to buy a ticket , check in luggage and get on board ), same while you are leaving . Don't miss : Show of dancing water Visit Venetian hotel Go to St Paul's ruins first and then walk down to Senado square , to get the pulse of the city ",50
"We were very happy and satisfied during our stay in Conrad and we would definitely stay again when we come back to Macau. All the hotel staff are so accomodating and helpful especially Mr. Gary Tong who assisted us when we check-out and until we ride the shuttle bus he was there and ready to render his help in any way he can. Until now we're still in awe with the kind of service we got from the whole Conrad Macao team. Sincerest thanks guys, job well done! ",50
"Fancy hotel located at the newest development of Macau, China. Shuttles services available at various mass transit locations like the Airport, Seaports and Border. The room is huge and the King size bed is big,separate bath tub  and shower facility. Our room had a view of the  Eiffel Tower of the Parisian Hotel across the street. Several hotels located nearby. Just tell the driver you want to get off at Conrad which is also the drop off point for Holiday Inn. Due to the high occupancy of the CNY week. Our room won't be available until 3PM. You have to use your guest key to operate the lifts to the guest room. Friendly staffs and willing to assist you by all means.",40
"I only stayed there one night, but it was a wonderful one!! It' s very important, when you walk into a hotel, the first ten seconds: at the time you decide, whether the right choice has been made.Thanks to Cathy, check in, I experienced one of the most beautiful moments since I've been in Asia.For months I am in Asia, I thought I had some beautiful check in, as one in Seoul, but what I lived with Cathy is indescribable: It has never happened. From beginning, when she welcomed me, accompanied in the room, giving all explanations, I hoped  that time does not pass ever.I could spend all my day in Conrad, making check in with her.The GM should be proud and lucky to have such an employee.Also when I needed some advices, I found in Trista, concierge,a perfect advisor, with its calm…",50

"After eventually locating the shuttle bus from the ferry terminal (better signage, please) and hefting our own cases into its luggage hold we were dropped off at the rear of a large shopping mall. Where were we? The driver pointed through the doors and after retrieving our cases we walked through  a lovely mall until we saw signs for the Conrad reception. It was all very odd, walking past shops to reach a reception area. It wasn't expected and we were a little disconcerted. However,  it is a very impressive reception and I was impressed that we were greeted by name. Check in was smooth and the staff friendly and informative.  We were upgraded to a suite (thank you for all your help, Gary Tong). What a lovely, comfortable, impressive room. Descriptions are on the web site but…",40

"I have now stayed at the St.Regis, the Sheraton, and the Conrad Macao, all located right next to each other on the Cotai strip across from the Venitian and Parisian. I must say, like the St Regis, this hotel was just fantastic. They had a stocked fridge/bar in the room, a couch with a small coffee table, giving me more options for relaxing than just on the bed, and the service staff was friendly. They have a good menu for room service which is 24 hours as usual. I believe the pricing for this room is similar to what St.Regis offers, but their rooms here come with a couch! If I had to rate the three, this would be number one, followed by the St. Regis (lacking a couch) and third would be the Sheraton (no stocked bar in room, have to order room service for items) although Sheraton…",50

Entrance in the Cotai central shopping plaza - but service to die for, the concierge knew my name within minutes of checking in and I didn't book the room!

This hotel is well located and connected to venetian macao so i enjoyed shopping at the grand canal. Bus stop is near the hotel, so i went to senado squre by 26A bus.  you could walk to C.O.D, parsian, and even to galaxy macao. old taipa village is also walkable.(around 20~30 min.) if the weather is not so hot, i recommned you to walk around. some times walking is faster than the shuttle bus.

Fancy walked me up to the suite to make sure it was to my satisfaction.  A few minutes later she called to offer me travel adapters!  I have never been called and offered items before- her attention to detail was amazing!  There was a huge dining area, 2 living rooms, bedroom and my favorite part...the bathroom.

"I celebrated my 40th birthday at the Conrad Cotai Central. There were several aspects of the hotel itself that made the event really special. I will highlight a few: 1. The concierge staff, specifically Edmund Tan, worked with me for months to help organize about 30 people travelling from around the world to rendezvous for a 3 day celebration. Someone from the hotel accompanied us on our complicated itinerary. 2. All the staff at the hotel seemed to know it was was my birthday and went out of my way to make it special. For example making custom made key cards related to my birthday. They also had balloons on the bed and cake with a photo on it related to the festivities.  3. At a baseline, the hotel has excellent facilities. The staff take great care to ensure you feel pampered.…",50
"We spent one night in Conrad Macau in the occasion of my son visit in Hong Kong. Hotel lobby is nice , luxury decoration, may be little empty at check in area as we need to be attentive to 3 desks to see where to go, same feeling for check out The check-in  was very efficient and courteous thanks to Mr Lee , he even leave counter desk and show us the way to the lifts.  We appreciate this individual welcome. The room is confortable and we had Eiffel Tower view which was nice , bathroom is large and with full amenities.  Why i don't give 5 points ? Definitely because I didn't appreciate to go in the commercial mall to have breakfast.  How come can we consider to be a 5 stars guest when Conrad sent you out of hotel for your breakfast ? It was a All day restaurant buffet , open to…",40
it's was an amazing stay in Conrad Macau..the room was very nice and clean..amenities was great like the infocus cellphone..'twas very useful to the guests..well be planning our next stay in conrad soon.. ,50
"It was my first time in Macau . So excited.We had great time at Conrad Macau few days ago . It was Chinese New Year. Room was very expensive. But it was acceptable, Because of the hospitality . One of the door man form Philippine I guess . he was try hard to speak mandarin to me . He thought We are Chinese may not understand English. When we arrived at the lobby .Great personalized service ! Also room is well maintained. Clean and tidy. From border gate ,ferry terminal to hotel has free shuttle bus . Also Close to Venetian ,city studio , Wynn place ,city of dreams,  We had breakfast at Grand Orbit .  Amazing restaurant.Everything and everybody exceeded our expectations,Gallant and his team could not have been more welcome and helpful.   One negative thing is we are not included…",50
"I traveled to Macau for my buddy Alex's 40th birthday party.  We were booked at the Conrad hotel, as Alex had done a lot of the leg work to find great accomodations.  I was so surprised.  The rooms are huge, and look just like the brochure shots.  Imaculate.  Clean, comfortable, attractive to the eye.  You feel you're living like a king!  But that's not all.  The staff was super friendly, and very helpful to us.  From little things like dental floss, to directions and recommendations.  They really went out of their way for us.  They even put together a framed photo of our party, all while we were still staying there.  Edmund Tan really coordinated things.  A very nice Singaporean gentleman, I enjoyed meeting him, and he was always great to talk to.  I would really recommend this…",50
"Stayed here for my birthday celebration and had a great all-round experience. In previous visits to Macau we usually stayed at the Sheraton and Marriott which are massive properties so there were always a lot of people everywhere you go. Conrad in comparison is smaller in scale and more intimate, and attracts guests who are willing to pay a bit more.  From the Taipa Ferry Terminal it was a one-stop bus ride and despite arriving at around check in time (3 pm) there was not a huge line. We checked in with Isac who was very welcoming and upgrade our room to a deluxe suite as I was a Gold member and extended the checkout time to 2pm. Upon finding out that I was celebrating my birthday with my wife Isac also arranged a special 'surprise' for us (which turned out to be a very nice…",50
"Macau offers a number of high-end properties and competition appears to be somewhat high. Having stayed at Conrad properties in the past, I knew what to expect and Conrad Macau did not disappoint. Service was very attentive and personalised. Would recommend this property to anyone!",50
"Great location, service and rooms. We came for my wife's birthday and they upgraded us, surprised us with a cake in our room after we got back from dinner and all the staff were very helpful. The location is perfect right in the middle of everything and walking distance too all the other resorts.",50
"I will strongly suggest my friends try this hotel, especially who enjoy the Hilton membership program. Must Try their Club Lounge! The services and food delivered by their club lounge team are unbelievable good that you can't imaging it is just a hotel club lounge. The staffs are amazingly professional in providing their services. we had 2 breakfast and 1 happy hour during our stay, we love the people and food. The quality of the food and services just so amazing that makes me believe I will chose Conrad always when I travel going forward. for those who visit recently, I hope you will meet Alkin there, his hospitality and great services  will just make your day!",50
We had a superb stay at the Conrad. The rooms are luxurious and well appointed and the staff are friendly and helpful. This is probably one of the best hotels we've stayed at. The hotel is linked to a shopping mall and the Venetian Hotel were you can find restaurants and a food court. There's a casino within the hotel if you fancy your chances at the tables/slots. Taxi drivers in Macau are rude and drive like maniacs.,50
"A wonderful 3 days in January at this luxurious hotel! With the regular luxury shops, a starbucks, great restaurants, family friendly shows daily, and a huge lunch buffet make it a great place to be.  Well connected on the Cotai strip, accessibility to the Venetian & new Parisian makes it more fun. Rooms were spacious and the staff is super helpful = from a room upgrade to extra toiletries, the response to my kids' requests was always 'anything else please', and that was much appreciated!!  The hand held phone with wifi in each room, with free calls to HK/ China, and free wifi was super useful as we could take it out and use the hotspot all over macau.  Great place in all respects!",50
"Our stay at  Conrad Macau was made enjoyable at every step from HH check in to the executive lounge, the superb dinner and smilingly happy concierge. The upgraded suite was amanzingly spacious an comfortable. Recommend a visit for a longer duration The hotel is linked to the adjoining hotels and the shopping malls add to the window surfing.",50
"Don't know where to start...the facilities are magnificent. 5+ stars in my opinion. Checked in at the Executive Lounge and was recognized by name by all staff, nice touch. Upgraded suite was quite comfortable. Rudy in operations was quite attentive to all of my needs.  The food was fantastic in the Executive Lounge both the p.m. and breakfast. Had a great scrub and massage in the spa. Hd a problem with my cell phone and staff was insistent on jumping in and fixing the problem...that is customer service!!",50
"Although I have been to Macau many times, Conrad Macau really wow me this time.  First of all, their chief concierge Edmund Tan sent email to me for some friendly reminders cos I chose to go at CNY time. He also gave the recommendation for their spa, and we did try and the experience is fantastic.  Upon check in, we were greeted by a nice receptionist Fancy, and her service was indeed fancy and outstanding. We were given a nice and clean room, and the color of the room was bright which I liked it very much. The first night we chose to stay at Four Seasons Macau, and the lighting there was a little dark for me so if you like a bright color, Conrad will be a better choice.  Talking about the room, everything is fine except the air condition. My mum went with me together, and she…",50
"This was the most helpful hotel I visited during my China / Macau / HK holiday. From the moment I walked in, Pedro (I think that was his name) was incredibly helpful. He recommended vegetarian restaurants, upgraded me to a higher floor with the Eiffel Tower view and knew exactly what I was after. A small but very nice gesture was that he suggested I keep the room key card as a memory, which is exactly what I wanted to do. The hotel is conveniently located and has a free shuttle bus to/from the Airport, ferry terminal and the city. The room was amazing, with a huge bathroom, bed and excellent view. Pedro also made sure I received a new hotel mobile phone (as they were only rolling them out that week). The doorman and bellboys remembered my name despite only being at the hotel for…",50
"My family went there and stayed for 3 days, and had great experience. We have the gold membership and have the free upgrade it to the suite which allowed us to have a snack time at their lounge every day. The room was very spacious and clean and have a free cell phone that we could use . lexecutive lounge  served great breakfast and afternoon tea snacks . One of the manager, Achin, was specially nice to my kids. My kids loved the hot cocoa Achin gave us, and he remembered our family and suggested menus accordingly based on what we had before. Both facility and people are very satisfactory and I'll be more than happy to go back.  영어로만 쓰니 안 쓴 것처럼 인식이 되서 한국말로 다시 씁니다 가족여행이없고 골드 멤버십 덕분에 큰 방으로 무료 업그레이드 되었습니다 멤버십 덕분에 라운지에서 Mail 아침과 점심 간식을 무료로 즐길 수 있었고 음식이 매우 맛있었습니다 또한 라운지에 매니저의 서비스도…",50
"It is the first time that I visited Conrad Macao, which provided me an accommodation with contemporary amenities and luxurious touches within spacious and sophisticated surroundings. I have a good sleep in a king-sized bed and refresh in the bathroom with a bathtub and a separate rain shower. Besides, a mobile phone was provided by the Hotel and I can use it during my visit in Macau, which is a really touching act.  Strongly recommended!!!!!",50
"There are so many people who have made this stay exceptional I hope I can mention them all.   First, the lovely room upgrade to a deluxe suite 840 sq feet was brilliant with a delightful seating area, two huge TVs, the view was great in the day and amazing at night when we could look out at mini Eiffel Tower which had a light show.  Shuttle bus to Macau was simple and it is easy to walk around the town.  Breakfast, afternoon tea and cocktails in the Executive Lounge were all delicious and the variety fairly good.  It was the staff in the Executive Lounge who made our stay exceptional and I would have to rate this hotel as the best I have been fortunate enough to stay in.   Ashin and his fantastic team in the restaurant were delightful to talk to but it was the seemless way they…",50
"The hotel was communicative and responded to our queries prior to our stay, and provided the info we needed on how to get there.  Check in was smooth and lots of details paid attention to. Info and assistance we required on local sights/eats/transport was readily available from the friendly folks in the lobby. The ""taxi card"" is innovative and a useful souvenir. Our room and view was amazing, and very spacious! Love the amenities in the room too! One small suggestion, which might just have been an oversight, is that perhaps an additional set of toiletries (shower gel etc) may be provided. Check out was swift and we were promptly assisted to the shuttle bus - very efficient as well.  Special thanks to your front office team, especially Ms Yumi, who arranged for a surprise…",50
"Checked in on a Thursday and stayed for two nights.  Booked lowest category room, but was upgraded to an 1100 sq feet deluxe suite as a Hilton Diamond.  Room was amazing with 1 1/2 bathrooms, a large living room and jet tub.  The club lounge was fantastic.  Lounge attendants Fenny and Sarah were fantastic.  Especially Fenny, who provided that extra special warmth and touch to make us feel even more welcome.  The hotel is connected to the Sands Cotai Central casino and shopping center with many things to do for everyone, including free character photos and parade with Po, Shrek, Boots, Madagascar, and Fiona.

"While I start to write I am sitting in a suite room of conrad macau itself.    Excellent part -   room size and upkeep Few great servicing individuals like -  Achin and Tyra at exec lounge and gentlemen who checked us in -  forgetting his name and Jim at restro grand orbit,  casino downstairs and part of cotai Sands connected to venetian and parasian from level 2 in mall.  And yup also Ricky and Stephen at concierge and Edmund prior to our visit   Good part - upgraded to suite as a diamond member of honors   Poor and arrogance -  when you travel with an infant 18 months old you need some flexibility.  Which this place lacks big time -  comparably I am just coming from conrad Hong Kong and I can't mention how different in a good way and service standards were set by management of…",20
"No wonder Conrad Macao is rated as the best hotel in Macao. Any 5-star hotel you would expect the room to be of superior fit and finish and it's no different at Conrad. But this Hotel surpasses in the quality of their Service.  From the time of check-in till check-out, all requests, proactive gestures and what not. Undoubtedly the best stay so far in South-East Asia.  Special shoot out to the Concierge Guest Relations Officer - SOFEA. Keep up the amazing work.",50
"The staff at Conrad Macao really go all out to make sure that their guests are comfortable. We were personally ushered to check-in in their Executive Lounge from the ground floor lobby. When we checked into our non-smoking room, there was a definite stale cigarette smell. A phone call and about 30 minutes later, we were swapped into a clean room.   Unfortunately due to the nature of the Sands Cotai Complex and it's in house casinos, the whole place reeks of cigarette smell especially from their clientele's clothing. The smell lingers especially in the public areas and guests are seen blatantly ignoring the non-smoking room.   Of all the hotels there, Conrad has probably the most ""smoke-free"" environment. The main smoke gauntlet that we had to run was between the lifts and the…",40
"Convenient location, nice room & staff & good aerobic room. The pools were scattered and small. Sufficient for a dip but not for a swim. Nice health club albeit lacking windows. The suites are fantastic and huge. That said, free upgrade would help. In this competitive day and age, it is still a good bang for your bucks. The food court downstairs has it all. Hasta Mañana.",40
"I am Hilton Diamond and have stayed at many Conrads and Waldorf''s.  We travel far to go to Macau in large part because we love the hotel, our upgraded room, the magnificent staff, the executive lounge and the wonderful food (both Asian and Western).  It is probably our favorite hotel on the planet.  The only small negative is not specific to hotel; namely, my wife and I are dancers and we find the music/dance scene limited in Macau.",50
"I visit every year this hotel once or twice.  My friends ask.  ' Why do you visit so often?  Are you a gambler? '  but I said  ' No, I do not like gambling. just...  This is one of the best hotels I have ever visited. '  This hotel offers private hotel-class service, Las Ventanas al Paraiso is not envious I do not fuss with upgrades, and I've never seen anything that disturbed my guests. The hotel has a concierge, desk, swimming pool, restaurant ... service and kindness are the best.   If one day you show them a kind smile, they can give you a lounge. maybe...  The lounge crew is really impressed. Thanks frand & emman.   The reason I go to this hotel is the crew are really like my family. who cleaned my room for seven days? I lost his name..

"If you are looking for a luxury hotel with true 5 star service when in Macau  then the Conrad is the place. The hotel is part of the casino and shopping complex which gives you easy access to all the amenities of a  mini Las Vegas. You can also use the ferry terminal at Cotai is only a 10 minute ride away and there is a shuttle. The ferries take you to either  Kowloon or straight to the airport. If you want to see the Macau old town it is only a 10 minute taxi ride away. The rooms are big which are unusual for Asian countries and they all have a great view over the area. There is a good and big pool area with lots of space as well as a Spa with reasonable prices and excellent service. The executive lounge is big and extends to both sides of the hotel, they have a great afternoon…",50
"This place is amazing.  I wish I had stayed a little longer.  The Conrad lives up to it's very well earned reputation as a first class hotel.  The service and amenities surpassed my expectations. There are a number of pools to choose from and casinos galore. When you alight from the ferry don't be tempted by the myriad of cabs and Limos at the entrance, there are lots of free shuttle buses if you walk out a little further.",40
"Stayed here with the family for a long weekend. We booked a suite to accommodate the four of us. Check in staff were good, unfortunately we had to switch rooms a few times as it seems like folks ignore the ""no smoking"" policy. The staff were very apologetic about the room changes and ended up providing a free fruit platter. Nice central location on the cotai side. It has all of the features and level of service you would expect from a conrad in Asia. Here's a tip, buy your ferry tickets at conrad counter before you leave, just incase they run out of seats back to Hong Kong....",40
"I've visited more than 50 cities all over the world, this hotel was the most impressive. First of all, staffs are very friendly and helpful. And the hotel room and facility were also great. I would like to visit Macau for staying Conrad Macau. It was my best stay.",50
"Getting there from Hong Kong is quick.  I used the Macau Ferry Terminal from HK which has a better schedule than the Taipa Ferry.  Once you exit the Macau Ferry Terminal, turn left and walk towards the shuttle bus area.  There are usually 2 buses for this hotel waiting.    The shuttle will drop you off at the Holiday Inn entrance, walk down the long passage and turn left until you see the Conrad Lobby.  This is where the amazing experience began.  I went to check-in.  Was assisted by Mr Eric.  He upgraded me as a Diamond Member to room that was as large as an apartment.  A seperate bedroom, lounge, dining room, 2 bathrooms and a closet.  My family was extremely comfortable.  Mr Eric walked me personally to my room and made arrangements for my lounge access.  I was impressed from…",50
"Since year 2014, my family and i stay here during the Christmas holiday. Although, we just stay one  night (26 Dec) in here, but it is still memorable for us. With the help from Mandy, the check-in is smooth and quick. She also provide us some information for the Light Festival. That's what we want.  When we arrive to our room, our old friend - rubber duck is already waiting for us. Also, the Christmas Tree cookies is ready on the small desk. After we have had the lunch, suddenly the door bell ring. While i am still in doubt for opening the door, a staff (forgive me, i react slow and forgive the name of staff) hold a plate of chocolate in front of me. It is really surprise me, of course my two kids too. It shows a warmest greeting. My family and I love it very much since it is…",50
"This review is way overdue considering I've already stayed at this hotel several times.  With that being said, it was only very recently that I realized Conrad Macao is ranked #1 on TripAdvisor for hotels in Macau.  But really, if you've had an opportunity to stay on this property, you'll definitely see that this number one ranking is more than well-deserved.  This is a hotel that makes you feel like home.  The customer service and experience at this hotel cannot be described by words alone - you have to experience it.  In my case, the awesome staffs at Conrad Macao knows that I'm an avid bear collector, especially when Conrad Macau's known for having seasonal limited edition bears.  I'm especially partial to the pink bears from breast cancer awareness month.  However, as they…",50
"We stayed here as a couple last month. The rooms are extremely clean and the hotel is large, with many facilities.   The room itself is beautifully designed, with a lovely round sofa in the basic rooms and a very comfortable bed. The shower and bathroom are perfect - a great stay!  The only thing to note is that room service is extremely expensive, and there are almost no shops nearby. 60 MOP for a drink - bring your own before you get here!",50
"This hotel is situated right across the Venetian and four seasons hotel. It is just the perfect location, to stay away from the very crowded zones especially the Venetian. The rooms are extremely spacious, new and clean. The staff really slayed all the details. They have a lovely bar/afternoon tea area in the lobby. I would definitely return. ",50
" My husband and I stayed here as part of our honeymoon and had a very romantic and relaxing stay. The staff at the Conrad went to so much trouble to make sure he had am enjoyable time,they made us a delicious cheesecake to celebrate our honeymoon, as well as giving us a free upgrade and late checkout. We also used the Conrad health club while we where there which was stunning, the facilities are world class and after burning off some of those Portuguese tarts at the gym it was nice to be able to relax in the pool. The staff at the health club found out it was our honeymoon even made up   a  heartwarming letter wishing us a good stay and many years of joy and happiness.  I found this luxurious hotel on Trip advisor noting the vast number of excellent  reviews, however I must say…",50
"Couldn't wait to immediately review this fabulous stay . Hotel to me is not the brick and mortar structure but the warmth and personal attention it exudes to humble traveler like me to whom family is everything. As Hilton Honor gold member I was expecting normal privileges but boy oh boy .. did Diana Brewer and her super Conrad lounge team step out to make things special !!! Edmund Tan , Alva , Sarah and Janice all and I mean all of them were outstanding in their service .  Upgraded in 100% packed hotel on new year eve for 2 nights to their Club Suite facing Parisian Eiffel Tower and then helping us with dinner reservations , shows , ferry tickets , everything was just too good .  The hotel is conveniently located opposite to Venetian in Cotai strip and has easy access to…",50
"This is our 2nd stay at Conrad Macau. The first time we stayed there was December 2014.    I was very surprised that about 4 days before my arrival, I received an email from Concierge (Mr. Tan) to welcome me and wanting to assist me in my arrival such as transportation, spa appointments and reservations to shows or dining.  Mr. Tan & his colleague Ms.Yin were extremely helpful.  As we were traveling from HK on turbojet ferries mid morning, I had requested that they help to notify reservation team so perhaps we would be able to get the room earlier. In addition, I requested their help to book my spa treatment as well as dining reservation.   When we arrived, the receptionist lady (Ms. Vanessa) was very efficient in locating a room for us. Due to the holidays, the Hotel was quite…",50
"Took free shuttle bus from Taipa Ferry to Sands Cotai Central, found Conrad's lobby and check after initially walked through the wrong door at Holiday Inn.  Check in staff was efficient and friendly, although the nit-picking side of me would hope the staff to have not asked whether it was our first stay at Conrad (it was), but instead promptly checked themselves and offered first-time guests say a tour of the facilities and rooms etc. We appreciate them honouring the requests for a room on high floors and not too close to the lifts, and the offer for a 1pm late check-out.  It was also a nice gesture for them to send an associate with us and escort us to our room, and whom subsequently went over the room features, although it would be nicer if she'd pointed out there was a large…",40
"It is our first time in Macau which has a taste of Las Vegas. Huge shopping centers and anonymity everywhere. Not so at Conrad. Not at the front desk, Lobby Dining, Concierge, Gym or Spa. The staff are very nice, open minded, taking care and observant. Congratulation! Rooms are nice, big, well equipped and cosy. Just... there is not much drinking water in the room. A point that means nothing.  Try the Spa, and the Lobby Dining. Good! And don't forget to see old Macau and its living streets. After you have visited Macau town, you will enjoy again the welcome at Conrad, or simple, use the Gym, what else I could mention.... everything is perfect. ",50
"Great hotel and amazing rooms. They were very kind to upgrade me to a suite which was absolutely amazing!!   Nice modern and spacious rooms, huge bathroom with shower and a separate bath.  Unfortunately had to leave early and did not get a chance to sample the breakfast.  Staff were friendly and helpful.",50
"I stayed here with my husband for two nights for a short getaway during year end, and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the benefits they have here. From the chief concierge Edmund Tan's helpful email few weeks before (which really was useful!) and the service of his team (thank you Pedro and Ivan for taking good care of us!) I couldn't be happier about this stay. As a Hilton diamond member, we were upgraded to a deluxe suite. Edmund was extremely helpful and always replied to any inquiries in a prompt and efficient manner - I'm not a great fan of Macau but I'd come back for the service & the Conrad bears! ",50
the service of the hotel is good. our room was upgraded to a luxury one with handy phone.  handy phone is extremely useful for us to bring out as hotspot for wifi as well as all the information we need for travelling.,40
"Our first time staying in Conrad Macao.  Conrad is at the heart of Cotai Strip, one of the hotel towers in Cotai Sands.  So the location is perfect if you like to experience the exciting and glamorous side of Macao.  The property, which is about 6 years old, is largely well maintained.  Spacious room with good features, such as the ""handy"" (a free mobile phone with free internet and free international calls to selected destinations) per room.  This is very thoughtful to provide the gadget to staying guests.  Gym opens all day and there is a heated pool, which is good for winter days.    Friendly and helpful staff.  Miss Sue helped us to do the check-in.  She was very professional in introducing us the facilities of the hotel and able to answer us our questions swiftly.  She made…",50

"This is quite a nicely appointed property with comfortable and tasteful appointments although I wished for the rooms to have been more reflective of the local Macau motif. More importantly I was impressed by the demeanor and friendliness of Isac Pakan, the Front Office Guest Relations Officer, and Vanessa Wong, Head of Front Office.",40
"We arrived early so The room wasn´t ready but after à tour in old Macau it was ready and we where upgraded from à 142 sqm suite to à Conrad Suite and the lounge manager told us that we will love the suite and we did.

"We stay regularly and it is probably my favorite Asian hotel - even though it is in a gambling complex and we don't gamble.  A few admittedly picky observations  1. Western food standard at breakfast is in unacceptable decline. Bacon like strips of PVC and pork sausage verging on stewed. Anchor butter is a non runner at this standard - especially as they previously served Isigny.  2. Chinese offerings are great - although they did produce a truly shocking pumpkin congee.  3. Lack of International Newspapers. At weekends where was The New York Times and The Financial Times? 4. Lack of connectivity to TV's in bedrooms. Set up makes use of own PC, USB, iPad etc impossible. And the sound from the unbranded TVs' own speakers is terrible. 5. Locked mini bar in suites. Is that normal?…",40
"My wife and I stayed at the Conrad as part of a quick one night stay in Macau. We were greeted warmly at reception, as is always the case at a Hilton property.   The concierge and staff treated us like royalty from the moment we stepped onto the property. The suite was magnificent and not a single detail was missed to make our stay perfectly comfortable.  In fact, the service was so phenomenal that we are planning to return to Macau with friends just so that we can stay at the Conrad again!  If you're a Hilton Honors member, this is a fantastic property to stay at. If you're not an HH member, the Conrad in Macau will make you want to sign up ASAP!    ",50
I have left a comment in trip advisor yesterday   All team members that I came across was great and very helpful.   I would like to thank the front office team for the best service that have let me experienced in Conrad Macao ,50
"My wife and I traveled together for the first time after our marriage, 18 months ago and it couldn't have been better.  Hotel offers an amazing experience. The staff is absolutely warm. When we mentioned this was our first trip as a couple, the staff wanted us to have a feel of a ""honeymoon"" and sent over some cake and delights.  Connectivity between the major shopping centers is amazing - you can just walk from one to the other.  Of course, the rooms are sublime...",50
"I would like to say that I have had the best time and experience in Conrad Macao, and the upgrade that I received was a surprise, as I did not expect to receive an upgrade to a suite. I was told at the check-in that I have been upgraded to a room in executive floor and I was very happy and thank the front office supervisor and once I get in to the room I was speechless for the room that I have received just for a night, I wish that I could stay longer then one night. But I did not use the tea time and happy hour at the executive lounge, as I was too busy on exploring the city of Taipa, Macao, how ever I did use the executive lounge for breakfast, and I would like to say that the breakfast experience was absolutely amazing. Same time I would like to say that the lobby lounge bar…",50
We stayed one night last week.The location is convenient to anywhere. The room is clean and comfortable. For a HHonors member is good. You can stay three more hours. The view of the room is good. The restaurant's food is pretty  good. ,50
"I stayed there for 3 nights and it was great especially to the first person I met there - Isac at the reception when I checked in. He was kind, considerate and welcoming. He asked our plan for the day, then provided proper information about important spot, transportation and hotel guide in Korean. It was my first visit to Macao and he was the first person I met there. He made first impression of Macao almost perfect.    I also would like to appreciate all the services Conrad provided. It was the most comfortable and pleasant hotel experience. Your service was very considerate but never too much.     When I visit Macao again, I will definitely choose Conrad again.",50
"Had a trouble free weekend stay here recently. This property is typical of many that have sprung up in Macau in recent years: large, functional, but soulless. Location is sandwiched between the other similar hotels that are along this part of the Cotai strip. Rooms were large and comfortable but the decor was rather tacky and although the hotel is still relatively new it felt dated. The usual noise problems with Chinese guests screaming at each other in nearby rooms (common in every hotel in Macau). Check in and check out staff were great but otherwise no real service to speak of - most likely you will not speak to another staff member, like many Macau hotels this place is about getting large numbers of people in and out quickly, it's very impersonal.  Overall perfectly…",40
"Upon check in , the lady was very friendly (sorry didn't get the name!). She walked us all the way to our room to find out we had an upgrade (Diamond member) to our room along with a couple of their cute little bears!  Very nice hotel. The room was very roomy and clean! The hotel is connected to 3 other hotels including the Ritz, Holiday Inn, and Sheraton. It can get a little confusing where to go to get back to your room, but not too bad.  Thanks for an awesome stay!",50
You cant complain about anything at the Conrad. The service is outstanding. The rooms very comfortable. These people go way out to make your stay memorable .Great view and access to Casinos and shopping.,50
"I had a wonderful stay at the Conrad Macao. I was upgraded to a suite and it was spacious, about 1000 sq ft. Very well maintained hotel and if you like a little bit of peace but still close to all the action, this place is ideal. Service was excellent from at the check-in and lounge.",50

The staff was some of the best we have come across in our travels! We enjoyed the pool as there were unheated & heated pools! We also liked that the casino was not in the middle of the hotel....it could be completely avoided if you wished & unlike some of the other larger hotels, it wasn't noisy. The wait time during peak hours for a taxi was long but just allow extra time when going to dinner. Were we to return to Macau, we would definitely stay here again.",50
We stayed at the Conrad hotel. The best hotel in Macau. The service was beyond our expectations. Would definitely stay here again. We were upgraded to a suite room because it was our anniversary. We were spoiled. ,50
"I came from Australia to have four day break from my hectic business life. I been with Hilton/ Conrad for 29 years, been Diamond member for a long time. I stay at this hotel because of the lovely and friendly staff. As I travel most of the time alone (98percent) I have few staff that became my friend and I follwed them from other hotel to Macau. I have been stayed in this property since they opened in Macao . I normally visit here around 6 times a year. Next month my husband is coming with me as this is one of his favourite property, because of very friendly staff and the weather . They always ask us why Macao? We don't gamble? But we love it here, I don't drink either hahahaha. I am cheap to keep. Tomorrow is my last day and I will could not wait for next mont. I will be…",40
It's a 2 out of 10 five star hotel. The Wynn Palace being the benchmark as a 10/10 five star hotel. Rooms not hi tech enough. Wifi drops off often as one moves through the property. Decor is fine but not magnificient. Hotel has a dark feel. ,40
"Super cozy hotel but lacking in some ways.   Pros:  • 5-star service! • Very comfortable, luxurious room • The room was incredibly quiet, felt like the walls were soundproof • Temperature was very easy to control and never felt humid • Buffet breakfast was pricey but one of the best I've had  Cons: • Wifi was so poor, around 2Mbps and only maintained connection in certain areas of room • The view was disappointing, but that's probably just the room I was in (there was a barricade blocking the bottom section of the window) • Location was ok • Pool area was plain in comparison to other hotel pools in Cotai  So overall I liked this hotel but didn't love it. If I was to return to Cotai I would try staying in one of the six hotels attached to Galaxy. There's a water park area that…",40
"We stayed for one night in November and found that there was plenty to like about the hotel but it had negatives too. The common parts are nice and bar in the lobby managed to be cosier and more intimate than many equivalent bars in rival hotels. The swimming pool area was underwhelming - it consists of 4 little pools none of which are really big enough to do any actual swimming in! The rooms were nicely decorated, clean and comfortable. The hotel is very much part of a complex and this is always apparent at ground floor, in contrast to the Mandarin or Four Seasons which manage to seem separate and self-contained from the casinos, shops etc. We had read good things about the breakfast at the Grand Orbit but didn't realise that you had to leave the hotel and go and find it in a…",40
"We spent 3 days at Conrad Hotel and were very happy with our choice.  Before our arrival, the hotel staff contacted us and asked if we have any special requests.  We have stayed at several 5 stars hotels and while most hotels have comfortable rooms, great facilities and good breakfast, it is the service that makes the difference.  Conrad staff provides really excellent service.       At Conrad you really feel welcomed all the time.  I would like to say thanks to the pool staff Geraldine ( I hope I have her name right).  She was very attentive and friendly, we were really spoiled by her.  All the other staff were great too but we didn't have much interaction and I unfortunately didn't remember their names.      The breakfast is served at Grand Orbit which is located outside the…",50
"I am writing as HH member so my review would mainly focus on the services received in club lounge.  I wanted to thank you Ivan, Sarah, Gallant, Fanny, and Tyra for making us feel welcomed.  From check in to check out, we were addressed by our names even from staff that we didn't meet personally.  Every morning, I would drink lemon water so I ask for tons of lemon slice and press the juice out with a spoon.  One morning, I asked Gallant if I could have more lemon slices and he brought me freshly squeezed lemon juice.  It is this type of thoughtfulness that puts Conrad above the rest.  One night after cocktail, I casually said goodbye to Sarah (I hope I remembered her name correctly) and I said see you tomorrow and she responded you are checking out tomorrow.  I said yes but we…",50
Enjoyed our stay here. A great hotel in close walking distance to other attractions and casinos. Friendly staff and classy comfortable rooms.  Nice lobby bar with a good snack menu. Will certainly stay here again. Thanks,40
"We spent a week end in Macau and we have been lucky to book the Conrad hotel in Cotai. The hotel offer very nice and very clean rooms, decoration has been done with taste, and you do not feel to be in Disneyland like the others hotels around. The service is top quality and they make you feel at home. Thanks for the kindness of all the staff",50
"Fantastic hotel with super helpful staff, large clean rooms with lots of little surprises and great attention to detail, wonderful pool and spa.  There was no wait at check in and in my opinion, a much better hotel experience than The Venetian which I stayed at a year prior.   Strongly recommend a stay at Conrad in Macau. ",50
"I highly recommend this hotel- service is exceptional, suites are extremely spacious and luxurious without being glitzy or tacky, and the location is perfect as the focal point around which to explore the attractions of the Cotai Strip. This was our third visit to Macau, but our first stay at Conrad, and we just loved it. The only negative was the musty odour went entering the room- but a few judicious sprays of Shanghai Tang room fragrance soon set that right.",50
"Good all round services with a spa, in-hotel restaurants and shopping just downstairs.  Near the Parisian complex which is newly opened.  Good shuttle buses to the Mainland and Ferry piers.  The location is in Cotai, which is not too far from sights at Taipa or Coloane, but may require a longer trip to the Macau Peninsula.  With the shuttle buses it is not difficult to reach most sightseeing spots.  The breakfast is not cheap at $200+ per head inside the hotel, but other inexpensive eateries are close by in a food court, or McDonald's.",50
"I stayed here for the second time. My first time was few years ago. I really like the Suite. Suite is large and functional. There has separate living room and bedroom. Another separate for television room(very nice). Bathroom is large with a hug bathtub which is i really like it. Room amenities such as slipper bathrobe toiletries are good quality and presentable. I really like how they put a teddy bear on the bed, rubber duck on the bathtub and chocolate on sofa table. It shows they pay attention to every little details to make guest stay even more memorable. I celebrate my Birthday last December, a gentlemen who check me in was recognised and very helpful.  Absolutely gonna come back!",50
"Highly recommend this hotel.  Excellent service from Conrad Club employees, Emman and Ivan.  Enjoyed every minute in this hotel - very comfortable room, great spa, good breakfast, afternoon tea and happy hour.  The hotel provided an upgrade from the standard room to a corner suite.  This is a very special experience.  Would definitely stay at this hotel when visit Macao next time.",50
"Conrad truly stands out amongst the St-Regis, Sheraton, Four Season and even Venetian within the same vicinity.  I would like to single out Amila for her exemplary service. She made an effort to highlight my existing Hilton membership and offered to upgrade my room.  Really glad to have made Conrad as my choice of stay in Macau.",50
"Consistent in their services and well-managed rooms and its overall condition. The suites are amazing - spacious and beautifully decorated. The buffet in Grand Orbit is good as well.... lots of food to choose from! My fave spot is the pool during sunset, while sipping cocktails or wine.",50
"Excellent service from checkin to check out.  Truly a 5 star hotel where they escort you to your room from checkin or out to the valet.  Housekeeping prompt and attentive.  Rooms are amazing and great views of the Parisian.  We stay at many 5 star hotels around the world, this is definately among the best.   The hallmark of 5 star service is knowing when the customer will need something even before they know they need it,  the Conrad fully delivers in this respect.   10 out 10 will stay here again.  The perfect hotel in the best location in Macau. ",50
"Very good services, tidy room, great breakfast place.  okay coffee at the restaurant.  Convenient shopping area, and nice food court with variety choices.  Good meeting rooms and great staff services for company meetings.  Excellent coffee break with yummy food and great coffee.",50
"I chose Conrad Macau because the overall comment on the internet is very high. I did have a high expectation to visit the hotel but….  We checked in at 3:05pm which was advised by the hotel that the room should be ready after 3pm. However, their staff told us we had to wait for another half an hour because our room was not ready?? We booked a Junior Suite which I believed this type of room shouldn't be that popular. I don't understand why it wasn't ready yet. After complaining to their manager, we then were offered to change another room. He said they ""upgraded"" us. But we found out it was still the same type of room but the only difference was ""1 King bed"" vs ""2 twin beds""???? I don't care about the upgrade. It made me surprised that the international hotel like Conrad couldn't…",20
"the staffs are very nice, rooms very tidy and grand; have some souvenir for guest, we like very much; coffee is very delicious and have enough water supply in the room. swimming pool is very good for warm water in autumn. Fast check out can help me to keep the luggage is very nice.",50
"I have stayed in Conrad for over 7 times in the last 3 years. It remains to be one of the hotels offering top notch service from check in to check out. Room is spacious. Their cute Conrad bear and duck have been nice welcoming toys. Their satin slipper are very nice and comfortable. As a silver member , they surprised me by offering a birthday cake . Thank you Renee and the staff who arranged this ",50
"This hotel is fab! Lovely rooms which are very large and clean. The bed is super comfy. The bathroom is large, separate bath and shower with plenty of toiletries. There is even a TV at the end of the bath! The pool area is nice (hot and cold pools and jacuzzi). The gym is good and the health club changing rooms have sauna and steam rooms. The hotel is conveniently located to the rest of the 'Taipa Strip'. Breakfast was average (in a tired Chinese restaurant) so don't bother if it isn't included. Staff were all very friendly and accommodating, especially the front of house staff. We stayed for our wedding anniversary and the hotel made it extra special which was lovely. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.",50
"I spent 2 nights at there for my vacation. As it is connected to Venetian, I was able to access Casinos and shopping spots easily. Foods served at breakfast was fine, a little bit hard to find at first time. Even though there are lots of new luxury hotels in Macau,  but I think it is still one of the best hotel - Staffs, rooms, location.",40
"Rooms are spacious Lack a bit of charm but efficient Pool is disappointing  Restaurant and breakfast are ok Service was very good, especially the front desk was very helpful when we looked for direction Overall a nice stay  ",40
"Excellent rooms. awesome bathroom, cushy bed room slippers. great room service. Friendly, attentive, thoughtful, dedicated, exceptional concierge. I would like to extend to thanks to Edmund Tan, Michell tan and stephen for their help and making our stay such a comfortable and pleasant one.",50
This Conrad is not the newest or fanciest but still puts up a good fight.  The lobby arrangement is odd with the check in on one side and the elevators tucked away behind the lobby lounge. The moment you walk in you can tell that this wasn't really designed to be a hotel first property.  It's nice but dated.  Same with the rooms.  Still in the top tier of hotel rooms globally but when compared to many posh new local hotels you can tell the difference.  The rooms are well kept and comfortable. but plumbing is a problem. The shower is constantly jumping from hot to cold to hot.  Normally it's bad when you flush your own room's toilet and it affects the shower but I think all the rooms affect the other rooms as well.  Taking a shower was a constantly unpleasant experience during my…,40
"Overall a pleasant stay at the Conrad. Standout was the service, the staff are always willing to help and check in and out was efficient and friendly. Many staff always looking to help.  Location is good amongst the Cotai strip. The rooms are large, well designed and spacious.   I did not try breakfast or check out the pool this time. That's for next time.",50
"The hotel was very good except for the odor of smoking. Although our room was a non-smoking room but the bad smell of cigarette was existing throughour the room. Anyway, service, location and cleaness were so excellent that we would visit again when we go to Macau next time.",40
"I have lived in Hong Kong for almost two years now but my first trip to Macau was in 2011. To say I was not impressed would be generous. I am from the US and have been to Vegas at least 25 times so maybe my expectations were too high, however all that changed after my last trip when I stayed at the Conrad. I am still not a fan of gambling at any of the Macau casinos, and most likely never will be compared to Vegas where I rarely leave the tables so I had to be talked into returning. It helps that I stayed with a friend of mine who is a Hilton Diamond member so we were greeted upon arrival by the hotel manager and a guest service manager. We were immediately taken to our suite where we signed everything and were briefed about the hotel amenities etc. The room was absolutely…",50
"Everything was perfect! Checked in by Ms. Mai(Thai lady), she was so professional and flexible for our requests, and explained their facility, escorted to the lounge and our room, she took care of our stay until check out, not only check in! I would like to come back to just see her again! Mai chan Arigato----!  Also guest relation officer at the lounge, Mr. Gallent was so friendly, I had a wonderful time there with his fantastic support. Definitely I'll be back very soon!",50
"We recently stayed four nights at the Conrad Macau having stayed with them two years previously.  As diamond Hilton members we were again welcomed with first class service by all.  They now have a dedicated executive lounge and we were checked in there, given a welcome drink and personally escorted to our magnificent suite.  Conrad Macau are number 1 and they deserve this honour.  There are not enough superlatives to describe the wonderful staff.  I believe this sort of staff culture starts at the very top with management seeming to pick and train some exceptional people.  They should perhaps pass on a few tips to Conrad Beijing, but that's another story!  If you are a diamond member and visiting Macau this is the only place to stay.  We have visited Hiltons all over the world…",50
"I stayed wifh my family for 4 nights in Conrad Macau and cannot forget the fantastic memory. This trip was for the first birthday party of my daughter and I need a lot of things to prepare. All staff, from room service to club lounge, were very nice and they were trying to help me to prepare all the things for the 1st birthday party of my daughter. I will definitely stay again in Conrad Macau and want to recommend to others.",50
We enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The rooms were very clean and nice. Bathrooms were superb. The ambience also was very relaxing. We were even surprised when they delivered complimentary birthday cake for my mom. No regrets for staying at this hotel. Kudos to staffs for the great service!,50
"Which word is the best? Maybe Fabulous, wonderful, Amazing.  I stayed at Conrad macao 2times. And latest time was with my mom and sister.  They were surprised from huge and luxurious lobby first and warm welcoming from front office.  Since I'm a Hhonors Diamond member,i checked-in at club lounge located on 39th floor. Durinh the check-in , Pink ribon campaign styled welcome drinks were served and actually it was pretty amazing.   The best thing is for conrad macao club lounge team, they were very smooth in processing for check-in and tried to assist as much as they can for my day tour in macao . Their assist was pretty helpful .   When we enter our room, we were surpised again! That we got upgraded to Two Twin Queen sized bed Deluxe Suite room with city view.  Its absolutley…",50
Friendly and polite staff and the check-in process was done smoothly and efficiently. The room is at high quality with Nespresso machine installed and they also provides turndown service putting the signature Conrad bear on my bed. I wish I could have spent a little bit more time there.,50
"This was my first stay at a Conrad; I used Hilton points for the stay and was not disappointed. Finding the hotel from the ferry shuttle was a bit challenging, but we made it. What stood out to us was the incredible service; coming from the mainland, this was a stark contrast. English was widely spoken and staff went out of their way to accommodate our needs. Emman was a particularly helpful staff member who helped us get checked in. As Hilton Diamond, we were given an upgrade to a King Suite even though the hotel was fully sold out. (We had requested this via email at the time of booking). We were traveling with children, so the fact that the suite did not have a partition between the bedroom and living room was a little disappointing. I mentioned it to the staff and they said…",50
"We stayed two nights at this great hotel. Being a Diamond member, we were upgraded to a very nice suite, with Executive Lounge privileges, and received a very nice fruit basket as a welcoming gift. Later, they even gave me two very nice Conrad duckies for my grandkids.  The hotel is beautiful and luxurious, the rooms spacious and the large bathroom and amenities great, the staff very friendly, attentive and helpful, and all the Executive Lounge and restaurant foods were excellent.",50
"Casinos aside, the property and management itself is what it's supposed to be - Great quality, well taken of facilities and details that make a difference.   We booked direct through the company website and stayed in the deluxe king room. The room had a stylish, modern yet comfy design, a good balance between the luxury and hype of Macau as well as being able to offer a pleasant environment for winding down. Room was spacious and thoughtful with little complimentary welcome gifts upon arrival and after the winding down services. Does make you feel like they made efforts on it to stand out. Notable are the bath soap, shower gel and cream, aromatherapy associates branded. Staff had good language skills and offered additional help if needed. You will be away from the other more…",50
"One of the better hotels in Taipa. Feels like a proper hotel as opposed to a casino hotel. Great lobby, attentive staff and rooms were clean and modern. Internet speed fantastic. Staff were very accommodating and the shoe shine service I loved. Fitness centre and pools are great. A very good business hotel with not too many families.",50
"This is one of several hotels that are based around a cereal shopping mall and facility at Cotai Sands. Great service, great food and really good conference facilities. The quality and quantity of food offered at a recent conference that I attended was probably the best that I ever experienced. ",50
"Hubbie & I had just flown in from Bangkok to have our first experience of Macau and the Conrad Cotai Central.  After our quick transfer, we were warmly greeted by our Porter, Neuwen who showed us to the 39th Floor and the Executive Lounge where we were booked in as Hilton members.  We were very kindly given an upgrade (always subject to availability and you must book with the hotel direct for this) to a corner Junior deluxe suite, complete with the ""Conrad Bear & rubber duck!"".  Neuwen showed us around what essentially was the equivalent size of a one bedroom flat in the UK, with a separate TV room and a bathroom that could house another family!!! We were bowled over to say the least and it was absolutely spotless.  Moving onto the Executive Lounge, we met our host Staff;…",50
"We stayed at the Conrad with my family during our visit to Macau. We loved the friendly service and English-speaking staff members (with special mention to Alva from reception and Erica from the Hotel Cafe). Noting none of us spoke any Chinese, the reception team gave us a card with the famous Macau spots so we can point to the cab drivers the places we wanted to visit.   The hotel smells of freshness and the rooms are very clean and spacious. All the other hotels are accessible from the Conrad as there is a covered walkway to the Parisian and the Venetian.   The service crew was very attentive, patient and responsive. We enjoyed our stay very much!",50
"My family and I had a wonderful stay at Conrad Macau. We had originally stayed at the Conrad Chicago and were impressed with the amenities it had to offer, such as the wonderful pillow menu.   We arrived at the Macau airport and the shuttle was easy to find. It wasn't the warmest greeting at the shuttle area at the airport as we were required to put our own luggage into the shuttle bus and there was no one there that spoke English.   We get to the Conrad hotel and were immediately helped by the bell boy with our luggage into the front desk area. At first we had a young man start our check in process but there seemed to be a little bit of a language barrier so we were assisted by Alva. She spoke great English and was super friendly. Our reservation was a little complicated as we…",50
"First time in Macau, it was a great hotel overall. When you first enter the lobby the ambience overwhelms you. Service was very nice and attentive. Spacious room with great view. Great gym staff members, unfortunately I forgot his name! Wayne? He was there on 18th Sept 16, evening closing the gym, he is such a nice guy. All staff members were very friendly. Location wise it is connected to Venetian hotel and close to new Parisian hotel. Bodhi spa was also very nice. Also my partner received a welcome conrad teddy bear at the turn down service, and she loved it 😀",50
"WE LOVE CONRAD!   Spent our anniversary at Conrad on 31 Aug for a night, which was unfortunately not enough. The room is spacious and very comfy, was kinda reluctant to even leave the room.   The whole stay was made special by Alva and her team. Elvis was very prompt with all our pre-stay enquiries over the email. Alva made us feel so welcomed the whole trip, she is very patient and gave us lots of tips to travel around Macau. We receive an anniversary cake with a handwritten card, which was so sweet of them.   We will definitely go back to Conrad again the next time we are heading to Macau.",50
"I was in Macao for one night only. I got to the hotel by the free shuttle they offer from the ferry terminal at 10am and the lady who checked me in was kind enough to give me an upgrade to a suite (for being a diamond member on HHonors) and an early check-in, on a smoking room though.   During check-in, I was able to buy a SIM CARD at the Concierge to use internet on my phone for HKD100. The front desk lady took me personally to my suite, which was very nice!  The suite is huge, big living room, one spacious bedroom and an equally big bathroom. Kind of modern decor, but many luxury amenities, as well as a bath robe.  I ordered breakfast from room service, which was also tasty and for a decent price.  At night I went to the Grand Club to do some work, and although the cocktail…",50
"The Conrad provided a very high level of service and comfort. Would recommend to stay definitely. As a first time visitor to Macau, I loved the accommodation and the service was extremely high standard, very helpful and very friendly.",50
"My wife, 5 month-old son and I visited the Conrad during the mid-Autumn festival weekend. I should start by saying that we had stayed at Conrad New York before (and it was fantastic!) and so our expectations were sky high. And boy! Did they did deliver beyond all our expectations . 1. We told them that we were travelling with an infant only on the day of arrival. Yet, our room had a baby cot, baby bath tub, and even a steriliser as soon as we arrived. 2. We requested them for a room on the higher floor/good view and they agreed as they had one available. 3. Very clean room, excellent service. 4. Convenient location - 5 minute walk from the Parisian, Venetian. 5. Excellent breakfast buffet (ask for Grand Orbit) 6. Finally and most importantly, we want to thank Edmund and Galen at…",50
I am currently staying in the Conrad Macau for a brief getaway. I travel internationally for work each week and have never had such a poor experience. The check-in counter was poorly staffed (HHonors Desk) and the agent rarely spoke English. I had asked if any upgrades were available and he said he would look. He then mentioned none are available because I arrived too late. I had reserved the king deluxe city-view room and went to my room to find this was not correct. I then went up to the 39th floor club lounge to speak to the concierge. He proceeded to tell me the hotel had too many gold and diamond members to accommodate my request. I have never experienced a Hilton property mention that you needed to show up earlier for the upgrade.   This is certainly not the number 1 hotel…,10
"The hotel is in an amazing complex that seems to stretch for ever. I think there are four or five hotels that are connected by shopping malls and casinos. The rooms are well appointed and our room overlooked the new Parisian hotel. The staff have been very helpful and efficient, with the laundry patching up a small tear in my husbands jacket that we sent off to be dry cleaned. This jacket has been dry cleaned in hotels all around the world and no one has ever attempted to fix it. We were not charged any extra, for this service. These are the small details that have made staying in the Conrad a great experience.",40
"Sorry Conrad you are not a 5 Star Hotel.  The reviews here actually confuse me.  For a real 5 star hotel just walk on over to the Four Seasons, St. Regis, or Ritz. The over all rating should still a four but because everyone puts this a 5 I feel something odd is going on here. My family booked 2 rooms here on a Sunday based on reviews on this site and ranking of #1 Hotel in Macao.  When we showed up at the hotel at 5:30PM the rooms were not ready yet and was told we would need to wait.  I explained that we had plans for that evening and needed to get checked in to change and go to dinner and show.  So the rather nice attendant inquired if we would be open to a 'smoking room'... whereupon I said absolutely not.  After about 10 minutes they decided to upgrade us to a 1 bedroom…",20
"Arrived for a one night stay. Very kind staff, are willing to help. Especially notable is Alva from the reception which made sure our other hotel was ready for us. She was really amazing and made our experience even more wonderful.  Got upgraded to a huge suite while using points so definitely worth the stay. Regardless the hotel isn't that expensive on weekdays (when we booked it). ",50
"This truly is an amazing hotel! From the moment you check in to the moment you check out the service is impeccable. As a Hilton Gold member I was upgraded to an amazing suite with a great view. The room was huge with two bathrooms, a gigantic tub a rain shower and double sinks. The living room had a couch, dining table and chairs. The staff at the hotel was truly amazing. They were so helpful. The Executive lounge is also amazing in this hotel. If you come to Macau you should definitely stay here! The staff helped me book my ferry ticket, a tour of Macau, and provided me with some great recommendations of places to see during my stay. If I come back to Macau you know where I will be staying the Conrad!",50
"Just spent a long weekend here and found it incredibly relaxing.  I was a bit anxious before going as I thought that with it being in the centre of things it would be crowded and  far from relaxing, I was very wrong.  Lovely rooms, which are well fitted and very comfortable.  A nice swimming pool and really good gym.  Easy access to all sorts of entertainment and easy to find taxis - often rare in Macau - which can have you in the old town or country parks and beaches in no time.  All-in-all a great place to stay.",40
"My friend Eric and I stayed for one night just over the weekend and we got upgraded to a junior suite despite the late check in. The beds were big and ammenities were well equipped, not forgetting good service especially from their front desk reception.  Overall we had a great staycation and I wished we could have stayed on for one more night to check out their other complimentary services such as the steam bath etc.  Once again thanks for the complimentary upgrade!",50
It is a top line hotel. The rooms are spacious and well presented. The staff are excellent they went out of their way to assist at all times. If you like shopping there is access to 600 shops without going outside. The breakfast was the best we have had a very wide range of choice. Very modern. Easy access to other hotels nearby.,50
I had a great time in Macau and it was because of the hospitality treatment of Conrad Macau ...the staff was very very friendly and helpful and made my three days like a breeze...DEFINITELY Recommended to all ,50
"Checking-in at Cotai Conrad on weekday was bliss compared to 2-hour waiting time at Cotai Sheraton two weekends ago. Moreover Cotai Conrad reception's Isac greeted us with smiles in stark contrast to Cotai Sheraton's stressed out staff.   We reserved a suite and a deluxe room for the four of us. They put us on different floors which was alright. At least we did not have to wait 2 hours for our room like at Cotai Sheraton.   The suite was fine as you would expect, but the deluxe room and the floor's corridor smelled of smoke despite non-smoking floor designation. For those of us anxious to avoid other people's tobacco stench, this was disappointing for a hotel of Conrad's price and caliber.   Breakfast was served at a distinctly bland ""food hall"" looking restaurant called Grand…",40
"We stayed at this fantastic hotel which is located at the Cotai Strip in Macau for 2 nights. All the big casinos are located directly next the the Conrad, all in walking distance! Direct sky bridge with the Venetian Hotel. Just around the corner from the Hard Rock Cafe / Hotel.   The hotel is very nice and clean and makes a very nice impression from inside and outside. Shuttle bus service to the boarded and to the ferry terminal towards Hong Kong & HKG Airport. All the employees which I had contact with (front desk & lounge) were very helpful and super friendly! On my next trip to Macau, I already know which hotel I will choose! :-)  Thank you very much for such a great stay at your Conrad and hopefully see you soon again!",50

This is not my first time staying here and definitely not the last time.  Lodged in the deluxe room and it's spacious and very clean.  Nice view to the Cotai area and the service is good as well.  Need key card to go upstairs so feeling quite safe.,50
"We were greeted by Ms Yumi at reception   She was attentive to our booking and arranged a room for us without waiting too long....awesome service.  The deluxe room was spacious, enough for 3 guests. There was a small bottle of candy in the room for the guests.  On the 2nd day of our stay the hotel gave us a small cute doggie toy.  We will definitely choose to stay  this hotel on next visit.",50
"Located on the Cotai strip, this Conrad hotel was a lovely find.  A quiet, peaceful retreat amidst all of the brashness of the strip. The staff on the front desk were amazing - so helpful and polite.  It was our anniversary and we were well looked after - and even had a delicious cheesecake delivered to the room. The room was spacious, clean and very well appointed - lovely Aromatherapy Associates toiletries and a Nespresso machine.   Breakfast was good (though the restaurant was hard to find as it was in the mall and not the hotel - no signposting). Gym was well equipped - I was the only person in there using it. Pool was peaceful - only a few other people in there.  Only minor complaint about the pool area is that it is made up of several small pools rather than a length pool…",50
"Being a Hilton member, I was upgraded to a king suite. The suite is spacious and luxurious, with a view of Parisian. The bathroom is particularly impressive! The bathtub is so huge and the amenities are out of expectation. Service was good generally. Check-in and out were efficient without queue. It's definitely worth its price and I'll consider a return stay!",50
"I was upgraded to a suite, including lounge access during my 4-night stay. The suite was sumptuously appointed. I loved the coffee machine and the separate lounge to loll about. I took full use of the pool and gym which were terrific and I loved the location, a stone's throw away from the Venetian and other hotels.   But the best part was the service. I've stayed in my fair share of hotels yet I'd never experienced anything like it. The staff couldn't do enough to please, without being stuffy or pretentious. The wonderful Gallant and Catherine in the lounge are a credit to the establishment and made each day a great one. They clearly love their jobs and that shines through in their approach to customer service. Another gem was Sarah - she exuded warmth and hospitality and her…",50
"Even before we arrived we were treated well.   The welcome emails detailing check in ( we are Hilton diamond members so have a special lounge for check in and use throughout the day) were helpful and communications with the concierges via email were lovely.  .   The staff at this property was so welcoming and gracious.  We were celebrating our anniversary so the guest services rep sent us a delicious cake and made us a card with a photo she took of us.    So thoughtful!   The pool area is nice and cabanas are plentiful and for use without a charge.   The rooks was spacious, clean and the bed was very comfortable.     The location is perfect for experiencing Cotai.  Highly recommend.   ",50
This hotel is excellent. I stayed at the hotel for my birthday with my wife. The service is perfect. The staff is very nice. They provided a complimentary birthday cake for us. We arrived at 1300 hrs. They gave us an early check-in and also a late check-out until 1300 hrs the next day. Thank you for Conrad.,50
"My first time in Macau and certainly not my last,even if it is just so I get to stay at this hotel again. Right from the moment I checked in at the executive lounge to my departure the service from the staff was outstanding. Being a Hilton Diamond member I was upgraded to a luxurious suite which was appreciated. The Executive lounge team, and they work as a team are the best I have experienced in any hotel I have stayed. A credit to the hotel and the management. Outstanding location, with many top shopping and restaurant options located within the premises give you plenty of options, and of course a vast outdoor area with pools etc to relax and enjoy the excellent weather. Free shuttles from the airport and ferries make transport easy and convenient. Yes I did go to the casino,…",50
"The rooms and facilities at the Conrad are excellent, but what sets them apart is the customer service. From start to finish the staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly. We were looked after primarily by Ivan in the executive lounge, he is a credit to the hotel and showed hospitality I don't think I have seen anywhere else (and I have so far spent 130 nights in hotels this year!). A very enjoyable stay and I'm sure we'll be back.",50
"Another stay at the Conrad Macau and another fantastic experience. They just get everything right, every time.  On this occasion, we managed to lose a mobile phone in the lobby on arrival.  Sanjay and his security team left no stone unturned in trying to track it down, including reviewing the security footage.  Alas, the phone wasn't recovered but not for lack of trying!  As, usual, every single employee we interacted with was helpful, courteous and just a pleasure to deal with.  They all stand out but on this occasion, in addition to Sanjay, Ms. Cathryn Chen and the Executive Lounge team and Onuki-San at the Front Desk really went above and beyond to make our stay memorable.  Still Highly, highly recommended!",50
"My husband and I came for a short weekend and stayed at the Conrad.  This hotel is quite impressive.  We were upgraded to a King Suite and wow is all i can say.  I felt like we were high rollers.  The suite was so nice with huge bathroom, a great big living area and the bedroom was enormous.  I loved everything about the room.  The Lounge was also great!  I will stay here again!",50
"What a surprise to get upgraded to a suite. Huge room with two toilets, huge bathroom and living room. Nice Canapes, Chocolates and Champagne on arrival in the room! The ducky in the bathroom is a nice touch as well as the Teddy bear on the bed.",50
I and my wife were very impressed with the friendliness and helpfulness of all staff especially the hotel reception team who processed our check-in smoothly and helped us to purchase the Ferry tickets from Macau to Hong Kong International Airport. Very clean room with good view and good customer services. Shopping center nearby and walking distances to other Macao Cotai Central casinos. We would recommend this hotel very highly and will definitely to stay here again.,50
"Conrad provides us with a wonderful holiday. We were welcomed by the sweet amenities in room.. candies... child setup and also the welcome duckling which was of course loved by my little girl.   Not much people in the pool which get us even more relaxing time. The iced pineapple served in pool was another surprised.   Although there was a little hiccup in our breakfast order, it was handled promptly with good service recovery. Looking forward to visit this hotel again. ",40
"We recently hosted our Annual sales kick-off and sales training conference within the Cotai resort complex. Great meeting facilities, excellent catering, with an abundance of choice. The room and facilities were comfortable and with the complex being interlinked one really never had to venture outside into the stifling heat. With access to the outdoor pool, the Venetian piazza area and the various shops one is really spoilt for choice.",50
"I have been very impressed with the friendliness of all the staff especially the executive lounge team,Mr. Gallent who have been very kind and helpful, the highest level of satisfaction for their service and location. Great room facilities and customer service. I would recommend this establishment very highly.",50
"We stayed in Macau for a birthday weekend away, and as a Gold Hilton Honours member and celebrating a birthday we were very kindly upgraded to a gorgeous suite which really set the tone for the weekend. The room was stunning, the service was fantastic, particularly in the Executive Club Lounge, although I did think they could offer a little more variety in the Executive Lounge in regards to food on offer. The rest of the F&B options we didn't have a chance to try as we ate out in the old town.   The only down side, which is a design fault, is that the hotel pool gets minimal sun, however it is a pleasant space and I definitely recommend trying the fantastic spa, sauna and steam room areas of the gymnasium",50
"My Mom and I got the great service at Conrad, peaceful and thoughtful for anytime, when we were waiting for check in at the front desk, there are few kids playing around which maybe 7 or 8 years old, the receptionist was giving very nice drawing notes to them, because it helps to stop the kids to bother other guests and made kids feeling happy also. really appreciated how thoughful they are. And they well know how to help the customers to solve their needs. We want to see the Shrek show, they are not only give informations, very details to explains where to buy and provide referral card for discount. They are not only provide services to earn your money, they also earn your beloved. I am sure I will come again.",50
"I can move comfortably through the shuttle bus from the port. As a Diamond members, I had check in at the lounge and all staffs are very friendly in lounge. The food of the lounge was not high-level, but spacious and clean, My room was a suite, which was separated by a room and living room. Above all, swimming pool was fantastic. The water of pool was warm enough to swim in the evening. Room service was a little unsatisfied but all things considered, this luxurious hotel is acceptable. Especially, Ivan at the lounge had considered throughout my stays with his utmost, which led my family enjoy Macao!",50
"I really and personally would like to appreciate to Ms. Renee Chen-Si-Ran, Front Office Supervisor. Her kindness, knowledge and warm guide are unforgettable memory and experience to me. Her wonderful heart to listen my difficulty and consideration are very impressive to my brothers. Assigned room, lounge and amenities are so nice",50
"I had a pleasure experience at Conrad Macao, thanks to the staffs for the excellent service and assistance. It's very sweet for giving guest the welcome gift and preparing the requests well. Manager Diana and Ivan were very friendly and hospitable. The suite was spacious, room view was good, queen beds were big(1.5M), convinient amenities. The hotel facilities and services exceeded my expectations.",50
"Hotel's Executive Lounge service is awesome and unique ; Executives Officers and Managers are all really helpful and friendly, including, Renee Chen, Elvis, Ivan, Frand.  Although it's my 16th visit to this hotel, opened back in Yr 2012, it is the first time i accompanied with my friend, bringing a 2 weeks' old baby boy to stay.    The hotel is really thoughtful with a full spectrum of baby oriented facilities and accessories provided and all i can say is Conrad Macao is not just a luxurious but very caring hotel as well.  Money for supreme value and just primarily cater for the best  and memorable stay for its hotel guests.  I would not have a second thought to have repeated and further repeated stay at this hotel, got intensively indulged and affected by Conrad Macao.",50
"i read many good reviews and decided to stay in Conrad Macau, the Hotel is excellent and has a good location. the room is really spacious and have a nice view of Parisian hotel.. beautiful view at night. Special thank you for Arnisah who has been helpful and made our trip happier.. definitely will come back again. ",50
"This is a little overdue. I stayed there Dec 2014.  Concierge service was excellent, they were very informed and could make very good recommendations. Service in general was outstanding, friendly staff, you get water while waiting for taxi etc. When we needed a heater because of a faulty A/C and we were too lazy to change our room, they delivered that too.  What I thought was a little strange for the room (100 sqm room) was that the hair dryer can only be used inside the bedroom and not the toilet despite it being a massive toilet. I find this to be inconvenient as if you have other family members who are still sleeping, you can imagine that running a hair dryer isn't the most considerate thing to do.",40
"I downloaded the trip advisor app just to add a review for Conrad. From the moment we stepped in, every single Conrad member had a friendly smile. We were offered water as we waited to check in. We were upgraded to a two queen beds suite. The room was amazing, so beautiful and spacious!! The room service did a excellent job putting personal touches everyday, like having slippers out or extra water set up with cups on the night stand. I also love how Conrad brightened up my kids day by giving them a ducky and a bear! Even the baby had toiletries!!  Last but not least I wanted to recognize GALLANT in the lounge on the 39th floor. He was always so friendly and helpful. I loved how personal and genuine he was. All my kids raved about how much they liked him too! To all the lounge…",50
Do not hesitate to stay at this splendid hotel. The attention to detail and service goes above and beyond. Huge and impeccable suites. Delicious food at the lounge. Beautiful views and seamless service. ,50
"An excellent, well managed luxury hotel. The rooms, the facilities, and most especially the people who work here are great. From the people at the reception and front office(Diana, Frand, Ivan, Joana, Glenn, and Elvis)        to the impeccable lounge run by Chanel and her team(Lorin,Gallent,Ysa,Dan,Marvin,and Kitty). I was very well taken care of and very much look forward to returning to this wonderful hotel.",50
"This is my second time to stay in Conrad Macao. It was very impressive for the facilities in the hotel and the staff are very nice.  Stayed in Premium suite this time, the room is very spacious with a big living room and two rooms in it. The view is excellent too.  The welcome snacks macaroon and stick candy is tasty~!  As we stayed two nights in the hotel, we have tried the body massage and foot massage respectively. The bonti spa is very great and the experienced staff let us feel very comfortable during the time.  Meanwhile, we have enjoyed the breakfast, tea and evening drinks in the club lounge, the food and drinks are excellent!  At last, all the staffs are very nice and we feel very happy for the stay. Thank you conrad to bring us the memorable trip in Macao",50
"This was our first stay at the Conrad Macao at the Sands hotel strip and we both truly enjoyed our holiday trip to there. The recognition for Diamond members is great. I got a big Deluxe Suite, perfectly clean and with nice views over the resort and Venetian! Also in the evening we got the lovely Conrad Teddy and duck during turn down service.  The Lounge was ok we didn't like not so much special the food selection is a bit low during evening canapés and in the morning the hot breakfast items was already cold and we arrived around 10:15am for breakfast! All the staffs in the lounge and beautiful pool area are very friendly and helpful but after our check out somethings really strange happened and I'm sure this is not common for a Conrad or even Hilton hotel worldwide! I asked…",40
"My family stayed 4days in conrad on july. And all about thing in conrad was wonderful!!!  Every steps were kind and rounge food and room conditions were best.  Most of all, we arrived very late timep because airplane arrvial time was 00:30 Am. But korean step did everyting for our family in spite of vey late check in time 7/18. She gave me a korean trip information and esqote to elevater and so on. We special thanks to her.  In addition to, we special thanks to Ms glendar who worked at swimming pool(Her name  spelling is not sure) she took care of my chilren and gave me a vinyl  pack we could put our wet swimmgsuit. She wa very kind!! Some times other step on swimmingpool gave us ice cube made by apple juice. It was very delicious and cool. We liked it and we loved like this…",50
"I have stayed mostly at the Holiday Inn at this location.  I found the Conrad to be a step above, and noticed that the clientele was also a bit more pleasant and quiet.  If your a Hilton Honors member, you can gain access to the Club on Level 39, which has great cook to order breakfasts!",50
"Was back in Macau after 3 years and this time, we decided to stay at Conrad again. The service was excellent, from the check-in to the various encounters which we had during our stay. Kudos to Trista from the front office who escorted us to our room and provided good recommendations for restaurants. The Shanghai Tang amenities was a nice touch too. The junior suite was perfect for our family of three. Will definitely stay here again when we visit Macau.",50
"Enjoy it, including everything , location, food , afternoon tea time and evening cocktail with hot dishes. The newspapers is a litter bit delay, only previous days till noon. The room is very clean, rest room is big enough.",50
"I live in hotels full time and this is the best hotel I have ever stayed at. My husband and I felt very special staying here, an absolute treat. The service that this Conrad property offers is extraordinary. We have reached the highest status possible in the best hotel chains, and hands down this hotel has excelled in recognizing us as HHonors Diamond members. We had personalized attention from beginning to end. The hotel was busy and we felt as if we were the most important guests here. I can assure you that the other guests felt the same way. I’ve had a smile on my face from beginning to end. The staff made us feel very welcomed and at home. This is a very intimate property where service is very personalized. The location is excellent! Very close to many other luxury hotels,…",50
"Stayed here for 3 nights. The room is more than spacious, all necessities and more are provided. The staff are also responsive to any requests you have. My only negative here is that the bedsheets/linen appears to haven't been changed during our arrival; my roommates and I found it itchy upon trying to lie down in the bed. We requested the the sheets to be replaced the next day, which was done without a hassle.   The pool area is great, with complete amenities in the changing area. They even have a machine that will dry your swimming attire in seconds! Pool staff is polite and helpful, and they provided ice pops while we're swimming as refreshments.   Location is also great as it's in the center of Cotai, right beside the big hotels.   Will come here again when I can afford to.…",40
"Very nice hotel. We got upgraded to a 3 room suite and got coplimentary late checkout, due to some issues with our ordinary room and that came natura without a problem. Roms very good, nice view of town and strip.",50
Thanks to the excellent service provided by Conrad When returning to Macau I will always use the Conrad Thanks once again as the kind of steps Return with pleasant memories in Macau Perhaps the Conrad Macao miss when you return home,50
"I stayed in this hotel for couple nights during my business trip and was really amazed with my experience in Conrad Hotels. The room had a breath taking view, big bath tub, two sinks, unbelievable super comfortable bed. Staff is very polite, professional and reactive. You will not be disappointed and I can't wait to return.",50
"It is one of the best 5-stars hotels in Asia. I have stayed in most of the hotels in the area, and Conrad has got to be one of the best. It has easy access to just about everything you need in Macau. Expect a lot and you will get more than expected.",50
"Stayed for a night with my parents -- let me start with the awesome service. We arrived early thinking to just drop bags first, but the room has been assigned and prepared. I requested for extra bed (which obviously should be chargeable), but the receptionist approached her manager, cancelled the assigned room, and upgraded us to a two-bed suite instead!!! I mean, which other hotel would give a free upgrade in lieu of a chargeable request. Upon knowing that it was our first visit to Macau, the receptionist handed us a good guidebook, bus list, taxi cards, etc. and while walking us to the room (yes she did that), she explained the attractions, recommended food, and how to get to each. Her name is Sophy, I hope I got that right.  The room itself is very well designed and spacious.…",50
"Conrad Macau is outstanding in every aspect.  Checking was effective and checking staff was very helpful.  The lobby, room and facility are luxurious. The room and bedding were extremely comfortable.   Staff is very helpful, nice, polite and goes out of their way to help guests.  They made out stay very enjoyable and we felt right at home.  We highly recommend this hotel.",50
"Stayed for 2 nights on my family trip in June. This elegant hotel has a great location with a spacious rooms. The staffs services attitudes are awesome.  The concierge team are the best I have come across my various hotel stays and it make Conrad Macao a fabulous place to stay in Macau. Chief Concierge, Mr Edmund Tan and his team went all the way to help me on my last minutes transport and hotel arrangement for my next leg of my trip. His genuineness and customer services attitude charmed my family and made us feel like ""Home away from Home. Highly recommend this hotel for Macau stays.",50
"Well appointed, luxurious and large rooms was a highlight of my stay. Conrad is well connected to casinos like Venetian, you dont even have to step on the road as these are inter-connected. For those who like shopping its again very convenient as there are enough shops to keep you busy whole day. There is a pick and drop complimentary service to the ferry and it taken around 30 mins to reach. Overall a good option for company parties and personal trips as well.",40
"Please copy from my description above.I have already described your offering a ""Paraise"" of building, suites, Lounge, Reading Room, and perfect Shefs and above all, a unique STAFF. Congratulations for a unique and perfect  CONRAD MACAO.",50
"It was my first time staying at the Conrad Hotel, Macau. All staffs were very helpful and kind, it made us forget about unpleasant experiences in Macau during the day time. I'd like to visit here again!",50
"I have stayed in this hotel for one night on July 1 with my family.  It was a terrible experience and i doubted this is a 5-star hotel quality.  When i arrived at the hotel at 11am, the reception staff told me the hotel was full and the room will be ready at 3pm.  I had also requested slippers for children on the spot.  However, when i came back at 3pm, the reception staff told me the room was still dirty and they even couldn't advise how long we had to wait to check-in.  Then, we waited at the lobby for another 1.5 hours without any updates from the staff.  We finally get into our room at 5pm until we rushed to the reception staff for updates.    In the room, we could not find the kid's slippers inside. Therefore, we called the ""personal service"" for the slippers again.  After…",10
"it was my first trip in Macau. i had a night in Conrad it was really good. the facility was greate, the bathrob was so nice also the slipers. and the pool smell was less tha other hotels. i really liked that. and the staffs was realy kind and their english is good so there was any inconvenient thing during the stay.",50
一直想都住依間酒店 但價＄比較貴 但今次為慶祝2週年紀念 所以就book了一晚住 去到酒店check in巳經是5點 沒有很多人check in 房間巳經準備好 由於是Hhoners  金卡會員 所以可以享用39/F 行政走廊的設施 有早餐 afternoon tea happy hours 由於一早通知酒店今次是慶祝2週年紀念 所以酒店有送cheese cake和親手寫的卡 很貼心！ 最後想感謝前台Owen 他很有禮貌 check in 的時侯問他有冇free upgrade 他回答暫時沒有 我就跟他說如果晚一點如有套房no show 請幫我upgrade 到了差不多11點多晚上 他告訴我可以upgrade了 真的很謝謝他的熱心幫助 還有house keeping的Eva 我離開房間的時侯 寫了一張字給開床姐姐 希望她們會給我多一隻bear bear 最後回到酒店房她巳經把bear bear 排好在床上 so cute! 總括黎講十分滿意今次住宿 期待下一次的visit ：）,50
"The high floor room comes with a stunning city view of the Venetian. Everything was perfect except for the breakfast buffet - stayed at Sheraton last time I visited Cotai and the buffet  at Feast (I think Holiday Inn and sheraton guests mostly go to Feast?) was better.   Still, highly recommended with all these fancy dolls, complimentary candies, etc. which seem not to be available at Sheraton. ",50
"We had a wonderful stay in Conrad Macao for a 3 days 2 nights family trip. The staffs were kind enough to make a special decoration in the room, specialized a couple bears, sent us a yum cheese cake and a lovely vase as gift when they knew it was my grandparents' 45th anniversary. They put a big smile on my grandparent which means a lot to my family. My grandparent enjoyed their leisure time in the upgraded suite while I had fun at the pools. We would love to visit back Macao soon and will choose Conrad Macao again for sure. :)",50
"My friend and I dropped by Conrad Macao for a day to have a short trip to Taipa & collect their signature bear.   The staff was very helpful as we were checking in (she was Korean, I think her name was Sue), and gave us specialized hotel guides in Korean with the local tour guide & map. They have services catered to Koreans (Korean speaking staff ready at all time), so if you're comfortable with that language and love things the Korean way, it's readily available here.   They sent us two bears immediately after check-in because we told them that we came to collect them, and gave us one more during turn down. We ordered some Asian food for dining in and was not disappointed with the quality. Stayed at the highest level, and the view is quite good (I wouldn't say great, I've…",50
"Spent 2 nights in a suite at Conrad Macao -- great service, comfortable and plush room, loved the Aromatherapy Associates toiletries provided. Discovered a little late in the trip that there is a free shuttle service from Conrad (to other hotels and vice versa). Did not try breakfast (not included in our room rate) but there are plenty of dining options (Shoppes at Sands, & Venetian). Overall a good stay at the Conrad. Minor event - we heard a few knocks on our room door late at night on the first night, there was a young Chinese girl outside (we peeped through the peephole. Being girls ourselves, we didn't open the door since we didn't recognize her nor was she wearing a hotel uniform)..",50
"This has been my third time staying at Conrad Macau as a Hilton Honors Gold member and the service given to me here was impeccable. First off,I would like to commend the staff at Conrad Club lounge especially Gallant, Glenn and Emman who made a strong impression as they took very good care of us when we used the lounge, feeding us from breakfast, high tea and happy hour. Also the front desk, Alva took care of our needs when we were there, from check in to check out. I highly commend these people for the time and effort they did for our stay at Conrad macau. Unfortunately I cannot say so much as well of the health club employees, especially a Chinese male staff who I was offended with when I was using the facilities on the last day, upon check out. I needed to shave at the health…",40
"Having just participated in a corporate 3 day event, using the Conrand Cotai as our base, the ability to literally staying within the confirm of the various interconnected building was incredible, and really at no point did I feel claustrophobic or having thought I had cabin fever. So much to do and so much to see, awesome restaurants with fantastic food, and the service staff always ensuring that you are welcome. If the opportunity arise will certainly return for a holiday",50
The Conrad is the perfect hotel for Macau. Great location lovely big rooms and first class service from the staff. Real 5 star experience. The pool area was great with nice cabanas to relax in. The spa was also a really relaxing experience. Can not wait to go back,50
"The room of this hotel is very spacious and nicely decorated. The marble bathroom looks superb, but somehow a little bit smelly, which should not happen in this category of hotel. Well maybe it was just our room, not really intense. Queuing time for check in was a little bit long on weekends and the breakfast was only average.",40
"Hotel staff very eager to please.  Room are very spacious, clean and neat.  Good assortment of TV channels.  Lush cosy bed.  Reliable, fuss-free, complimentary internet. Good links and shuttle buses to the various establishments in the central Cotai area and to Taipa ferry port.",50
"The staff are generally very friendly and helpful. The facilities are well maintained.  The room is extremely cozy that I could sleep exceptionally good throughout the night (and I can seldom do it first night I stay in a hotel).   I am particularly be impressed by the souvenirs from the hotel ( candies and bath duck with two dices in it). At the night time, they make up your bed and with two teddy bears.   The only downside of the hotel is design of the lobby floor that makes me get lost for the first time when I walked by myself. They have very big signs showing the way to the casino. If I was not led by the front desk staff to the hotel lift, I don't think I would be able to find it for the first time. It may be helpful if there is signboard showing the way to the shuttle bus…",50
"Check in was extremely smooth, even with early check-in and the girl (Shaylee) was extremely friendly and helpful with getting us maps of the area as well a map of the hotel (the hotel is attached to a MASSIVE complex, the Sands Cotai).  We'd done our research, but she offered to help with places to go, shows, restaurants.  One of the managing staff (Prem) had arranged for an upgrade, which made all the difference in our travel with a 2-year-old.  We also had their top-floor lounge access with an equally well-trained and welcoming staff as well as food and beverages.    All this made for an extremely relaxing family trip - I look forward to returning again soon!",50
It was best two days in Macau CONRAD. I still appreciate the whole hotel wonderful service. Every staffs in CONRAD provided great service with best kindness. We never feel any uncomfortable during the stay in CONRAD. And upgrade to the suite room for Diamond member of Hilton. I'm going to share my experience at CONRAD hotel with my friends. Thank you CONRAD !!,50
"Good view, good services, good bed and shower! Easy access to all shoppes and casino. Gym open 24 hours and the jacuzzi and sauna rooms look good! There is also spa services at level 3 with reasonable price and its is able to ask to massage in room! ",50
Awesome amenities and unforgettable surprise for our special occasion. It's located in the heart of Taipa and such a convenient place to go shopping and sightseeing. Fitness centre is open 7/24 and the facilities are fully equipped.  Strongly recommend. ,50
"I had visited Macau to celebrate my birthday and anniversary which fall together. The relationship officer had arranged for our room to be beautifully  decorated and sent some desert for my birthday! We had a lovely room overlooking Macau. It's a beautiful property, however since many five star properties are right next to each other, they share some services like spa and pool Etc. It was very confusing. We felt that it doesn't really matter which of the 5 star properties you choose, the only real difference is the uniform of the staff members- assuming the service level is equivalent.  So all in all, we had a great experience but would have probably been similar had we chosen another 5 star Property. ",40
"It was my friend's birthday while staying there. We received a lovely cheese cake and birthday card from the holiday, how sweet. All the staffs wear big smile and we'll trained, absolutely will recommend to any of my friedns.",50
As a HHonors Platinum member i was upgraded to their Junior Suite which was awesome. Plenty of space and really good quality furniture and settings. I had the luxury to visit their lounge and yes Parma Ham is served along a couple of good wines. The staff at the property were all very helpful and knowledgable. Nothing to fault actually. Breakfast was also great at the lounge. I would go back!!!,50
Beautiful rooms with great amenities. Well kept and clean room Very polite want well trained staff Hope to see more promotion  Great service  Nice environmental  Friendly bellboy Very nice rooms Great place,50
As a HHonors Diamond member I was extremely well looked after.   My king suite was perfect and the staff especially those in the executive lounge were exceptional.  Breakfast in Orbit was delicious with an incredible number of choices and different food stations manned by chefs.,50
"別感謝 Diana)，由於跟父母的班機時間不同，check in 的時候 Elvis 已經從我先前聯繫的 email 中得知這件事情，花時間幫忙將我們兩間房盡可能安排在同樣的樓層，方便我能照顧到父母，也將我父母的名字加到另一間房的住房名單上，讓他們稍後抵達時即便我不在現場也能順利入住，並享有相對應的待遇，在連假入住滿房的情況下，從大堂開門的小兄弟，到樓上前台的人員，他們依然態度和善，沒有絲毫不奈煩，等待check in 的時候也親切的招待了我朋友特調冰飲消暑。   這次朋友忘了帶手機充電線，特別感謝 Ivan 協助張羅，還有對我們各種需求的關心，晚上還招待我們水果吃，真的是太開心了！  在酒廊 Glenn, Mariz 總是給予溫暖的笑容，招呼我們入座，Gallant, Lorin 應該已經認識我們一家了，晚酒時間像是老朋友般為我父親介紹這一期新進的紅、白酒，當你想品嚐新酒的時候他們也絲毫不吝嗇，也謝謝 Kitty 推薦的水果，只能說第一次在台灣以外的地方還能吃到這麼甜的芒果，只好多吃點了。  這次的旅遊讓父母的結婚週年回憶格外特別，初次遊澳門的朋友也都感到驚艷，飯店的小驚喜與各種安排，都讓人覺得體貼備至，每年的家族旅遊，少不了都要再來的。  I booked 2 rooms for my friends and parents this time, my parents are celebrating their anniversary while my friends are on their first time trip to Macau, the experience of staying at Conrad was inspiring.  Although the rooms were fully booked due to the…",50
"his is hands down the best hotel in the Hilton portfolio for Diamond members.  Booked the base room and was upgraded to a huge suite nearly the size of my house.  Living room, two bathrooms, spa, bedroom.  The executive lounge was fantastic and the members very helpful.  Also a big thanks to Frand who went out of his to help during and after the stay.",50
"The hotel was fantastic with couple of exceptions: beautiful rooms, very clean, helpful and friendly staff (with one serious one exception). Front Desk staff and Manager on Duty were exceptional with elegant conduct and customer orientation.  Food was great with fresh amazing juices.  My status as a Hilton Diamond member was honored with beautiful room upgrade.  Conrad Macao Cotai Central is the preferred place to stay.  Now the negative exceptions:  Arriving by the shuttle bus  to the back of the Mall, there was no one to help with luggage and no one to tell you that Conrad is there.  I had to carry my bags my self.  Second,  There was one staff /supervisor  with misbehavior  in the Executive Lounge shouting/ negatively reacting because she was not happy that I told her the…",40
"Conrad is in the Sands complex, that has Holiday Inn, St Regis and Sheration too. The huge casino, main one is under Sheraton but all lobbies are connected in a mall + shops setting. Couple of smaller gaming zones too. Free pick/ drop to ferry station.",40
"This was my second stay after first visiting when the hotel opened 4 years ago. I was impressed with the outstanding service then and couldn't really think of any improvements to be made. But Conrad Macao has refined its service even more. In terms of hardware, it still feels brand new. The hotel is quite large with over 650 rooms, but it feels much more intimate. What truly sets apart this hotel from other nice hotels is the genuine and warm service. I'd especially like to mention a special thank you to Kus at the front desk. As soon as we entered the front desk(more like a ballroom in terms of size) area to check in, he recognized and greeted us. Check in was a breeze and he personally escorted us to our room. As a Hilton diamond member, he even upgraded us to a beautiful…",50
"Dear General Manager: I stayed in your lovely hotel on 16 May for 3 nights and i can't express how i was impressed by the services provided. I would like to specially thanks Diana for organizing my room, the receptionist who handled my check in, and of course Anisah and Edmund. They made my stay so memorable and i will definitely stay in Conrad for all my visits in Macao.",50
"A Pleasant and Memorable stay at Conrad, Macao. Everything was well arranged and Suite room was excellent. Hotel staff were courteous and welcoming. We celebrated my wife's birthday at Conrad. Thank you to Conrad staff and Management team for making this happened on this special occasion.",50
"This is my first conrad hotel stay and i must say that they did not disappoint! I was upgraded to a city view king suite because i was a diamond member and me and my husband were celebrating our honeymoon. Our first reaction was how spacious the suite was and how there was a bonus entertainment room. We were also greeted with utmost professionalism including being escorted by Guest services to our room. The staff at check-in/check out, concierge team, bell boy, pool area, and lounge staff were all very attentive. I would definitely choose to stay at the conrad macao again!",50
"For  1. Great staff with fantastic service attitude 2. Big rooms 3. Excellent treatment of high status HHonors members 4. Very good food offerings in Club Lounge  Niggles  1. No International newspapers. I expect International New York Times and The Financial Times. 2. the lounge where food is served needs some design supervision. It has the aesthetics of a 1990's Chinese airlines first class lounge  3. It is in Cotai - it is the gambling strip. You either love it or hate it. Be perfect if this hotel were in Old Macau.  I have noticed a bit of ""enhancement"" on some offerings. The butter was previously French Isigny brand. It is now Anchor. That really is the sublime to the ridiculous.  But overall a really great hotel with staff to match.",50
"Had a wonderful staycation with my family. The Conrad experience was above and beyond! Jason, the staff who checked us in was so patient and friendly. An exemplary staff of the Conrad. We were given a city view room and the view was outstanding especially to my Wife and Son.  Unfortunately, we didn't get to swim in this wonderful summer weather. We made out for that by spending time together going around the Venetian & SCC. Eating egg tarts at Lord Stow during our one of pit stops. Will come back and strongly recommend others to stay at the Conrad. Thank you! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",50
"The room is spacious. Staffs are very helpful, especially Sue as front desk. And housekeeper do well her job. I felt very comfort since housekeeping. I used club lounge. Foods have good quality. I would like to stay again.",50
"This is an incredibly comfortable hotel with such a warm, caring staff. Hilton Honors members are recognised and well rewarded. The pool is great for relaxing or playing with your kids. Food and beverage outlets are good value and quality food.  If you travel to Macau, Conrad should be at the top of your list for hotels.",50
"I can't say enough nice things about the hotel staff: everyone was passionate about their job and puts the customer first:  from Isaac at the front desk, to Andy in the bar, to Harland at the front door.   My first stay at a Conrad property and I look forward to the next.    The rooms are lovely.   It's attached to the Sands/Venetian property and shares their amenities.",50
"Firstly i would like to thank this amazing woman - Lydia . She welcomed me with a huge smile and a nice conversation and that was probably the longest conversation a native had made with me over my week's stay . She helped me with my preferences and was very kind , helpful , and patient with it .     Even though i just booked a normal 1 king-bed room , (not any fancy suite) She personally escorted me to show the way  my room.     The room was really an amazing one , what stood out is the bath-tub with the TV !! and the huge couch in the room , making it seem more like a lavish studio .   Small things make big difference - This will sum up why i love conrad even though i have stayed at 3 other macau hotels that week .",50
"We stayed at the Conrad Macao for a single night early January this year. We initially booked a King Deluxe Suite but were upgraded to as King Premier Suite. The Premier Suite was the largest hotel room we have ever stayed in, the upgrade was very much appreciated. Thanks Conrad Macao.  As a diamond member the hotel and club level staff treated us as if we were VIP's, the service was next level, and we could not fault it once. Concierge even emailed before the visit with hotel information, tips and asking if assistance was needed booking anything.  Also a nice touch escorting guests to their room after checkin and showing us the club level and hotel features along the way.  We have stayed in a lot of hotelS all around the world, but as of now, for us, this hotel had a level of…",50
"""Boutique"" feel in a large full service integrated resort.  Part of the large Sands Cotai Central property across the street from Venetian and City of Dreams.  Quick and efficient check-in/check out.  Great amenities, restaurant offerings and shopping.  Received a suite upgrade!",50
"I stayed here in Conrar macao for 2 nights with my family and it was the best hotel in our life. The staff members were willing to help at any moments, prompt in all our needs and exceptionally kind. We were so pleased during our stay and we want to come back to this hotel in the near future.",50
"Accommodation: High Quality decorations, everything in the room works, air conditioner runs perfectly.  Staffs : Excellent from pre arrival to departure. Mr. Edmond Tan the chief concierge sent us an email asking for our requests, and all were met with just one communication. Everything asked was served, never had to ask twice. We are Diamond member and were invited to use the Lounge. Staffs and F&B quality at the lounge were very high. We especially like to thank Joana, Yumi, Dan, and Glen. Location : 5-10 minutes from airport. Contai strip is great for shopping, dining, and entertainment and Contad is at the center of it all.",50
The Conrad Macao has become my favorite hotel not only in Macao but in all of Asia.  The staff and service are excellent. The facility is spotless and I am constantly trying to spend more time simply enjoying the property and amenities.  After my first stay here 3 years ago I haven't even considered another property in Macao.,50
"Being a HHonors member, I had an upgrade to a junior suite which was great! The location is perfect but might be lacking in food options. A short walk to the Venetian would satisfy that. Found it a little weird that the room require key cards to access the floor but the slot was only available at one side of the lift.",50
"My Wife and I started off our Christmas 2015 Asia trip in Macau, and had the pleasure of staying at the Conrad for a few days.    Our arrival - Due to flight delays, etc., we ended up getting to the hotel well after 2 in the Morning.  We had been in communication with Elvis (Front Office Supervisor), and he had taken care of the room arrangements.   We were able to check in very quickly, and were taken up to the room right away.  Room - We were upgraded to a Suite, and it was great.  Having a living room and dining area was luxurious, and really set the tone for our stay in Macau.  You entered the room into a foyer, which had a shelf on one side and a powder room on the other.  Past that was a dining area, leading into a living room.  To the right was the bedroom, dressing area,…",50
"The room setting is nice! As common hotel room, it is the toilet on the side near the door, closet on the other side, as u walk in. There's the bed and a semi circle sofa in front of the window.   My room was looking over to the Parisian hotel which is still under construction, but the tower is probably ready and the lights are on at night!   Bathroom is pretty big with bathtub on one side and shower on the other. The bathtub is pretty big I have to say that allow two adults to have a bath pretty comfortably.",40
"This was my fifth or sixth visit to the Conrad and no doubt it is my firm favourite in Macau.  I've stayed at the ""big Italianate castle"" across the street and there is no comparison.  Despite its size and the high daily turnover, the Conrad maintains an air of calm civility.  The rooms are spectacular - very well-appointed but still cozy.  The Conrad has been kind enough to upgrade me to a suite on two occasions and I must say I did feel rather spoiled.  Edmund Tan is everything you would expect of a classical hotel concierge - somehow he manages to remember my name despite the fact that I am not that frequent a guest and he must see 200 new faces every working day.  Everything there is to know about Macau, modern or historical, Edmund knows.  All of the front desk staff are…",50
"The Conrad Macau is a wonderful place to stay. It is well located with plenty of things to do in and around the hotel. Transfers to/from the ferry terminal are fast, easy and free. Rooms in the hotel are excellent - clean, spacious and comfortable. The Conrad duck for the bath and teddy on the pillow are thoughtful touches. Staff throughout the hotel are welcoming, friendly and efficient. Food and beverages at the hotel are great.",50
"Best stay in Macau. Great suite, the concierge was very attentive. We had access to the executive lounge, and it was perfect. Meeting rooms available. Great buffet at the breakfast. Near of good casinos and great restaurants.",50
"Spent 2 nights at the Conrad Macau and it was a great stay. Rewind to give you some background, we left Thailand 6am and by the time we got to The Hotel, it was about 12.30am. We met the floor manager who was quite sympathetic as we travelled quite a few hours. He upgraded us to a junior suite. Huge room, I think just Over 105 Sqm. Beautiful 2 bedroom suite, had everything. Pure luxury. Staff was great, room very clean, everyone very helpful. The Hotel was conveniently located to Venetian, City of Dreams. all Casinos have bus transfers to other Casinos so easy to visit several places. The Casino/Hotels are big, with hundreds of specialty shops. Must visit places are Senado Square and Taipa. Also definitely try the Portugese Tarts. Better than the real thing. The Chinese…",50
"優點： - 因是HHonors金會員，被升級了套房，環境大而舒適。 - HHonors金會員能在Lounge享用快速checkin，食下午茶和cocktail。 - Grand Orbit 早餐種類豐富。 - 有天橋去對面威尼斯人較體貼(尤期是炎熱的夏天)。  缺點： - 服務員沒有詳說行政樓層的設施。 - Lounge 的食物精美但種類較少, Grand Orbit 的食物種類多但質素較差。 - 金沙城本身的food court實在差勁得很。 - Wifi 速度快但試過斷線 - 免費巴士路線少",40
"Had a very nice 5-night stay. A bit difficult transport from the airport, since the hotel's website says to take the Cotai Central bus, of which none were to be found. Staff at the airport bus terminal said to take the Venetian bus, which we did with some doubts, and it actually stopped at the Conrad first.  Warmly greeted at check-in and given an upgrade to a large suite, with a spacious bathroom and a giant walk-in shower. Unfortunately the shower has only a rain shower head and no hand shower, something I have never seen in a hotel this new.  We had requested alternate bath amenities online and only the standard amenities were provided, but they were acceptable.  Staff in the lounge provided excellent service and food offerings both in the evening and morning were very good. …",50
Excellent staffs and nice service. Lunch buffet was cost-effective.  Club lounge happy hour was not satisfactory.  Limited shuttle bus service. Shuttle bus stops at Holiday inn. Swimming pool is not satisfactory and needs renovation.,40
"I and my parents stayed at Conrad Macao for 3nights and this was awesome experience with Hilton. The location, service and the room condition was perfect that I would strongly recommend this place to whom have plans for Macao.",50
"this a luxury hotel with a beautiful room, big bathroom and nice view! They put a little golden bear on the bed as a welcome gift, the bear is so cute and i took it back to home for sure^^  I really like the bag bathroom with double basin, and the breakfast buffet was good!",50
"Being a diamond member, there's always the added privileges of executive lounge, upgrade, late checkout etc.  The one thing that made the trip memorable for me was Emman, he was so lovely and attentive to my every need, truly exceptional for a young man, it reminds me of the old school concierge!  Prior to my arrival, he gave me detailed description of transportation to ensure a stress free arrival from HK airport. Then he asked if there were any special occasions in which I said not really except a girlfriend catch up, so there was surprise in the room awaiting!!Best cheesecake from the in-house Conrad chef! There were numerous other things he did for us, all in all he really is impressive. So if you are lucky enough to be a Hilton member, please ring or email him Emman…",50
"Upgraded us to a Suite with a very nice view. Truly a birthday treat for my husband. Hotel staff provided very good service overall, anticipating our needs and prompt in providing our additional needs. Alva Plandes, Guest Relations Officer, provided very personable and made our stay really special/memorable.",50
"I and my family enjoyed wonderful stay in Conrad Macao Cotai Central. Room condition was quite alright and breakfast included various food which can satisfy all of my family members. All in all, I will definitely come back when I go to Macao again.",50
"I was lucky to have my room upgraded to a junior suite, even though i had found that Hilton Honors had just dropped my status to silver right before i arrived at the hotel, which has really made me question my loyalty to this program.  In any case, the room was really big, super clean, however there was no welcome fruit basket which was a bit disappointing for such a 5 star property.   Also the breakfast that was served at the executive lounge was again really disappointing  , they should simply close it down. the croissants were so hard, that was so obvious they had been take from the day before and simply reheated. I mean how hard is it to put some fresh bakery products.",40
"Have stayed in many other hotels in Macau like Venetian, Galaxy , Sheraton , Wynn , lisboa but never felt this hospitality else where.  Maiko, the lady at the checkin counter was really helpful from checkin to making our ferry tickets to getting us a wake up call. Had to check out early and they had the breakfast packed for us. There was a personal touch and felt the warmth of hospitality which I never experienced before in Macau. The room too is pretty awesome a place I will revisit again for sure.",50
"As soon as we walk in the lobby, we were welcomed by one of their concierges called Emman. He took us to our room an gave us a quick run down of all the amenities available. From his obvious pride from working at one of the prestigious Conrad hotels,not only did he make us feel warmly welcomed...also made us feel like VIPs. Kudos to the front desk who gave us a double queen room last minute when we had originally booked a king room. Really appreciated the kind gesture. Sometimes it's the small details that differentiates the the best from the good ones! Room was spacious, lounge was quiet and relaxing, good snacks and friendly yet professional staffs.We highly recommend this hotel if staying on Taipa side.",50
"I am a regular visitor to the magical island of Macao, and have been fortunate enough to have stayed at many different Five-star establishments on both Macao island and the Cotai strip.  Whilst scouring through the TripAdvisor reviews on Macao hotels, I noticed that the Conrad was getting excellent reviews so decided to try it out for my 3-night stay.  Upon arrival to the hotel, I was fortunate to be assisted at check-in by the fabulous Arnisah. I have stayed in many hotels throughout the world, but Arnisah has to be one of the most pleasant and helpful hotel employees I have ever encountered.   She led me to my room and I was very satisfied. The room was of the usual high standard you get accustomed to from Conrad. The bed was extremely comfortable and would give the Westin…",40
"A truly luxury hotel, a friendly and helpful staff mostly the receptionist Maiko and Emman who makes our stay fabulous from check-in to everything we need. The room was very spacious, the amenities were extraordinary and ofcourse the view from our room that my family really enjoyed. I highly recommend this hotel...",50
"We stayed for the birthday of my girlfriend, staff was very attend and provided a birthday cake. Room is very spacious and especially the bathroom was huge. Very nice amenities and good location. Not having their own restaurant but plenty of restaurants in the area.",50
"We've been coming to the Conrad Macao Contai Central since it opened.  The service was uneven at the beginning, but the hotel has matured and improved over time.  The Executive Floor is now up to par with other Conrad Hotels in the region. The rooms are spacious and beautifully appointed.  And the location is unbeatable. Highly recommended.",40
"I highly recommend a stay at Conrad Cotai for anyone wishing to experience luxury with attention to detail delivered by friendly staff. Every element of our stay was anticipated following check-in by Arnisah. The room furnishings exceeded our expectations and we changed our plans to enjoy the space further.  The close proximity of the hotel to The House of Dancing Water show and shuttle buses made exploring Macao and other hotels with limited time very easy, even in bad weather. A special joy was the extra treat of complimentary afternoon tea, cocktails and breakfast on the 39th floor.  Staff greeted us by name and took extra care to deliver excellent but friendly service.  As an Australian I especially appreciated Gallant creating a Flat White coffee as a first attempt.  A…",50
"I stayed at a delux suite for 3days in 2014.(sorry tripadvisor.com does not allow me to select 2014 for this post)  While I am planning to re-visit Macau near future and it reminds me the happy moment at Conrad Macau.  The suite and rooms in the suite were very spacious and clean.(It has one bedroom and even has a small media room as well)  The best thing was people, I still remember Cliff and Wendy. Please do not misunderstand that other people are not kind like them. All the people I met at Conrad were kind enough and provided the best service to us.  Actually, the trip was to celebrate my wife's birthday and it really was the right decision staying at Conrad Macau.  Hope to see the people at Conrad as soon as possible.  FYI, my wife and I have collected Conrad ducks from the…",50

"Wonderful hotel with great end-to-end experience, from welcome till departure. Super professional while warm-hearted service, top-notch gym, and convenient location for both gambling, shopping, shows (make sure to check out ""Dancing Waters"") and restaurants while just a short taxi drive away from the old town with the most important tourist attractions (my favourite: The Mandarin's House).  Special cudos for Ms. Arnisah at the front desk for a perfect welcome experience!",50
It was best two days in Macau CONRAD. I cannot forget the stay . Every staffs in CONRAD provided great service with best kindness. We never feel any uncomfortable during the stay in CONRAD. I'm going to share my experience at CONRAD hotel with my friends. Thank you CONRAD !!,50
"I can't begin to say enough great things about my experience at the Conrad Macao. From the welcome email I received a few weeks before my arrival, to the impeccable service from the staff -- a truly wonderful stay. Upon arrival, I was greeted by no less than a half dozen staff and whisked upstairs to complete the check in. I received an upgrade because of my Diamond status, but I'm certain even without status the staff there would go the extra mile for guests.   Must mention Glenn and Joanna upstairs at check in and Mariz and Gallant in the lounge. I was always addressed by name (as were other guests) and felt welcome at every turn. You absolutely cannot go wrong choosing this hotel for your stay.",50
"From check-in to check-out, everything was personalized service. We stayed in a one-bedroom suite which was huge. My children were given activity folders which kept them entertained while I was checking-in. My children loved the rock candy. They also enjoyed bathing in the tub with the conrad duck. Everything was just perfect. The cake for my son was such a delightful surprise. Thank you for going the extra mile to make your guests feel special. We all had a memorable family vacation. ",50
"The service is first rate, and no lines for checkin and checkout like many hotels. The executive lounge had an excellent choice of food and beverage. The breakfast at the Grand Orbit was superb, and the spa was a 10.",50
Well placed within the centrally located Cotai Central.   Less of the casino hotel feel with spacious room and comfortable beds.   Quality food.  Service was attentive and personalised.  Lives up to the Conrad brand.,50
"We stayed in this hotel on 31 March till 02 April 2016. Hotel located in the center of Sands Cotai and besides other hotels (St. Regis, Sheraton and Holiday Inn). Opposite is Venetian, Four Season Hotel and 5 minutes walk to City of Dreams (COD) which consists other hotels such as Hard Rock and Grand Hyatt.  About this hotel, the staff are very friendly and able to communicate well in english. You just never feel like want to leave the hotel. Great staff, great hotel, good food, excellent overall experience!",50
"Stayed here a few times and the service keeps getting better and better. Stayed in a suite and used the lounge, one of the best food ever among all hotels lounges ever used. If you like to use the gym, they have an excellent one.",50
"Stayed at the Conrad for the first time and was pleasantly surprised.  We booked two rooms, one normal and one suite I think. In any case, room was roomy, bright, and with great service.  Check in experience was pleasant, except we had a wait a little.  But that's OK, the Level 39 Conrad Lounge was very comfortable.  They also serve breakfast, afternoon tea and cocktail there.  It's a great place to unwind, and they also have an excellent selection of books and other publications should you wish to indulge in some quiet time.   Didn't check out the casino, mainly because I was with kids.  Pool was OK.    The food court had a good selection of food, and this kids store next door - honestly, kids can stay there for hours!  I was traveling with a Baby, and was very happy to hear…",40
"It is my second time stay in this Hotel in Macau.  I love this hotel so much.  I visited Macau during a busy Easter Holiday, everywhere is crowded of tourists.  But when entered the hotel lobby, it becomes so quite and peaceful.  The front desk staffs, bell boys are so nice, patient and helpful, I appreciate their services.    The room is spacious, so clean and the bed is really very comfortable. They have the coffee machine in room, I can have a cup of good coffee instead of 3 in 1 powder coffee in the early morning before leaving the room.  But I needed to use my iPad before bed and at the coach.  If you also do that, I'd suggest you to bring along with a longer USB cables for mobile devices since the sockets in the room is usually far from bed and coach.  Btw, wifi is fast…",50
"We came to Macau for 1 night to see the Dancing Waters show.  We sated at the Conrad Macao Coati Central a short walk away.  Pedro checked us in, so personable and helpful.  He personally walked us to our room.  Magnificent room!  Upgraded suite with huge living room area, huge bedroom and bathroom.  Love the Conrad Duck and Teddy Bear.  Would come back here in a second!",50
"We chose this hotel based on the good review by other guests. We were not disappointed, it even exceeded our expectations.   Staff at the front office were very helpful and they even showed us to our room. Room is fantastic, location is good. Breakfast is great too.   Will definitely come back again.",50
"I stayed two nights in Macau at the Sands Cotai. One of the nights was spent at the new St. Regis, while the other was here at the Conrad. Last year I had stayed at the Sheraton.  I arrived on a very foggy evening at the Conrad. I had intended to arrive earlier in the afternoon to partake in afternoon tea in the executive lounge but the fog was so bad that all ferries from HK were delayed by several hours. Upon arrival I made my way to the front desk area which was completely empty. I was greeted by the front desk agent who promtly checked me in and informed me that I had been upgraded to a suite as a Hilton diamond. Nice!  While at the front desk I inquired about purchased a return ferry ticket and was escorted to the concierge area where they informed me they would take care…",40
"The hotel was great! The lobby was beautiful and the rooms were clean, spacious and comfortable!! The hotel was conveniently located on the Cotai Strip, we had an excellent view of the soon to be Eiffel Tower on the Strip and the shuttles to and from different Macau attractions were excellent!!",50
I travel a lot for work and privately and this was the least personalised 5 start hotel I've ever stayed. Went to attend a work event held at this hotel with other 100 colleagues but we all felt we're just another number for the hotel staff to process.  Didn't feel welcomed at all and it was very disappointing. The staff who put the even together for us was a massive help and very professional so for them I take my heat off but the rest of my experience was very average. ,30
"Conrad Macao, in my experience, is one of the best hotels in Macau. It is not as busy as some of the others in the strip and if you like to be treated nicely and professionally, this is the hotel for you. I just went with my wife and my son and they really looked after us. They responded to my email (as I need some special arrangements) within hours and followed up with great details. The room was clean and they even bring sweets to my son during the day.   If you are a frequent traveller, I strongly recommend you to join the Honors Program as the benefits are amazing.. they upgraded me to a suite :)  Overall, a great experience and I will not stay anywhere else but Conrad!",50
"Awesome customer service provided to me during my stay in this hotel. Both myself and wife enjoy so much staying. Hotel provided a complimentary birthday cake for my wife birthday celebration too..  With my diamond membership, i got my room upgraded and used of the VIP lounge with great service and environment ..",50
"I was here for 4 nights to present at company seminar.  I was upgraded because of my Gold status and the room was fantastic ... about twice the size of my entire Hong Kong apartment!  Staff were helpful and attentive, and the concierge helped me find the best way back to HK on Friday (ferries were delayed due to heavy fog).",50
"We book this hotel for one night stay to celebrate our 6th year anniversary after reading all the good reviews. it definitely exceeded our expectation, we booked a deluxe room and didn't expect to be upgraded to King Deluxe Suite. My boyfriend emailed them prior to our booking requesting for them to prepare a bubble bath while we're out having dinner, but due to hygiene reason they weren't able to but they did provide us with Shanghai Tang bathroom amenities separately from the usual hotel ones. Thanks to Eve for organising a lovely time for the both of us, she even phone us to see if she can help with anything else. we were surprise to find a box of gourmet chocolates and a letter thanking us for choosing to celebrate such a special occasion with them. Definitely recommend this…",50
"In my 100+ stays all over the world, I have never experienced a hospitality even remotely comparable to what we saw at Conrad. We felt we were like a Royal family :) The staff is courteous, helpful and will go out of their way to make you comfortable. It is Kids friendly and my daughter loved it!!  Highly recommended for family stay. I will certainly not think twice booking here for my future Macau visits!!",50
"I've stayed in this Conrad property in mid March 2016 because of a meeting nearby.  [1]  Due to my diamond membership, my room reservation is updated to a King premier suite, 3818, which consists of a bedroom with a comfortable King bed, a separate living room with flatscreen TV and nice sofa, a spacious dining area and study, and a big bathroom with a separate bathtub.  Since the weather is very foggy during my stay, I actually do not know if my room has a city view or not ... The Wi-Fi connectivity is above-par and there is a Ethernet connection available.

I do work out in their fitness center, which has a few treadmills, bicycles, and quite a number of weighting equipment, and a separate corner/room for yoga…",50
"After reading the reviews, I was sure no hotel could be this good, this often. I was wrong. The hotel is lovely, the staff and service exceptional. It is hard to find fault, and only a few minor things broke the fantasy of a perfect hotel stay. From the time we booked, the hotel engaged with us via email to understand our needs, our specific requirements were met in every way, and both rooms were upgraded. The staff always greeted us by name, and we had two lively evenings enjoying champagne in the executive lounge, being looked after with panache and humour by wonderful Marvin. On checking out, Ivan was attentive, helpful, and keen to have us back. Housekeeping by David and Sam was also top notch. We used the Bodhi spa while there, also good. Only minor faults, lounge in lobby…",50
"Have not stayed in a Conrad for a while, will look for it if I could at my next stay and definitely will be back here if I am back in Macau. Not the largest hotel here but just the way my family and I liked it. Not overcrowded and staff always have time for you. If u need anything in your room, they will be there in 5 mins.   Edmund and his crew at the concierge are most helpful on suggestions on where to eat locally and where to go with the family! So a daily affair for us to go and speak to them before we head off;).. Thanks guys for making it a great 3 nights for us in town!",50
"There's really nothing to complain about at the Conrad Macao.  It's an amazing hotel with a great, well trained staff.  They manage to tend to everything and make you feel as if you're a special guest.  There's also a great health and fitness club, and the executive lounge is in a league of its own.  A great property.",50
"All experience in Hotel is great.  most of all, they are very kind.  anytime they have a smile in face and are ready to hear what client say many people around me recommand this hotel for stay in macau, and it is not different what they said",50
This hotel is in a league of its own. The accommodation is up to the usual Conrad standard but the service is truly exceptional. Normally I would not chose to stay in a hotel on a casino strip but the attention to detail and personal service makes this a unique experience. I would definitely recommend. ,50
"This was simply the best hotel experience that we have ever had.  Pre-arrival emails and upgrades from concierge (Edmond). Fabulous huge suite upgrade on high floor with great view (Joanna at check-in).  Great lounge food and beverage, and staff (Chanel).  Wonderful breakfast at the Grand Orbit.  Very attentive Grand Orbit staff.  Massive buffet and huge variety of foods.  Free shuttles to and from ferry terminals.  Best Conrad in the portfolio.",50
"It was my first stay in Macao. I really concerned about new place. But there is a Very nice conciergy team. They are recommend restaurant, shuttle bus, Casino, ETC. So I really satisfy my trip at Conrad Macao.",50
"I stayed at this hotel in late February. As a diamond member, I was upgraded to Club Suite as the hotel side is always generous to Hilton loyal members. The suite is very big and we couple are very delighted. I am a very strict traveler with sleep quality. The hotel side also provides varieties of pillows which highly meet my satisfaction. The hotel side also have a lot of alcohol beverages during happy hours. The only disadvantage is that, the hotel side provides fewer hot dishes at that time. Nevertheless, this is my priority when I plan to re-visit Macau.",50
"From the initial email from Edmund Tan acknowledging our reservation, to the unexpected meet and greet at the airport and the upgrade to a luxurious suite, our stay in Macao at The Conrad could not have been bettered.    Everything and everybody exceeded our expectations.  Chanel and her team in the Executive Lounge could not have been more welcoming and helpful.  The breakfasts and Afternoon Tea were delightful and thoroughly enjoyed.   Thank you sincerely to all for making our stay so enjoyable.",50
"Stayed here during a week long stay in Macao, very nice and lavishly laid out rooms, nice attention to detail and all... That's about all it had to offer really... If you not into gambling then you will become board pretty quickly... Breakfast was disappointing for the standard one would expect...",30
"Bell boy is helpful.  HOWEVER, I was upset by the front desk and your hotline's colleague.   29/FEB is my wedding anniversary. I have requested a ""surprise"" during on-line booking. While checked in (on 28/FEB), front desk informed me that the "" surprise"" will be on 28/FEB/16. I corrected him immedialety and requested the ""surprise"" on 29/FEB/16  Unfortunately, a cake with the welcome letter delivered on 28/FEB/16. Even the name of my wife is stated wrongly in the envolpe.  I have written down my request during the on-line book via your website I have called the hotline before my jourary to double confirm the requested can be done on 29/FEB However, the surprise came 1 day before what i requested.    What a big surpise to me.",20
"Conrad hotels have a good reputation for looking after their guests and this hotel lived up to its name. Escorted up to the Executive lounge to check-in and upgraded to a very large lounge room with a cinema like feature room in a vegas like suite. The canopes in the lounge were spicy type dishes but I washed them down with some signature cocktails.😀😀 The layout for breakfast in the morning was one of the best breakfasts I have ever had. It had everything from Hong Kong dishes, Indian dishes and the normal western dishes. Everywhere I went in the hotel, someone was there to make sure my experience was lasting.  The pool area is set out well and overlooks the vegas like hotels in the back ground. On check out concierge even walks you to the shuttle bus down the road to get back…",50
"Had my 2nd stay (as a couple this time) at the property over the weekend and things were still very much excellent. Upgraded suite was definitely huge & spacious as always, well-fitted & stocked with amenities of high standard. Happy to see familiar faces (like Chanel & Gallant, missed out on Diana this time round) in the club lounge, who still remember you despite the many guests visiting each day. F&B quality in the lounge remains at a high level, with a good variety in the Grand Orbitz morning buffet breakfast. All staff we came across provided polished & personal service.  The Tripadvisor ranking doesn't lie and despite the many new competitors in the City (e.g. St Regis, Studio City), Conrad Macao manages to stand out and stays at the top of the game.",50
"It has been a while since I have given 5 stars to a hotel and write a review. I am happy to do it for Conrad Macau!   From the minute we stepped in the hotel, we were greeted with courtesy and smiles. We checked in to a one bedroom suite which is spotless and well appointed. The executive lounge served evening cocktails and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of wine and especially the smoked salmon served, which is of decent quality.  We came to Macau to take a overnight breather from our toddler but we found the attached shopping mall has a kids floor with surprisingly good selection of toys and clothes etc. as well as play area, so we are considering coming with kids next time. There is also a decent food court so one is not limited from hotel food.  We chose to have…",50
"When I am to reserve a hotel to stay in Macao, the first name is always Conrad! The way I was served was really friendly with comfort. I can find or order everything I need in my room. And the experience every time was different yet always pleasant.",50
"From the time we arrived at this hotel to the time we left, we were completely amazed at the customer service - especially Arnisah at Front Desk and Chanel at the Executive Lounge.  Lovely hotel with amazing staff - can't wait to come back!",50
"I had 3 delightful stays at this hotel, and regardless of your membership, their staff at the entrance treat you well and warm, once your membership is recognized, you may be invited to check in at 39F club lounge. During my first visit in 2015, Concierge manager had surprising arrangements when I informed it was my first time taking my parents on a trip, and my parents were really impressed, so we came back again this year, and will so on every next year. Last month when I took my parents to visit again, lounge staff kindly hosted my parents to dinner cocktail while I was checking in, thank you so much, since it was kind of late and they were hungry. Also the room type was upgraded generously based on membership tier during every stay which meant a lot, as well as having the…",50
"We are very excited about our stay at your wonderful hotel with perfect service. My room was very comfortable, clean and perfect service. For my daughter birthday, i got a lovely birthday card with sweet cake. It was the very touching. I'm very pride of visiting the Conrad Macao again. I will visit again.",50
"We checked the tripadvisor reviews before made our reservation, couldn't agree more with the others. Had a fantastic stay in Macau Conrad, from front desk, concierge to housekeeping, staff were super friendly and extremely helpful. We left a wallet in the shuttle bus to the hotel, didn't realize it until check-in. With the help from Conrad, within an hour, the wallet was back to our hands, they really saved our vacation!",50
We stayed here for one night in February with lounge access . I was upgraded to a suite with two large beds and a separate living area. There is a shopping centre attached to the hotel and many restaurants including grand Orbitz where breakfast lunch and dinner buffet is served. This is a perfect hotel traveling with kids for the room size and also little gifts given with the baby cot and also Conrad bears which I collect .   It is very clean and everyone very helpful organising transport arrangements this was my first time in Macao and we all were very impressed !,50
"I stayed here for 3 nights on a leisure trip. My room was on 11th Floor - very comfortable, clean and spacious! Received a nice birthday cake and fruit platter on our first day, followed by a box of pralines on our 2nd day. Front desk, concierge and housekeeping staff were very friendly and helpful. Thanks to Cecilia, Edmund, Sammy, Edward and Janes.  All in all I had a very pleasant stay and would definitely come back!",50
"Lovely stay in macau!! Conrad Macau really made my stay memorable, best hotel in macau! From the moment we stepped in until we left, specially to Arnisah who made our stay memorable and made me want to stay longer in Macau, thank you for your sweet kindness.",50
"This hotel definitely knows how to treat its guests.  We were upgraded to a lovely suite with sumptuous decor, comfortable bed and bedding, lush robes to snuggle into and a wonderfully deep bathtub.  Check in was easy and swift on the club floor reception. The club floor also has a small dining area with constant refreshments including breakfast, day snacks, afternoon tea, pre-dinner drinks and light meals.  Breakfasts are especially easy and they have all that you would need. If what you want is not immediately in your view it's only a request away. Treated very well.  Attendants are attentive without being intrusive and so very polite and efficient.  The Bodhi Spa experience is definitely worth the indulgence. We chose the 2 hour ultimate aromatherapy experience and felt…",40
"I am not a big fan of gentrified Macau, but if you are going there, this is a fantastic hotel.  The service was punctual and delivered with a smile. The room service was reasonably priced and actually tasted very good.  It is inside a big shopping centre which offers complimentary shuttle to the airport. ",50
It was indeed a fantastic experience staying at a the Conrad 5-Star luxury hotel in Macau. Upon arrival I took the free hotel shuttle bus from the Ferry Terminal to the hotel. The bus ride was fast and efficient.The team members were very helpful and friendly.The room was lovely and the ambience was cosy.Thank you for making my stay in Macau very memorable. Well done..!! ,50
"They are really top-notched.  Emailed a week before to coordinate our visit. Inquired about our kids' age and interests.  Had things ready for them even though we got delayed and checked in at 11pm.  The room was amazing.  My family did not want to leave the room, alas.  Their concierge took it upon themselves to ask about our plans and commuting back to Hong Kong.  It was apparently rush season and they were worried that we didn't anticipate the ferries would be sold out.  They GOT us the requisite tickets so that we wouldn't be stranded in Macao.  I would not consider going anywhere else, really.",50
"My wife and I stayed in Conrad Macao to celebrate our wedding anniversary from 16/2-18/2. All the hotel staffs were very friendly, helpful and nice. And they arranged a cake for us to celebrate our anniversary. I highly recommend Conrad Macao to all the visitors who travel to Macau. And for sure I will come back to Conrad Macao in the near future.",50
"We recently visited Macau and had the pleasure of staying at the Conrad there.  Everything during our stay was perfect!  The hotel was very nice and a great location.  We enjoyed the best service from check in to check out.  The staff was extremely attentive and anticipated our every need!  Special thanks to the pool staff who stood by in the cold rain while we enjoyed the hot tub and swam, just to make sure we had dry towels and hot tea!  That is truly going above and beyond! The fantastic team at the Conrad are what make this hotel so amazing! Special thanks to Sophie at the front desk and Christina at the pool! Bruce and Sherry from Colorado.",50
My boyfriend and I booked the hotel for Sunday night for a quick relaxation tour. We had a great time in their spa and well taken care by the front office team. Front office Eva helped a lot!  Room is bright and clean with a nice view. Will definitely come back and stay longer next time.,50
"My Wife and I were coming from a stay at a Mandarin Oriental, so we had lowered our expectations for the Conrad Macau. Being Hilton Honnors Gold members we were given an upgrade to an imense suite, really big, so this was a plus.  Also, this being a Casino Hotel we did not expect great service but overall the Conrad Macau exceeded our expectations and whenever we go back to Macau we would probably stay there once again. A special thank you to Mr. Edmund Tan from the concierge desk who made us feel very welcome. Clean, large, comfortable, but not a luxury hotel.",40
"Spent a weekend in Macau and booked the Conrad based on TA reviews. Hotels in Macau are really expensive and decided to splurge a bit and I was happy I chose the Conrad.   Seamless transfer from Taipa Ferry terminal (Free) takes 5 to 10 minutes. Super fast check-in. Huge luxurious room with amazing bathroom. Great service. Express check-out. Free wifi connection in all Sands complex. Their breakfast buffet at The Grand Orbit restaurant was excellent too. Service provided by all staff also 5*.   It is walking distance to Venetian, Four Seasons and City of Dreams. Studio city a bit further down the road but also very walkable. Within the same complex there are other hotels (St. Regis, Holiday Inn, Sheraton) and my friends staying at cheaper hotels and they were also quite happy…",50
"Just checked-in for Honeymoon... Front desk staff AMAZING! My first room smelled like smoke, was given a new room. Fantastic! Tried to order two dozen roses for the Mrs. while she was in the spa... was told by the flower shop that I couldn't since they close at 7pm... but I was calling at 6:45?... what is the logic... !?!?! Anyway, still highly recommend this hotel! ",50
"I seldom write a review in trip advisor. I write only when I found something very good or very bad. This time I stayed in an excellent hotel. Before my arrival, I requested for baby cot and high chair for my baby. My requests were addressed and the replies were prompt.   We were impressed at what we saw in the room: Bottle heater, bottle steamer, baby bath tub, mustela package (cream....), diapers, souvenir for baby, chocolate, high chair, baby cot, baby slipper.....  We were also provided with adjoining rooms!   The service is excellent!",50
"Just to let you know, Macau has a lot of smoking allowed hotels, and even though request a non-smoking room, sometimes you can still smell the smoke.  Or even if the room is non-smoking, the whole floor is not.  I experienced this problem in Singapore.  So travelling to Macau, I mainly chose this hotel because it has a no smoking policy.  If this is important to you, then there is nothing more that you need to know.    But if you need further advice, I can tell you that this hotel is luxurious and comfortable.  It takes you away from the hussle and bussle, and the crowds, and the pollution.  It is also very quiet, though a bit obscure (the taxi driver didn't know where this was - though he did know the Holiday Inn).  The shops in the complex are also a bit quieter and more…",50
Everything about the hotel is first class. Free shuttle from the pier was very useful. As diamond members we were upgraded to a really huge suite with fantastic views over the pool and the Venetian.  The executive lounge staff are just so helpful and attentive. The selection of canapés are up to and indeed beyond many conrads.  Perfect 4 night stay as a stopover from uk to Australia ,50
"It is easily understandable why this is one of the best hotels in Macau.  In a place with so many five star hotels this hotel really sets itself apart in terms of service.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  The rooms are stylishly decorated, spacious and comfortable.  The hotel is also baby friendly, providing us with a baby bath (complete with a duck for our little one), cot, steriliser and bottle warmer.  There is a free shuttle bus that transport us from the ferry terminal to the hotel.  Free shuttle to the town can be obtained from the hotel next door, City of Dreams up to 5:00pm. Although we didn't enjoy Macau much (too crowded), the hotel makes up for our trip.  We really had a wonderful experience at the hotel",50
"As a couple or family, we venture to Macau quite often because it is so close to Hong Kong. So in general we have stayed at most of the different Hotel Rooms in Taipa. For those new to Macau, Taipa is where most of the newly developed Casino resorts are such as Venetian, City of Dreams, Studio City, Galaxy etc. The Conrad is part of the Sands development and is probably the most luxurious out of the 3 hotels situated in this compound. The other 2 are Holiday Inn and the Sheraton of which we have stayed at all 3.   If you have come across our reviews you will have noticed, we try basically everything in the hotel and really test out both the service and food and of course the surroundings. I would like to take this moment to start our individual Bolognese Index. If you have…",40
We spent a night over Chinese New Year (we wished it was longer). A very enjoyable and relaxing stay. We decided to order in room dining and were delighted by the high standards in food and service. Will be definitely staying again. It was perfect!,50
The junior suite we booked are very nice and comfortable. We stayed with kids and they like the rooms so much.  All amenities are good quality and well prepared in rooms. So you no need to worry if you fotgot to bro ng something.. The hotel room just like your home which you can find anything you want here.  I alway choose Conrad as my stay at Macau just like back to my home.  This is high recommended hotel to all of you. You wont regret it.,50
"The room was pricey but nice. Great amenities and bathtub with a tv. The lobby is a bit misplaced as you have to go through the shopping mall. Not so nice if you come from the pool. The pool was closed which meant the neighbor pool had to be used. Pool staff were very friendly and pleasant. Pool was fortunately heated but very small. The internet was included in the room. Unfortunately only 3 devices and with phones, iPad and computer it is not enough. Also the internet disconnect all the time and it is a hassle to long in all the time.",40
"The staffs were friendly and efficient. Lobby has enough bling while remaining tasteful. Rooms were large. The selection of restaurants was good, and if one wanted even more choice, Sands Cotai & Venetian Shops are connected to the hotel with numerous food outlets. The gym’s equipment is well maintained with a steam room, sauna and Jacuzzi. The Front Desk staff, Isac was  vibrant, alert, and attentive to any and all needs. I believe all guests here will say they made a fine and wise choice to stay at the Conrad Macao.  I will definitely return! ",50
It is wonderful experience staying in Conrad Macau. The hotel owns excellent facility and very good service as well.Everyone will have good memory and enjoy the journey. I recommend to all tourists who will visit Macau. Thanks,50
"Having been to  most of the hotels in Cotai Strip,  I can now state that this would be the best out there at the moment (haven't tried St. Regis yet). Rooms are spacious and meet all the ticks of a 5 star(though nothing exceptional),  it's the service that set apart this hotel from others. Each and every member of the conrad team that I've come across was trying to offer their best.   On the flip side,  the buffet breakfast was just average and for the two nights I stayed there the breakfast menu remained the same.   If you  like to stay in a property where it's not crowded with bus loads of tourist and would like a spacious rooms then go for it.  You  wouldn't be disappointed.    People -  that's makes the difference.  This is very true with this hotel.  ",50
"Stayed here with family in Dec 2015. Facilities to service exceeded expectation. They always find way to attract the kid and personalize features. Excellent front desk, concierge and guest services.  Good location. Attached with Cotai Central Shopping mall and walking distance to Venetian Macau, Grand Canal Shoppes and etc. shuttle service always available to transit guest from Hotel to another Hotel and 5-8 mins to Macau International Airport and Taipa Ferry Terminal.  Will recommend Conrad Macao to all guests. Thanks and will return again. ",50

Reception just escort you to top 39th floor Club Lounge for checkin formakities, who then escort you to the room.  Club Lounge has breakfast, teatime offering then evening canapes and drinks (eg cocktails, beers, sparkling wine).  Also had nice b/f in ground floor restataurant.  Nice big cups of cappucino coffee Really sumptuous suite, comfy bed, comfy sofas.  Would be great for families with different aged kids as could have a TV each to watch.

Room was big and has nice view of the pool and venetian. has complimentary espresso and tea. the pillows were soft and fluffy. the bed though was a bit hard for me. but overall its nice, comfy friendly and attentive staffs the moment you enter the hotel. checkin and check out process is fast. it has great value for money. I will definitely stay here again.",50
"Because of big sale, booked 1 night to celebrate my husband's birthday.   We have arrived around 12 something and have early check-in and upgraded to suite.  The bedding is so comfortable and room is well-equipped.  Big size hairdryer is wonderful for long hair ladies! We have went to gym room around 8pm, this was my first time to use gym room during travelling.  There are free lesson everyday, which can be checked on their website.  The gym room is so nice and have various equipment.  We have enjoyed Jacuzzi very much. Everything was so great but unluckily when we were sleeping, suddenly all the night has been lighted up at 3am!  We have tried to took out key card but still nothing happened.  I called front desk for maintenance, technician had came to our room.  After several…",50
"We stayed at the King Deluxe Suite City View and it was beyond value for money. The room was opulent, the bathroom with massive rain shower and bathtub was an indulgent experience. It was a great room to relax, which was what we did.  The Chief Concierge, Edmund, was very kind and helpful with suggestions and advice for things to do and how to get around, and he's very friendly and lovely to chat to. The front desk staff, especially Vicky, was also so willing to help and was always gentle with her demeanor.  We love the turn down service - very nice little touches.  We had room service and the staff were always kind and respectful and always without fail asked us if they could further be of any help at the end. A delightful experience for us.  I really appreciated the great…",50
"Firstly a special mention for Queenie who checked us in to this fine hotel. She was extremely pleasant and took the time to take us all the way to our room, and then showed us around, giving us some Macao guidebooks along the way. First impressions are very positive, the lobby is very stylish as is the reception area. In that sense it is very different from some of the more tacky lobbies in Macao and its obvious counterpart Vegas. The rooms are magnificent. Large, tastefully decorated and with a great bathroom. We were only there for a short time but used the gym and  outdoor poor and both were high quality. A couple of the outdoor pools are nicely heated as well which helped in January. A walkway connects to the Venetian and Four Seasons which makes moving from one hotel to the…",50
"This hotel lives up to its reputation of its owners (the Hilton Group) offering consistantly good service. It is conveniently positioned in the middle of the strip, so with easy access to several casino's (if you want that), and also the shopping malls of the Venetian and Four Season's. Taipa village (Portugese colonial influence) is a twenty-five minute walk from the hotel. Cotai (the other colonial-influenced area) is a twenty minutye taxi ride. Whilst my room was impeccable, as with the overall level of service - especially from the Concierge, the breakfast area was a good ten minute walk from the lobby.",40
"We stayed at this great hotel, December 2915. A very good location with excellent service. The airport shuttle bus is free. The hotel is linked to a great shopping mall. Staff was very helpful and recommend this hotel.",50
"The Conrad Macau is located in the Catoi section of Macau. The area is built on reclaimed land to serve as the new center for gambling and entertainment for Macau. The hotel is walking distance to many of the other casinos, such as the Venetian and City of Dreams. If you are not into gambling and Vegas like attractions, the Macau Peninsula is a short cab ride away. The hotel provides a free shuttle from the Taipa Ferry Terminal for the ferry to and from Hong Kong.   The hotel is part of a large Sands Catoi Central Casino complex with a St. Regis, Holiday Inn and Sheraton hotel flanking the Conrad. All four hotels have separate lobbies. Hilton Gold and Diamond members have a private check-in desk adjoining their Executive Lounge. As to be expected in a world famous gambling…",50
"We had a wonderful stay at this place during our two days trip to Macau. Being a Conrad hotel, there is of course, no issues with cleanliness or the facilities available. The rooms are large, with all sort of facilities. However, what made the holiday memorable was the personal attention provided to us, thanks to the hotel management and I would like to specially acknowledge the personal touch provided by Arnisah. We reached before the check-in time, and were provided an early check-in without any fuss. We had requested for a room with a view of the Venetian, and we were provided with the same. Our nine year old daughter was very pleasantly surprised by a hand written card from Arnisah along with a gift left for her in the room. We took our dinner at the hotel for both nights,…",50

Each time I come back to this hotel, I look forward to it and feel so comfortable with the friendly staff and the gorgeous room that I feel so good and happy.",50
"Service was quite impressive, however minor issues were detected. First, I wanted to say thank you to Sofea at the front desk who let us checked in early and fulfilled all my requests in a promptly manner. She remembered everything I requested while I was checking in and even gave us a call to follow up after we've checked in to our room. My partner and I were staying in Macau for two nights but we only stayed at Conrad for one night and really regret not staying for another.   My partner was suffering severely with back pain and the hotel kindly offered someone to push him over in a wheel chair to Sheraton(where we stayed for the second night) to check in. We ordered room service for breakfast and the food was pretty good, the staff who sent the food over was very polite.  …",40
"We stayed at the Conrad in January travelling with our teenage daughter.  The room was gigantic so we were more than comfortable.  Everything you would expect from this 5 star hotel was delivered and nothing was too much trouble.  The Conrad is above a shopping mall connecting two other hotels.  A group of three ""The Sands"".  Thankyou for a wonderful stay.",50
"The Conrad is a beautiful hotel, the rooms are big and well decorated, it is located right on the strip and close to shopping and entertainment, but it is the staff that really makes it so special. We will be back, the best in Macau",50

"My wife and I stayed in a Deluxe Suite at the Conrad Macau a couple of weeks ago. Every month we book a hotel for a night to enjoy quality time together without the kids, and normally in Macau we stay in the Sheraton because of the quality of the personel. But our stay with Conrad was truly surprising. Every staff member I met, from Peter at the entrance, to Michael at Check-in, to the F&B staff who delivered a lovely wine and cheese platter and Housekeeping, everyone was friendly, efficient, well-spoken. the room was beautifully furnished and presented, and the facilities world class.   We will be staying at the Conrad Macau again, and will recommend to our friends.",50

From check-in, Lynn was friendly and attentive in gauging our needs to settle us in quickly. The bell boy was great in giving us the low down on how to use everything in the room. The room was a spectacle, from the decor to the linen to the mega bathroom.   The spa was also a treat along with the jacuzzi next to the ""arctic mist"" special shower ;) A great stay - no wonder this place is the 2nd best rated place in Macau.  Highly recommended for families, couples and solos!  Lynn was also superbd - Upgraded us from Junior Suite to Deluxe Suite!   Only slight knockback - the In-room dining menu was not as user-friendly as can be and the menu…",50

"The service at the Conrad was impeccable.  Everyone I encountered went out of their way to make sure my stay was as seamless as possible.  From the woman who checked me into my room to the housekeeping man who brought me a converter for my plug.  The Conrad Club had a very yummy breakfast with more great service and a beautiful view.  The bed was really comfortable, too.",50
"I have chosen Conrad to be the place to take my proposal to my girlfriend, have been there many times before so I am confident with the service they provide that this time as high levels as well. In touch with Diana and her team @ Conrad Lounge in advanced for 2 months for this proposal preparation and it came everything going smooth, great thanks to Diana and her team for their assistances and pre-arrangement given and also surprise when back into the room with a nice declaration offered by the hotel !! Everything happened on last sunday was unforgettable and I'm glad that I have chosen a right place for my life-time remarkable event and great thanks to Conrad and the team!",50
Second year to choose Conrad Macao as my wife's birthday celebration because of their exceptional guest service and luxury room products and facilities . Hotel maintenance still keep in high level. Staff was great as usual Conrad style. Will visit again next year definitely.,50
"Based on the internet review, I picked Conrad Macao and it turned out I made the right decision! Although I got there at 11am, which was earlier than their required check-in time, they got my family checked in with no hesistation. Then my room was automaticlly upgraded to city view, which really did not matter much to me, but heart-warming! My daughter was excited to see the little duck in the bathroom. Then the two cute teddy bears were smiling on my beds during the bed time, which again got my daughter's cheering. They would be perfect souvenirs from this visit. The most unforgettable event was when my daughter received the hand-writing welcome card from their hotel employee Arnisah and a birthday cake for myself, which would be one day later! What a nice surprise!! I was so…",50
"To celebrate my son's 8 years old birthday, I chose Conrad Cotai this time, and it was a fantastic experience that I would definitely recommend my friends to visit this hotel. Knowing my son's birthday, their guest officer Joana specially asked for his favourite cartoon character and sports in advance and prepared a dedicated birthday card to him. Apart from that, more ""surprises"" were arranged, including a complimentary cake and an unexpected upgrade of room for us!! We were so pleased with all these arrangements. All in all, the hotel is conveniently located at the central point of Cotai, close to shopping malls and playtowns and we will surely visit the hotel again! ",50
"Have visited Macao Conrad for numerous times, and they never disappoint. This time with my cousins and little niece for celebration of my birthday.  Diana the Club Manager greeted us personally during our check-in and wished me happy birthday.   My bday was 8th (Thurs)and we check in on 9th only, still the hotel has recognized my bday and kindly prepared a cake and a birthday card. And I haven’t received any physical bday/xmas/new year card for years. Thank you Diana!",50

"I had stayed at this property in 2014 and it is by far one of the most luxurious hotels i have stayed in around the globe. The service and promptness of the staff is fantastic and the rooms are gorgeous. I got to experience this promptness and kindness again this week when due to an illness i was unable to fly to Macau. Upon hearing my condition, i was promptly refunded my non-refundable booking for my 2 night stay. A special thanks also goes out to the staff at booking.com who helped co-ordinate this refund as i had used their site to make the booking in the first place. It's good to know humanity still exists. Thank you Conrad Macau, i look forward to staying again with you soon. Thank you Booking.com",50
"Stayed there just after Christmas Dec 2015 and my experience was amazing from checking in to checking out.  I was checked in by Lynn (I think that was her name but I am bad with names), she was extremely pleasant and then checked to ensure that we were happy with the room, and we were. Thanks Lynn, thanks Conrad, it is service like this that would keep me coming back to Conrad properties.  The Room was beautiful and extremely clean. The hotel on the whole was extremely clean.   Tip to travellers: this hotel is in Cotai so to get to old Macao (e.g. Senado square) using transit, you can take the hotel shuttle to the Ferry and from there take the public bus I think it is 3 dollars. You can check with the travel info at the ferry place",50
"We arrived by ferry and took the complimentary shuttle to the hotel. Beware that the shuttle doesn't stop directly in front of the hotel. First stop will be Holiday Inn then Sheraton. Conrad is situated in between. Probably best to alight at Holiday Inn as it's a shorter walk. The 3 hotels are joined together by luxurious stores where you can take a walk from one to the end. Once you're familiar, you'll realise that there are 6 hotels joined. You can go across to the Venetian without having to walk outside.  For first timers it's a bit confusing to look for the front desk as it's separated quite a distance to the lifts taking you to the rooms. No clear signs to indicate. Staff were friendly, well versed and professionals, especially the front desk. Queenie, was the staff who…",40
"Alva at the reception was excellent. The room was very comfortable. The only drawback is the door to the shower room cannot close properly leaving a big gap and there were no bath salts or bath liquid, therefore the rubber duckling placed at bath tub is wasted and do not have a meaning.",50
"Proud of myself picked Conrad for my 3 nights stay, an amazing spacious for our 104 feet deluxe suite, room luxury with sofa, comfortable queen bed, hugh bathroom. Room cleaning good just we had slow checkin in counter. Room service can be improved which misunderstanding our in-room breakfast order. Buffet breakfast nice, transport little crowded coz share the shuttle with attached hotels.",40
"Awaresome hotel with staff that are willing to go an extra mile to proffer better services for guests. To differentiate better good, average or poor hotel usually starts from basic human interaction. I think Conrad had done a good job here.",40
"I own diamond tier of hilton honors and got access to the  executive lounge and got my room upgraded to King city view suite. We enjoyed every single things in Macao during our stay in Hilton. Venetian is walking distance for shopping and dining. All staffs are very kind.  Especially, Ms. Renee Chen and Eva Ye was such a great host in the executive lounge. There were very welcoming and professional. I would love to visit Macao Conrad again to meet these kind staffs! Highly recommended!",50
"It was a complete delight to stay here..it has awesum rooms and is just a walk away from the mad rush of Venetian..so even though you are right in the heart of Macau, you are still away from the chaos..",50
"As a Diamond member, we used 40K Hilton points and spent 2 nights here on New Year's Eve and the New Year's Day.  Even though the hotel was booked full on NYE, the hotel still managed to get me an upgraded suite room.  We had room 2618.  It was an enormous suite with a living room and 1.5 bathrooms.  I contacted Edmund Tan prior to arriving to let him know we were celebrating an anniversary and he arranged for a cake to be brought to our room.  It was a nice touch.  This was the 8th Conrad we've stayed at around the world (Maldives, Bali, Hong Kong, Cairo, Tokyo, Bangkok, Koh Samui) and as far as room upgrade and service, it does not disappoint.  We flew into Macao and easily found the hotel shuttle.  It is the same shuttle for the Sands complex.  The bus dropped us off in front…",50
"My parents and I had a great experience staying in the Conrad Macao and we were impressed with their service and we were upgraded to a suite that we had plenty space to move around. We got a fantastic view room no matter it's day or night.  We also were able to use the executive lounge and all the staff in the lounge were delivered first class guest service and they even could call you by your name.  Two highlights: - I was so happy that I met Elvis in person who communicated with me prior to our arrival, helped me checked in and let us feel so welcoming.  - lobby lounge that you could not miss to visit. The snacks, drinks and staff there were excellent. Whenever we are in Macao, we must visit Lobby lounge.  Thanks Elvis, Diana and team to make our stay so wonderful. See you…",50
"The hotel service is good, and the room is quite nice and clean. The hotel is inside the Sanda center which is quite convenient for dining and shopping, or go to the casino. I enjoyed the whole staying at the Conrad Macao Cotai central hotel.",50
"My girlfriend and I spent our new year eve here and everything was perfect. The location is convenient to Venetian and Studio City which was great for us to browsing around. I loved the suite we stayed, the room was cozy, clean, spacious and beautifully furnished. The bed was hugh and super comfy, the hotel staff were extremely professional and courteous especially Mr. Galen at front desk.",50
"I'm a Hilton Gold member and I arrived @ midnight on January 1 from the US.  It was a long journey, but once I arrived at the Conrad ""I was at home""!   I was upgraded to a very big suite with a living & dining room, 2 bathrooms & a big king size bedroom.  I was upgraded & had access to the Executive Lounge which is wonderful.  I'm not sure how they do it, but I think all the staff knows my name which is very welcoming!  I have my breakfast there every morning which includes eggs made to order and a nice variety of fruits, breads, meats etc.  I also enjoy evening cocktails & appetizers from 5:30-8pm.  They have afternoon tea from 3-5pm, but have not gone.  They also have a lovely reading room in the lounge with books, newspapers, magazines & 2 tv's.  I have used the health club…",50
"I Really Have a best experience in this hotel. I already booked in their Junior Suite room, but they upgrade me to their Deluxe room which 1 and half bigger size and have a small watching room which become my daughter favourite room in that Suite room. The hotel In room Dining food is much better than the food in Food court in taste for just a little bit expensive.  And I also want give speciall appriciate for MISS CINDY in Reception / Front Desk which already serve me very well when check-in, which so much help about the hotel and macau.",50
"We've stayed at this hotel for new year eve, the location of this hotel is great and convenient, the room is spacious and cosy, the staff are friendly especially Mr. Galen who served us on the front desk as we had a little problem on our booking and we would like to thanks for his patient for solving it out.",50
"I stayed in Conrad for 2nd time, for 5 nights, and it was another awesome experience. Check-in was quick and hassle free. It was Ms. Eva Ye, a pretty lady, who received me. The check-in only took a few minutes and then she walked me through the big hall of the huge building to my room.  Eva explained where was the boundary of Conrad and Holiday Inn, and how to use the room key to initiate the elevator.  To me, she is just like  the Conrad's business card: of beauty, courtesy, hospitality, and taking care in detail.   Room was a suite, on 32nd floor. view from room was breathtaking. Everything in the room was extraordinary. Cleanness and upkeep was awesome.   Conrad's fitness room and Sauna room was really a gem. I like them very much. It is spacious and sunny and has all kinds…",50
"There is no flaw in the service we received at Conrad Macau. The rooms is super clean and well equipped. Staff is extremely nice and helpful, especially at the gym and spa facility. Definitely worth staying again and again.",50
"We booked an overnight stay to celebrate our anniversary, Alva and Conrad Cotai helped turn our HK runaway into a bless.    Hotel itself, was an oasis amongst jungle of casinos - checkin process was pleasantly smooth, Alva accompanied us from checking in to our room handover, she even arranged a lovely cake for our anniversary, ensuing the comfort and best satisfaction of our stay.  We also happily tried the Bodhi spa, with packages and treatments, thanks to the tips and suggestion from Alva, and the concierge desk, we left w smiles on our face.",50
"I dont need to mention that the rooms are great, and the hotel very nice. It is a 5 star Hotel in Macau. The difference lays in the Service. It was my forth visit this year, and as usual the service was perfect.  The team downstairs in the lobby, and upstairs in the Lounge are kind, friendly, professional and very efficient.  They make me feel at home in Conrad when I visit Macau. I have no remarks to make, just congratulate all the team and wish they continue the great job. See you soon.",50
Stayed for three nights over Christmas. Suite was excellent. I had not visited for 2-3 years and hotel has added Executive Lounge...this was very good addition and a Ms Chanel at the lounge was very pleasant and helpful.  There are several 5 star properties in this area; I've found The Conrad to be outstanding value in this area of Macau.,50
"We stayed here for 2 nights and it is indeed a luxury hotel with excellent service. We requested for a higher floor in our booking and were very pleased to have a room on level 34. The check in process was excellent and Galen who took care of our check in deserves special mention. He had macaroons delivered to the room for my little girl and she was delighted!  The room itself was lovely and spacious, with excellent room amenities. From the TV in the bathroom to the luxurious bathrobes, everything is designed for comfort.   We had a minor problem with the concierge when we booked tickets for the House of Dancing Water. He told us after the booking was completed that it was cash payment or a 5% service charge. I thought he should've explained it upfront but luckily the manager…",50
"hotel is quiet and exclusive unlike the popular ones in coati area. Highly recommended if you don't wish to shovel with the crowds. special mention to front desk Alva, she is pleasant courteous, professional and helpful. She personally escorted us to our rooms, explained the functions and gave recommendations and tips for a great stay. Also special mention to Edmund Tan, a local Singaporean at concierge who gave restaurant recommendations, tips on travel and valuable advice to keep away from crowds and peak hours jams. In a crowded hectic macau, this hotel is a pure bliss.",50
"I am extremely glad that I booked the Conrad. What's not to love? The location is stunning, the staff are delightful, and the rooms are superb. And the teddy bear is a nice little surprise, too! I will definitely stay here when I return to Macau.",50
"Super staff, wonderfully well-equipped room and lots of personal touches. A big plus was that our wall to wall window looked out on to The Grand Lisboa, which was a treat at night with the lights and colours changing every few seconds. :-) I would love to stay here again.",50
"The experience at the Conrad hotel was excellent from check-in to check-out, with good room service, house keeping, very good access to shopping, restaurants, and casinos. Asian hotels are always the best in term of value for money and Conrad proves it again. The only pet peeve I would have is the annoyance of the shower water dripping in to the dry bathroom area, more of a civil engineering correction.",50
I had a recent stay with Conrad Macau for my honeymoon trip. The suite room was Awesome and nice to stay. My wife & I enjoyed our stay in Conrad for 3 nights. All the hotel staffs are very friendly to us. Hotel management was so nice to give us a complimentary Honeymoon cheesecake & even nicer they noticed 1 of the day was my birthday & gave me a birthday dessert. I am so touched with Conrad's warm hospitality & if i am back to Macau again i definitely will stay again in Conrad.,50
"This is our second stay at the Conrad Macao on the Cotai strip. This hotel is newer and everything is still very modern, clean, and updated. They recently added an executive lounge for guests (paying the executive room rate or having hhonors gold/diamond status) and it was a welcome addition. Lots of snacks and beverages available throughout the day. No views from the lounge, but the servers greet you by name! Gallant was especially attentive and helpful, but everyone was amazing. We were upgraded to a suite as a hhonors gold, which was very nice. I am always treated so well here that I never want to leave! The hotel bus also takes you to/from the ferry terminals which is convenient. Really great hotel with really great staff.",50
We have booked our room directly via Conrad and the follow up by Elvis Wen was fantastic and greatly appreciate the kind arrangement for our family. Conrad service is never lacking and we glad we made the right choice to stay with them. The Shrekfast was fantastic for the kids and they have enjoyed themselves very much. Took a lot of photos and we wished they have a bundle price for getting all the photos :)  The room is spacious and clean and comes with great wifi. Easy access to other hotels around the area with free shuttle bus. The signature Conrad bear is a great personal touch for the guest and the kids are asking for more. Everything is perfect and we will definitely choose to stay with Conrad again.  Thumbs up for the great service which make our holiday perfect!!,50
"A real 5 star hotel. Good concierge, fabulous room and facilities. Silent environment and good view. Would be even greater if more choice of transportation. The restaurant is worth trying. Next time will try the SPA package.",50
"my first time in Macau and Conrad just gave me what I needed.  Definitely will start booking with Conrad hotels around the world. Comfortable bed, most friendly staff, quite rooms, great environment! I don't really like to be around crowd so this hotel just gives you enough space for vacation!",50
"I have read a lot of good review for the Conrad Macau. I never thought of I will have chance to experience it. Few days ago, I decided to go for a short trip together with my long lost friends. They suggest Macau. Without further delay, I made room booking @ Conrad Macau.  The conceirge team were the one who first contact me. They want to know my eta time, and ofer some assistant if we need for any show, dine, etc. I impressed. On arrival day, the reception girl did her job, by explaining to us all the HHonors gold VIP entitlement at the hotel, which inclusive upgrade to suite room, lounge benefits, and many more. She then led us to our room, and explain again all the room features to us. It is a premier suite, which come with separate living hall, dining table for 4, av room…",50
"The service was beyond excellent. Rooms are beautifully decorated with every single amenity imagined provided. Free Wifi. After long day out exploring the city of Macau, this hotel provides the best relaxation for any tired guest. From the moment we walked into the hotel to the time we walked out, I can find no fault in this hotel. Perfect.",50
"Wifi connection is only satisfactory.  It has room for improvements.  Guests should not be required to re-login after every 12 hours of use.  Furthermore, I was advised by the front desk that there was a winter get-away package which offers special room rate on Dec 6.  However, when I try to book it online, I could not find such package deal anywhere because I was automatically directed to the HHilton website. Overall, I am very pleased with my experience staying in Conrad.  The service and the room quality are all top form with no complaints.  The bathroom qualtiy is exceedingly well considered the price that I paid.  A very pleasant exprience staying in Conrad.",50
"This was my 6th stay at Conrad Macao Cotai Central. Being Conrad, the room and the environment can be expected to be excellent, which they are. However, I keep on coming back because the uniqueness of the its service. Every time I stayed here, I felt that I was genuinely welcome by all the staffs I met because they truly appreciated I chose their hotel. For every request I made, they didn't just fulfill it, staffs went the extra mile to make me feel I'm someone special to them. Just a phenomenal service.   If you arrive at Hong Kong International Airport like me, the connecting ferry trip to Macao is straightforward. Simply follow the ""Ferry Transfer to China/Macao"" sign and you will see all ferries' ticking windows. Once arrived in Macao, shutter buses just wait outside the…",50
"The hotel was clean, amenities were plentiful, and the employees were all great. Would definitely stay again. Also the complimentary teddy bear on the bed left during turn down service was sooo cute :)",50
"The ambience of the hotel is very good you'll feel relaxed. The room has very beautiful view and well maintained. The concierge is very friendly and helpful in recommending/ securing tickets to shows and places of interest. There is a bar on the ground floor which serves amazing cocktails. The shoppings, clubs and casinos are also easily accessible nearby with dedicated taxi/limousine line outside the lobby.",50
"Stayed with a couple of buddies of mine on trip around China.  Service was great!  Room was huge, one of my friends was Hilton Honors gold status so we wetter upgraded to very large suite with living room, dining area, and extra bathroom.  We also had access to the club lounge which was great.  Wish we could've stayed longer.",50
Lucky to win the discount price for the kind 388for a night and we plan for a little getaway trip. The first time with my months baby. Hotel send a warm email for asking any needs and i told them i am with my baby and they prepare all the needs before we arrive.   Amazing and impressive.  No need the wait for check in.

And send more waters etc. Very sweet and…,50
"This was our 3rd trip to the Conrad while visiting Macau and we would find it hard to stay anywhere else.  While other hotels in the area are outstandingly bling, the Conrad gives you a feeling of luxurious restraint while being close to all amenities.",50
Stayed here for a few nights in October for our first wedding anniversary.   My wife and I were discussing the stay afterwards and came to the conclusion that the stay with Conrad Macao has been THE BEST hotel we have ever stayed in. The high level of service we received from the team was just phenomenal and we really felt quite special. I've stayed in many great hotels over the years both for business and pleasure so I do not use that term lightly.  You're made to feel like all the staff know you and are grateful for your visit which is rare in such a large hotel.   The suite we had was outstanding and perfect in every single way.   Every single member of staff we spoke to were just wonderful so I'd like to acknowledge:  Francois  Yumi Renee Lorin Raymond Gallant Sarah Ysa…,50
Great location. Very nice rooms. Great quality. Prace is worth the quality.  Good for business and holidays. Great swimming pool. Great restaurants. Great service. Connected with an internal bridge to the Venetian. Great bus service (free of charge) fron ferries to hotel.,50
my room was beautiful and had a great view of the pool area. The bed was very comfy and had down pillows just like I have at home. The service was amazing and the pillow and bath gifts were very cute. I would definitely stay longer next time!,50
"We stayed 2 nights at this amazing hotel in a King Premier Suite (we were upgraded from the king deluxe suite because of our HH status) and although we've stayed in some large suites throughout the years, nothing quite compares to the size and grandeur the Conrad had in store for us on this trip. The suite comprised of a massive dinning/lounge room, media room, guest bathroom, massive bedroom (with another lounge suite) and a colossal main bathroom with spa bath and shower big enough to fit 6 adults!...not that we tested that theory mind you ;-) The hotel itself is connected to several large hotels (Holiday inn, Sheraton and the St Regis) and even connected to the Venetian via covered walkway. There are a plethora of big name shops and several casinos located in the complex, so…",50
"i bought the special offer from promotion in a very reasonable price, but the service they provided are surprised me feeling excellent ! the day before i go, i received their email from manager to remind me and asked which type of bed i would like to choose, then i requested two double bed, then they offered me a two queen size bed without any condition.  Rooms was very luxurious with lot of space, and got 2 bears and a duck as souvenir.  mother and i went there and receiving us was the manager that emailed me, and introduced the facility to us very detail, much appreciated they still treat us very good not because we bought the cheap promotion XP  on the other hand, the MUST write item is my mother was lost her mobile in one of the casino, but she finally can find back from the…",50
"It was tough initially deciding on a hotel in Macao as there are simply too many choices but i was glad the reviews here bought me over. We stayed 3 nights in a Junior Suite and wished we booked for more! Mr. Edmund Tan emailed prior to our visit with handy tips, suggestions and offers to book restaurants and shows etc. Lovely Amila checked us in and showed us to our room and very patiently answered all our questions regarding where to go and what to eat. Fantastic start to a wonderful stay. Thumbs up to all the room service and evening turn down service staff, the best I've ever encountered. The hotel is new, and the room is cleaned immaculately daily. It is luxurious and tastefully decorated without the opulence that makes one feel stifled. We loved having our breakfast in the…",50
Rooms was very luxurious with a lot of space. I really like then bathroom which was very spacious and they provided aromatherapy soap. Very nice. Overall great experience. Easy access to shopping area. I tried eating at one of the Italian restaurant Bene. It served great Italian food and seafood as well. Enjoyed the meal. Of course all hotels in Macau comes with a Casino. ,40
"Spacious room with King bed with sofa, writing desk, two closets, bath and shower. Complementary provides candies and the little bear with hotel name which is unique. Having the coffee anytime as there is capsule coffee machine in room. Hotel offered the tasty Tiramisu to us for celebrating birthday which is very nice. It's convenience to buy the ferry tickets at Concierge directly.  Difficult to access the reception and it's far away from the guest lift. The staff said there are nothing to see as construction areas surrounding or the higher floor seeing opposite building. The dices in the plastic duck are sticking together, seems unclean. No milk powder provided so you can only have black coffee. Some of the drinks in minibar are sticking as well. Small outdoor swimming pool.",30
"My wife and I enjoyed our stay at this hotel in late October.  Its facility and amenities meet the standards of five-star hotels in Las Vegas, but its customer service exceeds that in any hotels in Las Vegas.    Our room has a nice view facing the Venetian and it is clean and spacious.  The bathroom has a separate tub and shower with necessary supplies and more.  One thoughtful amenity is there is a 110V voltage transformer, which is helpful for travelers from the US.  Michael helped us with check-in and check-out.  He was exceptionally courteous and professional.  He accompanied us to the elevator after we checked in and escorted us to the door after we checked out.  Other staff was also polite, attentive and helpful.  I highly recommend this hotel.",50
"We first stayed at the Conrad Macao almost one year ago and each time we come, they are always on top of their game. The rooms, each a spacious oasis of tranquility away from the excitement of the casinos. The lounge, I could get fat and very happy just attending their breakfast, tea and evening drinks. The people, this is what truly sets the Conrad Macao apart. Diana Brewer and her team ensure that each of our stays has been memorable, attending to every detail. This visit, our first with our newborn, I asked for a crib in the room. Upon arrival, the crib was set up, a bottle warmer and sterilizer waiting and the cutest Baby Conrad box, complete with miniature slippers and bib, stocked for our comfort. They continually outdo themselves. Thank you for making us feel so welcomed!",50
"It is the staff here that makes this hotel so different and special.  We were being upgraded to suites which were beautifully appointed. The suites are huge with a big living room and bathrooms and of course with all the amenities you would expect from a hotel of this class.  What really impressed me was one detail which I had never encountered in all my travels - when I returned to my room, I saw the Room Attendant had neatly tied up 2 charges with a piece of band (like what you have when you purchase a new charger) and placed them neatly inside a box on the desk so you can really see the kind of details they go into and how well trained the Room Attendants are.  All the staff members we encountered throughout our stay were all very polite,courteous and show willingness to help…",50
"We stayed recently at Conrad Macao Cotai central and the service provided to us at reception by Arnisah and at the concierge counter by Cliff was five star. Both employees made sure our stay was pleasant, stress free and comfortable. We were given an upgrade upon arrival, shown to our room not only by the Porter but also Arnisah who went out of her way to make sure we knew where everything was and how everything worked. Both she and Cliff realized that our return Jet ride back to Hong Kong was going to take us to the wrong place and went to great lengths to make sure we were aware of this making our trip back to Hong Kong easier than it might have been. They were very informative about free shuttle buses and the best way to see both Tapai and Macau, making our stay very worth…",50
"I've stayed in many hotels in Macau, and this hotel was by far the nicest. Attentive staff, clean and large rooms, nice pool and gym. It's a little bit more expensive than the attached Sheraton and Holiday Inn, but it's worth it.",40
Was surprised to receive a pre-trip contact from their Customer Service before I travelled to confirm all relevant matters on checking in.  Truly a wonderful experience using their Executive Lounge services...  Probably one of the best from all my stays over the years!,40
"Conrad in Macao is really amazing. From the first moment until the last one was everything amazing. Great amd very frindly staff, aalways trying to help you. Amazing breakfast. Very good location close to all casinos around. I would definitely come again! ",50
"I have stayed at the Conrad Macau more than five times, and every time it keeps getting better. Great staff that really takes care of the guests, amazing room product. As a Hilton Honors gold member, I always get recognition and special attention, yet I am sure they do the same to all guests. I highly recommend if you want a great stay.",50
"This is the best hotel that I have stayed at in Macau.  The services from check-in to check-out are excellent.  The rooms are very comfortable.  You can just melt into the bed.  I have the view facing the Venetians and Crown, and it's beautiful.  The turn-down service is nice - it practically cleaned up your room; replace sheet and towels where necessary, provide plentiful of water; and like most Conrad and many Hiltons, it comes with a cute bear.  Also, upon check-in, there is a complimentary lolly in your room.  I am not a lolly person, but that lolly is specially made for Conrad (it was ""Conrad Macau"" written INSIDE each lolly), and it was the best lolly I've ever had.  I will go back to the Conrad just for the lolly ... and the bear ... and the divine sleep ... and the…",50
"Once the staff recognized that I was a Diamond Member, they immediately thanked me for my loyalty and added extra effort to make me feel welcome and comfortable.  I appreciated how kind, caring, and hospitable the staff was- especially the executive lounge manager name Frandt.  He was of great help to me throughout my stay.  I will definitely recommend this hotel to all my friends and business associates.",50
One of my favourite hotels on the planet. Property is easily accessed and in a central location. Great property surpassed only by highly professional staff. Enjoyable as a  quiet getaway or for all the activities that Macau has to offer. Have been to this property several times and quality and consistancy same high standards each visit. Recommended without hesitation.,50
"Conrad Hotel in Macao is one of the places that I would always stay, either business or pleasure and I always recommend to my clients because I would like them to have the same experience as me. It is always ready to check you in and understands that you came long way, they do not wait for after 2pm. I don't know if that is only for Diamond members but if you don't ask, you will never know. A very satisfied client.",40
The hotel staff provided excellent service starting from your first step to the hotel. The reception warmly welcomes your stay. She also discovered this visit is on my birthday. She bless my birthday and provided a compliment birthday cake and birthday card at night as a surprise gift. This is a very special present for the guest like me. I was deeply impressed by the service by the team.   The suite was wonderful and luxurious. The room is tidy and comfort. This is wonderful environment for our leisure stay. The hotel also locates close to the major landmarks in Macau. This is a wonderful and the best 5 stars resort for my frequent visit to Macau and it worths for every dollar I paid both for the service and facility in Conrad Macau. I would surely recommend this hotel for my…,50

"Great Stay in the most peaceful part of Macau. New luxurious hotel with rooms that are bigger than norm, great amenities. great location, lots of shops around. great service.  the food choices in and around the hotel are quite poor. if you are staying on the executive floor and or are a hilton honors member, do not waste your time in the executive lounge, as the food and offerings are just not there, i am not even sure why they have the lounge?? the staff in the lounge are extremely friendly and helpful and are quick to recognize you by name.",50
"Pro :  Best service that we have ever seen, comfy rooms, over the top bellhop and frontdesk, beyond call of duty concierge. Great location.  Con: Slightly confusing layout from the sheer size of the place, bring a map. I don't want to leave this place.    Our party came to Macau for a few days before ferrying over to Hong Kong for a tech conference. Since Yelp wasn't available in these country, we were just going to hit the ground running and rely on web info and locals for what to do and what to see. Thank god for the staffs at Conrad to completely removing all of our worries once we showed up at the hotel.   The bus ride from the airport to the hotel was a bit confusing, the labels was Holiday Inn, Conrad and one more hotel that I don't recall, so that was kind of a gamble on…",50
"You know when you walk in the door and the hotel staff make you feel like you are their only guest? That's how we felt at the Conrad Macao! There are a few 5 star properties in Macao, but I am so glad I picked this hotel! It is not the most elaborate resort in Macao, but it is very nice!  We were doing a 3 week trip thru Asia. I really wanted to see the House of Dancing Water show. I also wanted to see the new Macao. Last time I went to Macao was 1997. So Macao is now this huge, grand gambling city! I had good amount of Hilton HHonors points and this hotel has a great reputation for treating HHonors elites very well. It was relatively easy to book. The Conrad Macao does treat Hilton HHonors Golds and Diamonds very well. So, if you have those points this is a great hotel to book…",50
"First visit to Macau and Hong Kong.  Excellent hotel, service excellent.  Suite was wonderful, very luxurious, everything you could possibly want.  Very central, and virtually next door to ""The Dancing Waters"".  Would definitely return.",50
"The presidential suite is on 40th floor you get there with special elevator  ,wonderful security and service , high end retail stores brands that you see in NY, and  rodeo drive also the landscaping around the hotel is beautiful maintained well  ,will visit again for sure",50
"Clocked six nights here since I discovered this gem in September, am returning for another 3 nights tomorrow.  Location is good, smack in the middle of Cotai which has a few resorts now, and many more opening. I wish there were more late-night food options in Sands Cotai.  Front desk check-in nice, some staff do engage in small talks and provide suggestions. I dont remember if they would escort new guests to the lift lobby, but they should, as it can get rather confusing. Generally able to receive room keys upon arrival, before check-in time if rooms are available, I say this because some hotels deliberately hold the inventory until mid-afternoon.  The suites here are well-furnished and nicely decorated, great bed and A/C. I think every room has it's own wifi device, so…",50
"Loved the hotel once entering as the lady at the check in section is very efficient and polite.  She even walked us to our room and introduced all the facilities.  It is a very heart warming welcome.  The hotel is grant overall.  Gym room is great although no view there.  Very comfortable stay, highly recommended.",50
"Our family of 4- 2 adults and 2 kids of 6 and 9 booked a junior suite with two queen size beds for one night. I booked the room Sands webpage, and was asked whether we need to have yoga mat in room for workout. I have requested for one.  Prior to arrival, one of the staff emailed me for the estimated arrival time and asked for any special requests. I asked for 4 sets of towels. Upon check in, my kids were offered two bags with some toys.  The room was good, about 800 sq feet, with the Conrad duck sitting in the bathroom. All requested items were there.  After returning to the hotel again in the evening, the beds were turned  opened with two Conrad beats sitting on each bed. There were 3 macaroons and a jar of candy sitting on the table. The beds and pillows were just right for…",40
"Fantastic hotel with a level of service you only get within a 5 star establishment. Very spacious rooms. Food from room service was excellent. Lots of little touches that you only really get at this level. Can't really fault our stay, flawless.",50
"I had completed a conference at the Venetian Macau and made an extra day stay across at the Conrad property. It was a nice change from the crowded, hectic experience at the Venetian, the Sheraton, and the Holiday Inn nearby. The guest service agent (G/F) took exceptional care and detail at check in, and I was most impressed. A room upgrade and late checkout were provided as I was checking in to the properly late. The room was spacious and it got everything that I needed. My only comments for the room were the blinking light at the foyer of my room, and I would certainly like a removable shower head.  I also want to praise an excellent running of the Conrad Executive Club, they had a great team and all the staff was very nice and proactive. It was a very enjoyable experience. On…",40
"Went to Macau for the weekend and the staff at the Conrad made it amazing. They are so attentive and caring. Edmund and his team at the concierge were fantastic in giving instructions and Ivan at the lounge was very friendly too. Lydia from the front desks was funny and cheerful! I had a massage at their spa which was nice. I wish I would remember more name, but they were all amazing! There are shuttle busses to everywhere you wish to go basically. Taxis in Macau are very expensive compare to mainland China...  The casino isn't the best one in Macau but it has all you wish for. Pool area is great.   I will recommend to everyone I know to stay at the Conrad!!! Thank you very much!! ",50
"when I first arrived to the reception desk , I was greeted and warmly welcomed by the reception staff. They also escort me to the lift lobby and showed me how to get to my room. When I walked into my room and saw that lovely pink duckling. I was very surprise and tempted. I even asked the room boy whether I could take it home and he said yes.   The surprise came on that night when the room service  knocked on my door and delivered a birthday cake to me. I told him that I haven't order any dessert and he told me that was for me with the compliment from the hotel. I really happy because my birthday was on the date after and the hotel celebrate for me in advance.  Thank you Conrad",50
"Super clean room, spacious and welcoming. Lots of amenities, including the purple bathrobe, slippers, and complimentary shoeshine. However, it was the incredible staff who really make this a fantastic hotel. The front desk people- Ms. Queenie, Mr. Cliff F, Mr. Pedro- all personable, helpful, friendly. They truly love working with people- and it shows! I'd love to see Grea again some day!",50
"i stayed in sep. for 3 nights with my mom and we really had a good time. This was my second stay and all the staffs were kind as my first visit. the deluxe suite room was clean, quiet, and very spacious for two of us. i really liked the bed especially. very comfortable. I once forgot to turn off `do not disturb` sign and had to ask to clean the room at 8pm and the room was very well cleaned without any sign of annoyance. Thank you.  breakfast at the orbit was soso considering the original price.   I would like to thank Ivan especially for remembering us from first visit in May. During the stay he always welcomed us with smile whenever we visited the club floor. I wish i would be able to see him on my next visit. Gallant was also very kind, too. My mom is willing to visit macau…",50
"You receive a great hospitality as you enter the lobby of the hotel, makes you feel like vip. Very clean, friendly, highly luxurious and easy access to all shopping malls, pools etc. the hotel is linked with other famous hotels together like Sheraton and holiday inn. Linked to the Venetian by a walking bridge. The hotel also provided a great opportunity for parents with young kids to join the dream work movie characters for breakfast for s certain fee. It is defiantly worth it. Free wifi in the hotel area. Free bus to Macau airport and ferry service. One of the best places I stayed.    ",50
"Free shuttle buses between Sands Hotel and the both ferry piers. If you want to go to city of Macau, you can walk 5-10 mins to the next hotels called City of dream to take the free shuttles.  You can get MacDonald for your breakfast if someone looking for a budget, just next to the corner in the first floor and also there is a food court.   Swimming pool is beautiful, have 4 small pools, staff providing excellent services.    Rooms are huge, we stayed in a two queen beds room.  High standard.",50
"Staff are really helpful and cheerful. We booked by promotion price,but still offer good service to us.the facilities are very good, we can stay at hotel whole day.  My family are enjoy the trip on Conrad hotel.thank you!!",50
"Conrad Macau is a super luxury hotel in Macau, you can easily get to this hotel from Zhuhai border gate. The facility and staffs in this hotel is very helpful and impressive. Edmund is the one who sent me warm welcome emails which made me very comfortable. I got a upgrade to a suite by Ivan as a gold member, the city view is marvelous on 34th floor! And at this period Conrad is supporting the Hongkong pink revolution guest can get pink  ducky in the room.",50
"We were greeted by the doorman by name when we first arrived.  That never happened to us before.  We (my wife and I) were escorted to the elevator to check-in on the 39th floor.  During the brief check-in process we were served Shirley Temples.  During the check-in we were asked when it would be convenient for the staff to clean the room daily.  We told them that 10 AM would do nicely and the attendant arrived each day no more than 5 minutes after 10.    The Executive Lounge is well appointed, always opened on schedule, and the service (breakfast, tea, and cocktail hours) prompt and courteous.  The suite was spacious with a master bath off the bedroom and a half bath off the entry to the suite.   The wireless internet connection was very fast.  The only inconvenience was that…",50
"The staff are excellent , good shopping, restaurat orbitz is mot bad, but nothing very special the sea had not as good taste as we are expecting, but the service are very good................especially the pool staff thanks to glenda",50
"The Conrad Macao is an beautiful oasis.  I loved the attentive staff and luxurious rooms.  This is definitely a 5 star property.  Located above the mall,  shopping is just steps away.  The ferry ride from Hong Kong was a minor inconvenience for the luxory experience at the Macao Conrad Hilton.",50
"the facilities are very good, you could 100% relax in this hotel.  Staff are really helpful and cheerful.  You don't want to leave the hotel once you are in.  The official website cannot tells how good this hotel is.",50
"The room did not dissapoint. Close to everything great facilities.The staff here are amazing, I was ill with the flu and they had a Dr there in 7 mins with medication and rang me each day to see if they could do anything. Clean and spacious.",50
"We received one of the best customer service at any of our past stays at any hotels, especially Yumi, a Front Desk Supervisor and Baoyi in lounge were awesome! great location in Macau, walking distance to many casinos, shopping, theaters etc.",50
"This is my first time staying in Conrad, and I can't wait to stay there again. Few days before check in, we received an email from the Chef Concierge, Mr Tan, asking if we need help for transportation arrangement, getting tickets to attraction, restaurant booking etc. I was overwhelmed by the warm hospitality and the special arrangement that prepared for us. The hotel is situated in one of the towers of the Sands Cotai Central. The interior of the hotel looks very new and the decoration is just splendid. The room is spacious with a super comfortable bed. Love the Teddy Bear that the housekeeper left on our bed after the turn down service. There are lots of restaurants to choose from in the shopping mall, or you can easily walk to the Venetian via the footbridge with even more…",50
"Our unforgettable experience began with a very warm welcome in the reception on the executive floor. We got the luck to upgrade to a suite and we were allowed to access the lounge and check in early. The room was big and very clean. Very comfortable though the view was partially blocked by the new hotel next door. We had afternoon tea and evening cocktails. The food and beverage were of superb quality. Huge blueberries, fresh fruits, homemade scones, clotted cream, salad dressings and nice jams...just incredible as you cannot find them locally. We ate a lot. It was the mid-autumn festival but we were so full - our stomach had no more rooms for our own mooncakes!  The staff was so good at learning - as if they knew us before even this was our first visit to this hotel. Sarah…",50
Stayed for 2D1N with my wife and parents-in-law. My wife and I are gold members of the HH Club so each of us booked 1 room. Official check-in time was 15:00 and we reach the hotel at about 14:30. Our check-in was done at the lobby. (we didn’t mind as there was no need to queue for check in at the lobby) Check in process was smooth. The staff handled my check-in was “Yumi” who spoke excellent English and warmly welcomed us to the hotel.  She was very friendly and professional and left us with a great impression. Both of our rooms were not yet ready so we waited at the 39/F Lounge for it. Very soon tea time at the Lounge started (15:00). We were very happy with the food and drinks though my parents-in-law opined that it would be nice if there was more Chinese style hot food.  …,50
all of staff were so warm and kind. They always care my family and look for what we need. I experience what was real hotel service. It was my 9th visiting in Macau and was the best visiting. Definitely i will visit Conrad macau again,50
"We have a warm welcome in reception, quite satisfied their service.  They are compliment a birthday cake and some snack for my kid.  Staff' service is good!  I don't give five star is due to the pillow and the bed, they are too hard for me, not very well sleep.  Beside, the shower in bathroom is fixed, too strong and too high for the kid.",40
very huge but a bit expensive property . located very near to the tower. you have a whole shopping arcade to spend time and also the dream world is not far off. if you are an indian then food can be a problem for u .,40
"Great location, amazing rooms and outstanding staff. For sure one of the best places to stay in Macau, if not the best. Enjoy also the privileged view of Macau's city scenery during the day and the night.",50
"This has been my favourite hotel so far on this trip. The rooms are of a very generous size, ours had a lounge  and a massive bathroom, as well as a private room with home cinema system.  The hotel is right in the middle of the action and surrounded by restaurants and cafes and exquisite historic buildings. We walked to all of the major landmarks, shops.  The staff make this hotel, thanks to Pedro Pinheiro, an awesome FO member who will definitely take care of you in the most professional way.  This amazing staff is friendly, courteous and made the stay very enjoyable. I really don't have a bad thing to say about this hotel. Highly recommend it!!",50
"This is my first & only choice when staying in Macau. All staffs are so kind, with nice smile & helpful. I love the big swimming pools & nice spa there. Also I was enjoy of the Nespresso machine & Bath Amenities at room. The last, a special thank you for the birthday arrangements.",50
"This resort embodies the type of luxury and service you expect in a destination like Macau.  Our Conrad experience began before we even arrived with a personalized email from Edmund, the Chief Concierge, offering his service with any reservations or travel assistance we may have needed leading up to arrival.  The check-in process was pleasant and we were even walked all the way to our room by the front desk attendant.   Because of my HHonors status we were upgraded to a suite at check-in.  The suite was overly spacious and well-appointed, and had a media room and jacuzzi.  The hotel is centrally located within the Sands/Venetian complex.  Shopping, dining, and the casino floor are no more than a 3 minute walk from the room.    Our visit to Macau was part of a two week journey…",50
"Huge well equipped rooms, especially the Suites. Great executive lounge. Super outdoor pools gym and spa. Gambling tucked away so its not in your face if you, like us, come here to relax and soak up Macau's amazing atmosphere. Excellent restaurants on site or a short walk away (North, Beijing Kitchen, Golden Peacock, Edo and Jade Dragon); others on Macau side a 10 minute cab ride away (Robuchon, A Lorcha, Golden Flower, The Kitchen and many more). Super slick operation, everyone does their job with a smile and great efficiency. For me this is one of THE best Hilton brand hotels there is.",50
"I'd like to believe Katy Fitzgerald wrote the lyrics to her song ""It doesnt get better than this"" after a trip to the Conrad in Macau.   This place is a well oiled machine with a heart and a soul, it's got something for everyone and if you're not everyone then they've surely got it nearby. I would happily spend my last days on Earth in this hotel. Yes I like it, a lot, I've been here half a dozen times in the last year.  If you get tired of the speed and full on nature of nearby Hong Kong or Shenzhen then the slower pace of life and the Portuguese influences in Macau come as a breath of fresh air and there's no better spot to enjoy Macau than this place.   The hardware is fabulous- it's got a Tibetan theme (so you get to go to Lasa without getting the altitude sickness), it's…",50
"Words just can't describe what an amazing, flawless service provide from Elvis Wen and his staff.  Elvis genuinely cared about our stay before arrival and after check out.  I have not met a staff in any 5 stars hotel that went above and beyond many extra miles to make our stay truly amazing and perfect!   Prior to Arrival & Check in:  I emailed the hotel to make some special arrangements for my mom's birthday.  I received an email from Elvis, and he took care of everything for me.  He was very professional, precise, and he paid very close attention to details.  I haven't met such a caring staff than Elvis anywhere around the world, and I travel extensively and stayed at really nice hotels.  He is truly 10 stars in my book.  He is the role model of what a luxury hotel service…",50
I loved this Hotel.  Great location across from the Venetian.  The staff was very attentive and catered to my every need.  The two room suite was clean and quiet.  This is an excellent property and we plan to visit again.,50
"Wow, my family and I simply love Conrad Macao Cotai Central Hotel. Hotel staff are very professional, friendly and helpful (be it at reception, pool, spa, bell boy, wind down service staff). The hotel room is very spacious and clean. Swimming pools and spa services are excellent. Location is good. Free shuttle bus services to the airport and ferry terminals. A overhead bridge away from our love: The Lord Stow's Bakery at The Venetian. Also, just across the road to The House of Dancing Water musical at City of Dreams.",50
"This hotel is well decorated and peaceful and those staffs are extremely attentive and helpful. Gallant, who I met in executive lounge is one of the most oustanding staff. He is smart and efficient, that always provide sincere services.  I recommend my friends to stay here when they visit Macau as the price is reasonable when compared with the quality services.",50
"Visited for our 30th anniversary trip, and we were extremely happy with everything. The room was superb and we were treated very well. It was clean and very, very comfortable. The bathroom was so spacious and luxurious with bath and separate shower which had perfect pressure and temperature. Bed was comfortable and the pillows just so luxurious. Room was spacious. Staff were friendly, polite and very professional. Special mention to chief concierge, Edmund Tan for his extra special treatment, also Prem Comboz for his good wishes and Cindy at the pool for spoiling us. We have so many happy memories of our visit to Conrad Macau.",50
"Thank you, everyone for all the wonderful memories! Conrad macao has been an absolute heaven to us these past few days  we have had such a wonderful stay that we don't want to leave!

Thank you for all especially for Mr.Kus(김운석) with his effciency, attentiveness and politeness are exemplary.Thank you so much for taking care of us again.I will definitely stay at Conrad Macau the next opportunity i get.",50
"Conrad is, very well located, one of the hotels in a big complex (so big that sometimes you can get lost) with everything you need inside, shoping, restaurants, casinos.. Rooms and staff are excellent and the overall is pretty good. one of the best options if you want to go to Macau",40
hotel was very near to the airport. and the free shuttle service was very useful so we didn't need to take a taxi or a bus during the stay. hotel staff was really nice and kind and the room was wonderful but it was little bit chilly for me. I was satisfied with the hotel.,40
"As a VERY frequent traveler around the world, and having stayed in top-hotels such as Burj Al Arab, etc, I must say I was EXTREMELY impressed with Conrad Cotai. Staff service was simply AMAZING and far better what anybody could expect at any hotel in the world.  Attention from Miss Ann from reception (I can't remember if her name was ""Annysa"" or similar) was exceptional.  The room was VERY spacious and perfect in terms of cleanliness and elegance. It is easy to tell that the hotel is new because everything is so well maintained. Without any question, the BEST price-benefit ratio I can remember (considering at least the last 25 hotels where I have stayed).  Location is perfect: in the 'new' Macau (Cotai), just in front (walking distance <10 mins) of the Venetian and Hard Rock…",50
"From the first day of my check in and the front desk guy walked me all the way into my room, till the last day of my check out and the front desk girl sent me by herself to the taxi, I felt that I was serviced like a king, and I enjoyed every minute of my 5-night stay here.  As a decade long Hilton club member, I've stayed at a number of different Hilton family hotels and resorts around the world. And this was one of my best hotel experiences. This is an absolute diamond in the Hilton family of hotels.   I got a suite on 34th floor, and it was fabulous and very clean with luxurious amenities and a gracious Nespresso machine, The most important thing in the room, in my opinion, is the bed, and the one here was excellent. It's hard enough, and at the same time very comfortable, …",50
"I stayed at this hotel for only one night. I stayed at this hotel simply because I am a Hilton Gold member. Due to the membership, I was upgraded to a junior suite with free breakfast. The room was very spacious. The staff was very warm and showed their hospitality. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to people, especially to HH Gold and Diamond members. Overall, I think this hotel is worth 4.5 on a 5-point likert scale.   There are, however, some minor issues which can be improved. The wireless internet connection was quite weak in certain part of the room. I lost my internet connection from time to time. I did call the technical support staff of the hotel, and he was doing his best to fix this problem. This technical glitch, however, couldn't be fixed. When I was in Japan,…",40
"A nice hotel with beautiful lobby,good location,the staffs were really friendly, they tried  their best to satisfy our requirment since we hope to stay in a upper room. However, the check in was too slowly and the staff promised us we can check out on 2:00pm,but then when we want to go back to our room at 1:00Pm, the door key can't work.We call the front desk they said we shoul check out on 11:00am, it made us felt bad. However,it was a nice hotel! We would like to come back again.",50
"In my previous review 3 years ago, I mentioned that I had an unpleasant one. Yet a coincidence makes me arrive at this hotel again after 3 years – definitely a great improvement on services.  Due to a bad weather on my planned arrival date, I had once cancelled my booking and the staff at the reservation team, Ms Joana, was very happy to assist with my request which I deeply appreciated. And finally when weather turned better in the afternoon, I changed my mind and headed to Conrad Macao for my stay again.  At the club lounge, all staffs are very attentive and make you feel privileged. And I would like to mention Mr Elvis, who helped us with our check-in, has an exceptional service and he tries his best to make us feel comfortable. Though there were some issues on the first room…",40
"Took a short break in Conrad Macau for a night. Well Conrad is absolutely great! Though my room wasn't ready when I checked in, the spacious room, the decorations and the atmosphere bounce back! Bathroom is gorgeous with the bathtub so I can enjoy a nice hot bath after a day hanging around. King size bed is so large that even three persons can fit in.  Breakfast is full of variety so you can enjoy different kinds of food to start a brand new day. To be picky, the restaurant location isn't in the hotel main building but it's just 5 mins walk to the hotel mall which the restaurant located. I will definitely return to Conrad as both the hard and software are amazing. Staff are all professional and nice. Environment and decoration are sophisticated.  I really enjoy my stay here and…",40
"I would rate this hotel as the best bet within Sands in Cotai, if I could downgrade the Sheraton in this location, I'd give it no stars, too many hiccups with their service -- at least Conrad's service is at an acceptable standard for international hotels/travelers, even quite good. The rooms are spacious, neat and modern. Don't expect anything too glamorous in their typical rooms. Breakfast buffet is provided by Grand Orbit so not exclusively for Conrad guests, but there is ample variety for food choices. Overall I haven't had any bad experiences when I've stayed here. ",40
"I love this place so much that I would go to Macau again just to stay here, seriously!  We booked this property for 2 nights, and prior to going to Macau I had been in contact with the head concierge Mr. Edmund Tan for help in arranging transfer to Hong Kong via ferry.  Mr. Tan had been fantastic over email and gave us sufficient information to ease our anxiety.  Upon check-in we were told that the room that we booked which was a king deluxe suite was being upgraded to the premium suite for free, and that Mr. Tan wanted to personally welcome us.  That was such a nice thing to meet him in person, and he was very gracious and kind.  When we opened the door to our suite, our mouths just dropped.  It was HUGE and elegant, and just AMAZING!  It was basically like a house; the only…",50
"Located in Cotai central together with some other hotels,which also provide Casino for you whom like to try your luck in Macao Conrad is beautiful Hotel, room is really spacious (okay most hotel in Macao offer a spacious room), and trendy.. Love the ambiance of the hotel, not over crowded.  Easy access to Venetian Macau,  Breakfast with vast menu, and the staff were polite.. Really hope to stay in this hotel again..",50
"Conrad is one of three hotels located at Cotai Central, and probably the best of the 3. It is located between Sheraton and Holiday Inn, and closest to the shopping mall in center of building. Gambling is to the South, and North.  Shopping center connects by overhead bridge to Venetian across the street and hotel is very conveniently located.  Room Size is excellent although not as big as Venetian, but room is clean, quite new, and very upscale. Service is excellent upon check-in, and personalized. If you are member of IHG. You get to experience the superb service at Lounge level on 39th floor. Offering free breakfast starting at 6:30, afternoon snacks, and unlimited drink service throughout your stay.  Only drawback is the lack of room entertainment (few television channels),…",50
"Nestled in the Cotai Strip, Conrad Macao is conveniently located in the same stretch as Venetian Macao where you will find interesting places of interests to kill time, apart from gambling. Reception was warm and check in is fast and efficient. Rooms are big and I will definitely recommend for family crowd. From Conrad, you can easily take a cab and explore the Macau city, in search of authentic Portugese food, which I will strong recommend St Antonio (notwithstanding the poor service, but food quality is impeccable). ",50
"I visited Conrad Macau again last week. It is still fabulous. Seldom do I see hotel staffs so nice, from the club lounge to health club. They are just superb. Nice treatment for HHonors members as always. I would recommend this hotel to everyone visiting Macau. Simply won't let you down.",50
"Room is spacious and the bed is comfortable, hardware are all ok. Swimming pool is not large but at the same time, not many people will use it, get more privacy. One very important point need to address here is that, the staff at Conrad can speak English and their service is really GOOD! I tried the other two hotels near by but not many staff can speak English! If you want to go back to Macau, you can walk to City of Dream and use the hotel bus service there.  ",40
"Even if Macao was a little disappointing, small Vegas, without the shows..., the hotel is simply splendid. As a Hilton Diamond mr. I was upgd to a super Suite, big, clean and with an hyper luxurious marble bathroom. The bed, amenities, service was perfect, very nice gym and health club, kind of small crowded outside pools, but... OK The Conrad lounge located at the top floor is gorgeous, the food and service meet a Michelin standard. A special mention of the manager Mrs. Diane and her colleagues, always ready to fulfill your needs. ",50
"As H Hilton members, I've sent email to the hotel asking for any anniversary room upgrade, offers etc.  They only promised a complimentary cake without other offers whereas room upgarde to suite and complimentary cake were offered by other hotels in Macau for celebrating birthday such as Grand Hyatt, Hard Rock Hotel.   So siappointing and will not stay again!!",30
"It was my 1st experience with Hilton group hotel, and my wife and I were completely bowled over by their astonishing hospitality.  Right from check-in, we were personally greeted by their duty manager who not only escorted us to our rooms but didnt leave till our last questions had been answered and till we were entirely comfortable in our upgraded suite. What we really appreciated about our experience at Conrad Macau is the sincere care shown towards our special requirements. We were provided with a non-smoking room, and were upgraded to their premier suite and most importantly they made separate & exclusive arrangements for our vegetarian breakfast at their restaurant on both days of our stay. We enjoyed the Indian poha, puri-sabji, uttapams etc and had a filling breakfast…",50
"Is my first time staying in Macau Conrad and I really love it. The room is spacious and clean and NEW!!! We have 2 queen beds in a room and free premium coffee and milk. There is Conrad bear to take home as souvenir as well sweets. The staff are friendly and well groom especially the ambassador. They are approachable and good hospitality.  The hotel also link to other hotels without getting sun burn. There is also indoor jaccuzi, sauna and steam room. Is better than Vetinan where i previously stayed.  Bad about conrad? NONE! We really enjoy our stay. ",50
"It was definitely a great vacation, but what makes it the most was the great service extended by the staffs especially the receptionist Arnisah who was very patient on finding me and my friend a twin-bedded room as they were on a high occupancy. She assured us that they will  try their very best to accommodate our request which did not disappoint us when we received our room keys.",40
I really enjoyed staying there. Excellent hotel with excellent staffs(Kus^^). They hepled me with anything i needed. I am willing to stay there again and again. This is my favorite hotel from now on.  Thanks Conrad.,50
"Being one of the three hotels at the development known as Sands City, this is one of the most non-descript Conrad I have ever stayed in. The location is convenient, being within walking distance to other hotspots and entertainments in Cotai, with frequent and comfortable shuttle buses from both the main Macau Pier and the Cotai Pier. Journey to the hotel from both is short. The lobby of this hotel is small and is franked by shops shops and more shops, making it kind of cold and commercial. The staff, as expected of a Conrad, is polite courteous and efficient. The room is large and luxuriously appointed, with delightful little touchs such as a Conrad rubber duck sitting on the bathtub edge, and handmade truffles awaiting one's arrival.   The swimming pool seems small comparing to…",30
Prompt reply for all enquires; a very lovely and delicious birthday cake for my boyfriend; pro-actively made reservation for our dinner; and willing to change another room for us due to the loud air-conditioning.,50

Special thanks as well to Glenda from the recreation team as she's been very helpful during our stay in the health club.. Kudos to your team! Till our next staycation....",50
stayed here for a conference and was suitable impressed with the rooms. Rooms are big and they give you a teddy bear to keep you company. rooms are well maintained. the hotel is joint together with Sheraton and Holiday Inn. Opposite is the Venetian shoppes. Its only 10 minutes by free shuttle bus from airport. Only gripe is breakfast café is inside shopping centre so its a 5min walk from lobby.,40

But I will select conrad macao again for next trip.And of course i'll recommend this hotel for Macao travelers. First of all, I can meet again I known staffs. I met a with gym staff Jeff in 2014. I met Jeff near the poolside again in this year. I want talk about employment stability, welfare and Customer satisfaction. This is like a stable triangle. My wife didn't like a chinese congee.

We arrived late at 1900 and the reception knew what to do as they made the check-in process quick and easy. The service level of the front staff, alongside the room cleaning service personnel were impressive. The room was big at 52sqm with perfect sound insulation. The free wifi was quick and easy to connect, alongside free hotel-wide wifi, Its elevators were fast and efficient, location was perfect as it is a few strides away from malls and the walkway to the Venetian and City of Dreams. Shuttle buses to the ports and city is just outside the main lobby and had 5-10 minute intervals. Given the chance, will be back on my…",50
"The Conrad Macao is by far our favorite hotel in Macau with an incredible lounge, attached to a mall and an overhead walkway to the Venetian for shows, gambling and great restaurants. There is also a free bus/shuttle to and from the ferry terminals and airport (Taipa is most convenient for the ferry). The pool is typically not busy with good service and cabanas. The rooms are very nice, especially if you can get the room with a separate living area and bedroom ... many of them have 2 bathrooms or an extra theater room perfect for families. The service is always incredible, probably the best we have had anywhere in the world, and the bed and robes are the best (just wait until you try them ... my whole family has purchased them including my parents when they visited). By far the…",50
"Now this gotta to be a property to stay in Macau. The rooms are inexpensive and at the same time luxurious. We were on the executive floor suites and the hospitality is great. Running from the reservations, to the front desk, this property come along way. They are well polite in comparison to the people we met and tried to get directions from the Casino hotels. The bed was comfortable too. The executive lounge has wide spread but could be better during tea time. Will definitely come back to this hotel",50
"Hotel is part of a bigger complex that is shared with Holiday inn & Sheraton.  Interconnect within the massive complex for F&B , branded shops and gaming zone.only 2 F&B outlet operates beyond midnights and the closest supermarket is at taipa village ( MOP30 taxi fare )  Stayed in the junior suit which was huge (after compare with HK hotels).  Cotai area is a fair distance from the old Senado square with a MOP70 taxi fare or free hotel shuttle bus hopping.  ",50
"Great service!  Impressed by the warmest hospitality.  They gave us great surprise by secretly preparing us a cake and a box of macaroon for my husband's birthday. More than that, two stuffed bears for my daughters.  We were really impressed!",50
"Booked a junior suite which was upgraded to a suite that was larger than most apartments. After a long day touring historical sites in Macau, returning to the comforts of a pool and hot tub was so inviting. From my private media room to soaking in the jacuzzi tub, my only regret was not staying for longer. Staff were extremely attentive and treated guests very well. Little luxuries like turn down service, slippers and the built-in tv in the bathroom added to the experience. Short distance from larger casinos, shopping complex comes complete with child minding and food court. No regrets on choosing the Conrad over other hotels. Free shuttle from TurboJet port, 1 hr from Hong Kong Island.",50
"Visited Macau for a short break and had a wonderful stay at Conrad. We stayed at the deluxe suite. The service here is top notch besides great room size, amenities and layout. Staff exceeded every expectations to make sure a memorable stay. Surprised receiving a call from their guest relations few days before checking in to extend assistance for a dinner booking. Upon arrival, Sabrina at front office was extremely kind and helpful. She helped us to check in smoothly, took the time to explain the facilities & arranged a last minute and an enjoyable Shrekfast! Staffs at The Lounge effortlessly offered fruit platters and fresh juice while we waited for our tea set. Nahjeer at pool side was attentive and cheerful. All in all we had a great time here! Can't wait to return soon. Our…",50
Everything came beyond expecatation. Hotel staff are friendly and respond to requests with warm smiles and carried out in a professional manner. A good place to stay for personal pleasure and business visits. Will always stay here whenever I visit Macau.,50
"Conrad is a excellant hotel, Staff is sincere, warm and very polite. They meet to need the guest requirement. They will try to help & cooperation, as far as possible for guest fuifilled. Hotel room is perfect facilities, high-quality appliance, a lot of space. Very comfortable and relax while I feel at home. Within the scope of the hotel have provided many difference national cuisine and restaurant, a large shopping mall and casino. You can not need demand external. All in all Conrad Macau, Cotai Central is a high quality and excellant hotel. Staff must provide high efficiency, enthusiastic about helping others and warm hospitality. If I once again go to Macau, I must choice Conrad first priority. Here say that thank you very much for Edmund Tan great support!",50
"I have been this hotel many times and yearly  since its start. Right from day one they treated me royally and the managers I ran into through the years are just great.  Their services are great. Their rooms are well appointed and usually have great view.  The hotel is amid the Sands center and it is very well kept.  The fitness and pool are above average,   The breakfast off site is more than adequate.  It provides good transportation to and fro no matter you arrive by plane or by hydrofoils. I have no problem to come back whenever I am in Macau.",50
"Hi we just had 2 nights stay with family with young children, the facilities were great, the staff really helpful and friendly, i would certainly stay when ever we visit Macao again. The Executive Lounge was one of the best i have ever experienced. plenty of great food choices and extremely friendly and accommodating staff, namely Gallant, Sarah and Renee  great job guys! Wish you all the best!! Cheers",50
"We booked online under the ""Beauty and The Beast"" package which includes one night stay at a deluxe room with breakfast, tickets for 2 to the show, one way ferry ticket back to Hong Kong.   A week before our arrival, we received an email from the concierge asking if we need assistance in making dining or spa reservation. It was a simple but thoughtful gesture. We were upgraded to a Junior Suite at check-in and the room was available right away at around 1:30pm. Without being requested, Ms Yumi extended our check-out time for 1 hour and she was apologetic for not being able to let us keep the room longer as there was a full house the next day. She then directed us to the concierge from whom we collected our show and ferry tickets. She waited until we finished and took us to our…",40
"Good facilities and good service, and large room space; make you feel very comfortable while you are in Hotel. It will be your first choice while you stay in Sand Cotai center, good restaurant and food.",50
"The moment we checked in to the hotel, we were pampered by the first class service of the hotel. Warm and very helpful welcome by the front desk and very patience in taking care of our needs. The rooms are superb, large and comfy, and best of all, a very comfortable mattress for a good night sleep. WiFi are superb, and available through out the whole hotel.   Definitely my first choice on my next trip back here. ",50
"The service here really set this hotel apart.  From the moment I walked into the hotel, everything was taken care of.  I am only Gold, but the team working this hotel treated me as if I was 20 year Diamond member.  The breakfast in the lounge is top notch and the staff was just as good (they even remember my drink order from the day before).    After we had checked out we went to the front desk and asked where we could purchase one of the rubber ducks in the room (they are awesome, see through with dice in them) and was informed that they were free to take.  Realizing we had checked out, the front desk attendant went and got us two fresh ones, two bottles of water and a bag to carry everything in.  I was literally blow away at the effort he made to make our stay memorable (this…",50
"Stayed here for a night with a friend last week. The hotel was fantastic! The standard throughout was impeccable and the staff customer service was also first class. I would definitely stay again and would definitely recommend.  Special mention goes to Queenie and Yumi who clearly know how to make guests feel welcome.  Macau is an interesting place. Its clearing trying to become the Vegas of the Far East and the place where the Chinese go to gamble. It has mega hotels and nice shops and restaurants, but it lacks a bit of character, which I am sure will come when it has move buildings and things to do.   All said and done, the hotel is superb and has excellent facilities. The only small issue was that the bar closed at 1am...which was a bit odd... and the closest open bar was at…",50
"We recently stayed at the Conrad for three nights.  From the moment we booked the holiday right through to check out, the customer service was incredible.  The staff were attentive and really went out of their way to accommodate us. We had originally booked for two nights, but since we were having such a nice experience, we booked a third night at the reception desk. We stayed in a suite and were extremely impressed with room. We were travelling with our baby and the hotel provided everything we needed at no additional cost. We found the food very good. We got room service for two nights and ate in the Lounge on the third night. The breakfast cost extra, but was worth it. It was an extravagant buffet. A particular thank you to Isac and Ea who paid careful attention to our…",50

"We previously stayed at this wonderful hotel as a treat for our anniversary, and were astounded by a generous upgrade to a suite which was spacious, elegant and so comfortable - truly a gift! Made us feel very fortunate to be Hilton Gold members!  This time we brought my brother-in-law to enjoy Macau and planned to stay in a room together. Once I made the reservation, I soon heard from Diana, the manager of the Conrad Club Lounge who asked if there was any way to personalize our stay. I let her know that we'd have a 3rd adult on the reservation so if there was any way to get a slightly bigger room or a cot for him, it would be much appreciated. Diana took it upon herself to make sure we were upgraded to a suite which gave us a little more room to spread out, and greeted us…",50
"I stayed at the Conrad Macao for 4 nights in July 2015. Entering the Himalayan-themed lobby is an experience. Check-in was a breeze thanks to the competent front desk staff. Stepping into the room, I was pleased by the tasteful decor and the thoughtful design and furnishings. The room is quite large by Asian standards. The Nespresso machine and complimentary capsules was a nice touch. Even though I was in Macao for business, I had a pleasant stay that felt more like a vacation as soon as I stepped in the room. My only quibble - not all guests on my non-smoking floor adhered to the no smoking policy - hardly the fault of the hotel!",50
"In general staying at the Hilton is a welcome as even as a blue member (which is right at the bottom of the tier) you get treated exceptionally. Conrad Macau though exceeded even that. The room, the service, the complimentary items provided as was my birthday, the excellent housekeeping and staff that new what the 'do not disturb' sign meant. If being at blue level warrants such service and importance, I can only wonder what the gold level has in store for me! Ea at front office - a special thank you to you and your team for doing a fantastic job. Location wise - the best place to be!",50
"This is my second stay at the Conrad Macao, and I am staying in their Deluxe Suite this time and it's just perfect for me.   Room: Deluxe Suite - Very Big & Nice, especially the living room, can definitely fit 10 people in it, very clean & tidy Bed: Big King size bed and very comfortable (comparatively softer than the others) Bathroom: Also very big, luxury and the bathtub is perfect for two  Location: Very good, within 10mins walking distance to the Venetian (Indoor sky bridge connected) & the City of Dreams; Shopping mall & Casino underneath Shuttle Bus: Not many shuttle buses can take from the Sands cotai, but you can still walk to City of drams/Venetian so that you can have many choices and can go anywhere in Macau by the shuttle  In room dining: Very good and efficient,…",50
"Stayed in April to celebrate my birthday. The room is spacious, beautiful and clean. It is good to have heated pools so that we still could swim in cold weather. However, the pools are a bit small for good swimmers.  I would like to thanks Edmund Tan the chief concierge and Eric from front desk. They are really professional, helpful and caring. The complimentary cake provided by the hotel is delicious. It was a big surprise for all of us to see the lovely chocolate pops and cards for my two girls too. We usually stay in banyan tree when we go to Macau, but my elder daughter ask me to stay in Conrad next time again. Conrad macau is a true 5 stars plus hotel in terms of accomodation and service.",50
"It's our first time staying at Conrad, decided to try this because of the great reviews on tripadvisor.  The beginning was not great, and we did not feel any anticipation for our needs from the hotel.  It is never good to feel like a room number, not a valued guest.  After speaking to a couple of people, we finally spoke to the duty manager, Anson who took care of the problem to our satisfaction.This hotel has some hits & misses.   The hits:  1- The standard fare from Conrad were there...my boy was instantly given a kid's pack at check in which we appreciate.  The bears and ducks were waiting in the room, that's great!    2- We were upgraded to a 1 bedroom suite with luxurious amenities provided.  We had a choice of Aromatherapy Associates, Tara Smith & Shanghai Tang toiletries…",40
"I stayed in Conrad Hotel - Macau for two days recently and I was impressed with their services.  The check in at the Executive Lounge was smooth and efficient, but the most important point is that the staff can anticipate our needs and arrange everything accordingly. They made us feel at home.  The room was in it's mint condition and have a great view of the pool.   The food and drinks in the Executive Lounge and the café are of Conrad Standard, but the important point is that the staff were very friendly and always have a smile on their face.  The service that impressed me was that when I asked the Executive Lounge staff to book a Portuguese restaurant for dinner, they asked me what were our preferences and finally recommend one and successfully made a reservation in a very…",50
"I've been to Macau five times, and was looking for a new hotel on the Cotai Strip, so I decided on the Conrad at Cotai Central.  What an amazing spot ...  Upon arrival, my room was upgraded to a suite, which was stocked with chocolate and fruit. I then went downstairs to play some roulette and grab dim sum at Dynasty 8, which was excellent.  Up a few patacas at the table, I went back up to my room to unwind and then went to enjoy the pool, where I relaxed, swam, and read in a very quiet and relaxing atmosphere.  Following my swim, I went to the gym and sauna and steam room. Feeling completely relaxed and refreshed, I went up to the Conrad club for snacks, dinner, and drinks.  The staff in the club were completely helpful, offering advice on things to do around Macau, but I was…",50
"This a luxurious and efficient hotel, highly recommended. Rooms are large and well appointed, pool area with private cabana was wonderful, good location in walking distance to most attractions. Restaurants have good selection of quality food and there are many high end shops to visit, casino is great fun.",50
"That's one of my favorite two hotels in Macau. They always offer me with the excellent service and nice room. I do appreciate the staffs of the club lounge, whatever I demand or make any trouble they've tried their best to satisfy me. But one thing I should mention is the lounge foods, they should enhance the food kinds and make some changes with them. Finally I need say 'thanks' to all the lounge staffs: Ivan, Joey, Rannie, Frank, Francsil, Raymond, Kitty, Dan, Ysa, Lorlline and so on. I'll look forward to being there next time.",50
"Conrad Macao, Cotai Central provides my families and I very good experience in Macao. Room and bathroom is clean and quite. Bed is very comfortable. The distance between airport and hotel is not too far. There is a big shopping mall in the lower floor and a famous casino just cross the street should provide good places for you and your family for shopping and exciting.",50
"From the minute we walked in, the staff of this hotel made us feel very special.  Beautiful entryway, top notch staff and a wonderful concierge lounge made us fell that this facility is an example that all others must be compared against for excellence in personalized service.  We certainly stay here again and strongly recommend to any friends and business associates.",50
nice room  good and fast reception  all de luxe rooms with all the amenities and very clean what most impressed me of this hotel was the breakfast room grand orbit not very big but waiters very polite and attentive choice and quality of food at high standard even if the price is a little bit higher than others,30
We enjoy staying in Conrad.  Beautiful room and very helpful and friendly staffs.  I love the unique waterfall in the pool area and they even have a rain mist in the changing room.  What a surprise!  It was my husband birthday and they let us  have a very late check out time which we really appreciate .,50
"The stay in Conrad was just amazing!!   This was my boyfriend's birthday trip. A week before our stay, I contacted Ea about the birthday cake and room decoration. Hat off to Ea! The customer relation team prepared everything perfectly and we were being upgraded to Premier Suite. The suite is huge and luxurious which is far beyond our expectation. Not only a surprise for my boyfriend but also for myself. My boyfriend also received a hand written card and a small gift in the next morning. Every staff we met at Conrad from the front desk concierge to the customer relation team delivered exceptional service. We will definitely stay again and recommend to friends visiting Macau. Thanks a lot!",50
"Despite being only a one night stay both my wife and myself loved tis hotel.  All of the staff were fantastic with helping us to the room with our bags, arranging ferry tickets back to Hong Kong and showing us where to go for the House of Dancing Water show.  The hotel is very big, and merged with a shopping mall (Vegas style)!  The rooms are well sized and very clean. Anyone whom likes to take baths will love the bathroom.  The food served in the lobby bar was very good and reasonable priced.  The lunch buffet was also very good with a great selection to please everyone.  Our only regret was that we didn't stay for longer!  Hope to return to Macao in the near future.  Special thanks to Joana for such a warm welcome.  Ian",50
Had a quick one night stay but my room was clean and comfortable. The food options could have been better but no complaints. It is close to the Venetian and hotel staff helped me decide on some things to do and see in Macau.,50
"This is the 2nd time we stayed with Conrad in Macao, this round we booked the Junior Suite. The room was big with 2 queen beds and a separate living/bathroom. Check in was fast & smooth. It had an amazing view of The Venetian. They also had their signature bears & duck in the room. As it was my birthday during our 4 nights stay, they even placed an birthday cake in the room, it really surprised me.  Perhaps the only disappointment was that they no longer provide shuttle bus service to Galaxy Macau. Nevertheless the stay was awesome, we will definitely stay in Conrad again!",50
"complete luxury from start to finish love the hotel the location and the  staff, rooms clean spacious and opulent, food delicious with plenty of choice  , cant wait for our  return visit in September  /october",50
"I was visiting in Hong Kong and took and took a quick day trip over to Macau after the weather really did not look like the typhoon would impact the travel...boy, was I wrong.  Got stranded and turned to the Conrad for last minute lodging until the am.  Cindy at registration was so helpful and upgraded our room to a fabulous suite.  Then on to the executive lounge for a diet coke and to worry.  The folks in the lounge were so helpful and stayed while we were trying to get our devices charged.  You could not ask for better hospitality and assistance.",50
"I have had he privilege of staying in many 5 Star deluxe hotels, but this one takes the take. They take hospitality to a different level. Everyone, from check in assistant to the servers to the manager, they make you feel so welcome that you almost regret departing from the hotel.  God Bless them all! ",50
"We rarely ever have a negative Hilton experience, but we also rarely never have such great attention and treatment from the staff!  We were double upgraded to an enormous suite.  The details are above and beyond-teddy bears on your kids' beds at night, rubber duck for the tub, a baby kit in case you lost things.  They made a gluten free cake and delivered it to our room for our daughter's birthday.  Diane and the staff in the club lounge were so friendly and accommodating.  The swimming pools were great, the food of course wonderful.  We will definitely be going back!",50
This is the second time I have stayed at the Macau Conrad and I have found the rooms to be very large and well appointed each time.  As a Diamond member I received upgrades to beautiful suites with a dining room and media room which were very nice but I never actually used. The bathroom are large in the room and very nicely done. My shower was very large and felt about the size of a one car garage.   The location is very desirable being directly across from the Venetian Macau and all its shoppes.   The service was pleasant in general although the executive lounge is a little unusual.  It is a very large room and feels more like an unused conference room than an executive lounge. On two occasions at breakfast I had to wait 45 minutes while a chef was found to make scrambled eggs.…,40
Conrad was the best hotel in Macau. Great location. The shuttle busses were very convenient and the shuttle from the ferry terminal to the hotel made every thing much easier ! Would definitely stay here again when I return to Macau !,50
"It is my second time stayed in Conrad. 1st time is Conrad Koh Samui, it was a wonderful memory.  My family stayed here last week for my wedding anniversary and my brother's birthday. Requested for a upgrade but was disppointed. But they did arrange connecting rooms for us, which my 2years old daughter loved it as she can run between two rooms.  Service was disappointed too, already requested for a baby set before i came, while i had to call them twice to remind them after checked in. Also, i saw others received  Combi baby bowls and spoon, a bear in the baby set, but i received none of it, so I called the help desk again and they reluntantly gave me.   We appreciated that they provided a complimentary cake for my celebrations,  i told them to deliver at 4:00pm.. but it arrived…",40
"This is a lovely big room with an excellent bed (a bit hard though) and a great bathroom. This is located in a casino complex of three hotels parallel to each other. All look the same from outside. The Holiday Inn is on the left, Conrad in the middle and Sheraton on the right. Because it has larger rooms, and therefore less  rooms, the Conrad is a much calmer and more peaceful hotel than those on either side. The problems that the hotel has comes from its location in the complex, there is no sign to the breakfast room, which is in this giant complex, rather than in the hotel itself, and we got lost on the first day. You walk past fake rocks and plastic plants to get to the breakfast restaurant - very tacky. On arrival I was asked which newspaper I would like every day, I told…",40
We just finished up our stay at the Conrad Macau hotel and find that this property is an absolute diamond in the Hilton family of hotels.  I've stayed at a number of different Hilton family hotels/resorts around the world. However this was one of our very best hotel experiences so far. And for sure the best level of service and most beautiful location I've stayed at. As Hilton Gold member and also other Hotels chains high level loyalty membership I’m spending many nights a year in worldwide travel and this hotel belongs to the very top!    After a warm welcome from the reception desk we were upgraded to deluxe suite for being Hilton Gold along with access to the Executive Lounge which was highlight of our whole holiday at Macau. Several staff members there made my family and I…,50
Where else would a hotel assign a bellman t o take ones luggage from hotel to customs at the ferry termminal. Upgrade d to a very nice suite.  Breakfast spread quite good.  Would definitely stay again.  Front desk personnel were more than helpful and friendly.,50
"this hotel is a nice surprise. I usually go to either Sheraton or Holiday Inn in coati central and for once I decided to test this one as they had room for 1500 HKD. The rooms are really nice and luxurious. They are so much better than in Sheraton or Holiday Inn. The bed is very comfortable. The bath room was nice too, it was quite similar to the bathrooms from Sheraton. The room service was also good. An employee Maldives (sorry forgot her name) was very helpful at checkin. It’s really one of the best hotel of Cotai. Breakfast selection is solid, but the restaurant is quite far from the room.",50
"We have spent a night at Conrad Macao for a belated birthday celebration with my boyfriend. We requested upgrade through the website and we even got more for our special occasion, double upgrade from Queenie to a huge suite in which we actually got lost. The room was fabulous and very clean with luxurious amenities and a gracious Nespresso machine, our favorite in-room amenity ever!! Food from in room dining was tasty and kept warm till it was served by Vincent. He provided a fully service setting up the dining table and serving a breakfast like in the restaurant. Thank you to Conrad Team for such a pampered service, we were really delighted.!!",40
"Only stayed one night before leaving to HK airport but great experience at a great price.  Hotel was clean, location was right on the strip, and a fantastic value.  The staff spoke very good English as well.",40
"Stayed for two nights in a high level floor suite - Room was marvelous with a great view towards old Macao. Building work going on at ground level at an adjacent development but we didn't notice/hear. Best thing about the hotel was the staff - all very helpful, very polite and welcoming. Breakfast was in the Grand Orbit within the mall complex (not so easy to find) but great selection of food (Chinese/western). Beautifully equipped gym. Great location - Near Hard Rock cafe, House of Dancing Water and away from all the rush/bustle in The Venetian complex. Only down-side (for us) was the absence of a relaxing bar/dining area - there was an area near reception but very dark and lacking in atmosphere, so we ate out. Would we return again - definitely.",50
We stayed here for four fantastic nights. First off they sent me a welcome email before I arrived asking if I needed anything. When we arrived we were upgraded to a beautiful suite. The service from everyone in the hotel was perfect but the service we received in the club level was far above that of most hotels I have stayed in. A really big thank you to the general manager and the whole team at the Conrad. You earned this five star review... Can't wait to come back:-),50
My siblings and I went for short vacation and shopping.  The location of Conrad Hotel in Macau is prime location where there is a bridgeway connecting the hotel and the other Hotels nearby.  Very convenient!    The hotel room is spacious and it provided us very comfortable rest.  I luv the Nespresso Coffee machine that they provided in the room..,40
"Stayed here for one night and it was the highlight of our Macao trip (6N in HK & 1N in Macao). If you're a Hilton's member then the more reason for you to stay here because they value their loyal members. We booked a suite but received an even better one (free upgrade) with its own entertainment room. It was very spacious and complete with everything you'll need and more. Despite of its enormous size, everything was spotless and well maintained. The room was just so beautiful I actually considered extending our stay despite of having booked and paid for a hotel in HK.  Service was excellent. Our requests and inquiries were all addressed in a very timely manner and they did it professionally and with a smile. They do go out of their way to ensure you have a pleasant stay.  Thank…",50
"This is the second time I visited this hotel. Hotel service is very good. In case of long waiting queue for  Check-in & out, they would provide more staff. This is really helpful to visitors. Sometimes I really don't understand why some visitors takes so long for the process. Staff in the swimming pool also has a good service bringing water and towel for us. In the spa, service of the therapists are also good, well-mannered. As expected, This is the better hotel among the three which I've also visited.",40
"Conrad is really top notch in service and room quality. And I would like to specially say thank you to the concierge staff Edmund and John, been so helpful and always willing to go the extra miles to help. Made our stay extra pleasant.",50
"The hotel is located in Cotai Central, next door to the Sheraton, Holiday Inns and across from the Venetian and four seasons.  This location is therefore very convenient because it's close to everything,  lots of shops, restaurants and casinos.  My suite on 34th floor is spacious with fully stocked amenities even his and her slipper.  Love the Conrad puppy and rubber duckie.  Breakfast at Grand Orbit is quite an experience with so much choices and the quality of the food and service is excellent.  The executive lounge offers great selection of snacks during Happy hour as well.  Many thanks to Diana and her staffs who always making sure all my need are met.  Overall, it's a very pleasant stay and I'd love to have another opportunity to go back.",50
Stayed in conrad for 2 nights. The room and service very top notch. Big room and clean. House keeping was good. check in counter/area was big and beautiful and check in/out was fast and easy.  I would recommend this Hotel to any one. Only thing i think could be improved is the WIFI. Signal Strength was week only getting 2 bars everywhere in living room. Almost no service in the bathroom and bed room. Also had to relogin to the service almost 5 times during my stay.,50

"The rooms - standard king deluxe were huge and well appointed. There's a pillow menu which we took advantage of. The staff were all  very helpful and friendly, yet professional. Sammy at the concierge desk went to great lengths to help us book a restaurant. The hotel is well located, and even provided wheelchairs for our use. The only complaint is that even though the 33rd floor is non smoking, it was obvious that the neighbouring rooms had smokers. The staff were very apologetic and sprayed air fresheners when brought to their attention, but it would be good if they penalised the offenders.  ",40
"Lovely stay at the hotel , in all great service .. Just that the hotel should have their own Shuttle service for their guests for the city   Rest all great .... As always superb service which u would expect from a Conrad .  Don't hesitate to book at all !!!!",50
"My wife stayed here during a business trip and raved about the amenities and the candies (especially the candies!)   So, this time we went together and I was curious to whether the experience would live up to her hype.  Happily, it did.  I was most impressed by the staff.  Due to being allergic to cigarette smoke, we specifically requested a non-smoking room.  Not only did they provide one, but the staff accompanied us to the room, made sure it was smoke free and we were satisfied with it.  Just taking that extra step really sets the standard for good service for a 5 star hotel.    I would be delighted to stay again at this hotel in the future if they can maintain this high quality of service!",40
"Airport shuttle to hotel is only 5-7 mins and we checked in almost immediately. Yao (a young Malaysian) was at the counter and everyone is very friendly. I realized there's Yumi who speaks Japanese and probably other nationalities to cater to international customers needs. I booked through the hotel web and got my HHonours pts, if it's booked through other websites, no HHonours.   We got our junior suite room and was not disappointed. The sofa is long and enough to lay down 2 people flat for resting or a nap! The 2 queen Bed size is nice, blanket is very fluffy but is just a tad too warm for me. Pillow is soft so I use 2 stack up for me. Being an easy sleeper, I'm still getting my sleep so it's ok. Kids sleeps well and are thrilled so the stay is very comfortable. Hotel has…",50

"This stay, of 2 nights, at the Conrad Macao was the epitome of what a 5 star hotel should be and offer. I have stayed at both the Conrad Hong Kong and Macao, while both are great hotels, the Conrad Macao is superior. I have also stayed at a few JW Marriotts, a Sofitel, a few SPG hotels, and many 4.5 stars. So, I like to believe I have a good idea of what a good 5 star hotel should be. The Conrad Macao is an example of what a great 5 star hotel is. Therefore, my experience is as follows: as a Gold Rewards member, I was upgraded form a deluxe suite to a premier suite. The room was immaculate, well-appointed with hints of local flare, and huge: 156 sqm or almost 1,700 sqf. The sign in was fast, personable, and gracious: there was an offer to walk me to the elevator. The concierge,…",50
"We had such a memorable time in this hotel and would definitely recommend this to any couples who want to have some quality time in Macau. You will get much more than what you have paid for. Great location, outstanding service, and cute souvenirs.",50
This hotel is just the best!!! Spacious and very clean rooms. Staff very efficient. Convenient location.  There's something to do for everyone.  Food is great also.  All perfect...will definitely stay in Conrad again.. :),50
"Stayed here for 3 days, 2 nights. Since Sands Cotai combines several hotels and is a little confusing to navigate, the concierge took us all the way to our hotel room after our check-in. We got upgraded to the Deluxe City View room, which overlooks their pool. I was surprised upon returning at night to see our slippers laid out beside the bed and teddy bears on the pillows - a very thoughtful gesture. Overall, I was extremely happy with my stay.",50
"I stayed here for two nights in May.  I had arrived by ferry to Macao central terminal and they provided a bus service to here. (I went in circles a little bit before finding the front desk area as the Hotel is part of a huge complex of hotels and mall, so make sure either you get dropped at the front lobby or ask for directions. Once I found it though, I realized I got dropped off at the shops entrance rather than the hotels. Something to avoid).  The check-in was very fast and smooth. The front desk staff was very helpful, and spoke good English. They explained the hotel layout etc. and gave some tips about the area. I had ended up making two different reservations for each night, and it was a quick fix to get them combined into one stay.  The room was spacious, luxurious, and…",50
"What one expects of a Conrad!  Great service with all the amenities that one expects at Conrad, clean, and convenient to both gaming, shopping and food.   What more could you ask for.  It's the extras that count.   For my friend's birthday, they gave us a cake..  what a nice touch! I have stayed at a number of properties in the enclave and this one is the best!",50
"It is no surprise why the Conrad is ranked the #1 hotel in Macau as I write this. Upon arrival, you will notice that the service is world class. I was amazed at how hospitable and accommodating the staff was. This immediately relaxed me after my long travels from the US. For example, I booked a non refundable rate on the Hilton website. But due to some delays and travel changes, I arrived a day later than expected. The front desk took care of it and credited me back the amount without even me asking. They even upgraded me to a spacious suite. Being a platinum HHonors member definitely helps too. Classy moves Conrad.  The hotel itself is one of the nicest I have stayed in. Had turn down service, cookies left bedside and mini bottles of water throughout the room. Internet speed…",50
"The hotel already ""wow"" me when I first stepped into the property. The lobby was exquisitely designed with great grandiose. The check-in process was fast with an extremely friendly and helpful service staff. I was given a free upgrade to a Suite on the 37th floor. Had a fantastic view of the city. The room and amenities were attentively designed, equipped with a Nespresso machine. Even the bath robe gave a luxury feel when I was wearing it. My wife and I totally enjoyed ourselves although we returned the benefits that we got from the upgrade at the gaming tables. Truly live up to their tagline - Luxury of being yourself.",50
"I have stayed at many hotels in Macau before, but Conrad has been exceptional.  The room itself was fantastic.  They had everything that I needed and more.  The amenities were great and the whole place felt like home.  The front office staff were excellent!  They helped me with everything that I needed and provided a truly 5 star experience.  A special thanks to Mr. Galen Leung who assisted me throughout my whole stay.  His level of expertise and service is above and beyond what I had expected.  I will deem Conrad as my place of choice for all future visits to Macau, either for business or leisure.  Superb job Conrad!",50
"I booked a junior suite for a night to celebrate my mom’s birthday.    We arrived a bit early at 1:30 pm. Instead of going to the lobby we end up in the lift area. A kind staff Pedro? directly guided us to check-in where I could settle all formalities right away. He greets my mom and wishing her happy birthday in Chinese =). I requested late check-out for 1pm which was available without any problems.  Out of surprise we got upgrade to the Deluxe Queen Suite and the room was ready. The living room is spacious with dining table, couch, TV, nepresso machine and a very nice view over the Venetian. At the other end was the bed room, two queen size beds, reading table. But what was really amazing was the walk in wardrobe and a spacious toilet with bathtub and shower! A very cute…",50
"We arrived early in the morning and were greeted and made very comfortable by the staff in the Conrad Lounge. The property and rooms were stunning! I cannot think of anything that could have made our stay more positive. The only downside was that our room was so wonderful that it was hard to leave such luxury and elegance behind. I wish we could have stayed longer. The pool area and cabanas were wonderful. Despite the high temp temperature, the pool area was breezy and very enjoyable. If I am ever fortunate enough to visit Macau again in my lifetime, I will stay at the Conrad. ",50
"This is our third visit to the Conrad Macau, and it never fails to spoil us.  We were visiting with our 1-year old for his birthday celebration.  As with our previous experience, the pre-arrival email communication was excellent and efficient.  We were personally greeted at the lobby and got an upgrade as the hotel's loyal member.  The whole Conrad team was still all-time professional and warm - you simply can't miss their genuine and friendly smile because it's everywhere!  They were also extremely attentive to details that they prepared in advance all necessary baby amenities, cot, bath basin, bottle steriliser, etc, that made our trip so at ease with the little one.  The lounge on the 39/F was new to the property. It was spacious with a wide variety of delicious food and…",50
"My wife and I stayed here last week for one night.  Our view of the hotel was probably positively biased because they upgraded us to a king suite, but even without this I was very happy with the hotel and would gladly make it my pick for all future Macau stays.  We were contacted before check-in by the Hhonors manager to see if we had any special requirements or needs, and when I asked a few questions she replied the same day.  Service is excellent, both professional and friendly, and staff helpfulness is exceptional in all areas of the team, ranging from the concierge desk to housekeeping.  It is a beautiful hotel with a fantastic team.  The Conrad Macau holds its own amongst top global hotels, not just Macau.",50
"Stayed there one night for family visit and business. This hotel is definitely one of the best high end hotels in Macau. Occupancy is always full, which already explains how good this hotel is. Location is in Cotai Central so there will be gamblers and tourists walking around on the lobby level, but any level above is quite quaint. Service is excellent as you would expect from any Hilton/Conrad hotel as in one instance, I requested a room change and happily obliged. Rooms are clean, modern and luxurious. Gym and the pool are the best among the 3 hotels in Cotai. The lounge is also a cool place for a drink or treat your lady for a afternoon tea set (which is one of the best in Macau), and the servers are very friendly and most of them can speak English quite fluently. For what I…",50
"my stay at the conrad started before my arrival.  i got an email from diane inquring about my arrival and stay.  I had never been to macau/cotai before and was arriving late (after midnight) by ferry. Not  only did she give me all the information i needed to navigate all of the mass transit hazards (in a foreign country where i don't speak the language), but i managed, because of her help to make tight connections and felt very comfortable looking for and finding the right gates and transports, at night, after a long trip.  Because of Diane, the concerige was looking for me at 1am when i arrived, greeted me by name (nice surpise) and escorted me to the check in desk.  I stayed in a King suite, the room was huge, has every amenity and was impeccably clean.  Very comfortable beds,…",50
"We stayed in this hotel as I organised a ""thank you weekend"" for my wife in Macao. From the moment I contact the hotel before our arrival until the moment we checked out, the hotel has been fabulous. A special thank you to Francois, your efforts made my ""thank you weekend"" unforgettable.  Everything in the hotel has been designed with eye for detail, art on the walls, vases around the hotel, ceramic and superb lighting. Simply unbeatable. The room we got upgraded to was huge with a super bathroom and bedroom. A giant bath and a marvellous shower. We even made a movie to refresh our memory at a later stage.  Executive lounge was really good. Not only the quality of food/drinks and variety of food/drinks, but especially the personal attention (Thank you Sarah). It is obvious that…",50
"Very great experience for Conrad Hotel and service from Front Office - Ms. Vanessa Wong  For the restaurant, just a normal restaurant. not very good but not bad  Actually, the loction not really good but that's ok~~",50
"very receptive and cooperative staffs.  house keeping very good and service excellent. walking distance through sky walk to the largest casino at Venetian, Macau City of Dreams also on the next door where the water show is held",50
"I was a little surprised that the Conrad is in a massive complex shared with the Holiday Inn and Sheraton hotels so it did not really feel like a Hilton experience. Check-in was smooth, the reception was an impressive area and my welcome was quite amazing. After check-in, the receptionist escorted me to my room and explained the hotel and the room's facilities before setting off again to the front desk. I was on the 18th floor and in one of the largest rooms I have ever stayed in, it was just one step away from a suite. We had a massive bathroom with bath, shower area and twin sinks.  I opted for the light stay program - beds made but sheets not changed every day. This was a little mistake as housekeeping failed to clean the coffee cups and remove service plates daily. Maybe…",40
One of the best hotel I have tried so far. Excellent service starting from the front desk office. We would recommend this hotel to be choice hotel for the next Macau visit.   We are initially upset by the rude attitude shown by staff at the airport when we arrive but service by this hotel makes our trip more pleasant.,50
"We stay at Conrad for 3 nights with family for vacation, when until second when we came from Hong Kong Day Trip reach around 0000hrs, the hotel staff inform us that current moment is blackout and there are not sure what time it will be back on, plus there is no water supply at all..? im not sure how the electric and water pump is on going but does do a bit not convenience for my family. Called to call services but seems the operator cannot give me an exact problem for it. Until 0100hrs, power & water is back to normal. Try to get my hot shower before bedtime but water was yellowish! try to let it run for around 30 minutes but still the water is yellowish until i need to call to call services again and seek for solutions. she called for Engeenering for me but due to my mom and…",40
"Despite the facilities of this hotel are very pleasant and luxurious, but the front desk staff (multiple) were very IMPOLITE and UNPROFESSIONAL in customer services.   Our group checked in for two rooms at around 12:45pm, and was told our rooms would have been ready by 2pm. So we decided to take some rest and wait at the lobby to pick up our room key at 2pm.   At 2pm, it turned out neither of our room were ready, and when we asked follow-up question, the staff (multiple) started to make up excuse on why our rooms were not ready, such as housing keeping supervisor had not checked the room, room was not tied up, IT system was not working etc. etc. etc. Our group started to get frustrated on their nonsense, because all other check-in customers went up to their room smoothly at the…",20
"I simply stayed in this hotel for more than 12 times now (since it opened almost 3 years ago), but it was the first time to bring my family members to join me as well to enjoy the stay in this highly comfortable and luxurious hotel in Macao (Macau).  No need to mention how caring and lovely the hotel staff have been treating us (as always), but worth to highlight their highly impressive Executive lounge services and catering offered to its uniquely respectable hotel guests.  The Club lounge, headed by the manager, Diana Brewer and her team (including Renee, Frand, Ivan, Sarah) are extremely professional, cheerful and helpful.  Drinks & Snacks offered at the cocktail hours are at high quality and well displayed.  Although the weather was not great, me and my family's stay last…",50
"This is my forth time visit Conrad Macau this year, the services still keep outstanding. I personal requested the same room I stayed last month. And they did it. The pick up service at Ferry port and In-room check-in also make people confortable.  But a point, this hotel serve Evian Water since it opened few years ago, I dont know why this time they changed to Bonaqua, the standard is dropping.....made me little bit disappoint",40
"I give very few fives but this place is a five in every respect. Of course I got an upgrade to their largest suite and my experience was filtered through their wonderful executive lounge, but I am sure that just the normal garden variety stay is fabulous here, too. Rooms are spotless and the staff tend to everything with quiet efficiency. Not to be missed if you're in Macau.Food, too, was well prepared and plentiful. Best of Asian and American worlds. ",50
"We had booked a 2 day stay at the Conrad to celebrate my wife's birthday. We took the ferry from Hong Kong and on arrival at Macau took the free luxury courtesy coach to the hotel which is a 10 to 15 minute journey. On arrival at check in when the reception realised from the passport it was my wife's birthday gave us a free upgrade to a king suite. Wow, wow and double wow ! The rooms and hotel were furnished to an extremely high standard which you would expect from 5 star hotel with all the little extras included. We even had a complementary birthday cake delivered to our room in the evening. All this arranged by "" Owen"" our personel man at reception. Our room included breakfast which was taken at the ""Grand Orbit"" restaurant downstairs. The choice of food here catered for all…",50
"I had a terrible experience during my short stay.  On my first night, the hotel had a power blackout that lasted for about 3 hours - from 11 pm to 1 am.  There was no explanation on what had happened.  The next day, there was even no apology letter to the guests.  On my second night, there was a short power blackout again.  When I got to my room at around 10:30 pm, there was no TV service. This lasted until early in the morning. So, on the third day, I checked out leaving Conrad unsatisfied with the experience I had.",10
"Arrived at Taipa Cotei Jet Terminal, quick 10 min transfer to the Conrad, meet & great off the coach and ushered through the lobby by Warren who was delightful and very knowledgeable.  Opened the room door on the 29 th Floor and greated by a 2 queen bed suite, WOW very unexpected, probably the best hotel room I have ever had the pleasure to stay in and boy I have stayed in plenty both good and bad.  Appreciated the complementary Conrad duck & Teddy bear, great addition to the room.  Enjoyed the invite to the lounge which was also amazing and plush.  Great hotel had a fantastic time and considering a return at the end of August was that impressed.",50
I was amazed at the luxury of the room that I stayed at Conrad. The staff is extremely helpful and facilities excellent. Right from the picking up at the Airport and check-in at the hotel was meticoulously planned and executed by the staff. Stay was very comfortable.,50
"This is my second stay in Conrad Macau in the last 18 months. The hotel is on track and as usual excellent services and attentive to our needs. The suite is big and has all we need to have.  My recommendation.    Their Club Lounge Manager, Diana Brewer attended to details and left remarks to the Front Desk Receptionist to be sure we can be assisted and to be perfect with our visit to Macau.  Thank you, Diana.",50
"This is a rather new hotel, very close to the airport, but a bit far from major attractions.  If you are HH gold, then you would likely get a room upgrade with access to lounge. All is nice, if you do not care about a little extra commute time.  Friendly staff!",40
"Room is tidy and big. Matress quality is good, which make a leisure stay a plus. Love the complimentary conrad bear and rubber duck, it makes a warm welcome to travellers :) Overall experience is good. A hotel can consider to return.",40
"I stayed in Conrad Macau in April 2015. Nothing fantastic about the hotel but since it was a business trip, I did not really bother too much.  Upon check-out, I paid the bills as per what normal decent guest would have. Once back home, I settled by credit card accordingly as well.  To my shock and surprised, about a month later, I received another charge on my credit card from Conrad Macau for the SAME amount which I have already paid a month ago.  I contacted the hotel and they confirmed that it was a double charge and they will refund. I then reminded the hotel that they need to take note of the currency exchange rate, which Ken Xu promptly responded that he will take care of it and ensure there is no inconvenience to me.  What happened next was, the hotel did a refund without…",10
"excellent hotel,rooms were fantastic,location is perfect for casinos and exploring historical sites,friendly staff  who were extremely helpful,my son had an upgrade and his room was out f this worlds.we had the buffet breakfast and the variety of food was excellent for both European and Chinese guestss",50
"I was served very promptly at check in by a korean lady whom even escorted me to the room and have very clear information on what I could do in my spare time.  Hotel was well kept and spacious, wifi works good too. I had time for a morning workout, and every step of the way, even at check out, there were friendly smiles by all the Conrad staff.  Special thanks to also the concierge whom gave me a bottle of water and wet towel on check out - it wasn't necessarily a hot day, but a thoughtful gesture.  Fantastic location in the taipa side.  My only less than stellar feedback would be the slower lifts (they have 40 floors after all) and the restaurants in the cotai sands shopping. ",50
"Staff are polite and helpful.  Main lobby and lift lobby are located separately, route between them is not clear enough.  Twice a day for tidying up room and refilling stuff.  Choices/quality of food stall at shopping mall is not enough.  Shuttle bus service to other famous places needs to be improved.",40
"We were on a birthday getaway from HK and could not have been made to feel any more special!  The staff are first class!  Wherever we went they were warm and engaging and know how to create special moments.    The Conrad Club is the only way to go, great views and extra special attentive service. It was such a lovely surprise from what we thought casino hotels would be.  They certainly know how to deliver the personal touches........Can't wait to go back!",50
I had a lovely two night stay at the Conrad. The customer service is wonderful  facilities are modern and well maintained and the rooms very spacious.   If I wasn't moving into an apartment in Macau I would have stayed longer !,50
"I was traveling with my 86-year-old grandmother who required a lot of attention. We decided to go to the concierge to borrow a wheelchair for her to travel around in. While trying to figure out how to cross to the Shoppes at Venitian, we bumped into a Conrad staff named Arnisah, who was already off-duty. Arnisah saw us struggling with direction, and she kindly showed us the way to the Venetian through the indoor connecting bridge. From the moment we arrived in the Conrad Macau, we have received such excellent services from every single personnel we've met. We had a lovely stay at the Conrad Macau.",50
Corad Hotels and Resorts at Cotai is the best choice to stay because it is convenience to go to other place with good transporation service and also close to air port which take only 15 minutes. We can save time and spent more time in the hotel. We would like to go back again in winter season,50
"This is truly the best Conrad I ever visit. Location is perfect for any time of day or night, shopping, walking or any other activitie. Everything on my satay was perfect, specially the staff members who made our stay memorable.",50
"It was such a great stay with my long time friend. Every facility of hotel is very new and size of room is huge. From the front gate to Club lounge, every single people works very professionally. I was so happy with Conrad Macao and I will come back to Macao soon with my family just because of this hotel.",50
"This hotel is ranked number one in Tripadvisor and it was certainly lovely. It is on the Cotai Strip and close to all casino  and entertainment. A trip by shuttle, bus or taxi takes you Macau and the  old Portugese area. Petro welcomed us and took us to our room. The service was always friendly and personalised. The rooms had everything and were beautifully appointed and large.  The hotel is a apart of the larger Sands complex and it is big. Therefore aspects of the hotel felt a bit disjointed as happens in a large complex but the staff welcome you at every component. We indulged in breakfast $209 which was at the Grand Orbit on the other side of the complex but it was wonderful. The gym and steam room sauna are state of the art with good instructors on the 4th floor. The pool…",50
"firstly, I gave them my ID and was told that I did not have a reservation and that they could not find my name. I gave them my travel documents for them to look me up but they couldnt tell what was my surname and first name (from my english name). After trying again and asking crap questions, they found it and said the booking I made on booking.com had switched the order of my name (lame excuse). It was actually cuz the receptionist was too incompetent to figure it out -_-  Seriously.. the worst mistake a hotel can make (being 5 star or whatever) is not being able to look up the reservation and tell the guest that they cant' find it while asking if it was made under another name. I was pretty pissed..and asked for an upgrade which was first denied unless I paid extra. It was a…",30
"My husband and I stayed at the Conrad Macao for the weekend and we had an absolutely fabulous stay!  This is a relatively new hotel that is a part of the Sands Cotai Strip and it's one of the nicest Conrad hotels that we have ever stayed at.  My husband is a Hilton Diamond member so we were upgraded to a beautiful and very spacious suite and had check-in, breakfast and cocktails at the executive lounge.  The executive lounge service was incredible and Diana Brewer and her team of managers and staff are to be commended for their excellent guest service work.  Everyone from check-in to food service made us feel welcomed and pampered. The food in the lounge was tasty, plentiful and well presented.    In fact, every staff we've encountered at the hotel was friendly and helpful, even…",50
"We were fortunate enough to be upgraded to a suite and to Club access.  The hotel was just perfect.  The room was about 1,600 sq. ft. With two bathrooms, more TVs than you could ever need and a great workspace.  The food, beverage, and service in the Club lounge was impeccable.  Everyone was gracious and helpful.  The availability of nearby restaurants is huge.  There's a covered walkway connecting to the Venetian, so if you can't find what you want in Cotai Central, it's convenient to visit the Venetian complex or, walk accross a street and visit City of Dreams.  I have stayed a three other hotels in Macau and while the standards are very high at all of them, I would choose the Conrad for another visit.",50
"We had 3 nights staying in a junior suite in early April.  We were very pleased with the quality of the hotel and the service offered by their staff. Most noteworthy was the size of the suite - extremely spacious, well appointed and stylish.  Enjoyed the Nespresso machine.  We were also contacted by the Conrad concierge in the days prior to our arrival to check if there was anything they could assist or prebook for our trip.   The hotel is situated in the Cotai Central which is the casino and shopping district.  There is a lot of construction of new casinos in this district. We agreed that if we went back to Macau we would stay on the other side closer to the central Portuguese area. There seems to be more local activity in this area and it is a more cultural experience.  We…",50
"My stay at the Conrad Macau was EXCELLENT!!!!! we had a beautiful King Suite, The service was awesome, Room Service was very prompt & great value for money. We also used the executive lounge & were exteremely satisfied with the food,beverage & service we received. Would certainly go back to stay again & also recommend it to all the people I know.",50
"I was staying with my husband and my baby. The room was fantastic and my baby likes the turndown golden bear. The birthday cake arrangement was great. We tried the breakfast at the buffet restautant on the 2nd day, there were many choices, the chefs are nice and both of us felt super satisfied. But the colleagues may need some improvements, even the colleagues who wore in black, they were not so helpful. We also saw the parade at 1500hrs, the dancers were so passionate, we had a lot of fun. Overall, we love the hotel so much, especially the Guest Relations Team, they wrote a card to my baby with his name. We felt touching and many thanks with the GR team. If we go to Macau next time, we probably will choose Conrad again!",40
"wonderful room.  single king suite.  the suite was 4 total rooms.  very helpful staff.  Apparently TripAdvisor needs a longer review.  We had dinner at a Chinese restaurant that had good food and very helpful staff who even made good food suggestions.  We had a cigar at the Cigar Emporium, which as had an attentive staff and a nice smoking room.  The cigar selection was out of this world.  We had a very nice lounge breakfast.  Good food and service.  The Front desk at check out was very thorough and courteous.  Again Stay at the Conrad",50
"Overall everything was very good, except for smoke smell in supposedly non smoking rooms.  This was a relatively new hotel, believe it was built in 2013 or so.   I would return next time when visiting Macau.",40
"This hotel has been like heaven on earth with angels as staffs. Conrad Hotel is not just a 5 star hotel but an unforgettable life experience. Thanks to people like Warren who has been an amazing person and was their to make our stay as wonderful as he can make it. Thanks also to Mary who has been as patient in explaining where to go and how to get there to enjoy the place like Macau. The room 3417 has been a haven for 4 days to my family. It has an amazing view, although there are lots of buildings being built that you can see as well but it hasn't  dampen the beautiful view especially at night. Macau has been a fantabulous experience for my kids and me. I would like to thank all the staff in Conrad Macao Cotai Central for the amazing care they've all given us. All of them has…",50
"The Conrad team did an outstanding job in taking care of every aspect of our stay from the initial greeting, concierge service and checking out process. We received a complimentary birthday cake from the Conrad team, adding value to celebration. Their attention to details made our stay an enjoyable one.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Conrad Macau.",50
"It can seem peculiar that the highly esteemed CONRAD brand is sharing shuttle bus with Holiday Inn, but as the hotels clearly are sharing both owner and property, the mystery is solved! But the comparisons ends with the bus. I cannot imagine being treated with more attention by the entrance staff, receptionists and concierge than I received! They even remembered my very difficult Danish last name for my complete stay.  The deluxe king room is more of a suite in my opinion. With 52 square meters it is much more than just a hotel room. The suite is filled with lovely details and the CONRAD brand is well-accompanied by complimentary Evian and Nespresso. The bathroom is just lovely and especially the bathtub was fantastic.  The city view was splendid and I could also spot the lovely…",50
"My wife and I recently stayed at the Conrad Macau for two nights on vacation.   Everything about our stay was excellent - every member of staff we met was courteous and professional, our upgraded suite was huge and the executive lounge large and friendly.  The front desk helped us find a travel agency to book a discovery tour of Macau - delivering a hand written note and map directions to the booking office to our room.  I will be recommending this hotel to all my friends and colleagues on my return from vacation.  We travelled to Macau via the Cotai Water Jet from Hong Kong - I must admit I was a little confused/worried as how the baggage/luggage would work when getting onto the ferry, but with a 'cotai first' ticket it was a simple matter of just taking everything with us and…",50
"Being a long time business traveler having yearly average of 90 days, I was overall very positively impressed. I can say that the quality of service was excellent+, never seen a hotel having so many staff with such a high quality, dedication and a genuine smile each time you see them. Not only on the lounge where they greet you with your name even the first time they see you but everywhere. If ever again in Macao, I would not even think of going some other hotel.",50
"I've stayed at a number of different Hilton family hotels/resorts around the world, from the Hilton Sydney to the Conrad in Hong Kong and Conrad Tokyo.  However, this was easily the best level of service and most beautiful location I've stayed at.    I arrived at Macau airport and took the Sands Cotai shuttle to the Sands Complex in which the Conrad is located.  First, the shuttle has extremely comfortable seats, definitely a modern bus, with good aircon and free wifi (a great bonus for a traveler).  The shuttle buses seemed to run about every 20 minutes and only take 10 minutes or so to get to the hotel.  Upon getting off the shuttle and heading to the doors on the Conrad as staff member immediately offered to help me with my luggage.  I was escorted through a large sweeping…",50
"What beautiful rooms at the Conrad Macau and so tastefully decorated. I had a suite that was huge and even had its own media room The staff are incredibly attentive and Diana Brewer was particularly welcoming. The pool facilities offer a lot of choice, and try the Steam / Sauna / Jacuzzi at the fitness centre. I didn't want to leave!",50
From the moment we checked in we were greeted by very professional and customer service oriented staff members.    The lobby was beautifully decorated for Easter.  We were upgraded to a suite and escorted to the room where Ea went over everything with us and made sure that we were comfortable.  Francois and Chanel at the Executive Lounge were of great assistance and were ready to help with anything that we needed.  The location couldn't have been better as it was near the fishing town of Coloane which is quite charming and home to Lord Stowes Bakery/Cafe and not to be missed!  It is also directly across the strip from the Venetian.  I truly enjoyed every aspect of the 2 nights that we were there and wished that we had stayed longer!,50
"My experience with the Conrad started before I even arrived in Macau. The chief concierge, Edmund, reached out to me via email prior to my trip and over a few exchanges, I received some very useful information for my journey. Not only was Edmund's information detailed, he very quickly deciphered my style and personalized his recommendations based on it. He even greeted me upon check-in to introduce himself, which was a very nice gesture on his part.  I booked a deluxe king suite, and let me tell you, this ""room"" was absolutely massive, larger than most urban 1 bedroom apartments. There was even a second living room off to the side of the main room that housed a home theater. The bedroom and bathroom, like the living room(s), were equally ginormous. It took me a full 4 steps to…",50
"It is my pleasure to again write about the Conrad Macao Hotel.  I recently stayed there again and was surprised by more great additions to marvel the guests.  The Staff continues to be unique, in making sure that our needs as guests are taken care of. And the attention to detail of the Staff at the Executive Lounge makes our stay feel like “being in Paradise”.   The Executive Lounge at the 39th Floor is now open and it is a fantastic collection of rooms to enjoy and to delight in the superb decoration, I believe by a Decoration Company from Texas. The attention to detail, the selection of furniture, the “Reading Room”, the “Lounge Rooms”, the “Reception Room”, the toilets, all is now not only delightful, but also welcoming, elegant and superior to so many other Executive Lounges…",50

This is one of my favorite hotel if I am to stay at cotai area. The rooms are new and spacious. Beautifully furnish. The hotel is connected to 2 more hotels and casino at the lobby. Shops and restaurants at the lobby area. There is many other major hotel nearby,50
"I had the opportunity to stay in Conrad Macao recently, and the experience I had was truly one of a kind. The service staff, Maiko was very professional, pleasant and she made the effort to make my stay memorable. Maiko took the time to explain the details of my room and she even recommended some of the places that I should go to in Macao and how to get there. She walked me to my room with a friendly welcome. The whole experience was fantastic.  The room that I requested was available immediately without any delay and it was exactly what I wished for.   Although, they did forgot to place the signature Conrad teddy bear in my room, and I had to call them before they personally deliver one to me. But apart from that, I did have a wonderful time in Conrad and I'll recommend anyone…",40
It's my 1st review in Tripadvisor although I always read the information through this website. Definitely my 1st review should be contributed to the Conrad Macao as we had a great stay!  We stayed there for 2 nights (4 adults and my 2 years old baby). I can say that it is one of the best service hotels I have ever stayed in the world (I am a frequent traveler). My baby enjoyed it very much and they arranged everything for us smoothly. Highly appreciate and would like to say a BIG thank you to 1) Joana from Guest Relations Team and 2) Stephen from Concierge. Joana made all the restaurant reservations for us and prepared nice gifts to my baby and my parents who had wedding anniversary. She brought us to the rooms and explained the facilities in the rooms in detail. She is very…,50
Picked this one because it's ranked first in Trip Advisor. We did make a right choice.   The service is excellent and the room is great. The whole experience is fantastic.  Thanks Eva for arranging the cake for our anniversary and Michell for showing us the room with a friendly welcome.,50
"We stayed in the Conrad for two nights while we were in Macau. It was a terrific experience! From the very warm welcome, to the personalized service, including a very large, wonderfully appointed, comfortable room - the Conrad has it all. The staff is always eager to be helpful including assisting us to plan our sightseeing tour. This is definitely a 6 star hotel, and we would recommend it to anyone wanting to enjoy the luxury of an upscale hotel!",50
The staff at this hotel go the extra step to make your stay amazing. We were upgraded to a suite which was just stunning and opulent. The front office staff were very friendly and helpful and the executive lounge was just amazing. The staff went out of their way with fabulous service and their manager took the time to talk to guests and ensure they were receiving brilliant service. We can't wait to return!,50
"From the moment we arrived, we felt spoiled.  Everyone here was so attentive and capable.  The suite was spacious,luxurious, and well appointed. Every evening, the turn down staff would surprise us with some delightful gesture.  All the staff in the executive lounge is really outstanding, they really made our stay very special.  The concierge was also very knowledgeable and helped us arrange tickets to the dancing water show, which must not be missed in Macau.  The location in Cotai is an easy 15 minute walk to Taipa village, or just across the bridge from the entire Venetian complex of shops, casinos etc.  The only thing that brings them down a bit is the pool area was reduced due to construction of the building next door.  They need to have the whole pool area operating at …",50
"I stayed here in November 2014. I was actually at the Sheraton located next door just a few days before and tried the Conrad for the last few days of my trip. I would say that service is much better at the Conrad. Service was much more personal and all the staff I met spoke decent english. The Conrad is located in the Sand Cotai resort, so if you are arriving in Macau via ferry or airport, make sure you look for the Sand Cotai shuttle bus. The hotel itself is clean as it is expected from other Conrad hotels. Sands Cotai is a very big complex, offering decent amount of food selection. However i didn't not enjoy most of the restaurants there. It was ok but not worth the price.  I think generally speaking you can find better food on the Macau side and not in Cotai. I tried Xin,…",50

"This facility measured up to the Conrad namesake. I've stayed in the Conrad Seoul and elsewhere, and the Conrad Macau is one of the best. The staff are beyond friendly, and go out of their way to provide a level of customer service that is disappearing in other areas of the world. This was a family vacation, and our 9 year old had plenty to do. Great swimming facilities!",50
Very nice experience . Good location near The venetian Macao walk just 5 minutes. Good staff everybody so lovely . Staff at Executive lounge make me field love here. Nice dinner and breakfast so delicious. We very impressed with the bear at the bedroom and The room is comfortable.,50
"Conrad in Macau is very very good! My family will visit to this hotel again. And all hotel staffs are very kindness and my family was happy during the stay.  The room is perfect and so clean, no issue..... Especially thanks to Diana,",50
"I wanted to stay in Conrad Hotel encouraged by its prestigious name, its position in the Macao Cotai Strip and its recent excellent positioning in Forbes Travel Guide. I had high expectations, which have all been met: it's really a luxury 5 stars hotel! The hotel is located in a building full of every kind of shop, restaurant and entertainment, basically you can shop, eat, play, sleep, gamble (and do many other things) without needing to move so much around, anyway if you want ""more"" you can just go out and cross the street: there are plenty of other hotels, casinos, shops within a few hundred meters. Also they offer a very good connection service with free hotel shuttle buses all around Macao.  The room was pretty big, with a very big and comfortable bed, a sofa, desk, tea…",50
"I had booked a suite room at the Conrad for a business conference, and had been informed by the concierge that I had a complimentary one way limo transfer, which I booked accordingly. Upon touchdown, I met the concierge (Arnisah), whom I informed I had a party of 3 pax with me, which was larger than my initial booking of 1 pax. It also happened that on that day, there was a massive jam causing a lockdown of all traffic, which affected the shuttle buses as well. As the limo could only take 4 pax, Arnisah graciously offered to give up her seat so that my whole party could travel (and be stuck in the jam) together in comfort, while she waited patiently for the shuttle bus. This was top-notch service in my opinion as she could have just rejected my last minute request!  I was…",50
"The Hotel made sure that we had a wonderful Wedding Anniversary weekend. They could not have been more accommodating or caring. They really made sure that we had a special time. The room was gorgeous, as were the amenities. The gymnasium and pool were also great. The room service food and waiting staff also rate highly. A highly- recommended property. Check it out if you're in Macao.",50
"This was a mixture of points and points and money stay and as a HHonors diamond was upgraded from a city room deluxe to a suite. There was excellent pre-stay communications from the Executive Lounge Manager who helped with the instructions on how to get from HKIA to Macau on onwards to the Conrad, the last bit being to head for the hotel shuttles and find the lime green bus (turn right and right at the top of the escalator) heading for the Holiday Inn / Conrad.  The lounge is excellent and all the staff outstanding.",50
"Stayed here for a night with my mom for a weekend in Macau. Room is 5 star all the way with very big and comfy beds, luxurious bathroom, and probably the biggest room I've ever stayed in. We were served by a very lovely and courteous Indonesian male staff at reception (best treatment I've ever received from a hotel reception staff). The concierge staff was very helpful in securing a booking at a Michelin-starred restaurant in downtown Macau. Too bad we only stayed for one night, would've loved to have stayed there longer.",50
"I would like to extend my special appreication to Mr. Ea Enriquez and his teammates in providing a memorable, surprise and warm service in which my husband really enjoyed a sweet birthday at this hotel.",50
"As a Hilton HHonors member since 2005, I travel frequently with my work. I almost always stay at a Hilton property wherever I go. I have been travelling to Macao since 2008 and it was a welcome relief to see Conrad open its doors a couple of years ago. Despite opening with an executive lounge I am pleased to see it finally relocated and opened.   Room are spacious and easy to navigate your way around. The staff are excellent. To my shock and surprise I am treated by every member of staff by name. From the doorman, to the housekeepers to the elevator attendants. I have never ever experienced anything like that in such a large hotel anywhere. I have some specific requests (e.g mini bar stocked with certain type of soda) and my special requests are met each and every time without…",50
"If only we could have stayed more than one night!! One of the best hotel experiences we have had in Macau. The Conrad Macao makes for a perfect romantic retreat away from home for the weekend with beautiful rooms, impeccable service and great amenities throughout the hotel. Most certainly it will be our destination of choice each time we return - fantastic experience!",50
i stay in the hotel for two nights with my family during spring festival.it is wonderful stay and is one of my toppest experience.before stay EA is so nice to arrange everything for our family .the welcome letter prepared by EA for my son is so cute!the brandly new lounge is one the best and the wine is good. i will defintely recommended to all of my friend and for sure i will back again.,50
We were having our 33rd anniversary staying in the premium suite from which the elegant decoration of the room deeply attracted our eye balls.  It is the most spacious suite we ever had comparatively to the value we paid. The bed is extremely comfortable. Hotel staff are helpful and friendly.  Chinese dishes are excellent.  I will highly recommend this hotel to my friends planning to celebrate their BIG DAY in Macau.,50
"Excellent service from front desk to room sevice. Food is great and can delivered around only 20 minutes. Room dedor is excellent, with very fresh smell. Only sound insulation is not that good as I can hear other guest loud talking in the corridor.",50
This has got to be one of the best Conrad Hiltons I have stayed. Check-in was fast and very accommodating. We were able to upgrade to a king bed without any problem. Our clerk took us to our suite and explained everything...very sweet host. The suite itself was by far the largest I have booked. It was clean and spacious. The evening turn down service was also very timely. We took advantage of the lobby lounge bar for drinks and the staff there were also very nice.  The hotel is located close to all the other hotels and casinos and resturants.,50
"Had an amazing stay at the Conrad Macao. The lounge is fantastic, one of the best I have seen at any property. Diana and her entire team in the lounge were wonderful, so friendly and attentive. That was the most incredible service I have ever experienced in a lounge. Bravo!",50
"This is my second stay in the hotel and the first time writing a review.  The first one was about a year ago and that one was not good as we were disturbed by the noisy beer festival until 3am in the midnight which we just can't sleep.  This time, the front office manager, Vanessa, did a good job to repair my bad memory.  The free room upgrade and the cake for celebrating my wedding anniversary were touching and made my trip a memorable one!  The suite is excellent with just a little room of improvement. Need to be patient to wait for a few minutes before the hot water running off the tap.",40
"Stayed here again this past weekend.  This is my family's hotel of choice in Macao -  Fantastic property, excellent customer service, wonderful rooms and staff that go above and beyond to make it an absolutely fantastic experience for guests. For this reason, while I very rarely write reviews, I just had to share this.  Particular kudos goes to Prem Comboz and his Front Office Team as well as the team at the Concierge Desk.  They are absolutely wonderful.  Consistently fabulous.  If you are looking for a hotel in Macao, look no further.",50
"Largely a good experience and what you'd expect at this price point and for a Conrad Hotel.  Booked a suite over the Christmas/New Year period which was a crazy busy time but compared with the Sheraton, the Conrad felt far less chaotic.  Of course the Sheraton in Macau is the largest of their properties in the world with 3000 rooms so it's unsurprising but does make the Conrad the better choice if you prefer less noise and crowds, it's just more expensive.  Room was nice though unfortunately there was only a smoking room available when we checked in though staff went to a lot of effort to try to clear the smoke smell.  The hotel is really beautiful in the public areas though the room doesn't feel quite as plush, it is however still good.  The Conrad teddies, rubber duckie and…",50
"I had stayed in Conrad for a night with my partner and we would like to experienced the service of this brand.  We had stayed in Grand Hyatt before and want to try either Sheraton or Conrad.    We check in before lunch time and the staff is very nice to arrange early check in for us.  I guess ten room assigned to us is being upgraded.  The room is big and with a big bathing room.  The decoration on wall is nice and I like it very much.    Room provided with free wifi and the bed is big and comfortable.  We want to dine in some famous restaurants and the concierge paid its effort to check for a few suggestion for us.   In general, I would love to stay in Conrad again.",50
"Would not stay here again. Firstly, I just wanted to say that the Executive lounge and its staff are fabulous, and that aspect I will certainly recommend. However what marred my stay was the following 1. Hot water not working in the shower this morning. 2. The sound on the television in the bedroom kept going off every 5 mins or so. You had to turn the tv on and off to get it to put the sound back on. 3. Last night I was having a Skype conference for work in my room. There was some type of concert/outdoor entertainment occurring which made it hard to hear. I rang down to reception to ask what it was and what time it would be finishing. I was very rudely told we cannot control outside noise. I wasn't asking for anyone to do something, I just wanted information. The staff member…",10
"Well located, wonderful service, convenient for shopping, just 10 mins walk to Venetian then you get everything. Plenty good restaurants nearby. I liked Dynasty 8 where served with exquisite Chinese cuisine. The cotai view from the top floor lounge was nice.",50
"1. Check-in was very efficient. Lynn at the reception desk proceeded our check-in very efficiently and thoughtfully. 2. We stayed at the deluxe room with the city view, which was wide enough for a family with 2 adults and 1 child. 3. The view of a city view room was very beautiful.",50
"stayed for the third time feb14th2015 ....and did not disappoint , the Hiltons hotels in the uk could learn a lot from the customer service  hospitality and luxurious surroundings ....as diamond members we were made to feel like royalty , all staff were friendly and professional with a very special thank you to Gwen{pool side}",50
"I booked Conrad with my friend without really knowing much about it, except that its seemingly good reputation and the fact that it was yet to be fuly booked! Both my friend and I wanted to have a relaxing stay for 1 night over the weekend and so we booked a junior suite. To our surprise, the suite was really spacious, with a large ""living room"" where long comfy sofas were located, and a bedroom with two double bed. Both the living room and bedroom have their own TV and this was great when we basically spent most of our time in our hotel room just to chill.   Talking about their service, we were taken by surprise again by how efficient and helpful the staff were. As we were unable to reserve table for our lunch and dinner at some ""famous""/""popular"" restuarants in Macau…",40
I went to this hotel for my honeymoon but my room was dirty with a big stain on the headboard when I walked in. They didn't even bother to switch the room for us so totally disappointed. I would not recommend this hotel to any traveler.,10
"The location of Conrad Macao is perfect. The hotel is next to the Venetian and closed to the airport. At the same time，Conrad Macau is very thoughtful and considerate. If I‘ve got a chance to come back, I wil book the Conrad Macau first.",50
"Recently, I had a 4D/3N stay with my family at Conrad, Macao. It was a very pleasant stay.  We took the Cotai Water Jet from HK to Taipa Ferry Terminal, Macau. The journey was one hour. After we arrived, the pre-arranged hotel car had already been there and took us directly to Conrad. To my surprise, the hotel staff welcomed us at the entrance of the hotel. One of them, Joana, the Guest Relations Officer took us directly to our room which was located on the high and non-smoking floor. I had a fast check-in in my room. The room was spacious with two queen size beds and a separate living room with a great view. The decoration was new and elegant. Chinese food is my favourite. There was a very good Chinese Restaurant ""Dynasty 8"" in the hotel. The restaurant was decorated in Chinese…",50
"I have been visiting Macau for many years and have stayed in many of the hotel (Venetian, Wynn, MGM, Sheraton, etc) but the Conrad, in my opinion, is the best.   The staff are outstanding and the rooms are large, luxurious and comfortable. However, the thing that sets this hotel apart from the others is the excellent proximity to dining and shopping without being forced to walk through the casino. This is a huge plus for me.   This will be my hotel of choice in Macau as well as the one I choose for my business colleagues when they visit from now on. ",50
"This is my favorite hotel in Macao. First choice for me ever. The room is very well comfort with all amenities as request. The staff at reception, lobby bar and house keeper all provided the first class service and very helpful. I really love to come back to stay at this hotel again in the future.",50
"We were there for one night for my parents anniversary - the communications with Edmund with the concierge desk was beyond helpful - when we showed up he was there and made sure everything is prefect for us. My boyfriend broke the zipper of his suitcase as we were departing, and somehow Edmund magically found a luggage belt for us to hold his bag together. We also enjoyed how much attentions were paid to the smallest details at the property, from the amazing staff at the club room, to the turn down service, to the amenities in the room. Overall, we enjoyed our stay very much - thank you for an amazing time!",50
"To start with, let me first mention that we were redeeming my husband's Hilton Honors points while booking 2 nights at this hotel and we were upgraded to a rather luxurious 'suite' considering his gold status..... but even putting the 'material' benefits aside, it was the sheer service attitude and warmth and care of the staff that made this experience a memorable one. There was no doubt about the room being an excellent one with great view, fantastic facilties and a 'feel at home' kind of feeling. to add to that, the staff was very friendly, went out of their way to accomodate my 'vegetarian only' daughter - something we will always remember them for. the hotels location is a great plus point. city of dreams, venetian etc are all walking distance from the hotel. also, the hotel…",50
"We went to Cotai Strip to celebrate Chinese New year and decided to stay in 3 different hotels during our 4 days stay there just to get a different kind of experience. While we expected Venetian to come out on Top, Conrad surprised us by the quality of its rooms and fantastic service ethics of its staff who were awesome to say the least. We got a junior suite which was very spacious and looked brand new with the quality of amenities provided in the room top notch and miles ahead of the competitors. Since we had kids travelling with us, the staff was courteous to send complimentary macrons and teddy bears which delighted the kids and made their day!! The bathroom was quite spacious and the toiletries were of highest quality. The twin beds were excellent with soft mattress and…",50
"Excellent hotel! We were amazed with how helpful and efficient every single member of staff were. Will definetely be staying there again in any future visit to Macau. We had requested a quiet room on a high floor and our wish was fulfilled to the maximum- it felt we were alone in the hotel when we were in our room! Great variety in the breakfast buffet, western and asian dishes. We also had a wonderful experience at the spa- very skilled therapists, with friendly but professional attitude.",50
"Conrad has almost been my first choice whenever I visit Macau. The rooms are perfect and the service staff (almost usually) a standout. This trip was no different, except that the Club Lounge was finally opened on the 39th floor. I went up for cocktails and while the drinks available were extensive, the staff were trying way too hard (to a fault). We were asked for our rooms 3 times, orders were forgotten, they were fretting over some obvious DYKWIAs and being overly selective with who to serve... seemed almost like a joke about the heightened level of enthusiasm amongst them. Less is sometimes more, and in this instance providing better service could probably be achieved by taking a step back and taking a deep breathe instead of foraging forward and missing the whole point. …",50
"We were bowled over by the exceptional service and quality of this hotel - which way exceeds a standard 5 star hotel in our opinion! Even before we arrived we received an email from the Guest Relations Manager (Kim) to advise us of the HH Diamond benefits and an offer to note any special requests. The experience from the minute we arrived was world class. When we got to the front desk we were invited to check-in on the Executive Lounge where we were greeted by very friendly staff. We were advised we had been upgraded to an Executive Suite. The suite was fantastic and even had a separate TV room, a great oversized bathroom and top quality amenities! Kim had also kindly arranged a cake as we mentioned it was our anniversary - a very nice touch. We had breakfast in the Executive…",50
"We were there to celebrate our anniversary and asked for a room with a view. The view was just facing another hotel and some construction site which was pretty disappointing. The bed was comfy but the duvet was too thick. I was sweating lots. Beautiful bathroom but they need to fix the shower door. Lots of water on the floor after my shower. They have put a big towel on the floor. It was all wet. This shouldn't happen at a five star hotel.   Breakfast was great. I enjoyed that a lot. Overall, My hubby and I would have liked our stay more if we were given a room with a better view.",40
"Overall it's good though, can't say was great or definitely want to come back.... The staff @ check-in was NOT so helpful, he didn't give me an upgrade and even told me they will deliver newspapers to my room every morning but never did. Most staff try to talk to me in LOCAL language even I do NOT look like LOCAL which was really uncomfortable...  But, concierge lady was very very kind and worked great!  Compare to other Conrad, does not meet its quality.",30
"Very lovely stay at this hotel!  I enjoyed the comfortable beds, watching fashion T.V., the nice sitting area as I welcomed my friends, the friendly spa service and private gym.  The hotel provides me will everything I need to have a luxury inspiring travel and I couldn't ask for more.  Will definitely come back again on my next trip to Macao.",50
"When visiting Hong Kong, whether on business or pleasure, I always endeavour to allow two or more days to go to Macau, a less than 60 minute journey from either Hong Kong or Hong Kong Airport by jet ferry. Although I am not a gambler, I find Macau to be a real jewel, with some of the best hotels and restaurants in the world. On this trip I chose to stay at the Conrad Macau Cotai Central. This is certainly one of the finest hotels in this ex Portuguese territory.   I love a good 5 star hotel with a choice of restaurants, lounges and facilities and Conrad Macau ticks all the boxes for me. Our room, a King Deluxe on a high floor overlooked most of Macau and one could see the many additional new hotels springing up in all directions. After a very efficient check in we were shown to…",50
"Quite simply one of the most amazing hotel in Macao, staff were well trained, sincere and very consistent. The rooms are beautiful, well maintained and very warm and comfortable. There were a few aspects that really made my stay which were the positive encounters with different staff members and they were truly genuine in helping me with my requests and assuring my stay was comfortable and enjoyable. It takes a lot of effort, training and dedication and no wonder, #1 on Trip Advisor! Very well done, Conrad Macao!",50
"It is another long overdue review as I haven't been writing for a year.   We stayed at Conrad for 3 nights in Feb to celebrate my wife's birthday. We have been staying at Four Seasons, Banyan Tree, Venetian, Sofitel and Hotel LFK,and decided to stay at this relatively new hotel at Coating Strip. One of the main reason, because we are a collector of Conrad Bears!  The location is great as is has an own mall, also nearby City of Dreams where you can watch the famous ""The House of Dancing Water"" and good michelin stars restaurant. Also within walking distance to the famous Rua du Conha.   We even have a surprise birthday cake!  The only disappointment, we only get a bear even though we stayed for 3 nights.",50
"I had a great experience from a previous stay when the Conrad Macau first opened. At that time I stayed in a club suite but sadly I found out later that the lounge been closed. For me being a serious swimmer, the one thing that kept from coming back was mainly because their pools are small.  Since I go to macau a few times a year and had been somewhat frustrated with other 5 star Macau hotels, I reached out to Paweena to see when their club lounge will be back open.  She had already transferred to Dubai but was still good enough to forward my info to the right person at Conrad Macau.    I stayed for 2 night in the beginning of Jan in a Deluxe suite.  Upon arrival off the bus, their staff member immediately greeted me, helped me with my lugguage and walked me over to check in. …",50
"Perfect HHonors members' benefits, and all staff are nice and efficient. Room is quit big, nice and clean. Amazing experience. What should be mentioned, the slipper provided by the hotel is not comfortable, and only 3 devices are allowed to registered to the internet. Overall, the hotel is highly recommended.",50
"Stayed here for a night as a surprise birthday celebration for my mom, the staff that i've met are all very professional and polite, the room was very beautiful, i got a good view of the pool side area, thank you to Ms. Sabrina at the Front Desk for giving me a good room. I loved the Conrad bears that I got after they turned down our suite, it's so adorable!  I ordered in breakfast for myself and my parents, I can say I had a very happy tummy to start my day! Thank you to the in-room dining staff for the scrumptious breakfast! :)",50
"I've really enjoyed each stay at this property.  The staff, facilities, and location are top notch.  The other COTAI properties are close by and the Macau properties are a short shuttle or taxi ride away.  The new Conrad Club for HHonors Gold and Diamond members was a welcome surprise on my most recent visit.",50
"We decided to take our kids (1 yr and 4 yr old) to Macao for some sightseeing. We chose the Conrad because of its location and ratings in Tripadvisor.  We were expecting a similar experience to the one in Hong Kong, but this location exceeded our expectations.  They were so kind to accommodate us all in a suite (3 adults plus the kids), most especially since I told them that we could not be separated from the kids -- that alone you see that they care for their customers comfort.  The suite we booked was HUGE.  We all loved the space (most especially the kids as they were able to run around the room).  The room looks better in actual than the photos on the webpage (which is quite rare as most of the time it is the other way around).  The room colors were cool and muted and…",50
The Conrad Hotel in Macau is a well managed property offering a very compfortable environment. All staff encountered were very helpful and were a genuine pleasure. This property is well maintained and well staffed. Good transport to and from hotel. Highly recommended as a hotel for business or pleasure.,50
"I was arrived earlier that day with my grand parents and kid. The hotel let me checkin around noon and we could have a rest before out for lunch. Excellence hotel experience.  Also, the hotel allowed me to extend my stay for late checkout too.",50
"A friend and I recently decided to splurge on a stay at the Conrad, and we were so glad we did!  Everything is immaculately beautiful and clean, and there are tons of in-room amenities.  We left for a few hours in the afternoon, and found that housekeeping had already replenished everything we had used.  Also, the bath is huge... Probably my favorite part of the room.  Customer service is intuitive, going above and beyond the call of duty.  Upon check-in, the receptionist told us that check-out was at 11, and automatically asked if we wanted complimentary late check-out.  When we checked out, a different receptionist asked if we would like them to store our luggage for any length of time that day while we wandered around.  I wouldn't think of staying elsewhere in Macau! …",50
"We had a great stay at this hotel. It is very easy to get to from the main Macau ferry terminal (via complementary shuttlebus). From the minute we stepped into the hotel we felt very welcome. The staff on reception were excellent. It is a big hotel complex of three adjoining hotels but very easy to navigate.   The rooms were excellent and of the usual high Conrad standard.   The concierge was also stand out. On the day of our departure he arranged the ferry tickets for us, made sure we had plenty of time to get there and write down the name of the next hotel in Chinese so we could easily get to our Hong kong hotel. It felt like he was a friend waving us off on our trip rather than someone doing their job. They have also produced handy guides in Chinese of the top locations to…",50
"Macau is amazing, so many great hotels, we stayed in the Conrad and everything about it was great, service was exceptional and so to were the rooms! I had a standard room but some of my colleagues had the hire floors which even better still. On the lower floors it's just one huge shopping mall on two floors, all I can say is I'm glad my wife was not with me.  Loved the one night we had there my only negative is we should of had 3 nights here I stead of Hong Kong! Great team, great island, great people. ",50
"This is the finest hotel I have ever stayed in.  The service is impeccable.  The facilities top notch.  Just everything from A to Z is 5 star.  I have now been here twice and it will not be my last time.  I have stayed in fine hotels throughout the world and this is my favorite.  The staff's recollection of my name everyday was amazing.  The pool area is wonderful with a very affordable drink and food selection.  So nice to see reasonable prices so you don't feel like you were hijacked ordering a cocktail and a snack.  The new executive lounge is terrific, and the staff at the lounge were some of the most professional, attentive, knowledgeable, and friendly staff I have ever had in any hotel anywhere.  Even at the end of a long trip I never wanted to leave the property.  Can't…",50
"Amazing bedrooms (one of the best standard rooms I've stayed in) for the price, excellent attentive service and all round 5 star treatment. If you're staying in Macau, stay here. Lots of extra touches that make this memorable, comfortable and flawless.",50
Had a nice accomodation for the value of money. Staff polite and cooperative. Service was excellent. Free shuttle service to move around was wonderful. Overall we had a nice time and would suggest anybody to stay in Conrad Macau.,50
I stayed many times in Conrad and I finally have the chance to write a review. My sister and friends stayed as well and the experience was superb. Hotel was beautiful and the staff are always ready to assist.,50
"I'm celebrating my wife's birthday in Conrad. Sherrihan was noticed of this and she really build great memory to us. The stay was enjoyable and my wife was very happy. Conrad was beautiful. In fact, hardware is very important, but people is the most important essential to make things happen. Sherrihan is the one. Please pass my compliment and congratulations to General Manager.",50
"My company had a conference in Macau.  I was assigned to a room full of the smell of cigarettes. I went into the room of my colleague which was supposed to be the non smoking room but still had the smell of cigarettes.  This was totally unacceptable. Since we only stayed there for one night, therefore we did not request to change the room.  Since this is supposed to be a pretty new hotel, it already had flushing problem in the toilet.   Since this is supposed to be a 5 stars hotel, some of the staff can't speak English at all.  The room is very spacious and the service is pretty good.  If you don't like cigarettes, I would suggest you pick other hotels.",30
"Great hotel, in a great location, close to all the other large casinos. However travel to old macau is rather difficult if using free shuttles. Shuttle to galaxy from sheraton (same block) followed by shuttle from galaxy to San Ma Lo (senado) square. Easier to take taxi (<$100MOP). All in all great stay, would have preferred longer.",50
"Short summary for you:  + great rooms, some have great venetian view + central contained location, just opposite venetian  + decent VIP baccarat in the sands-casino on ground floor + attractive rates + great extras if you are Hilton Diamond   - cotai location not ideal for Macau main island tourist attractions. 20min drive away - as most Macau hotels, the building is so huge that it feels less personal than the Wynn Encore, for example",50
"This was a pretty good hotel,that was close to the House of Dancing Water.The service and general friendliness of the staff was very welcoming and helpful to guide us to specific tourist destinations that they recommended.The TV was enjoyable,and we could watch movies the whole time and for FREE!(Well,the cost of the movies was probably included in the hotel fee and unlike other hotels where you have to PAY to watch a movie!)",40
"Rarely if ever in life do you get the opportunity to do something twice. That is apart from making a New Year’s resolution. At the stroke of midnight on the 31st of December each year, you get your first opportunity- and if you falter shortly thereafter- (as we all do), you can have another go, thanks to the lunar calendar sometime around mid-February. After just spending 7 nights at the Conrad Macao, Cotai Central- we humbly suggest that your second New Year’s resolution should be that before you choose any overseas destination your first question should be;  “Is There A Conrad There?”   If the answer is yes, then book straight away, without reservation or hesitation.  My wife and I were met off the ferry from Hong Kong by Vicky who greeted us with a big warm smile, a nice…",50
My second visit to this exraordinary hotel.this time the executive lounge was in fuction and I had the best service ever experienced at a Hilton Hotel. Raymond and his crew will read any wish from your eyes or mouth and made my stay unforgettable.,50
"We arrived on 12/21 after a short ferry from Hong Kong. First glance, I thought it was strange that it is between the Holiday Inn & Sheraton Cotai. Check in process was a breeze and front desk escorted us to the elevator.  The hotel is directly across from Venetian & Four seasons.   We received an upgrade to a suite and it was very both luxurious and spacious.  I have stayed with a couple other Conrads (Tokyo & Hong Kong) and this is by far more superior in decoration and amenities.   The bathrobes are microfiber with plush inside that it kept each of us very warm (not that Macao was that cold in December) It was so comfy that we ended up purchasing them at the gift shop downstairs and brought it back to Hong Kong and eventually to home - America.   The breakfast buffet at Grand…",50
"The arrival into the ferry terminal was not very auspicious, but once I arrived at the hotel the entire experience was flawless to the end.  From fabulous suite complete with walk-in closet, jet tub, and countless other bedroom amenities to the separate and enclosed media room and the lovely dining plus comfortable living room, wow!  The most important asset this hotel has is the staff, though.  Totally delightful, knowledgeable and always more than happy to assist.  I particularly enjoyed the diversity among them and although none spoke Spanish, fortunately, I speak English.  Lastly, I'm not a gambler, but even the casino was a pleasant and fun experience.  Two thumbs up!",50
"Love this hotel! Conrad is extremely comfortable and is perfect for travellers who just want to relax and unwind.  Apart from the luxurious rooms, what really makes this hotel unforgettable is the fantastic service by its well-trained and professional staff. The experience is highly consistent year after year. The front desk staff are always very friendly and efficient; check in and check out are always a breeze. We had some setbacks during our last trip (mostly our fault for not planning it well enough) but the staff at the front desk and concierge helped us a great deal in solving most of these setbacks - from finding a great alternative restaurant because the one we wanted was fully booked, finding a faster way to the restaurant because we didn't anticipate the cab line would…",50
"The hotel and lounge were truly excellent. Concierge and front desk employees were top notch. We particularly loved the lounge and their staff. All of the lounge staff were attentive, kind, and gracious. We found ourselves looking forward to going back to see them. Dan and James in particular provided truly wonderful service.",50
"WauW! What a wonderful hotel. Great spacious rooms, quality decor and amenities. But most important: Fabulous staff!! We enjoyed access to the Conrad Lounge, and the staff here was top notch! Friendly and super professional. We felt at home from the first visit.",50
Rooms are large and extremely comfortable and staff are professional and helpful.  The executive lounge is now open and is superb - Francois and Gallant went out of their way to ensure we were comfortable and Anne and Dan never stopped checking that we had all we needed. I am a Hilton Honors member but it was clear that every guest in the lounge was as well looked after.  The Conrad is a welcome retreat from the other huge hotels in Cotai and it felt like coming back to civilization after fighting through the tour groups round the Venetian.  Only small criticism is the lack of hotel information - for example dining is mentioned on the TV service directory but there is no specific info on individual restaurants or menus etc - the Conrad staff were happy to provide this info but…,50
"The Conrad is what you expect from a five star hotel.  The service is excellent.  My group had a nice email exchange with various members of the Customer Relations team, specifically Edmund Tan, and the recommendations beforehand made the trip (during Halloween 2014) very special (Thank you Edmund!).  Rooms were pristine.  A major negative during my stay was the lack of an Executive Lounge.  This has now been added, which would make a stay an absolute five star.  The front desk customer relations came through each time asked; every restaurant recommendation was excellent (Antonio's was an especially memorable meal).  The gym is adequate.  The locker room, with sauna, steam room and hot tub were all very relaxing.  The pool, which is only open to Conrad guests, is a set of…",50
"Our lovely experience with Conrad Macau started a week before our actual stay, when the chief concierge, Edmund Tan, emailed me to confirm my stay and asked about the purpose of my visit and if I had any request. I told him that my wife and I were spending our wedding anniversary there and our only request was to have a non smoking room. Then it was full of surprises from there onward! Cake and strawberries to the room, personalized card from Edmund himself, but the biggest surprise for both my wife and I were when we were brought to the room by Vicky from the check in counter - we were upgraded to a suite!! I spent about 90 days a year in hotels and the hospitality provided by Edmund and team is at a league of its own! Amazing! ",50
"I hv been in Macau for more than 100 times, trust me, Conrad is no.1 for me. You can try. Nearly all parts are perfect. They will fulfill all your needs in short time. The environment is good. The service is good. The price is reasonable. The people working ther is very nice. If you hv never been ther, just try one time and u will not go to others.",50
"Another stop in our two week vacation.  Took the ferry from Hong Kong and jumped on the shuttle bus provided.  The whole place had a different feeling than Hong Kong and felt more like Las Vegas or Reno  I picked the Conrad because I previously had a good stay at the Conrad, Singapore - that and being rated number one in Macau didn't hurt either.   It's a beautiful hotel and I knew the service was going to be top notch.  We checked in and and were escorted to our room, which was on a very high level with an amazing view of our area.  The room was a much better value than what we got in Hong Kong in terms of size and amenities; I'm guessing they want you to save your money for the Casinos.  They have a nice high tea place in the lobby. The gym is immaculately clean and spacious,…",40
"This is my 10th time visiting Conrad Macao Cotai hotel, within 2.5 years and all the hotel staff so far i met with are highly professional, cheerful & helpful.   My loyalty towards this elite & highly prestige hotel in Macau, could hint you well about the consistently high quality of service and facilities this hotel could offer to its guests.  I particularly like to appraise their warm arrangements on providing me a very tranquil & comfortable enviroment for my relaxing stay and their superb services & facilities, plus lots of nice surprises delivered to me at all time.  For this stay, i would like to express my gratitude towards Jessie Kim, the new Customer Relationship Manager (who managed to take well care of me, equally impressive like what Poy did before, but now being…",50
"Visited several months ago, and the place was exceptional already. Just visited in mid-December, and Conrad got even better! Service was still impeccible everywhere; the rooms are tastefully decorated and spacious. But now, they've launched the Executive Lounge for Hilton Honors members on the 39th floor--the facilities and service there are top-notch. It's a great place to relax for tea, some snacks in a quiet comfortable zone away from the crowds. Elvis Wen at reception orchestrated a truly memorable stay for our family. We couldn't have asked for better service.",50
"I stayed at Conrad Macau from 20 Dec. to 22 Dec. Though arrived at the hotel early (shortly after noon), I got the room very quickly. When the receptionist(Ms.Sabrina) asked me for choosing the next day's newspaper service, she said that the hotel will serve me two Chinese newspapers because I said that I like both.Wow! What a warm service! In Conrad, the room is large, bed is comfortable, view is nice,bathroom is clean,everything is fine. If I go to Macau next time, I will choose Conrad again.",50
"Conrad Macao is nicely situated on the Macao 'Strip' that is, by the way, still heavily under construction. A taxi can get you anywhere, of course, but shuttle buses are a very good alternative here; Conrad shuttle buses take you from both (!) ferry terminals to the hotel and back (very short waiting times) and casino shuttle buses take you from the ferry terminals to the Macau city center (no questions asked). The Conrad Macao itself is a wonderful hotel; both public areas and rooms are stylish and convenient. Exceptionally professional staff members guarantee you the highest level of service ever seen.  Breakfast at the 'Grand Orbit' buffet restaurant is beyond imagination. High quality food and a dazzling variety of choice. A special mention goes to the hotel's executive…",50
"This may be my all time best hotel experience.  From the time we checked in to the time we left the service was exceptional, Francois is the best.  As Hilton Diamond members we have come to appreciate the club benefits and were disappointed to learn the club was closed.  After experiencing the rest of the hotel I can only imagine what the club is like and we will definitely be back to try it out.  The room was spotless and everything had been meticulously maintained.  The concierge was one of the best ever; great tips and wrote out our destinations to give to the taxi drivers.  The afternoon tea was an experience not to be missed.  They served two different multilevel trays of deserts, scones and snacks and the teapot was never empty.  We went back on a different day and only…",50
"We had an exceptional experience at the hotel.  The service was absolutely supurb!  The room was very spacious and beautiful.  we have stayed in many great hotels, but this is the best hotel experiences we have ever had!",50
"We stay here during our Jun holiday, and I must say that we love this hotel and keep thinking to go Macau again. The hotel is charging half of the price other similar hotel charges but without any discount on the service. I booked this hotel with  kids, upon arrival, we saw a lovely bear which instantly win their heart, also little biscuit as welcome snack. The room is clean and nice, the bed is comfortable. Thumbs up!   ",50
"I and my wife stayed in Conrad, Macau, for 2 nights about two weeks ago to celebrate our 16th wedding anniversary. We really appreciated everything the head of the concierge had done for us, which included two congratulation cards hand-written by himself. Staffs at the pool are also well-trained and attentive. The outdoor swimming pool was actually heated (30 degrees), so we can still use it at this time of the year. The suite we stayed at was spacious, clean, and very comfortable.  We are already planning our next stay there!",50
"We definitely won BIG with service at the Conrad Macao.  I am a Hilton Diamond member, and the property certainly rolled out the red carpet for my husband and I.  The correspondence began two weeks prior to our arrival, with an email from the Guest Relations Manager, Ms. Jessie Kim.  She was polite in sharing the benefits offered to a Diamond member, as well as, making some suggestions for our stay.    Upon our arrival, we were immediately greeted with smiles and bottles of evian water which was very nice after our journey.  We were given a personal tour of the hotel and escort to our room.  We received a complimentary upgrade to a King Premier Suite, after only reserving a King Deluxe Room.  This was a 2-level up upgrade, and extremely luxurious!  We had a beautiful bedroom…",50
I stayed there for my mom birthday. They prepared a chocolate birthday cake for us which is very dellicious. Staff are friendly and well trained. The food quality is high. Will definitely come back to Conrad Macao again!,50
"The Conrad Macao Cotai Central is an excellent facility and the staff is one of the best.  The room size was outstanding for the price.  My only complaint is that the prices for room service are higher than other hotels in which I have stayed.  Also, there are no low price dining options within the hotel although there are some within walking distance.  In addition, if you like to play poker, Chinese casinos are not for you.  If you like to play baccarat, which most Chinese do like to play, then these casinos are for you.",50
"Definitely a 5-star. I stayed 1 night to experience the Cotai area. As a Hilton member, I even receive an email 2-weeks before trip from the Chief Concierge asking whether I need any help on reservation of restaurants and shows. I am only staying in standard room but I already feel that it is extremely comfortable :) Tasteful room painting, quiet room, you barely can hear any noise outside your room. Staff was efficient and helpful. Went to take a look at the pool in my full winter clothing but the staff is still more then willing to explain me to on the facility of the pools and showing me around.  Not to forget, I got a little box of sweet waiting for me in my room.",50
"excellent service, excellent amenities, excellent luxury, it's my 3rd time staying here and i get max. satisfaction from each stay! not as noisy and crowded as other hotels, more classy and you don't encounter with 'service providers' lottering in the lobby which irritates you!",50
This is totally a 5-star hotel. The service is good with all the decor that are so nice and classy. The room we had is the Junior Suite with a double bed that come with a small living hall area and a detach bathroom that is big enough that have a jacuzzi and shower area. The design and decor are so nice and beautiful. They even give us an Evian water bottle as complimentary while most hotel will charge you on it. One of the down point is the room didn't provide a hair dryer which I think is an essential item for a hotel right now.  You will shop till you drop if you are a shopaholic as they have one of the best branded shop at their shoppes. They are even connected with Venetian Hotel that have a big shoppes too that some branded shop are repeated but is big enough for you to…,50
"My son and I stayed here 1 week in July 2014. I'm 55 y.o. and I have been visiting well over 300 hotels in my life. This hotel beats even the famous Waldorf Astoria in New York. The service was absolutely beyond my wildest imagination. Should I ever visit Macau again the choice will be easy. This is not a 5 but a 6-7 star hotel for the price of a 3-4 star hotel !!!  Plus it is next door to Macau's nr 1 attraction '''The House of Dancing Water"" and you can of course buy the tickets from their concierge.",50
"One of the best hotel I had stayed. Comfortable, and great customer service! Efficient and patient service from Edmund Tan. I would recommend this hotel for a luxurious stay! Very comfortable, good location in the Cotai Central region and shuttle bus service.",50
"Wide variety of assortment , both Asian and Western.  Great service especially from the Concierge named Edmund Tan.  Spotless and will definitely stay there next  time I go back. Fast internet connection, quiet room with a nice view",50
"This is the place to be if you and your family just want to do some sightseeings and shopping in Macau. Like most hotels in Macau, it provides free shuttle to/from ferry terminals and downtown. As a HH Gold member, I got to enjoy free room upgrade, wifi, buffet breakfast for two, and concierge service. The regular price for the breakfast alone is $20 plus tax per person. All in all, the service is exceptional and the guest room well-appointed, making the stay a very enjoyable one. No doubt will go back again.",50
"We just returned from 4 nights at the Conrad Macau, and it was such a great experience. Being a Hilton Honors Gold Member, we go upgraded to a King Executive Suite, and the room was incredible, large living room, dining area, 1,5 bath, large walk-in shower, and a TV for the bath-tub, for that long, soothing soak at the end of the day.  However, as spectacular as the property is, the staff makes it even better. From helping us get there, to making sure everything was perfect along the way, to the concierge desk making us perfectly prepared for the ferry/immigration procedure on our departure day.   Thanks for a great stay!!",50
"Do expect a lot from this hotel and you will end up getting more than your expectation. I have stayed in many top hotels in the world, and Conrad Macau is one of the best. If you have high standards, then Conrad Macau would be your top choice.",50
"I visited the Conrad Macao again and it is getting better and better: the elegant and ultra-comfortable rooms and suites, the excellent food and wines at the restaurants and at the Executive Lounge and above all: the superb, unique and ""beyond excellent"" Staff. The Staff is an example for all the hotels in the world: they go beyond the call of duty to make sure that you are comfortable, you have all you need to make your meals perfect and you constantly feel that your needs are going to be taken care of. I felt comfortable, relaxed and happy to be in this unique hotel and to add to it, its location, the quality of its restaurants, the dedicated service .... all will make your stay a supreme experience. I heartily recommend time and again the fantastic, elegant, refined Conrad…",50
"Very impressed with the service of this hotel.  The service began before we even arrived.  They paid attention to the ""comments"" or ""special notes"" we put in our reservation and went above and beyond to not just meet our needs but did more than what we asked for.  The member of staff who corresponded with us came to meet us when we arrived to check in and brought us to our room to make sure everything is set.  They also gave us a complimentary limo ride.  The concierge was also very responsible and arranged all the rides and bookings we requested.  We had a suite and it was huge.  Very clean.  If there were one thing to complain about, it is the view from room.  We faced a huge building under construction.  It was fun watching the many workers running and climbing around but not…",50
"Conrad Macau provided one of the best Hilton experience I encountered. From the moment I made the reservation until the day we checked out, the staff could not have provided a better service. Knowing we were celebrating my mom’s birthday, I was contacted by Jessie from Guest Relation weeks prior to my stay and she went out of her way to ensure my mom had an unforgettable birthday experience. On the day we checked into the hotel, Eva upgraded our room to a suite with a view of the strip. My mom was truly amazed by the décor and size of the suite. She has never stayed at a luxury hotel before so this was a special treat for her. The staff at the concierge desk was also very helpful and provided detailed instructions on the places we wanted to explore (Pork Buns, Portuguese Food,…",50
"My family and I stayed in Conrad from 30th Nov to 2 Dec.  We had a Junior Suite.  It was excellent service from the time we reached the hotel.  A young man, George who served us when we checked in was very attentive and showed us all the way to our rooms and explained the amenities to us patiently.  Later in the day, we approached the concierge for assistance to book a day tour in Macau but we were too late for the scheduled tour.  A young man, Stephen (I hope I got his name right) was extremely attentive and took pains to show us how to get to the main attractions and what to look out for.  He even suggested other sites in Macau that we could consider and provided all the maps and directions for us.  For both gentlemen, it was not what they did or say but how they say it. …",50
"Our family stayed in the hotel from 30 Nov to 1 Dec. It was the first time we bring along our 6-month old baby for travel and thus we contacted the hotel to arrange baby amenities for her.  Soon after I emailed the hotel, the Chief Concierge Mr Edmund Tan replied and prepared all the essential items from baby crib, bottle steriliser, bottle warmer to baby bath tub for my baby.  When we arrived the hotel, we received a warm welcome from Edmund in person and a fabulous news of being upgraded to a lovely corner suite. All requested items for baby are duly set up once we stepped into the suite, the hotel also provided a baby stroller for our use during our stay.  The suite itself is very comfortable, spacious with first class facilities. Top-quality service is provided by all the…",50
"excellent location to experience the new and old Macao  Downtown is too busy.  Conrad is close to entertainment, casinos and the quiet old village of Ti Pan.  Getting there by plane and boat is a breeze. Definitely my top pick on Macao or even a side trip from Hong Kong",50
"It is ranked No. 1 in Macao. So I had high expectations before I checked in here. This hotel just didn't let me down. I can only say, it is simply fabulous.   The service is impeccable. I have stayed at many hotels. This one is definitely one of the best hotels that I have ever stayed at.  You won't regret to stay at this No.1 hotel in Macao.",50
"This is genuine 5 star .. First class, great pillows , good sized room, teddy bear in bed , rubber duck in the bath..it's in a Vegas style Casino complex, opposite the Venetian , classy cafes, gambling , great service , 15 mins to Chinese border by taxi ..a great experience after a long working week in China .",50
"My family and I recently stayed at your property from October 13th to 15th 2014 and would like to commend the entire staff for providing my family such an outstanding service.  Our stay and experience at the Conrad Macao was top-notch and I would like to express my sincere thank you.  It all started with an email greeting from Qurio Chao confirming my reservation, room needs, and requests I have made ahead of time.  Mr. Edmund Tan followed up with detailed instructions on where to board the bus upon arrival at the ferry terminal, and information regarding family oriented activities and events during our stay in Macao.  When we arrived, we were greeted with friendly faces that were all very helpful and polite. Bobby checked us in and was very thorough. We had two rooms booked and…",50
"We stayed at the Conrad Macao recently and found it to be a top notch Conrad property in terms of the quality of the rooms and furnishings. We arrived at the property after a delayed flight and were looking to check in promptly. As a Diamond member with both the Hyatt and Hilton hotel chains, I usually get ushered to the lounge for an expedited check in. However, I realised that there was no executive lounge at the property upon check in, which is quite surprising to me. There was a HHonors check in counter with 3 front desk agents and presumably a manager nearby but we didnt notice this particular counter on the left and checked in at one of the other counters. Check in was pretty slow and took more than 10 minutes. The lady, while pleasant, was only on the job for 2 weeks and…",40
"I usually like the Four Seasons but while it was fully booked, I tried the Conrad and oh surprise! I loved it! I thought it was even better than the Four Seasons. The rooms are more modern, the service is incredible, even the amenities in the room are high quality. Vegan products for cosmetics, that's very rare in hotels rooms! And I kept the sleepers, there are my favorite as well:-) The property is very nice and convenient, it's all attached with Hollyday Inn and the Venetian.The free shuttle from the Ferry Terminal has free WIFI which is also rare and very useful.I enjoyed everything, from the moment I arrived til I left.",50
"My husband and I stayed at the Conrad Macao for 2 nights and had the most wonderful time! Right from the get go- when we boarded the bus from the ferry terminal to the hotel- it was a seamless and excellent experience. The bellboys at the main entrance were so efficient and polite and the check in process was super pleasant! The receptionist was all smiles and super friendly and helpful. We loved her! We were there during my birthday so they had the most delicious chocolate cake ready for us in the room. The room, a suite, was just so unbelievanly pretty and luxurious, you'll never want to leave! Everytime we'd run into a member of the staff- in the corridors, the elevators or the lobby- we were greeted with smiles and warmth and escorted to wherever it is we were heading…",50
"I have lived in HK for a year but had not been to Macau so wife and I used Hilton Honors points for a room.  Was pleasantly surprised to get a nice upgrade upon check-in.  Very nice room.  Tastefully understated.   The people there were amazing at remembering our names and being very helpful.  The property was nice, but the staff was amazing.  Thanks!",50
"I really enjoyed my stay in Conrad. Good location in Cotai, infront of Venetian and beside City of Dreams. Breakfast at Conrad Grand Orbit is excellent, way better than Venetian. I stayed in suite room, it has nice design, good size, comfy bed and clean. But the best in this hotel is the service, real 5 star. Unlike other hotels that you wait long line to check-in, here it's a breeze. Every staff is really accomodating and helpful, from reception staff, room cleaner, all the way to breakfast restaurant staff...lastly, I also ate at Rice Empire, here service is slow, we waited a long time for few orders of food but the restaurant is only half filled. Overall experience is ver good and will surely comeback again.",50
"My fiance and I stayed at Conrad Macao in October and can't speak highly enough of the hotel.  I have travelled around a fair bit and this is one of the best places we've stayed.    Main points I loved: - Bodhi Spa - definitely recommend this, especially after a long flight. A very personalised service and wonderful attention to detail. My masseuse was always checking in with me to make sure i was comfortable and pressure was okay.   Was so relaxed afterward and I'm still thinking about this massage today!  - Pools - the holiday inn side had about 4 large pools and a couple of spa's and the same for Conrad except maybe slightly smaller pools.  Heated and unheated pools.  We used it twice and had the pool and spa to ourselves both times.  - Shopping & restaurants- this hotel is…",50
"there for business meetings.  Meeting services and arrangements were quite good.  Service was really responsive and attentive.  Within the complex great access to shops and restaurants.  Room was massive and great quality. Design is not my style, but well maintained and presented.  ",40
"This is a great hotel - rooms are generously large, and super clean.  Staff are unfailingly polite and constantly asking how they can assist.  Well appointed bathroom, but for some reason Internet speed was highly variable = frustrating at times (but on the upside, it was free for up to three devices)  Best of all, The Conrad Macao is not as garish as some of the themed casino hotels, so it feels classier and less ""Disneyland on Dice.""  Sadly the rooms are not ready until 3pm, which feels late, but as promised our bags arrived moments after we did get access to our room. At present there is a lot of construction going on next door (same property I guess) and that makes the site a bit of an eyesore - but I imagine that will quickly change.  Extensive mall-style shopping in and…",40
"I arrived at midnight at 2 am. Because our flight was delayed 3 hours. But Conrad's Staff was perfect for our stay. Prem Singh Comboz escorted for our couple with warm smile.  And I received warm welcoming handwrite mail from Jaycee Soong. That was good memory. So We got Conrad macao at around 2 am., but no one was tired. And next day schedule set up with concerige Mr. Edmund Tan. So We can save time. and we could enjoy perfect dining. We recommand to other people, If you have question about macao, Just call to Edmund Tan. And check out service supported by  Ms Suyeon. This stay was short for us during 2days. But It was perfect stay with perfect conrad staffs.",50
"From the room to the breakfast buffet everything was perfect.  We spent three days here early November.  Early check-in was no problem, and neither was late checkout at 2pm.  Impeccable service all around.  The buffet breakfast was the best I've seen anywhere around the world.  The room was incredible as we were upgraded to a suite due to Gold status.  The gym , sauna/steam facilities, and the pool area were wonderful.  A huge shout out to the staff there; they were all professional, friendly, and hard-working.  Can't wait to return to stay here again!",50
"Conrad, nice room as expected. The room was pretty big and the service was wonderful. Only downside is the room wasn't ready till 3pm on a weekday and 11am check out is a Bit early but standard in macau given No hotel can really hire enough people so can't really complain. One thing I was disappointed is that the engineering noise woke me up in the morning at around 10, as only half the hotel is opened anyway. Well, once it is all done, it will be another great Conrad.",40
"you had better open club rounge, because restrant  is used customers from other hotels. Club lounge of other hotel  provide good quality wine and  fine foods, I am going out for business, but wife like to stay in house.",40
"My wife and I stayed at the Conrad for one night in Macau and our experience was superb.  We weren't huge fans of Macau as a destination but the Conrad was truly top notch.    The lobby is beautiful and from the second we got there, we were asked by at least three different hosts/bellmen to take our bags and to see if they could be helpful with anything.  The woman who checked us in was super professional and walked us up to our room.  One thing I will mention is that I am diamond status, so my experience might be different from others, but based on a lot of the reviews here, it sounds like my experience was pretty similar.  I was upgraded to an enormous suite that was probably over 1000 sq feet and I had perks through the day - complimentary high tea, cocktail hour, and…",50
"Wonderful people, wonderful ambience, stunning suite, loved it! So helpful and Warren was amazing. Much classier than the Venetian and no tourists just to see the building although it was very beautiful but no canals😊",50
"This is a superior property and I had a truly wonderful time here.  The hotel is central to everything on the Cotai Strip and the Grand Orbit breakfast buffet is outstanding, offering a huge variety of breakfast fare.  All of the staff are very friendly and courteous and the next time I visit Macau I will definitely stay at the Conrad Hilton.",50
"Staying at the Conrad Macao was wonderful, the service was absolutely outstanding. I felt like we were the only people there as they were going out of their way constantly to show us all of the amenities on offer throughout our stay. The rooms were great fully set out for everything you may need. There was even a pillow menu for you selection and comfort of your stay, I loved the full body comforter. The staff were always friendly and always had a personal touch.",50
"I have stayed at the Conrad Macao on four separate occasions, including the week of its grand opening.  I have found the service to be consistently excellent and wish I had more reason to visit. I like that the hotel is 5-star but not stuffy, so I don't have to monitor my kids every move in the public spaces.   The standard rooms are very big to start with, but I have also received two upgrades to large suites as well. Since there are lots of suites in the room inventory, chances of an upgrade are good (especially if you have Hilton HHonors Diamond or Gold status).  Note that the hotel was originally going to be managed by Shangri La but was switched over to Conrad after the Global Financial Crisis.   The concierge often emails guests in advance about special requests, and it is…",50
"Our first stay at a Conrad property, the first of many more. We stayed for three nights on a escape to Macao to celebrate our wedding anniversary. The chief concierge contacted us before our arrival and made our way to the hotel simple and easy from Guangzhou. Check in was a breeze, all the staff attentive, respectful and polite. The room was much larger than expected, great smell and the furniture first class. Everyday we got a surprise from The concierge desk who helped us to get the most of the city. They made us feel very special. The property is elegant, classy and not that big as other properties around so you don't feel a tiny dot in the space. What else can I say? A stay to tell our grandkids about! :-) 6 out of 5...",50
"From A-Z an amazing stay. The only negative was having to leave. We stayed only one night but got spoilt and pampered like seldom before. Rooms are huge, common areas amazing staff incredible . I got an belated birthday surprise from the management. Macao itself is worth a visit and the Conrad an experience for itself. Well done and thank you ! For sure I will return !",50
"This was my first stay at the Conrad Macao and it will definitely won't be my last!  Firstly the hotel shuttle at the high speed boat terminal was very quick and the check-in process was very friendly and warm.  As a diamond member they run thru the list of usual benefits you get at the hotel but to my surprise they give me an upgrade to a junior suite.  This was definitely a nice surprise as it is above the normal upgrades I have been getting from other Hilton's or Conrad's I have stayed in.    The room was of course huge with all the furnishings being top quality and clean.  The view of Macao in the upper levels was also amazing especially at night.  The location of the hotel was also conveniently located as we planned to see ""The House of Dancing Water"" show which was only…",50
"We were warmly greeted by the front desk staff. She was kind enough to ask us about the purpose of our stay. When she was told that we came to celebrate our anniversary, she immediately told us that the hotel will arrange something special for us and a cake with candle was delivered to us the same evening. We were very impressed with their attention to details. Thanks.",50
"Had 3 wonderful days and nights at the Conrad Macao. The 5 star experience started with a complimentary shuttle from the ferry terminal. We were greeted at the hotel with smiles and the beautiful signature fragrance which I found out was Ginger Flower.  The main lobby was filled with stunning pink flower arrangements in support of Breast Cancer. Had a wonderful welcome to the room - there was a fruit plate to nibble on, slippers were laid out by the bed, a teddy bear was on my pillow and a rubber ducky awaiting in the bath. Loved the bathrobes - they have fur lining. The room and bathroom were spacious and they have a selection of 3 different amenities on the menu that you can try. Feeling a bit stiff from the 9 hour flight I had a signature massage at their Bodhi spa - OMG!…",50
"It is not often one has a service provider exceed expectations and simply delight, Conrad Macau did this in spades from the booking right through to arrival and our stay. I cant fault them at all, all the staff are very geared towards ensuring guests feel at home and they are so focused on ensuring our son felt welcome that i have been converted to a ""Conrad"" fan! As a HHonors gold member we get some great perks and they upgraded us to a beautiful suite, even when we booked the stay with points. the attention to detail from making the booking and pre arrival arrangements were excellent. Check in was friendly, quick and painless and the room was superb. Big, bright and modern and a bed had been set up for our son, this was based on our requests before arrival and it is generally…",50
I like the fact that you can use the Conrad concierge app on your phone to customize your room and needs.  The app didn't work for this hotel for some reason but it did in Hong Kong.  No worries though because even before we landed my wife received an e-mail from Prem Comboz the front office duty manager to ensure that we have everything we needed and to double check our check in times.    We must have been greeted 4 times before making it into the check in area where Mr. Comboz was waiting for us.  Mr. Comboz checked us in and walked us up to our suite.  The suite was very large and accommodating.  I usually check to see how much noise their central air makes and this one was fairly quiet.  Nothing to prevent you from getting a nice night's rest.    The Conrad Hotel is…,50
"great location and value, highly recommended choice for visiting Macau.   The rooms is extremely clean, internet is fast, staff service is excellent.   However the only pity is that gold members do not have any benefit of lounge access.",50
"Beautiful hotel, located on the new strip (which is basically a Sheldon Adelson gambling empire). From the moment we set foot in the hotel, the concierge was walking with us through all the stations and up into our suite. He gave us a few explanations on Macau and was super helpful.  Yes. We got a suite. Conrad has this cool upsale promo where you sign up for cheap upgrades and if the room is available - you get it. We had to add 690 HKD to be upgraded from a regular room to a very impressive suite.  The room itself was very clean and beautiful. They even filled up our Nespresso capsules once we drank them all in once.. :)  I regret we had to spend just one night there, as the hospitality was amazing.Thank you Conrad for the honeymoon cake!  The only downside I could find to the…",50
We went as a couple to the conrad. Rooms offer excellent quality and the team was always here to take care of everything. Perfect place in Macau. Little back side is the under construction hotel near the place.,50
Best hotel to spend a long weekend getaway in Macau!!!  My other half and I have spent our anniversary at Conrad Macau and it was a great experience as we had expected.  We have been going to this hotel and the hotel restaurants on special occasions in several Asian cities that we have lived in and the experience have always been more than satisfactory!!!,50
"I stayed here  for 2 nights with my family in August. The room was nice and comfortable, and easily large enough for the 3 of us. We liked the swimming pools area, where several pools are available, so we  could usually have one to ourselves. The only disappointment was the ground floor, which is basically a large, tacky shopping mall. The hotel cafe / restaurant here served good, but over-priced food.",50
"Stay at this hotel. It's fabulous.  There's no need to qualify it: I've been on a continuous round-the-world trip for the past 12 months and this is the best hotel I've ever stayed at.  My Hilton HHonors diamond status undoubtedly helped - by facilitating a room upgrade, free wifi, free breakfast and especially obsequious service - but, even taking those benefits into account, this is a wonderful hotel.  It started about a week before my arrival, when I had a personalised email from Jessie, the guest relations manager, confirming my booking preferences and asking if there was anything they could do to assist prior to my arrival. I asked about the ferry from Hong Kong and Jessie responded with detailed info about how to get to the hotel. It really made life a lot easier. (A free…",50
"We arrived in Taipa via the ferry terminal, and a shuttle bus from the Conrad was already waiting for us. The driver asked for our last name and checked it off on a piece of paper. By the time we arrived at the hotel, the bell staff immediately greeted us by name (the driver must have called in to let the hotel know we were on our way) and helped carry our luggage inside. There were a lot of people waiting to check in, and the bell staff directed us to a space near the centre of the lobby to wait our turn. He was courteous, friendly, and made us feel very much at ease. It was a quick wait and I felt that despite how busy the hotel was, the operation was smooth and very efficient. Throughout our entire stay, all of the staff were extremely friendly and helpful with cheerful…",50
"We've tried several big name hotels in Macao, but Conrad is easily the best.  Location, facilities, view, noise control, service - all superb. In our future visits to Macao, I strongly doubt we'll bother to try other hotels.",50
"We spent four nights recently and had a fantastic time at the hotel. We took the ferry from Hongkong airport to Macau ferry terminal and the free shuttle to the hotel. There was free wifi in the bus and we also received various sms's about 1000 - 2500 credit vouchers to sign up at the casinos. We were escorted to the reception and warmly greeted by Eva & Vicky. The first wonderful thing we heard was 'you have been upgraded to the suite'. Perfect! We were also given the reservation confirmations to the restaurants we previously reserved. More on this later.  The suite was very spacious with a huge living room, closet area and a super sized bedroom with two queen beds. Two large LED TVs occupied the living and bed rooms. Our second pleasant surprise arrived later in the evening in…",50
This hotel was great!   The location was central on the hotel strip which is all inter-connected!  There were delicious restaurants connected to the lobby!  There were many   The hotel was beautiful!  And the staff was so sweet and helpful!  I would def. recommend this hotel to everyone!,50
"The Conrad Macao is impeccable from arrival to departure. This was my first experience at any hotel with this type of precision. I was welcomed both warmly and professionally, given a tour of my upgraded room and greeted by name by employees from every department throughout my stay.  The suites are fit for the most discerning of guest and way beyond my expectations. The accommodations are world-class and the service is out of this world. Look no further if you want five star amenities combined with genuine guest service so wholehearted and skilled it’s immeasurable. In the future when I speak of topnotch guest service experiences; the Conrad Cotai Strip Macao will be the first in my mind. Thank you for making my holiday an outstanding one.",50
"We've booked a room for five days at Conrad Hilton in Macau in July 2014 using HHonours points. Soon after making my online reservation I was contacted via email by a Conrad representative (a real person, not an email robot) asking if they could help in any way to further enjoy our future stay. A few days ahead of my arrival, I was contacted again and asked if I needed information on how to get to the hotel from the airport, and was given details on how to board the free shuttle bus, that serves most hotels on the Cotai strip, and lands just in front of the Conrad & Holiday Inn in a five minute drive.  At our arrival we were welcomed ahead of the front desk, promptly, by extremely friendly staff, and immediately upgraded to a superior room, that included free internet even if we…",50
Very beautiful and luxurious hotel in Macao. I got my suite upgrade at 36 floor with my Elite HHonors membership. Breakfast was great with quality stuff. My suite was big spacious and luxury feel. They provide shuttle service to both ferry terminal and you can use shuttle service too to visit the town,50
I stayed during 27JAN  ~ 30JAN with my a son-in-law kim. That was my first time visit Hongkong & Macao.  Just I had a mind as gamble city macao before that visit. But my mind changed. Conrad hotel was so family friendly atmosphere.  Dreamworks parade was very interested and central garden was beautiful. And Macao city have a lot of good landmark and UNESCO World Heritage Site. Ah..The room condition was great and excellent Thanks for joshua. The room was big more than my house. hahaha. If I got a chance for travel to Macao. I'll come back again Conrad macao. Thanks,50
"this hotel really oozes quality of rooms and service, and a definite must stay destination, for anyone going to the Cotai Strip Area. Particularly take note diamond members of Hilton, the extras laid on are really amazing. there is no exec lounge persay, but you use the lobby lounge as complimentary and it works, i had an isolated incident with one staff member who didnt know what they were doing, but generally they are all great.",50
"I am still staying here now at Conrad but I can't wait to write how great it is here.  We are staying here for 4 days to celebrate our 3rd Anniversary and now is our 3rd night.  I would like to say thanks to the Guest Relations Duty Manager, Qurio Chao for giving us the personalised card and the cake.  At the front desk, Renee, who gives her very best service and also Robbie who helped us with our luggages.  We would love to come back to Conrad Cotai Central again the next time we visit Macao.",50
"Although I stayed at this Hotel during the typhoon period, I still enjoyed a lot by a very tailor made customer service given by the staff of the hotel and its facilities there.   Even not having any coming promotion provided, I will stay this hotel again sooner.",50
"I stayed in Conrad from19 to 20 of Sept, I can say it is the most remarkable hotel experience.  When we checked in, I request to stay in upper floor and we were upgraded to a double size room, which it just have everything we need.  The biggest surprise is when we came back after dinner, there is a cake and hand write card for my birthday, what a sweet treat!!   especially thanks the lady in fitness room, we were there when typhoon 8 was hoisting. She gave us excellent service!! Also guest relations duty manager - Qurio Chao for the hand write card. ",50
"我們覺得工作人員服務態度很好, 笑容很好, 特別是游泳池的男工作人員, 但房間冷氣晚上有3小時出現問題不能用. 此次是為了慶祝結婚紀念訂房, 酒店知道就送了蛋糕, 見到我太太懷孕了, 就送了一盒嬰兒用品, 太驚喜了. We feel that the staff provides good service attitude, smile well, especially the male pool staff, but the room has air-conditioning problem at night for three hours, can not be used.  This time is to celebrate the wedding anniversary, the hotel sent us a cake, and knowing my wife was pregnant, they send a box of baby products, these are too surprising.",40
"Tip: Don't miss the Gold Autumn Sale today is the last day!  We went last Sunday to Monday to celebrate mom's grand 75th birthday. It's my first stay here and I am only a basic Blue member. My little sis, a Gold member, strongly advised me to let hotel know of our occasion, and told me we will be surprised, in a good way :-)  And surprised we indeed were. Mom and dad got upgraded to a Queen Suite. Sis, being a Gold member, got upgrade to a corner King Suite, with cot and high hair and 2 LOVELY rabbits for my baby niece.  They even have kid slippers in addition to the His and Her versions.  All 3 rooms were nicely arranged on the same floor reasonably close to each other.  The suites were so spacious that we had to have some doors closed because we have difficulty chasing the kid…",50
I loved staying at the Conrad Macau. They got it right. The service was phenomenal.  The pool area was relaxing. The staff were well presented and friendly. The bedroom large and quiet. The bed comfortable. I don't think I could fault this hotel in any way. Jessie Kim the Guest Relations Manager stood out and made the whole stay amazing.,50
"I stayed for the first time and I have to say, it is one of the best hotels I've been to in Macau. The room was very spacious and the room design is classy with many quality touches. I love the subtle finishings that make the room aesthetic and not overly ornate. I just love love spacious bathrooms and double sinks. From the Conrad bear, the candies in the room to the Nescafe machine make the entire experience a bit more luxurious.   The location is excellent with indoor access to the Cotai strip, Four Seasons and Venetian. There are many restaurants and eateries in the area and it's amazingly convenient to get around. The only thing I would comment as a downside was that the lobby is not very obvious when I first arrived. However, I was immediately greeted by a helpful staff…",50
"I'm also one of big fan Conrad macau. I visited several times in macau. So I stayed many other hotels "" Venetian, Sheraton, Holiday inn, Grand waldo, Golden dragon and Airbnb"". Of course Conrad is not the biggest hotel in macau.  And you'll be meet a lot of newest hotels in 2015~2016. But I'll choice this hotel again in next year.  Because This hotel's staffs are very kindness and hang on guest's words. Their kindness from the bottom of their hearts will make guest happy! One of staff talked to me ""If you are feel happy in conrad macau. Then it can make happy to conrad macao""  So I remembered the most innovative company Zappos. Their vision is like this _________________________________ Customer Service Isn't Just A Department! We've been asked by a lot of people how we've grown…",50
The hotel staff went above and beyond in every respect for our stay. When we arrived they had hand-drawn cards welcoming our three children and had put together various displays of candy and other treats that delighted our travel-worn children. This hotel has customer service down to a science. We would be delighted to stay here next time we are in Hong Kong or Macao.,50
"Have been stayed at Conrad Macao many times since their opening in April 2012, definitely I'm one of their ""Super Fan"" with almost all the editions of their Conrad Bears & Ducks (only missed the Pink duck & X'mas bear last year).  You can find any nice staff with brilliant service anywhere like Galen & Curio at Front Office who followed up closely of my booking and I truly appreciated all of their pre-arrangement of my request; Edmund at Concierge who always send me email to arrange table reservation at any restaurant before my arrival; also met Jeff at Health Club who explained to me, the beginner, how to warm-up and use the gym equipment patiently.  Thanks a zillion for everything.",50
"Recently went to this hotel for a business trip. It's co-located with Holiday Inn Sands and Sheraton Sands. The room was clean and spacious, and the staff makes you feel important. I must say the staff from Conrad really made the stay feel different. I would have given it a 5-star if not for the fact that I feel for the rate we are paying, bottled water should be complimentary and not just limited to 2 small bottles a day!",40
"Conrad Macau is always discreet but high standard. Every staff is happy to see and help me and give me useful information.Efficient check in with Haruna who is very considerate.Fantastic room on high floor with super comfortable bathrobe and speedy free WiFi! Concierge provides House of Dancing Water and Cotai/Turbo jet tickets. Thanks William who took care of my battery also! Nice bridge connecting the mall to Venetian on 2nd floor. You can get 20% discount coupon for  Bodhi SPA (3rd floor ) upon check in every TUE,WED and THU.",50
"This is one of my favorites. I actually had a terrible sinus infection, the staff was very helpful and let me sleep all day and have a late check out. The rooms are all incredible. Very clean. The lobby bar has great food and knows how to make a martini well. It is not loud like other casino hotels there also. Walking distance to Venetian and City of Dreams. Casinos. If you go check out The House of Dancing Waters show, I've been twice.",50
"it's a modern terrific hotel, close to casino's.  Free upgrade to a suite was nice.  The room was very quiet and high standard.  Not vegas, although worth a visit.  Trendy shopping mall connected to the place. Perhaps not the cheapest, considering they're trying to get you into a casino.",40
"I stayed at the Conrad Macao for two nights with my wife as a part of a group trip with 12 other friends.  I had also considered the Venetian, Galaxy, Four Seasons, and Sheraton. However, upon checking out available rooms and prices, I proposed to the group that we stay at the Conrad Macao Cotai Central. I regretted this upon check-in.  My friend, who is a HHonors Platinum member helped us book (I am just a Blue level, normally preferring to stay at Marriott and InterContinental).  SERVICE  Normally, I include service as a part of my review of the Hotel and the Room. However, this time, the service at this hotel was so disappointing, I must address this from the start.  Coming from Hong Kong, we were greeted at the Cotai ferry pier by a hotel representative. As 6 of us were…",20
love to stay at Conrad.. staffs are very helpful and friendly.. feel like you are their friend rather than a customer...  Room is big and comfortable.. Had a sweet dream night...  I like here.. i will be back soon...,50
"I'd been upgraded to jr suite and room was superb in size and comfortable.  Just happened that the coffee machine was broken but tea selection was v good. One funny thing was that hair dryer provided could not be plugged in in the bathroom as type of plug was different, so I had to use the socket intended for nespresso machine.",50
Every staff is kindly and friendly.  They have Korean staff. They are top of best.  And room condition is clean and very nice.  I feel visit macau one more time. Because I stay here(conrad) one more time.,50
"Great service, very nice room. I stayed there for a weekend trip. There are lots of shops just nearby or you can take the footbridge over to Venetian for more shops. Transport is not a problem, so it is very convenient.",50
"For a relatively new hotel in a town where unemployment is effectively zero, we were very impressed with the warm services provided by everyone. At checkin we asked for our room at noon instead of the standard 3pm and not only we got what we asked, they proactively asked if we would like a late checkout as well. The room cleaning ladies offered their help a couple of times when we were milling about in the corridor. When I had to double back to the hotel for having left my car keys in the safe, the staff at concierge was super efficient and went to lost and found downstairs to retrieve my key when I told him I was in a rush to catch the ferry. The hotel is connected to the huge Venetian and Four Seasons complex as well as to its own smaller mall/casino. The City of Dreams is on…",50
"good position, reasonable price, most comfortable service ever met. the only issue is the swimming pool is too small. and staffs are very nice. another good point is there are different types of pillow for choice, which saved my neck.",50
"I stayed at Conrad for weekend getaway and celebrate my aunt's birthday. The service was excellent, staff was greeted upon check in and I arrived a bit earlier than check in time but the room was ready which I was very grateful. I also tried the food at lounge, the set lunch was tasty and great portion, service was excellent at the lounge. One thing I could not believe it was I requested extra bottle of water and the staff told me it will be $28 dollars. I understand some guests will ask for a lot but I would suggest just offer extra water for the first time request and second time need to charge. I booked directly from official and spend few thousands dollars on my room and dining and even internet... I'm even an elite member of your hotel group.. I think it's a bit stingy not…",30
"Quick Tip - The Conrad Macao is connected to The Holiday Inn and so the free shuttle from the fairy station will drop you off in front of the Holiday Inn.  Bonus Tip - The Conrad macao is connected to the Venetian via an indoor shopping area.  You'll never have to step a foot outside because everything is indoors.  So my stay at the Conrad Hilton was amazing!  I was warming greeted by all the doormen, Joy the front desk rep and Jessie Kim who's the guest relations manager.  They really made me and my girlfriend feel amazingly welcome and special.  They quickly checked us into our room, escorted us up to your room which was upgraded to an amazing suite and treated us as if we were worth a million bucks.  The room that we stayed in was very clean, modern and comfortable.  A true 5…",50
"From the moment you are greeted in the lobby and throughout the entire stay, luxury and attention to detail are cornerstones supported by the friendliest staff anywhere.  The rooms are as beautiful as the website shows and pool area is fantastic and relaxing great cabana.  Paweena was especially helpful.",50
"I'll state this up front: this is the best hotel I've ever stayed in. Absolute luxury. We stayed for three nights and loved every minute. If you are going to Macau, stay here. Nothing else needs to be said!",50
"Visited Macau with kids during  our Asia trip. Enjoyed staying atvthe Conrad on Cotai strip ( the  Asian version of Vegas)  attentive staffs, fast room service,  great amenities  in the room.  Will always book this hotel for future visits. ",50
We had chosen a Junior Suite to stay at our stay.  Room is spacious and beds are very comfortable.  Nicely layout and extremely quiet.  I guess if you are very concerned on the soundproofing between rooms and outside the public corridor.  Conrad will be your ultimate choice.  Hotel staffs are all very friendly and provide quality and professional attentive and personnel service.,50
"Very little has to be said of how exemplary a hotel the Conrad Macau is. There is a certain aura of classiness, exclusivity and sophistication that you will never be able to find at any other hotel in Macau. From the check-in, to the concierge, to the housekeeping... and even the staff at the Grand Orbit restaurant where the buffet breakfast is served is flawless. Big shout out to Vicky who checked me in, to the graciousness of Paweena who attended to our needs, and Jack at the Grand Orbit Restaurant. Thanks for making this trip so pleasant!",50
This is my fourth stay in Conrad since it was opened. The service and quality of the hotel remain top notch! All staff members I came across from the point I got off the shuttle served me with their hearts and they had been extremely helpful and kind! I will definitely come back next time!   Thank you for making my stay such a wonderful experience ! ,50
"We have been very frequent Asia travellers over the past 5 years; staying at the Conrad hotel in Macau was one of our best experiences. At started at check-in where the receptionist arranged 2 prams for our kids (2,5 years) which we could use for the duration of our stay. The room is very spacious with excellent beds, a large bath room and nice features such as a Nespresso machine; luxury bath robes, macaroons for the kids, conrad bath duckies etc etc The room was very clean. The swimming pools are great and do have plenty of shady relax units. Great service at the pool, nice food and drinks. All staff in the hotel are super friendly and polite. Most hotels, shops and casino's on the strip are within walking distance.  One issue we had was that there was some unclearity on the…",50
"Stayed here on the way home from Thailand on Cash and Points stay. Location is an easy shuttle ride from either Taipa Ferry Terminal or the main terminal near downtown Macao. I was upgraded to a suite and had free breakfast in the Grand Orbit as a result of my Hilton HHonors Gold status. Suite was large, clean, looked out over City of Dreams. Breakfast was plentiful and tasty, has afternoon tea in the lobby with cocktails, it was good as well. Shuttles can take you to Sands properties downtown. Enjoyed staying there, would stay again.",50
"2-yr old property in the middle of the action in Cotai, conveniently located in the same shopping mall/complex with Sheraton and Holiday Inn. A skybridge (enclosed/air conditioned) connects the Conrad to the Venetian and Four Seasons across one street, and an easy 5 min walk to the City of Dreams. The premium suite was amazing-- large, separate living room with dining table and working space and game/karoake room, all tastefully decorated like the best Conrad anywhere.  Experienced great service everywhere, including at the restaurants, but have to point out how amazingly friendly and thoughtful the staff was at reception, especially Paweena who helped with Hilton Honors members. The Executive Lounge has not launched yet, so she made sure we had access to the lobby lounge for…",50

Great stay, very comfortable bed!! and I love the flowers decoration at the entrance of Conrad.. very pretty and made me smile!! Recommend stay in Conrad !! :-)",50
"I was not prepared for such a team of ultra friendly and 1st class hospitality treatment by the staff -  they had went above and beyond their call of duty in my view. Firstly - they made accommodations  to allow me to have early check in - upon arrival ( checking out from Venetian ) at their lobby, I was greeted by Chandran - by mere mention of my last name - he addressed me by my full name - they were well informed about our arrival and early check-in. Paweena  aka Poy (Conrad Club Lounge Manager) - Upgraded us to premium suit ( me not a celebrity nor ultra rich person - just because I am celebrating my birthday during my stay at Conrad ) made me felt important and they made every single effort to ensure I had an enjoyable stay. Supposedly to stay for 2 nights - but due to my…",50
We spent 2 nights in a king suite and were extremely impressed. The suite was huge and felt like it was new.  The staff were all very friendly and the service exceptional from the time we checked in till we caught the shuttle back to the Hong Kong ferry.,50

SPA choice is very wide and professional service in a beautiful ambient. Great choice of restaurants and shops side close to main lobby lounge .",40
"We had a mini weekend getaway from HK to Macau and the end of June for a special occasion. Booked up with the suite, they then upgraded us to the premium suite which was superb and luxurious. The room was huge, with large tv room. We got free wifi which was great. The service exceptional, the manager had lead us up to our room, introduced us around the hotel. The room service was efficient and the food was great. We did not have time to enjoy their pool and onsite recreation, but the only set back was the construction site adjacent to the hotel. When we checked out, the hotel director and manager greeted us warmly.   Overall, I had a lovely stay and would definitely recommend this place to any family, couple or business traveler.",50
"Rooms were well appointed, we were on the 19th floor. Location is extremely convenient in the middle of Cotai Strip in Macau, linked to The Venetian and adjacent hotels. Only thing was the lack of free Wifi in the rooms, which was inconvenient.",40
"This is an outstanding property with excellent attention to customer service!  As a Hilton Diamond guest, I was upgraded to a lovely, large suite with a view of the city.  Although the Diamond lounge was being renovated, the hotel had made special accommodations so that I could still get the benefits.  Every employee made special efforts to assist me with any request.    It is part of the Sands Cotai group, which also includes a Holiday Inn and a Sheraton.  There is a large mall attached that includes sit-down restaurants and a food court.  This makes it very convenient.  There are covered walkways to the Four Seasons and the Venetian.",50
"Good location, good service, & good facility. We had very good experience to stay there. The size of the room makes our stay comfortable. The walking distance to Venetian, Sheraton, Galaxy, & Hyatt allows us to have a lot of options to shop, eat, & gamble.    The food there was not fantastic to us, but you can always find other restaurants easily.",50
"Hotel : Conrad Hotel, Macau  Location : The location of Conrad is fantastic.  Part of the sprawling Sands Cotai strip, the whole strip encompasses Conrad, Holiday Inn and Sheraton all linked by a sprawling shopping centre filled with branded shops, restaurants and entertainment.  Esp noteworthy was the Kids Cavern on the 3rd floor and Cube 2 on the 2nd floor.  Our kids were also overwhelmed by the daily Dreamworks parade and photo sessions with Shrek, Po etc. Across a bridge via a travellator, is the Venetian and the Four Seasons Mall.  Next door is the City of Dreams with its one of its kind performance House of Dancing Water.  So in fact, you do not have to go anywhere else in Macau.  Service : We have always stayed at suites all over the world so being pampered is customary…",50

Hotel is quiet and well located in main shopping mall connected to 2 other hotels.  We took the boat to get to the Hong Kong airport.  It is convenient, and saves time.  Hotel staff are very helpful.",50
"It was just a weekend getaway with my mum and we stayed at Macao Conrad for one night.  We took the free shuttle bus from the ferry terminal to the hotel complex.  Conrad is one of the hotels within the complex (sharing with Sheraton and Holiday Inn) and there are plenty of shops and restaurants within the complex!  The lobby was grand and check in/out area was spacious.  The room was moderaely large and bathroom was spacious.  It was a beautiful hotel but my only complaint was their quilt!  I woke up in the middle of the night sweating and too cold if I slept without the quilt.    Will I go back?  With that price tag, I think I'll try some other hotels!",40
"We had a terrific stay at the Conrad. We arrived in Macau by ferry and took their free shuttle service to the hotel. Oddly enough, the hotel lobby is in the middle of a mall. This made the hotel a little less personal, but it wasn't a big deal. We loved our room! We booked a suite, which was pure luxury and so comfortable. Service was great as well. We had a small problem at night with a loud outdoor party at the adjacent hotel, and the staff was great at managing the situation. For breakfast, we had to walk through the mall again to get to the hotel buffet. It was odd as well, but the food and selection were good. I will definitely stay here again on my next visit to Macau!",50
"I've been in Macau several times now and stayed most times in Venetian. For a 40th bday of a friend we've decided to take something more 'serious' and followed Tripadvisor ranking and so booked the Conrad. The hotel is beautiful, unlike Macau not noisy and with a sense of intimacy, there is a very good smell as you are entering the hotel.   We've stayed in room 922 (King Suite, 128 SQM) - really great room. From the decoration, the rooms, to the cosmetics provided.   The hotel is connected to the venetian and others hotels with bridges, so getting to all hotels in the Cotai Strip is very convenient.   Checking in was quick and efficient and the team wished us happy birthday (later a cake was sent to the room).   Only two downsides are the breakfast: it is outside the hotel, and…",50
We stayed in Conrad Macao for 5 days in the last week of June. Thanks to the great hospitality of the hotel staff we had a wonderful and memorable stay. Service was impeccable and whatever we asked was provided within minutes. The gym was very spacious and exceptionally good. The best part of my stay was the spa treatment i had taken at Bodhi spa. The staff (Nyoman and Jackie) were real experts and were very pleasant. Overall we had an incredibly good stay at Conrad. Would love to stay here again. Shopping was also good with lot of new shops.,40
"We chose this hotel after reading the review in TA and we never regret.  We arrived Macau from the ferry terminal and there was a free shuttle service direct to Conrad. The shuttle bus is in green colour which is easily recognizable. It's about 15 min bus ride to the hotel. Upon arrival, we were greeted by Ms Cathy at the front desk. Her service and smile was commendable. Checking in was swift and we were led to our room by the concierge. The room was huge and bright with big windows. Bed was comfortable and in room amenities were adequate. The only complaint is they only provide wifi at the lobby but not in the room. We ordered in room dining at late night and the food arrived on time. It would be great if they were to bring up 2 glasses of iced water since we have ordered…",50
"Being located on the southern island of Macao, it's far away from everything interesting (which is on the northern peninsula). The hotel lacks a bar and in general it lacked atmosphere.  Staff was nice, sometimes helpful (e.g. tip to catch a City of Dreams shuttle to get to the northern peninsula for free), sometimes unhelpful (I booked a room with breakfast included, someone from the reception told me this is not possible and sent me to the bar in the lobby).  The breakfast buffet (once I found it, it's outside of the Conrad part of the building complex) was huge, but a labyrinth - at first it wasn't clear to me which parts belong to the breakfast and nobody of the staff could answer me the simple question where I could get some eggs...  Charging extra for WiFi in the room is…",30

"I'm based in Macau and so its nice to have a little stay-cation some times... and for me personally, this is the perfect option. I love this Hotel and everything about it, from the moment you enter the Lobby it has that special feel about it... check in is amazing calm, and yet speedy and professional (why can't other hotels be the same... ? what's the catch?). The rooms are perfect, in size, in luxury, in amenities... bathroom beautiful, large, everything you need on hand - even a TV in the bath. The only down point of this hotel... ""Check out"".  The Pool area, where maybe its not huge, its very relaxing and has warm water pools and regular temp pools, I spent half my day in a cabana next to the warm water pool... relaxing to say the least.  Thank You Conrad for succeeding…",50

"This is my first review on TripAdvisor; I have been using it as a reference for some time now but never felt the necessity to post a review, as I think it usually sets up ridiculously unrealistic expectations, or dashes them with a capital D- but this experience definitely warrants writing about.  I was planning a trip across the pond to Macau for a four-day conference and I decided to use the opportunity to celebrate a missed anniversary with my spouse - which involved reaching out to hotel staff beforehand. The manager in charge of my booking, Ms Paweena, or Poy, was prompt and efficient in her replies, and also assisted with my request of placing a special message in the room in advance. She also offered to waive the wi-fi charge for us, which was extremely thoughtful,…",50
"Service couldn't be better! The staff were friendly, helpful and goes beyond the call of duty. Besides, since it's our honeymoon trip, we got upgraded to a high floor room with city view and a complimentary cake! By the way, the conrad teddy bear and duck and the candies brighten up all my days at Conrad! Overall, we had a memorable holiday at Conrad Macao and I would definitely return again!",50

"I spent a week at the Conrad Macao, and it is difficult to say what was better, because everything was ""fantastic"". I took a Ferry from Hong Kong to Macao, one hour of a quiet ferry ride. Upon arrival, because they are building a new pier, you must walk a few minutes, the Passport is  stamped and you are .... in a very nice place of Macao: Taipa. A very nice Mercedes Benz from the Conrad Macao hotel picked us up and upon arrival, we immediately noticed the elegance of the hotel and the reception by Ms. Poi Waraha, Chief Concierge, and Ms. Cecily Chan and Ms. Joyce Soong, all Directors of several departments, who introduced us to the ""functioning""' of the Conrad and took us to our suite. The entry halls, the elevators, the corridors to the suites, all elegantly decorated, clean,…",50
"My wife and I received excellent benefits as a Hilton Gold member including room upgrade to a junior suite and great breakfast.   The room was so spacious and also very quiet.  We thought next door rooms empty since nothing heard from next door at all, but the both rooms were occupied.   Staff members were so friendly and showed great hospitality.  Concierges explained us great value local restraints where we really appreciated food. Pool deck staff provided hourly “mist services” which was really cool!  We also enjoyed 150 minute Exotic Couples Retreat at SPA though the price is a little expensive.  The quality of Conrad's restransts were supper for both breakfast and dinner. What we missed was a nice bar with great view.  We could not find such bar at nearby hotels. Overall…",50
We are very pleased to have stayed in this hotel. The hotel staff had outdone themselves. They not only upgraded our room to junior suite but also provided us with the best service. We were looking forward to stay at the hotel and we were also sad when it was time to go. Thank you for the amazing experience we had with you.,50
"My girlfriend and I stayed there in June and we had an outstanding time. The check in process, the room, the pool area, fitness center, staff, location and restaurant were all excellent. Special thanks go out to Prem, Poy and Herbert.  They made our stay so wonderful and memorable. I would highly recommend this hotel to everyone. I would definitely return.",50
"We had booked a King Deluxe Suite City View and it was quite lovely. We could see the construction going on at Holiday Inn but no noise penetrated. My daughter loved running around the various rooms. We were super pleased with how family friendly it was. They had supplied us with a whole children's kit along with a black rubber ducky for her bath :)   I had previously been in touch with Edmund, the Head Concierge for spa and other appointments. Edmund had booked everything to the T and all his restaurant recommendations were wonderful as well! A special shout out to him for delivering such fine service.   The pool was very kid friendly but do note that there are no lifeguards on duty, something I do believe the hotel must correct. The staff were extremely accommodating and…",50
"We had a few booking problems as the Hilton website stated that there were club rooms and we booked one of these to find that currently there are no club rooms.  There will eventually be a lounge but this will be only available to Diamond HiltonHonors members which is a bit disappointing.   However, when expressing our concerns to hotel management, they very kindly upgraded our room to a Premier Suite and also gave us free breakfast.  Jessie the manager even greeted us when we arrived and looked after us and offered some tips for attractions while we were in Macau.  The room was beautiful... very large and made our 4 day stay extremely comfortable.  The staff here are very very helpful and deserve top marks for their customer service from The Lounge to the The Orbit restaurant…",50

Seating plentiful and stylish with cabana and lounge chairs for large crowds.",50

I specially deeply appreciate Ms Poy Paweena Waraha's (Conrad Club Lounge Manager) arrangement and many thanks for the hospitality she and her staffs showed me.

"Conrad Macao provides a luxury stay no matter how you measure it. Our room, a suite, was massive, extremely well-appointed, quiet and an oasis away from the crowds that can swarm Macau. The most important part of any stay for us, however, is how we are received. Conrad's staff were welcoming and warm, friendly without being obstrusive and helpful when needed. There's a lot of choice when it comes to hotels in Macau. Conrad is now mine.",50

"Again I am traveling with a minor so please bare with me. I am writing in a parent's prespective. If you don't like it please skip.   Very luxurios. It has the vegas kind of feel. Very new and modern. Free shuttle from the cotai ferry pier took about 15 mins. It feels like a hotel that is inside a shopping mall (a very luxurious shopping mall). It has a feel of a business hotel, some staffs are a bit cold but some are very warm and friendly. I guess the casino makes us all a bit ruthness.   The room is big. Facility is modern and grand. Many breakable items and sharp edges so beware. Bed is big enough for me and my boy. You can smell the residue of cigarettes in the air. I am not too concerned. Toilet is huge with seperate shower box and bath tub.  My room had nice view of city…",50
"I travel a lot globally and The Conrad Macau has gained the distinction of being one of the best hotels I have stayed in. The moment I arrived by bright green transfer bus from the ferry terminal I was treated to something special. The porters were horrified at the prospect I'd be wheeling my own hand luggage into the hotel and promptly assisted me in a very gracious manner.  Check-in was a spectacular experience thanks to Guest Services Manager Nicole (whose name I remember despite writing this review 6 months after my stay). As a Hilton Gold member, I'm used to being treated somewhat indifferently by the brand around the world, so I was shocked at the attention Nicole and her colleagues afforded me. When Nicole found out that I did not yet have my ferry ticket to Hong Kong…",50
"I spend three days two nights at Conrad Macao Cotai Hotel in June 11-13 2014 for Business meeting trip, I should say this Hotel is really nice for stay and relax, convenience to spend a days of shopping, gambling and even business meeting. Hotel itself located in the new development area connecting with another big three hotels. A big convenience to heading back and forth from Macao Airport in 5-10 mins only!.   Superior room is so large and very nice in room facility, Breakfast is really awesome and wide variety for all choices (at The Orbit).

"Within 18 months, i have stay in Conrad Macao for more than 7 times, there must be something uniquely attractive and relaxing that this hotel offered to me and to all its guests.  I was staying at the hotel in June to have a kind of hugely important celebration ; the Conrad Club Lounge manager (Poy) is really thoughtful and caring and has given us really nice surprise, which complement our stay and celebration to become a really memorable & enjoyable one.  Highly appreciated their high quality of service provided and their focussed attention to their loyal customers.  Everything offered by this hotel would definitely honor its 5 stars (or above) level of service ; which is not always you could get in Macau - where gambling / casinos dominates the catering of the demand.  So if…",50
"It was my birthday, and the hotel completely spoiled me. We got upgraded to a suite, twice the size as our apartment at home, and they brought me a complimentary cake with my name on. So sweet!!!   Otherwise, I was a little bit surprised to see how calm it was. I have been to Las Vegas, USA, many times, and I expected a similar experience. However, at Conrad's it was so calm; it almost felt like being at a spa or a monastery. I was almost the only one in the pool area, I was the only one at the gym, there were only a few people in the bar, etc. It almost felt a bit lonely, but the service was superb everywhere!    Perhaps there are other hotels where there are more action in Cotai?   Still, to me it was perfect! The pools were great, the gym was perfect, and we had some lovely…",40
"This review is from a guest who didn't stay in the hotel.  My parents told me that they will celebrate my mom's birthday in this hotel. I tried to surprised my mom by sending flower to the hotel.  therefore, i told the Chef Concierge about the floral delivery that day.  The Chef Concierge Edmund was so nice that he was assisting me for arranging a nice surprise for my mom.  Everything was so perfect thatreat day when my mom arrive.  She is pampered with wonderful arrangements. I couldn't have done it without his help.  I was so grateful for his help that there's no better channels to express my compliments toward his services.  This is definitely a great hotel that you will never regret that you stay at.  My parents had such a wonderful time",50

"We love their attentive service. From the moment we walk in to their front reception and queued up, in less than half minute, someone walked over to us and assisted us, led us to the front for check-in. Being part of the Hilton group and a Hilton Honours member, I have not been disappointed by it and Conrad indeed lives up to its expectation where service is concerned.  As I booked through Agoda and had requested for an early check-in, they were unable to accommodate my request as the rooms were full. To our utter delight and surprised, they upgraded us to King Premier room as compensation and also being my birthday. We have nothing negative to say about our room as we loved it.  We left our backpacks at their luggage room while we explored the surroundings of the hotel and COD.…",50
"luxurious facilities and heartwarming hospitality. I was really touched with carefull concern prior to check-in such as how to get hotel and memorable event. Location is really nice for my family, not crowded nearby. I can go anywhere in Macau with the shuttle bus. Room rate is relatively good, but it's really expensive on a weekend. Breakfast is tasty. If I go to Macao again, I will surely stay in Conrad.",50

The staff, location, and attention to detail was first class.

You will not be disappointed here, I  certainly will return soon....",50
"First time to Macao and first time stayed in Conrad and felt so pampered with the highest quality of service from the first minute we checked in till we checked out. Mr Edmund, the concierge, has been helpful with all information weeks before we arrived there and greeted us personally when we checked in. He always made sure that my parents (in their 70s) and well taken care of and he wrote us a personalized notes every morning to give us ideas how to spend the day! The rooms were amazing as it should be as a Conrad hotel but the service that made it our stay there unforgettable. Just one small note for an area of improvement that the room service was quite slow when we asked for more tea, pillows and sewing kit maybe because the numbers of rooms and guess. Keep up the good work!",50
"Despite paying a premium due to holiday peak season, it was still worth every penny.   The service is, as commented here, amazing.   We booked 2 rooms for our father's 65th birthday and he was treated as a birthday boy.  Although he complaint about the rooms being more expensive the what he would budget, but at the end, even he thought the rooms were superb.   My 2.5 year old did not want to go back home cos of the comfortable bed and great swimming pool.  ALso she loved the Dreamwork cartoon parade.   I did not get the name of the female staff who served us, she is not a Chinese speaker, but she was super friendly in such a way that does not make you feel uncomfortable.

They arranged so many surprises for our 5 yr old daughter's birthday which was an excellent added bonus.  The hotel is part of the Cotai central complex with Holiday Inn and Sheraton. The mall, swimming pools and facilities are excellent. The room and bathroom were beautifully decorated.  We did the DreamWorks Shreakfast experience which was outstanding. Our daughter got to meet and cuddle all the characters including Shrek, Fiona, The Lion, Hippo and penguins from Madagascar and King Fu panda and his Tiger friend. Well worth the charge which included a nice buffet breakfast.  There is also a daily 3pm parade of the characters…",50

Before that, I sent an email to the hotel with my planning, the hotel manager Paweena Waraha (Poy) gave me a complimentary cake in a prompt response for my propose marriage plan. My girlfriend was surprised when she saw the cake and a diamond ring. My girlfriend was happy and said YES to me, we would definitely visit Conrad in the future. Besides, the room environment are large and clean. The staff there are helpful and polite. That's why I got an excellent experience in Conrad Macao.",50

The hotel is huge, the Casino is good and the staff very friendly and helpful.  Will definitely stay here again",50
Conrad cotai Macau is an excellent choice hotel in Macau. Staff is great and really helpful. The rooms are spacious and new. Importantly it locates near all the actions like shopping and shows without residing in the wild crowd! Cannot wait to go back,50
I am writing to express our grateful thanks to the Conrad staff especially Mr Chandran Morgan and Mr Edmund Tan. We were on our way home to Singapore when our friend fainted at Macau Airport. He was refused permission to board the aircraft and told to go to a hospital for a checkup. My husband and I decided to stay behind with the couple and decided  to book rooms at the Conrad Macau until clearance could be obtained from a medical doctor. When Mr Chandran whom we met on a previous stay last year heard our story he rose to the occasion... arranged interconnecting rooms and gave us the most warm welcome to compensate for a most difficult day.The wonderful rooms and beds gave us all a good night`s sleep! With Edmund `s help  we managed to transfer our flights to the next day…,50
The Conrad Hotel in Cotai is really a lovely hotel. Excellent value for money. It is part of a group of hotels that were built on reclaimed land between the islands of Taipa and Coloane. It is actually a 15 minutes bus ride from the downtown section of Macau.,50
"Beatiful hotel but a bit confusing to find the lobby as we all get lost as we decided to do some shopping at ground floor where all shops and connecting passage to other hotels are. However, The room was great, my family and I stay in a suit room only 1 nightl, but the bed was great and amenity is more than I expected. Though now I regrat that I didn't buy a bathrobe (texture really nice and confortable, It shown how well the hotel has choose a good material for guests), before I return home as my luggage were full. If I go to Macau again, this hotel will be my only choice!",50
From the moment we stepped off the shuttle bus we were warmly welcomed by the concierge staff who guided us to reception. Reception staff were professional and informative. Our suite was superb. Each contact we made during the weekend was handled efficiently and with a friendly attitude. It reminded us of what good service is meant to be.,50
"We stayed here as part of our honeymoon and received wonderful service from the moment we stepped out of the taxi. The staff are all tremendous and nothing is too much trouble for them. The rooms are enormous and the bed incredibly comfortable. The only thing that lets it down is charging so much for wifi use in your room, I would expect this to be complimentary in a 5 star hotel. We had a wonderful stay however and highly recommend this hotel.",40
Stayed here for two nights en route from Hong Kong to London. Very attentive staff and Jessie is brilliant! Had excellent room upgrade as Diamond member and an all round pleasant and relaxing stay. My only thought is that the bar area lacks a bit of ambience as it is like having a drink in a shopping centre (which is exactly what it is). Executive lounge non-existent but free drinks in the bar instead. Excellent location for casino and shops!,50
"We had a luxurious stay @ Conrad, Macau. The room was spacious and the interiors were rich that offers a luxurious ambiance.Hotel staff at the reception lobby / breakfast were very courteous. My family (specially my daughter) had great stay at Conrad.",40
"This is my third stay with Conrad Macau, and I was pampered by staffs and facifity everytime.  They would cater all your nneds and Paweena (Poy), the manger of Club Lounge, was so attentive and helpful.  This was a perfect arrangement to celebrate Mother's Day, and I would not stay in other hotel except this one in Macau.",50
"Great experience! Will be my first chose in Macao for sure. Check-in was smothly and quick and when my friend pick up key in the afternoon,Mr.Ken was really helpful!When we check out, Ms.JOY and the gentleman who was check-out for us are very nice and professional,carry a big smile,offer luggage assist proactive,etc. Thank you!",50
"If you want elegance and class then stay at the Conrad in Macau.  From the moment of check until the time you walk out the door you feel welcome. The staff are pleasant, smiling and always helpful. The security is excellent and unobtrusive and the environment is one of understated warmth and invitation.  The buffet breakfast is excellent and staff were smiling, helpful and always on hand to help   A wonderful stay as usual.",50
"The moment I arrived, this hotel was surprised me with attention to every single detail, like other Conrad. I stayed in many Conrad hotels but this hotel has supremacy than others due to its descent construction/built and friendly staff. The guy at receptionist (sorry I forgot his name) had upgraded me to city view which have flawless panoramic overlooking city and sea harbor.  All the Conrad staff was very attentive and really helpful in providing any service. All basic amenities which required by the guest is fulfilled and even more. One good example: Two bottles of Evian water daily provided by free is one kind of luxury that you have staying in Conrad. Not to mention, sufficiently provided bathroom kits (soap, shampoo, towel etc). Conrad duck will also welcome your…",50
"Most wonderful hotel I have ever stayed in. Staff were so friendly and curteous. Nothing was a trouble. The Director of operations Christopher Duker was at reception greeting guest when we arrived. He Introduced himself and took a genuine interest in what we would like to see and do while visiting Macau. He told us if there was anything he or the staff could assist us with not to hesitate to ask. As for the room ""magnificent""  is the only way to describe it. Spotless clean, cosy and very large.The bathroom was of such a high standard and very large with a wonderful shower and bath. The halls and lifts were immaculate.

"Very nice Hotel.  All the staff are friendly and attentive.  One of the Guest Relation Managers even emailed me prior to my arrival asking me about my room preferences – an extremely nice and professional touch. I must give special mention to the head Concierge (whose name I have forgotten – sorry) but he knows and can direct you to everything there is to know and see in Macau – indeed if he does not know about it, it is not worth seeing!  The suites are lovely with the full amenities that one expects from a Conrad.  All in all a lovely couple of days – thankyou.",50
This a great hotel if you like to live it up. The room I had came with 2 queen size beds and was very tastefully furnished with all the makings of a 5 star hotel. Service was excellent with the staff being very helpful and always smiling. Location was great with shopping and food within the hotel. Highly recommended.,50
"The hotels at Cotai Central, either Sheraton, Holiday, Hard Rock etc are generally quite above average standard if compare to their hotel in other countries. However, Conrad Macau has offered extra bit of lovely touch to me (of course with extra $$).   In addition to their bed turning service, the cute complementary candy on coffee table, bear toy on top of my pillow, little duck miniature on bathtub, purple velvet slipper etc added lots of surprise for me...  The room is spacious with huge sofa and coffee table. It is definitely a good choice if the price is within your budget.  For meal: we tried the Hot Pot buffer at hotel. Interesting dish such as spring chicken with sugarcane (with kaffir lime leaf flavour), olong tea jelly etc should be good try if you have the time.",40
"Lovely hotel, great room and amenities. The staff took a lot of small steps which resulted in great delight for us. For instance, additional water, toiletries, complimentary child bed, comfy cute bathrobe and slippers for the kids, kiddie toy bag on check in, surprise macaroons for the child on day 1, teddy bear left on the child bed when we returned from our tour, strawberries and cream on day 2, with compliments from the manager, I could go on & on. The expresso machine was lovely with the water all ready.. small touches but these were thoughtful and made us overlook the fact that the breakfast lounge was way too far away with no directions/ boards anywhere. Choose a higher floor if you can. We were on the 37th floor and the views were great. A special thanks to Mr Chandran…",50
"I will say this is the best among the others at Cotai Central, nice room, friendly staff. Our room was on 38th floor but no open view as there's a wall which block the surrouding, like a terrace outside but close and this is not a big deal. Swimming pool was small, for kids it's fine. Overall it's a comfortable stay, will be back.",40
"Stayed in both Cotai Conrad and Banyan Tree suites in my lustful sojourn in April 14.  For hotels in Cotai, my preference is for Conrad:   1) All complimentary features for HH Honors Diamond members honored.  This includes a 1 or 2 tier complimentary upgrade to a suite, free internet plus happy hour lounge usage despite using HH points to secure accommodation.  This was beyond expectation.  Upgrade was conducted seamlessly without hassle.   2) Loved Conrad's more contemporary in-room look than Banyan Tree's Balinese theme architecture and certainly didn't like the latter incense fragrance which is overtly sensitive to my dog like nose. Trust i won't be evicted by Banyan Tree and Angsana going forward for comments like these.   3) Coffee machine in Conrad's room was already…",50
"The room was great but once you leave the room, it becomes average: - To get a drink in the lobby bar takes an eternity. - The ordered eggs at breakfast arrived with a considerable delay and were cold. - The beverage service at the pool was also extremely long. - No free internet in the room. When questioning this at checkout, we were told that it was allegedly free. - Although it did not matter in the end, the staff told us to wait in a wrong area for the shuttle bus.  On the upside, the spa was wonderful.",30
"I was very impressed by the Conrad from the moment I arrived. A very big thank you for the upgrade, as the suite was spectacular!   Cathy was delightful and made the check in process seamless. She quickly picked up on what I was interested in doing while in Macao and offered lots of suggestions, not in a pushy or salesy way but as someone who had been listening and had some helpful ideas. All the staff I encountered were polite, friendly and efficient and made my short stay very relaxing and pleasant.   The location is fine and it is easy to get to the old part of Macao by taxi or bus. The hotel provides a card with common tourist site names printed in English and Chinese and that made getting around a breeze as I could show that card and get directions.   Food and beverage…",50
We had an amazing stay at the Conrad Macao. We were very impressed with the staff as well as the spa facility. Big thank you for the warm hospitality and personal greetings from Paweena Waraha. She helped me coordinate with the spa appointment via emails as I did not have international calling during my trip. She met my family and I in person during our check-in and personally escorted us to our room. The service was top-notch.   We only stayed one night and wished we could stay forever. We were upgraded to a suite with a living room and king size bed that came with a bath tub and shower. The room had a great view of the Taipa. We enjoyed a few drinks at the bar and games at the two casinos in the hotel. The breakfast buffet at the Grand Orbit was phenomenal. It had everything…,50
"Great hotel, everything you need, wonderful service, stay here! I do prefer to stay closer to the other island vs the strip, but this hotel is so grand it made it worth the short taxi ride. The casino attached is not one of my favorites but is also very clean but expensive like all of Macau's.",50
Extreemly comfortable quiet rooms to relax before a hard days meeting agenda - Quality at its best - Staff make you feel welcome as a guest and provided good quality service - Overall an enjoyable experience and would definately reccommend a visit for both leisure and/or buisness trips.,40
We really enjoyed our stay at the Conrad - we paid a little extra and were upgraded to an absolutely stunning room.  The spa is one of the best I have ever experienced and the pools are beautiful.  The only slight disappointment was the fact breakfast is served in restaurant outside of the hotel and was incredibly busy with average food.  Otherwise a wonderful stay.,50
"We arrived at the hotel concierge to do the check-in, a boy staff keep served us in Mandarin while we were speaking in English.  It was quite annoying indeed, though he has good manner.  What I would like to say is, not all people in black hair and with chinese face are speaking or understand Mandarin / Cantonese.    We stayed at the king deluxe suite for 1 night.  The room is very big.  There are 3 TVs in the media room, sitting room and bedroom respectively, but the one in bedroom was not working.  The bathroom is large too.  They provide bath salt for hot bath, also a cute bath toy, conrad duck, must enjoy it for relaxing.  When we back after out for dinner, the room had been tidy up.  What a little suprise was, a little conrad bear was welcoming us ""home"" on bed, it was so…",40
"Clean with excellence services, staffs always in anticipation of customers needs . Room are well kept and clean by house keeping . Never fail to make up the room timely and do up the bed during the evening . Bar could be improved further with a more relaxing sitting arrangement . In general given an option I will always stay at the Conrad.",40
"Travelled from Hong Kong on the Turbo Jet foil from HK for a two night stay at the Conrad with my family.  There are regular free shuttle buses from the ferry port to the hotel. On arrival we were greeted personally and shown to our wonderful suite with connecting room for our teenage daughters. This is one of the best hotel suites I have stayed in worldwide. The staff had left a lovely birthday cake for me. The guest relations  manager, Paweena had ensured we were looked after fantastically. Great gym, lovely pools. Nice bar. 5 minutes walk to the Venetian and the Hard Rock. 15 minutes to main town Macao in a taxi but also worth going to Tapia village with is a 15 minute walk away and has some nice places.   Only downside was the noise from the screens on the strip outside…",40
"This hotel made an unauthorised charge for no-show on a booking that was cancelled two days before arrival with Hilton Worldwide Reservations (with confirmation number). The hotel claimed they did not receive the cancellation notification from reservations, none of this should be a guests' issue.   The lack of thought to even check whether the reservation had been booked before charging a credit card is careless. The fact that my credit card was charged without any notice from Conrad Macau by email or letter is questionable business practice.    As a Gold Member of Hilton Honors I was extremely uncomfortable with this whole experience and this Hilton property needs to get its act together.  Booking Reference: 3121131924 Cancellation number: 1569940157",10
"Spacious room, bathroom. Great hotel amenity. Comfy robe with flannel liner. Thick sole slippers non open toes. Shampoo , conditioner and bath gel of very good brand.  Great pen, took 2 pens from the room back with me. Each room serves 2 bottles of free Evian water. Casino beneath has many tables with lower minimum bets. Chinese food cuisine in the casino is yummy!!",50
Checked in the Superior Suite. Very spacious. There is a so called Media Room in the suite. Staff said they could arrange a karaoke set so that I could invite friends to come and sing karaoke together. What a brilliant idea! But instead I watched my favourite soccer game TV live broadcast there. Enjoyed it.,40
"Hotel is in the Sands complex. Easy access to gaming at Sands, free shuttle bus to other major casinos. Free shuttle bus to/from both ferry piers. Rooms are very large, well appointed, and comfortable. Air conditioning works well. Excellent concierge can obtain ferry tickets and help with getting around town to see landmarks. One of the best Hilton properties I have ever stayed at.",50
"lathey have normal things same as other five-star hotel: good location, food, service, beautiful lobby, view, etc. BUT they arrange details very good!  1) a cute small Teddy bear. 2) a bottle of cute candy on which print Conrad. 3) lavender topic: color of pajamas and slippers(I do like! ); smell of bodywash, shampoo, conditioner, soap, body lotion( I do like! ) 4) a lot of beautiful table lamps 5) very big room for suite(two toilets which are located very reasonable and very big&comfortable bathroom)  If you will travel Macau, I do recommend Conrad! If your budget is ok I recommend suite! It will be your unforgotten nice hotel which you will consider stay again.",50
"This was an easy trip for us from Hong Kong by ferry. I had booked a suite at the hotel and was met at the exit from the ferry pier by the limo driver- very convenient.  Check in was personal and escorted by the guest relations manager who gave me a card so that I could reach her if I had any problems.  The suite, and the standard room that I added on day two when the rest of the family arrived were both outstanding. I travel a lot and this hotel has exceptional rooms.  Food was very high quality and reasonably priced. I tried the Grand Orbit and In room dining.  The pool was quiet and we used it several times. I looked into the gym but didn't have time to use it. It looked very well equipped.  The minor problems I had were rectified quickly and my expectations were exceeded. …",50
"Nice hotel, good location, nice staff. I highly recommand to stay this hotel if you are coming Macau. But the FO staff should be trainned  more especially billing. Do not overcharge and if no guest sign any bill on it.",50
"I have booked junior suite for my vocation!  I'm so appreciate for Conrad reservation team ms. Joana well prepare a b'day cake to my sister and also provide a full set milk bottle steamer and re heat machine to my baby girl and can't expect they was provide the baby cleansing set to bb, no doubt provided a baby tub and cot too.",40
I am a Hilton Diamond member and stayed at many global Hilton properties.  This Conrad is very nice and the staff are some of the best I have experienced.  However the breakfast was not up to Int'l Conrad standards and overall the hotel is overpriced.,50
"This is the second time I have stayed here, having also stayed here in 2012. It is still as wonderful as before, even more so this time due to a staying in massive suite.  Conrad Macau is located in the Cotai strip area of Macau, where the new hotels are all being built. The old Macau where the Grand Lisboa is located, whilst having old world charm, simply doesn't cut it for quality of hotels. Conrad Macau shares the same building as the Holiday Inn, and is connected to the Sheraton (which occupies the last 2 towers), as such the Conrad rooms have the best views of the Venetian and Hard Rock Hotel / Crown.  Surrounds: *Do visit Taipa Village (catch a free shuttle bus from Sheraton to the Galaxy and then from Galaxy to Taipa VIllage, and vice versa. Don't bother walking) *There…",50
"I planned a surprise birthday trip for my fiance, and I was given excellent assistance throughout my planning from Conrad Macao team. A special mention for Paweena and Edmund who really supported and promptly responded to my incessant emails. They helped me to plan a beautiful dinner and provided a delicious cake. The service really made us feel royal and cared for; we experienced the luxury they had to offer.  Our room was beautiful, spacious and had a lot of character (because there for three separate areas to the suite). We were lucky enough to get an up-grade to the city view which gave us  an absolutely breathtaking view. It was special to just sit there enjoy a nice glass of wine and watch the buzzing life in Macao. We didn't get the time to enjoy the hotel facilities…",50
"Stunning hotel room, with separate lounge area. Facilities were impeccable as was the service from Wendy, Joanna and Nicole.  Pool is fabulous and the location is central. I had terrific views of the Venetian and its gondola lake.  Best use of Hilton Reward Points ever. Best hotel room ever.",50
"We had a great upgrade; staff were everywhere, but helpful and smiling, not overbearing; room was incredibly comfortable and everything worked perfectly; room service food was delicious; check-in and check-out was easy and quick.  I have stayed in a lot of Macau hotels and this one is easily the best on every level.",50
"Upgraded to a suite. Very large and comfortable room. Bathroom with tube and shower. Excellent breakfast. Very convenient location : in central Cotai, across the street from the Venitian with direct access to a shopping mall of more the 600 shops ans shuttle bus from and to the Macau ferry terminal.",50
From check-in to check-out experienced incredible service. The room itself is well laid out and luxurious. Love the hair dryer that is provided as well as the other amenities. Would definitely stay again!,50
"I just went to the Conrad Macao for a 1-night trip during weekend. The lobby wan't too big but still, the check in process was quick. We booked a standard room, and the room was surprisingly nice, big and comfortable with the nespresso coffee machine. Other than that, the service is superb and  the location was really good as well, just few minutes distance to the Venetian, Four Seasons and the City of dreams, it's easy to access everywhere by taking the shuttle. Although the Sands Cotai Central itself didn't run   many routes, you can still walk to the City of dreams, Venetian, Galaxy.etc to take the shuttle and they are quite frequent. One more tips, the minimum bet (except the slot machine) of the casino downstairs on the lobby level is HKD$500.",50
"Writing a review about this hotel, I am thinking how can I possibly give this a true reflection to readers who have never stayed here. Think of falling asleep and waking up in hotel heaven! I simply cannot describe this in any other way. You are in a location that is dubbed ""the Las Vegas of China"" with 6 times the amount of revenue generated here compared to it's more well known compatriot in the USA. If you ever get a chance to visit this part of the world, treat yourself, even for only one night and stay here! You will not regret it! I can give you a 100% assurance!",50
I would highly recommend the Conrad Macao. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and the old-world Hong Kong theme of the hotel gives it a great dose of character. The outdoor pools are gorgeous and the Dynasty 8 restaurant offers amazing Cantonese cuisine.,50
"staying over for just a night, room was awesome. it just make me feel like spending my whole day in the room and enjoy. appreciated the turn-down they arranged for us, thank you! Will definitely recommend to all of my friends to stay. It just worth it!",40
"The hotel was good, as expected, in terms of hardware and service.  No surprise.  Service at restaurants could improve.  We went to two during the stay - food is fine, service is not quite good, but price is relatively high.",40
"From the moment you arrive at the Conrad they make every effort to make you feel welcome.  The take the time to not just speak to you but to listen to your answers.  I was shown all the way to my room by the lady checking me in and she talked me through my room.  The room was great, I could not have asked for more.......OK the view was mainly of construction sites, but that is Macau today.  It is nice to see people investing in bricks and mortar, it is certainly not the case in the UK at present!  The rest of the resort is good, combining with the Connected hotels.  You are a short walk away from the Venetian and the City of Dream complex, so plenty of choice for food and entertainment.  The bricks and mortar suggest you are in Vegas, the level of service reminds you you are in…",50
"Stayed 3 nights over the weekend of 13-17 Mar'14 with hubby and we were pleasantly surprised by a complimentary upgrade to a junior suite.  Room was timely made up daily and duly turned down nightly with thoughtful touches like leaving the signature teddy left on the pillow, bedroom slippers left by the bedside for hubby and I. Hubby especially like their shower gel--very theraputic !   A great variety of TV channels and conveniently connected to Cotai Central Shopping Mall and Venetian. A stone's throw away from Galaxy & City of Dreams where we managed to catch shuttle bus to downtown Macau. Conrad is linked to Holiday Inn and Sheraton Hotel, where we took a shuttle bus from the latter to China immigration to enter Zhu Hai (珠海商场) ->a good bargain place for fashion and latest…",50
"If you've decided to visit Macau, Conrad, Macau is probably one of the top choices. It's located in a huge complex consisted of two casinos run by Sands. There's a bridge linking the complex to Venetian or you can walk over. There are free shuttles from the hotel to everywhere. Conrad is one of the best hotel in the area, and is,  in my opinion, the best one of the three hotels in the complex.  I stay at this hotel regularly, and its internet connection is fast and reliable, and that would be very important to travelers who would need it for work during the stay. Anyways, expect more and you will get more than you expect.",50
"Conrad Macau provided us a wonderful weekend, their professional team, and attention to details, make me feel impressed and being a VIP Guest. Will definitely come back again.  The location of Conrad Macau is perfect, Venetian Macau is just opposite to it, easy access to conference, entertainment, and shopping. With the facilities of Shuttle Bus, sightseeing Macau is just too easy and conveient.",50
"We stayed at the Conrad as part of a package with Rolling Stones tickets.  It was good value and the suite was super, a huge room, 1.5 baths, very comfortable.  Although they offer a Nespresso coffee machine, the mini bar was a bit lame, with no wine or hard alchohol.  Especially frustrating when room service could not deliver a bottle of wine in less than 20 minutes and the bar downstairs was packed.  The hotel was very quiet, even though it was busy.  They offer fun extras like a rubber duck for the bath and a teddy bear at night.  I had a pretty good facial at the spa and they were able to accomodate me without much lead time.  Check in was smooth, although the lobby is very sterile.  The staff were also very helpful with suggestions for dinner reservations.  It's in a good…",40
"We stayed at this hotel July of last year. The room is spacious, comfortable, and we were happy with the nespresso machine. We were greeted on arrival by one of their managers/receptionists who is from our country. As I understand it,   they make sure their guests are greeted by someone from their own country or someone who speaks their language.  Check in and check out is a breeze. the hotel/ sands cotai  has a covered, air conditioned walkway going to the four seasons/venetian which makes going around these areas easier especially since it kept raining the time we were there.   I particularly appreciated their pillow menu. They have a snore no more pillow which my partner used. It was really effective! we had several quiet nights of sleep there.   Thanks to Cathy at the…",40
I stay here for 1 night. Receptionist very friendly and meet my need. Room was cleanliness and furniture is luxuary for all. But wi-fi in room is charge 160 HKD per24 hrs. it not make sense if you are stay in 5Star hotel like Conrad.But anyway i love in this hotel and will tell another one to choose Conrad when they be here.,50
"This place is beautiful, enormous, with lovely big rooms, and lovely bathrooms!   The breakfast was amazing. Once all the other Cotai strip casinos are finished, this place will be incredible! The staff are fabulous and very attentive. I would have loved to have had more time to enjoy the pools and health centre.",50
"The hotel rooms are spacious and comfortable, but there are nearby is still under construction , it is affecting environment , then breakfast in general, do not eat it anyway. Room not provided free wifi only in lobby if has this service in room be better.",30
"Outstanding centrally located property, with excellent view from our higher floor room, especially during the night. Spacious, nicely done room. Hotel staff was really  over enthusiastic customer focused to help you for virtually every thing - from sight-seeing suggestion to shopping suggestion. As it was Christmas time, the decoration was just awesome. Great experience.",50
"I normally stayed at Four Seasons Hotel Macau before Conrad Hotel Macau opened in 2013, now my new Macau address is Conrad Macau after 4 stays, my personal opinion it is the best especially treating the Hilton Honors Diamond members.     Their executive lounge ""was"" the best in the business before they shut down last year for remodeling, can't wait for the reopening later this year and hope it is about the same.",50
"My husband and I were lucky to stay at this magnificent hotel for 4 nights last week! The hotel rooms were amazing, the bed comfy and the bath so relaxing! At night the view was amazing looking out at all the other casinos lit up!  In reception there is a lovely bar with reasonably priced drinks and a good slection of food. The staff here were lovely and very patient with us - we were often there with up to 6 couples all needing to pay seperate nothing was a drama for them!  We did have have an issue with the toilet blocking a number of times - having said this the issue was always resolved within 10minutes and we were compinsated with free internet for the inconvnience so we really can't complain!!!",50
"Great service and amenities.  Rooms were 5 star quality.  Business travel but prices seemed reasonable.  Highly attentive staff, all spoke english very well (a few words in mandarin goes a very long way in getting an extra smile), the staff were very outgoing.",50

"My wife and I spent two nights here during our trip to Hong Kong. We had reserved well in advance and were contacted by Nicole, the Guest Relations Manager, about a week prior to arrival. Nicole gave us some advice on the best travel options from Hong Kong to Macau. As she suggested, we took the Cotai Water Jet and arrived at the Taipa ferry terminal and easily found the bus to the hotel, which is part of the Sands Cotai Central development. The hotel complex is new, about two years old. At check-in, we were met by Kajana, another Guest Relations Manager who told us about all of the Diamond member benefits at the Conrad. We were upgraded to a wonderful suite. Kajana escorted us to the room and gave us the tour (it was big enough to need a tour!). Our room had an excellent view…",50
"My gf and i stayed for 4 days, the room, food and staff were excellent. I travel the world on business and for pleasure and highly recommend this hotel. If you have the opportuity stay at the Conrad and take time out to see the River Dance show.. It is a nice compliment to the Conrad and within walking distance.",50
"Booked a king room and also a suite. Placed both on the same floor and pretty much right across. Suite 822 and room 819. Rooms are very clean and suite is massive. Travelled with a 11 month old and also my parents. From check in until check out everything was wonderful, smooth and polite staff. Concierge was amazingly helpful satisfying quite a few of our requests promptly.  During check in they took everyone's ID and noticed we had a child with us. They asked whom would be in each room. They used the info very wisely. We checked in feb 10th. My dad's birthday is February 20th. After settling in and then went around to explore and eventually had dinner at the buffet. Upon our return my dad's room had a birthday cake waiting for him saying happy early birthday...wow so…",50
"Hotel Conrad in Macau is a really nice hotel. Rooms are clean, big, contain everything one needs for their stay. Unlike beds in many other hotels, bed at Conrad was very comfortable. Staff was very professional and very helpful, especially the concierge. All in all, nothing to complain about.",50
"I never had met the worst treatment by the Conrad Macau Hotel receptionist "" Shaylee"" before. I always go travel and have written serval positive reviews. I hesitated for some days to decide writing this review. Firstly, I had made a reservation for Conrad Macau Hotel three months ago before stayed on 31/1/2014 to 2/2/2014 for 3 days.  When I checked in, I needed spending some time for negotiating with the receptionist ""Shaylee"" for insisting asked to write my husband's name. In booking list I mentioned two people to stay. But, from Shaylee's attitude made me felt more like a criminal rather than a welcome guest. Secondly, we still spending time to negotiate for the complimentary preferential (see photo). Thirdly, we got into the room (3801), when we saw the window view was…",20
I have stayed at this hotel for 5 nights to attend a company event. The junior suite room is pretty large and super clean. Bathroom is confortable and clean as well. What you got is every thing you need from a 5 star hotel. Service is very accurate and friendly . No complains at all.,50
"The first impression of this hotel was very nice.  It was not crowded even during the Christmas peak season.  The reception area was elegant and the staff members were helpful.  The check-in was seamless and the receptionist led me to the way to the lift lobby.  The room was sizeable with two queen beds.  A small lovely teddy bear was sitting on the tea table as a surprise welcoming gift.  There was a cute rubber ducky swimming in the bath tub.  Complimentary Nespresso was another highlight of the room.  After a short trip to the old town of Macau, a bunch of macarons were waiting for us to cheer up.  The service was excellent and so “Conrad”!  The buffet lunch in the hotel restaurant was great.  The price was reasonable with plenty of choices.  Although the restaurant was big,…",50
"Its a beautiful hotel. And new.  Everything is clean and shiny.  Very close to Venetian, u can shop till u drop.  The only downside was that executive  lounge was under construction at the time, so we didnt get to use it.  But the breakfast buffet was the best.  Even better than some of Vegas hotels.  If u want to experience 5 star hotel at a price of 3 star, go visit Macau!",40
"Spent a night in Conrad Macau with my girlfriend for celebrating our first Valentine's day. The hotel is beautiful and room is so nice. We dined in the room and the room service is terrific, the food is way better than my expectation! Staff are well trained and they always ask what they can do for you once you stepped in the reception area. Especially thanks to Francois for giving us the wonderful service when we are about to leave the hotel.  Have stayed in several hotels in Macau before and i do think Conrad Macau is the best in the city, definitely will return again and wish we can get an upgrade a suite upgrade next time.",50
"Conrad Macao,  The food & Service, staff attitude, kindness are all good. Except one staff, gahee. I recommand to avoid this staff.  If you meet her, your trip will be destroyed.  If you want to take a rest quietly, You can choose a Conrad better than Sheraton.",40
"Excellent stay experience with Conrad much better than I expected with this price, staff are very nice, room is clean and quite, the complimentary jar of candy shows the attention to details this hotel has. Recommended",50
"Thanks very much Conrad Macau for the wonderful trip to Macau in last January.  Staffs were kind, helpful, and the importantly, works fast.  Although I expected the lobby to be less crowded, the entire experience in Conrad was unforgettable.   The buffet restaurant at Grand Orbit was a fabulous experience.",50
"Splendid!  Correspondence of the staff is satisfactory very much fantastically.  It is that a restroom has been clogged up to be disappointing. . . However, I coped with such a problem immediately. Including a friend, I stayed at five rooms this time, but a similar problem seemed to occur in other rooms. I expect the improvement of facilities.",50
"Sands cotai central has 3 hotel chains, one is Conrad cotai central. from outside, 3 huge buildings are seen. one is Conrad, the other two are Sheraton, During I was staying at conrad, I can't locate where the holiday inn was. is there another small building?  from January 30th thru Feb 2nd, we enjoyed cotai area by walk or free shuttle bus, and really had fun at the swimming pool. the pool size was not very large but the water temperature was warm to swim. on the first day of my stay, Conrad macao surprised me with Great chocolate Birthday Cake and 3 sweet macalon. it was really memorable one.",40
"It was 2nd time to stay in this hotel already. They provide better service than the 1st time. Specially Check-in period, the receptionist able to provide his best services to me although he is new in hotel and the Chef Concierge also come in invite us to help us to plan our trip. It was a great experience! thx!!",40
"The hotel is placed at Taipa, the island next to the ""old city Makau"". The shuttel buses form the ferry terminal and the old town are provided, the taxi is ca 50 - 75 MOP and it takes ca 15 minutes to reach St Pauls catedra from the hotel. The hotel keeps the Conrad standard no doubts, however the surrending is a bit too much ""Las Vegas"" = read ""kitsch, plastic style"". The Cotai strip consists of 3 hotels, Conrad included, the Venatian is opposite, the shopping galery is in the lobby, a lot of tourists from China due to the  Chineeses New Year celebrations. All in all good stay if only gamling and short old part of the city visit is planned.",40
"This hotel is beautiful, the rooms as most in Macau are very nice. I can not get over the service standards whilst travelling through Asia. They are always asking questions about what they can do for you. Location is good as its near the golf course Macau CC and Caesars.",50
"We spent 5 nights at the Macau Conrad and are so pleased we chose this resort. It was the most amazing treatment we have ever had.  We are Diamond members so are used to the niceties of Hilton upgrades and executive lounges but this was on a different level. The upgraded suite was fabulous and had everything we could have asked for.  It was kept in an immaculate condition for us too. The free afternoon tea rivaled London hotels and the excellent buffet breakfast in the Grand Orbit kept us going all day. A huge thank you to Nathan Kung who was so attentive,  Kajana, Linda, Chris and everyone else in their teams. Everyone from the porter to the Manager seemed to know our names. The most impressive stay we've had anywhere.",50
"The suites at Conrad Macau are great value for money you really are getting more for your money they are very plush with wonderful views our suite had a lounge dining and media room the condition of the rooms are excellent the only negative as far as the room is concerned is there were plumbing issues , the staff are very good and accommodating there are many restaurants here as there is a shopping mall attached and an easy walk across a bridge to the Venetian which is a bigger shopping mall , I'm not a big fan of Macau it's all gambling and high end shopping , unless your a gambler 2 to 3 days is enough also there is a wander flu restaurant called Bene great Italian food hope this helps .",40
"My family just celebrated Chinese New Year in Macau this year.  We checked in the hotel on the New Year's Eve with booking of 2 rooms for my brother's family and myself with my parents.  My brother and I are diamond members, our rooms were upgraded to suites, which were spacious and elegantly decorated.  Member benefits include complimentary afternoon tea sets, evening cocktails and breakfasts.  We were lucky the afternoon tea was served in buffet style as a CNY special, instead of the rack.  There was a good selection of food and desserts to choose from, including Beijing duck, turnip cakes, macaron etc.  Evening cocktails were served from 6pm at the lobby lounge as well, they catered mostly drinks only.  On New Year''s Day, we were assigned to take breakfast at Grand Orbit…",50
"Nice hotel with  great rooms. Separate bath and walk in shower lots of nice toiletries. Pool area was a let down though. It had about four small, funny shaped pools half of which were heated and the other half cold. They could quite easily have had one large pool so that you could at least swim if you wanted. It is a nice spot to chill out though with the spa baths,cabanas etc. The gym was pretty good with very friendly staff. Lots of people mention Edmund the chief concierge. He is from Singapore and has worked for many years at the Four Seasons and Raffles Hotels in Singapore. I found him to be excellent and the Conrad are lucky to have him. This was my first time in Macau but I really enjoyed it. In a couple of years they will have completed several more hotels on the Cotai…",40
"Excellent stayed at Conrad Macau, especially thanked for Mr. Edmund Tan & Mr. Chandran Morgan wonderful service. They are the best leader and all his staff well trained very helpful and knowledgeable. Definitely we will return again, they prepared a lovely cake for my celebration of my pre-wedding trip.",50
"We were holidaying in HK for 3 weeks, so I thought we could do a nice getaway to change the scenery by booking 3 nights at the Conrad Macao. I'd originally booked the cheapest room available for $1400HKD on the internet, seeing I thought we would be doing a lot of sight seeing and didn't need such a lush room. Upon check-in, and with the presentation of my husband and my own HHonours Diamond cards, we were suddenly triple upgraded to their King Premier Suite - Sweet!! The room was absolutely unbelievable, we had over 1600sqft of living area - and just as well, as out of the 3 days we were there, 2 days were drizzling and we weren't too keen to venture out to sight see - we'd much prefer relaxing in the comfort and luxury of our hotel!  The room opened up to a beautiful hallway,…",50
"We stayed here as part of our honeymoon, so after a short ferry trip from Hong Kong and a free transfer from the temporary Cotai ferry terminal (we travelled with Cotai Jet), we were delighted to be shown to our wonderful room on the 23rd floor.We had a great view over the Venetian and to Macua itself in the distance.  From our arrival the staff were incredible - from the first people to greet us at the door, to the reception staff, and later on the restaurant, fitness suite and poolside staff, all were impeccably polite, anticipated your every need, and had excellent attitudes. Our room was lovely, we enjoyed the touches such as the luxury robes and slippers, nespresso machines, and extensive toiletries in the massive bathroom. The hotel delivered a 'happy honeymoon' cake and…",50
The junior sweet room in Conrad hotel was fantastic. It's wide and comfortable. And the service was very good. Every staffs were kind and they responded well to my need. I'll stay here again if I have a chance to come to Macau.,50
"I must say it really was a great pleasure to stay at the Conrad Macau this week, I am in the hospitality business and have been fortunate enough to not only work, but stay in many great Hotels worldwide. I can honestly say this Hotel tops the list. From the initial warm welcome from the doorman to the super-efficient attentive and friendly check in at reception, a kind greeting from all team members who make eye contact as you walk down the palatial corridors on the finest of carpets to the luxurious comfort of the room. Then there is the great choice of dining options available, from which I particularly enjoyed the sumptuous choices at the Grand Orbit Buffet.   Truly a flagship Hotel from the Hilton brand / Sands Venetian, thank you so much to all your team members, all of…",50
"First time to Macao and first time stayed in Conrad and felt so pampered with the highest quality of service from the first minute we checked in till we checked out.  Mr Edmund, the concierge, has been helpful with all information weeks before we arrived there and greeted us personally when we checked in. He always made sure that my parents (in their 70s) and well taken care of and he wrote us a personalized notes every morning to give us ideas how to spend the day!  The rooms were amazing as it should be as a Conrad hotel but the service that made it our stay there unforgettable.  Just one small note for an area of improvement that the room service was quite slow when we asked for more tea, pillows and sewing kit maybe because the numbers of rooms and guess.  Keep up the good…",50
"Prior to arrival, I contacted the customer service, Nathan, of Conrad regarding my preference. Upon arrival all request was met and much more, his upgraded me to the suite on the 26th floor with the amazing city view. Nathan introduced the hotel facilities to us clearly and patiently. He accompanied us to the hotel room which is huge and clean. The facilities are well-equipped. We loved the inside bathtub. The customer service is just unbeatable!!   I am sure if you want very high quality of service from staff that are very friendly, then Conrad is the place you should stay !! I am sure I will stay in Conrad again in the near future !",50
"We were upgraded to one the largest deluxe suite with an awesome view of the strip. Hotel is luxurious and elegant, but what really set Conrad apart is the service level. The staff and concierge were exceptional to make our stay perfect. The head concierge, Mr. Edmond Tan and his team are extremely helpful in answering our many what/when/how.",50
"Macau is mainly about shopping and gambling (for the Chinese coming from the mainland). It's all bling, bling. Conrad is appropriately low key compared the most extremely lound casino hotels. Thwe rooms are big and standard Conrad quality. Condad's could fair better if they'd skip that bed backslash that's long outdated. For a casino hotel this a true 5-star property.",50
"Cannot fault this hotel, from check-in to check-out the whole experience was a joy.  The staff were all very attentive and not too over powering as experienced with other hotels. The room was amazing, would have been happy to just stay and relax in the room. Pool and gym quiet and very clean and inviting. Breakfast was perfect, selection amazing!! If you are ever in macau, this should be your first choice, stay away from Venitian, too many people to fight with!!",50
"Apart from the super luxurious bedding and room amenities, what made this hotel stand out was the exceptional courtesy and attention lavished upon their guests from check-in to concierge and room service! Will make this my permanent tourist address if I visit Macau again.",50
"I have booked this hotel & arrived on 22 Dec 2013 at 2:30pm. The receptionist told me to come back after 3pm & the room should be ready & my luggage will be directly put in my room. However, when I came back at 3:30pm. The receptionist told me that the room was still not yet ready & would change another room to me. Also I needed to wait for another 15min for the luggage. Though I finally got another room after spending some time negotiating with the receptionist, this was totally unacceptable for such a 5-star hotel.  Once the hotel promised the customer, she should tried her best to make it done!",30
"Our stay here was amazing, every aspect of our suite and the attention to detail was at the highest levels of hospitality. The staff was professional and well trained to meet any request during our stay. Great hotel I look forward to returning in the future.",50
"As Hilton Diamond member we were upgraded to a suite.  The room was huge and gorgeous, with beautiful marble and fantastic views.  We had a great time on strip and also in central Macau.  Will be back to this intriguing part of the world!!  If I had to search for a negative, it would be that we had to search for roll and rock dancing.  An employee at Hard Rock told us that Macau is not into dancing, like Hong Kong.    Anyway, the hotel is first class!!!!!!",50
"Stayed here for a convention and got an upgrade to a suite room from the convention package. The check in process was so good we felt like VIPs. We simply left our luggage at the bellboy station, and they were swiftly delivered ahead of us to our room. The room itself was so beautifully appointed we felt like we never wanted to leave. And the concierge staff were exceptionally patient and helpful when we needed help with our return flights and ferry transfer arrangement. One of the staff even took the time to walk with us to show where we could take the shuttle bus to the port.   The only downside about the hotel is that it's quite some distance away from the downtown/historical Macau. If you want to visit St. Paul's Ruin, you will need to take a taxi, or take the low-cost…",50
"Took the ferry over directly from  Chek Lap Kok  for 3 nights in Macau at this incredible property. Complimentary shuttle service from ferry terminal was a breeze. We were upgraded to one the largest deluxe suite I have ever stayed in with an awesome view of the strip. State of the art room with super comfortable beds. The executive lounge is a divided section in the main lounge on the ground floor with excellent afternoon tea and pre dinner drinks and hors d'oeuvre options. Breakfast buffet had everything you could think of and want along with a a good selection of brunch options for non breakfast lovers. Overall beautiful, luxurious hotel, but  what really set this Conrad apart from others is their service level. The staff and concierge went above and beyond to make our stay…",50
"I spent two nights with my daugthers and the room is great (spacious), clean and tidy. Also, they sent xmas dessert (macaron) and hand made card to my daugthers. Really a great experience at conrad macao. Surely the top rated hotel in macao I ever stayed!",50
"Hotel reception could not recognise my booking number provided by Booking.com, I give them my name and they were able to find it, but they claim that room rate should be higher than what the confirmation I got, more than double?! after insisting they accept the confirmed rate but only after I send them the same confirmation email that I have??!!  There was a plastic duck at bathroom that spread very strong ""plastic"" smell around ... you can notice some black stains on room flloor, at the end I rated this hotel as very good because of many many positive things, but not excellent :-)",40
We were staying at a beautiful huge room. One of the most luxurious we've ever been in. View was nice. Bar downstairs offered some delicious and great looking treats. The buffet style breakfast is excellent.,50
"Visited Macau with friends from Hong Kong and spent 3 magnificent days at the hotel. Service levels were exemplary and all staff were genuinely helpful and extremely efficient but the one thing that distinguished the Conrad from other luxury hotels I've stayed, was their attention to detail. For instance in general ' chit chat' at the reception when registering, my friend's wife mentioned we were all going out to celebrate her birthday on the next evening.... Lo and behold the next evening, a small birthday cake arrived in the room with one candle and lighter to light it with. It's that attention to detail that distinguishes the excellent from the very good. Well done Conrad !",50
We stayed here for two nights for new year. The deluxe suite was very spacious and nice but we paid for about hkd4500 per night and breakfast was not even included. It is also very annoying the check in time is 3pm while check out is at 11am. They should at least adjust to meet the 2pm check in and 12pm check out standard. One other annoying thing is wifi is not included if you are getting a standard room. Ours was included but the signal was not very good and stable. The food court here has some choices but to be honest the food is very so so...limited selections and bad quality when compared to Galaxy and Venetian. The gaming areas are relatively small I'd say. Overall it is a beautiful hotel but not worth of the price. ,40
Stayed for almost a week with my family.  The hotel staff were really personable and accommodating; though the same could not be said for the restaurant staff.  Internet is not included in the price which was a bit of a letdown.,40
"If you are in the service industry or have client facing employees, take a trip here to observe service at it's finest!  From the moment we entered the driveway, to the time we checked out, the service was flawless!  I have stayed in some of the most exclusive hotels and the service experience at the Conrad, Macao is top rate.  I would like to especially thank Edmond, the Chief Concierge and. Pedro and Nathan at the front desk for the excellent service and help.  If you are in Macao, don't think of staying anywhere else!",50
"Extremely nice hotel. Was upgraded to a large suite on arrival.  No complaints about the hotel at all, though they could probably use an indoor pool given the smog in Macao.  The breakfast buffet provided to HHonors Elites was excellent. Service throughout was excellent. The bed was comfy, the bathroom large and spacious. Not really much to say other than you won't be disappointed whatever your expectations. The only reason I don't give it an excellent rating is due to the smog which is more a Macao issue than a Conrad issue.",40
"Im not picky about hotels, as long as they have a standard in service and quality. The conrad provided a decent experience, for my and my husband. It wasn't the type where they go to the extra level to make you happy, but it wasn't bad either. A straight forward hotel. Only problem if any was there was no free wifi in the room. The best thing was, the Venetian was located not far away.",40
"We arrived in Macao really late 2 AM. The hotel is in the same build/complex as Holiday Inn and one other hotel. The check in was fast and received a free upgrade into one of the suite. The suite is just WOW. It is larger than my 2 bedroom apartment.  The Good: - The Suite is big, really big: Living Room (TV, sofa...etc), Dinning area (Table that seats at least 6), Two work station one in living room and one in bed room, entertainment room (TV, couch and more), The bed room triple the size of regular hotel room. - 1 Guest Washroom (sick and toilet)  - Shower, very large tub, double sink and more.  - Very Clean - Safe: security downstairs checking everyone room key 24 hours a day - Next to a good size mall (in the same building), across the street from city of dream and Venetian…",50
"We stayed at the Conrad Macau on the 20 Dec 2013 for 1 night and we were very disappointed of this ""5 star"" hotel.  Firstly, there was no free wifi inside the room, I found it ridiculous in this day and age. Secondly, there was no electrical outlet in the bathroom, so we had to blow dry our hair in the corridor of the room by using their not so hot hairdryer. (It probably took me 20 min for my medium-long hair). Thirdly, we found hair in both of our plates during breakfast and we were having a different dishes.  Lastly, when we checked out on the 21 Dec 2013.  I found out that I left all my cosmetics inside the hotel when I got home (Hong Kong). I called the hotel right away and they said they found it and will ask the Lost & Found department to contact me.  No one contacted me…",10
"It's my 4th stay at this hotel and it has not failed me, even once. From the moment I stepped into Conrad Macao, the experience was already great. As compared to the majestic Venetian across the road, the air in this hotel is definitely fresher. It is also conveniently connected to The Venetian with a sheltered overheard walkway.  Staff in the hotel are better groomed and they served guests with sincerity. The smiles are more genuine as compared to some other hotels that I've stayed before.  Paweena, who did the reservation for me, made the procedure swift and simple and always tried her best to accede to all requests. She even arranged for a cake to be delivered to my room for my mum's birthday when we went there in June this year.  Prem, who handled the checkin for me for this…",50
"The hotel is still relatively new.  I like the room layout, the bed, pillows and large bathroom.  I also like the fact that the bathroom has two sinks and overhead shower.  It is quite rare to find hotel bathrooms with two sinks which I believe its helpful for couples.  The mattress is also firm enough and the large pillows were very comfortable to lay my head on.  Our room came with free wifi because we had booked online.  The wifi was quite fast.    The hotel is situated next to a mall and within walking distance to many other hotels.  There are many restaurants and food courts adjoining the hotel.  Shopping and eating are conveniently located.  We look forward to staying there again.",40
Really enjoyed this hotel. Great service... Right down to staff asking where we were staying on our return to Hong Kong and writing the address in Chinese for the taxi driver. Easy to get around. Close to the Venetian to see the sights but not having to battle the madness of that site all the time. Rooms comfortable and quiet. Check out the drawer next to the bed for the pillow menu.,50
"I surprised my husband with a weekend get-away in Macao and decided to stay at Conrad Macao since I'm a Hilton Gold member.  The lobby was impressive but that's where the Conrad experience abruptly ended.  The lifts to the rooms were not located in the lobby but rather off to the side, near the mall and not particularly obvious.  There was a ""bouncer"" to make sure you had key cards before you  could enter the lift lobby and his steely glare made me feel more like a criminal rather than a welcomed guest. The decor of the common corridors and rooms were surprisingly sub-par to what I'm used to seeing at Conrad properties.  The carpet and wall-paper leading to our room had clashing patterns and literally made my husband feel seasick walking down to our room. Even though we were…",30
"The location is 8mins drive from airport, quite accessible to other casinos & shopping area (COD, sands cotai central, venetian & four seasons) in cotai strip. Nice clean room with FOC toy bear, candys & duckie, comfort bed but no free wifi while lobby area is free wifi.",30
"Traveling during my daughter's birthday month, thoughtful staff actually prepared her favourite cheese cake when we arrived!  This is a first for I remember hotel staff by name! Amelia, Pameera, Warran, you have been great , we were pampered and really enjoyed our stay to the max!",50
"I have been at many hotels, from Vegas, NYC, Europe, etc.  This was the best stay ever at any hotel, the hotel manager there Paweena is amazing and the best.  Detail oriented, professional and courteous.  Booked 4 rooms for me and my extended family - The whole stay was amazing!!!!  Its a 10 I highly recommend - Hotel is beautiful, close to everything on that side of the island.",50
"Stayed here for the first time at Christmas last year 2012 and was very very pleased. I stayed in a King suite which was MASSIVE comfortable and clean.  Take the complimentary green shuttle buses from the ferries here!  *Clean room, comfortable king bed *Spacious and clean bathroom, features separate shower (none of that standing-in-the-bathtub nonsense) and toilet. The rain shower is massive and can easily fit 6 adults inside! *Bathrooms include high quality amenities and also a step exercise machine! *Complimentary Conrad teddy bears are very cute, I got the silver one! *Features complimentary Conrad Lychee candies! *The breakfast buffet in the Orbit lounge is nice and has a diverse spread of both western and chinese dishes.

"From the time we arrived to the moment we left, it was a time to remember and now a time to savor.  The reception was warm and we were treated like family.  We had booked 4 rooms for a family get-together in Macao and we were given rooms on the same floor with great views of the Venetian and the City of Dreams.  We also got an upgrade to the premium king suite; it was so nice we didn't want to leave.  The rooms were immaculate and the service was excellent.  The rooms were also very quiet (except when the Venetian had their outdoor Christmas events in the early evening that could be heard for kilometers away).  Everyone seemed to know who we were as we were greeted personally by name many times.  The complementary breakfast buffet at the Grand Orbit (in the Sands Cotai Central…",50
"I stayed at the Conrad Cotai Central for 2 nights and had a wonderful time. The service was great, the facilities were exactly what we needed, the location was great, and the room service was outstanding!! The room set up and design was great, just loved everything about our time here (except they could have been a bit more lenient with their check out time - we arrived pretty late at night bc of travel delays, but they still said there was no way we could check out later than noon on our last day). Anyway, the service and everything else were so great that I can overlook that minor disappointment :)",50

"Stayed here for 2 nights in between my visit to HK. We were upgraded to the premium king suite. Room is extremely spacious with a king size bed, living and dining area, entertainment area and a huge bathroom. Room is kept clean. Only grouse is although there are 2 toilets, there is only 1 bathroom. Overall, my family loves the room and will stay here again in future. Location is superb with free shuttle from ferry terminal and a free limo upon return. Plenty of shopping and eateries around. ",50

"That was a awesome night, room is amazing, service is excellent, this is my anniversary trip, they upgraded my room and gifted us a very nice tiramisu. Even thought we are so full after buffet. We still finish the cake, it taste is amazing. Thanks I'm looking forward,to my second anniversary at Conrad already, ",50
Had a lovely time at the Conrad.  One of the better fitness centres I've been to for a hotel.  No complaints at all.  Especially enjoyed the comfy robes and the pillow selection!  The teddy bear was a nice touch!,50
"Stayed here one night for business. The hotel room is very spacious.  I requested a non-smoking room but somehow when I got my room which is on the non-smoking floor, I can tell that someone had smoked there before, so I asked for a room change which they are more than happy to do so.  After the swapped, the room is clean and without any hint of smoking. Breakfast selection is good, but the restaurant is bit of a walk from the hotel and it's out inside the mall. Buffet lunch is also has excellence selection, but it seems strange that the breads are placed close to the dessert which location in the central roundabout of the restaurant, we ordered the tea and coffee which took ages to arrive and the coffee tasted awful (been sitting in the pot for too long) The shuttle to the…",50
"Prior booking this hotel months ago to coincide with my folks' Golden Anniversary, my sibling and I were deciding between luxury, accessibility and quaint quietness for our 4-nights stay, with a total of 8-travelling family members. I'm glad to say we found all these elements in Conrad Macau. On first night, and just as we have requested, an Anniversary Cake was wheeled to our room, to the delights of my nieces. We lament the fact that there was no lift to connect from the hotel to the Bridge which linked it to the Venetian, especially for my wheel-chaired bound mother. Initially finding the lift to the second level was like a walk in the maze, and the staff did not seem to know where the connecting lift was. Throughout our stay, we found that the overseas staff, Filipino staff…",50
"I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough! My wife and I stayed at Conrad Macau at the end of November for three nights having taken advantage of a Cotai Strip web special. As HHonors Gold members, this also made the decision an easy one. We were not disappointed!! The hotel was excellent all round, however, the service we experienced was absolutely outstanding! Prior to arrival, we were contacted by guest relations to arrange a complimentary limo service. From the moment we met the hotel representative at the ferry, we were made to feel like VIP guests! On arrival at the hotel, we were whisked straight to our room for check-in avoiding the usual check-in procedure altogether. A special thank you to Paweena (Guest Relations Manager) who made our stay extra special and provided…",50
"A big thanks to the staff of the Conrad for a wonderful one night stay, and a great weekend away from Hong Kong.   The service exceeded expectations. We were upgraded to an even bigger suite than the one we had booked, which may be par for the course in the big hotels when they're not full, but it's still appreciated nonetheless.  The staff looked after my 2 year old daughter with a special teddy bear gift in the room gift and some macaroons which were rapidly consumed and resulted in infant hyperactivity.   The service from Edmund Tan, the chief concierge both before and during the stay was exceptional. Wonderful communication and information before the visit and the quality of the service continued throughout. He's a gem.  Was in Macau for the marathon and Edmund even had some…",50

"I stayed overnight with my folks. We were greeted by friend staff at check-in who ensure all our requests were attended to.    The hotel is well connected with lots of malls and restaurants nearby.  The only short-coming is that free shuttle to other areas of Macau is locate a street away from the hotel.    The breakfast spread was good but quality is not to the Conrad,HK standard.    Room is spacious with good range of coffee to choose.  Ventilation in the bathroom is a little poor hence one may need to keep the bathroom door open to ""clear the air"".",40
"Stay at Conrad Macau 14th to 17th November. Paid approximately $550~600 SGD for a Night, stayed here for a total of 3 nights. Given the Price I've paid as a Starwood Preferred member, SADLY enough, wifi and breakfast was not included. Wifi Usage has a separate charge. To my astonishment, Conrad Macau pre-charged me in case of damages, almost 300 Singapore Dollars. Conrad Macao is the First ever hotel that I ever know of, who would pre charge customers for damages or whatever reason they have. Room is big and spacious, bed is comfortable. Toilet is considerably SMALL compared to Sheraton and Venetian Macao. Conrad Toilet Bowl Flushing System is the worst I've had encountered in a 5 star hotel. I had to CALL for room service to request for make up room. Shuttle Bus to airport only…",20

Was able to dine at the Venetican and charge my bill to the room to rack up Hilton Honor points.  Too bad the executive lounge is being renovated until January 2014.  Excellent buffent at the Grand Orbit(Went crazy with the Dim Sum).  The room is very big getting both separate living room and bedroom.  Don't need to take cab to downtown Macau or the Macau ferry(Outer and Taipa) since the location provided shuttle bus services. Finally, had good massage at the Bodhi Spa",50
"My experience does not support Conrad Macao Cotai Central being rated #1 of 82 hotel by Tripadvisors.  I was misled this time and regret making the wrong decision.   Conrad Macao Cotai shares the same Sands Cotai Central Complex with Sheraton and Holiday Inn.  The rates of the other two are lower.  So why pay more to stay in Conrad and use the same casinos, restaurants, and other facilities of the same complex, which as a whole is already showing age.  My wife and I booked online and paid Can$685 to stay 2 nights in Conrad, for a room with city view and a king size bed with breakfast included.  We are certainly not pleased to have to pay extra for Wi-Fi.    Now we are kicking ourselves for not choosing Galaxy Hotel which for around the same price would give us a suite of much…",30

The helpfulness of the staff is allowing us to use bowls, forks and spoons as there are not much Halal restaurant in Macau left us with no problem since we have ready-to-eat food from home, and we can eat them using the bowls provided. Mr. Chandran of Bell and Concierge service not only help us to find good place to visit, how to get there, and even introducing us to a new Halal restaurant. After that, he also helped us finding a spot where we can perform our prayers.",50

The rooms are spacious and amazing, the service is out of this world, every single hotel staff, went out of their way to make the quick stay amazing.  I would thoroughly recommend this hotel.",50
Thank you for making my first Macau visit unforgettable. The best service ever. Special thanks to all staffs especially Poy Paweena for the making me feel like a princess. The staff kept impressed me with excellent service since day one. They really deserve ranked #1 hotel in Macau.,50

"Sometimes you get a hotel experience that takes the breath away. And our stay at the Conrad in Macau did just that.   Arriving at their very plush and luxurious reception, we were told that we'd been upgraded to a suite by the friendly staff. A suite? I'm sure it was actually bigger than our flat back in London!  For our few days in the territory, we had a giant lounge, a vast bedroom, a glorious bathroom and countless facilities - all with stunning views from the Cotai Strip to old Macau. What more could one ask for?  I'm not rating this hotel five stars on the basis of the upgrade either. The staff were uniformly excellent, whether on reception, in the bars or at concierge; the comfort level was excellent; the location easily accessible thanks to the hotel bus service and the…",50

The front desk went extra mile to show you to your room and answer all your questions along the way. We were also given complimentary internet and late check-out. Service staff at the pool and fitness centre are also extremely friendly, always keen and eager to assist. Nice touches and gestures such as the complimentary Conrad teddy bear placed on your bed during turn down service in the evening,  Lychee candies in a small jar nicely tied up with Conrad ribbon placed on the coffee table in the room during check-in and Conrad rubber ducky in the bathroom adds wonderful touches to our stay experience…",50

"Lovely staff, good location, beautiful room, nice breakfast from in-room dining. But a charge for wifi?! Come on Conrad, catch up. We enjoyed our stay and it's good to be next to city of dreams, hard rock and Venetian. But the lack of wifi will probably mean we go elsewhere next time, in this day and age, and in that calibre of hotel, wifi should be a given. Hope Conrad sort it out soon.",30
"I stayed at the Conrad Macau with my partner for three nights in November 2013. There are three hotels that are part of the same complex - The Holiday Inn, The Conrad and The Sheraton - each has its own entrance, lobby and check-in, but there are some shared facilities that are all part of an eating/entertainment/shopping centre complex at the centre.  The hotel gave us a free upgrade upon arrival to a suite. We were pretty gobsmacked as it was probably bigger than our flat in London: there was a large living/dining room with a separate guest cloakroom - then a large bedroom with en suite bathroom. It was all extremely luxurious - marble bathroom with separate shower and large bath, a bathroom TV, two sinks etc.   The bed was enormous and very comfy. We also had an exceptional…",50
"This place is part of the sands complex on cotai part of Macau. Next to city of dreams and Venetian so location is brilliant, both are an easy walk.  The Conrad is well maintained and a very good hotel. Unfortunately no five star due to lack or FREE wifi, not even wired free internet! Even though free wifi is not widespread in Asia most places are beginning to see the benefits in terms of guest satisfaction.  The servicE from the staff was fabulous, from concierge who helped book tickets for show to housekeeping and room service. But unfortunately the wifi thing will probably mean I look for alternatives the next time I visit, which is a shame given the remainder of what the hotel has to offer. ",40
"We had an amazing experience at the Conrad Macao and we cannot wait to come back. We are diamond so were upgraded when we got there and had supurb service throughout our stay. The rooms are incredibly spacious, especially the suites (2 bathrooms is also a plus). The breakfast you get with diamond is also great because it is the only hotel I have been at where you can it for in room dining (Hilton, please consider this for all Conrad properties). Also, the location is great. I read a lot of reviews that said to say on the Macao side but we really liked the Cotai side given that the Venetian is right across the street, there are many restaurants and it is a short taxi ride to the Macao island (10min). The pool and gym area are also the best of any Hilton property I have stayed in.…",50
"I traveled with family, 2 small kids for a 2 night’s getaway from HK. I have chosen the hotel based on reviews and got a 50% discount deal. Room: we had a suite with city view (highly recommend city view!) and it was huge, impressive in size. Bed was good, a little short for my taste but wide though. Separate toilet for living and shower separate in master + bathtub. My only complaint would be related to air-con remote, need light to change settings during night but the led from screen however is a light in itself and affects the sleep for those with small kids at least. Swimming pool: just visited shortly during a light rain and even if not heated water was not cold either but however had to bail due to weather. Pools are small but are few Jacuzzis also. Meals: did not had…",50
"Fantastic hotel. Five star.... (SIX star) excellent facilities.. perfect ambiance. cozy, i would like to go back here very soon. i will refer Conrad to all my friends and family. All staff are very helpful",50
"Spent my birthday at Conrad Macao. It was most memorable and the staff of Conrad made it extra special. Even before my arrival, Guest relations Officer Mr Nathan Kung emailed me, and when he realised I will be spending my birthday in Conrad, he organised a complimentary Cake and special bathroom amenities to be made available to me upon check in. Even though I arrived early at 11am, and Nathan was on his off day, his colleague Miss Poy Paweena Waraha, met me in person at check in and welcomed me to Conrad. A room was also prepared with the requested amenities. Best part, I was upgraded to a Suite room, all complimentary! This is what I call service!  I have stayed in both CIty of Dreams and Galaxy recently, but none can match the friendly and prompt service Conrad staff provided…",50
"The hotel has at an excellent location.  The room is well decorated and the bed is comfortable.  The shower is excellent.  However, the noise outside could be clearly heard.  The drapes are good quality but you cannot define day or night if you have the curtains drawn.  The breakfast is not great.  The afternoon tea is cheap but no good, not worth to try.  A food court is conveniently located between the 3 hotels.  A McDonald is on the ground floor.  Due to the location of the hotel you can easily grab food around.",40
"If you want a true 5 stars services Miss.Poy (Paweena), a Thai pretty guest  relation manager will be the best person to look for. But if you ever need the best photographer and warm hearted gentleman then ask for Mr.Chandra, duty manager. You will not be disappointed with their pampering and caring services. The best Conrad hotel I ever stayed and if you wanted the opposite services then I would recommend the hotels' services in Singapore.",50
This hotel is indeed a great place to stay. I stay at the Deluxe Room and the room is great and very comfortable. The location of the hotel is fine where it is walking distance to all Cotai attraction.,50
"Four of us stayed in the Conrad in two rooms due to catching a special deal on the room rate and were quite impressed. Its a large and fairly new hotel, but aside from the physical infrastructure its the small attention to service detail that counts. Service is friendly and efficient and very professional as one would expect from a hotel of this stature.  My seven year old daughter was quite chuffed with the 3 colourful macaroons left for her along with her name written in chocolate on a plate on the first night. She was less impressed with the high chair put in there for her – she stated that such chairs are only for babies. But she did like the rubber duck in the bathroom.  The hotel is well built with attention to design and with solid doors and walls. Once inside the room we…",50
"We arrived late in the evening and took the shuttle bus from the ferry terminal to the hotel. Stops right in front of the door. The entrance and lobby is quite impressive, high class. Staff one of the friendliest ever. Our suite the size of which was larger than a typical New York apartment, was meticulously clean, very nicely furnished and came with a lot of unexpected bells and whistles. The bathroom featured double marble sinks, a huge soaking tub with a flatscreen built into the wall. Toilet and walk in shower were separate. The bedroom came with a kingsize bed and a fantastic view. It had a huge flat screen as did the living room/dining/office combo. Additionally there was a little study where one could retreat for extra quiet with another flatscreen. We unanimously coin…",50
"well, there are many outstanding hotels in Macau, Cotie area. I've been to many hotels in there, Conrad is one of best hotel in my point of view.   A little problum is 'Internet', which is not free even for suite room guest, but when making reservation via website, you may provide free internet service.",40
"My wife and me stayed one night in the Konrad on 24/25 Oct. It was actually a birthday present flying down from Beijing to see the ""House of Dancing Water"". The overall design is very beautiful and high-end, no doubt. What is truly confusing for first time customers is the overall layout of the place as all is very unconnected - the lobby, the check-in, the elevator and the breakfast buffet restaurant. We didn't like it at all. What bothered us a lot during breakfast was the constant breeze of cold AC air - we changed our table twice, to no avail. They had made sure that airflow will cover the last corner. The breakfast room has no ambience, and feels like a big high-ceiling casino dining room. My major complaint is a tiny little matter that - as you will see - can have huge…",30
"We were extremely happy with our choice of hotel in Macau. It complemented very well our sightseeing and culinary adventures, and it was right in the middle of the casino strip n this newer part of the casino city. We stayed two nights, which was ideal for a night out to watch the water dance, a must for visitors. The theatre was only a short walk away. We were away from the most popular, crowded and possibly, cheaper hotels in the Cotai strip, something worth considering if you want to have some (relative) peace, and ease of getting transport. The room and the service were top class. We had no complaints whatsoever.  The only negative, perhaps, was that breakfast was served in a restaurant shared with another (not an issue really), but it was a short walk away within the same…",50
"Like a slice of high quality Las Vegas in Macau.  Beautuful hotel, high quality fittings, exceptionally helpful staff.  I wish I'd used the gym earlier in my stay - it was excellent! Don't bother with the shopping unless you are loaded...",50
"Stay in Conrad Macao more than 5 times, no one time was disappointed, only have better than the last. Comfortable, luxurious & elegante suit, kind & helpful staff, especially Kajana, excellent arrangment, made our birthday celebrate trip amazing & everything complete. Thank you all! Hope to stay again soon.",50
"The hotel is extremely comfortable and luxurious albeit I find the lobby a bit dimly lit hence not as ""warm"" as I'd like.  The room is of very high quality.  However, if hotel can provide more complimentary water, it would be good since the pharmacies in the area do not sell mineral water and I have to resort to getting water from the casinos most of the time.  Overall, it is an extremely pleasant 3 nights stay.  Thank you Conrad Macao...",40
"Just came back after a 4-night stay in Conrad Macau. Service was exactly what I read and expected - Excellent! From prompt responses to pre-stay queries by Nathan Kung and Herbert Leung, to personalised attention from Chandran Morgan and Edmund Tan during our stay there, it was truly a fabulous stay. Checking  in and out was a breeze and the rooms were lovely and spacious, and equipped with full amenities. Our special request for rooms nearer to the lift lobby were well noted and our old folks  really appreciated the shorter walk. Conrad also provided complimentary wheelchair (upon request).  All these personal touch points from the hotel made our family vacation a great and memorable experience. Truly impressive service and I will definitely stay here for my next visit!",50
"I have travelled a lot and stayed in some nice hotels around the world but this hotel was an absolute stand out. I have never done a review before as I’m usually straight back into my busy life at home but this hotel was so good I just had to write this review. We stayed there for 2 nights a few weeks ago. From the moment we arrived we were impressed. The front door was opened for us and we walked into the most beautiful shiny marble foyer, the air was scented with a lovely smell and there was the most extravagant flower display in the middle of the shiny marble foyer. The staff couldn’t do enough for us and the service was impeccable. The beds and pillows are the best I have ever slept on in any hotel and that made it very easy to have a good nights’ sleep. The buffet…",50
We had a fabulous stay at Conrad Macau.  The staff were very attentive to our needs we could not have wished to stay at a better hotel.  If we return to Macau we will definately revisit Conrad Macau.  The hotel is attached to a really large beautiful shopping mall.  Everywhere was spotlessly clean.  We were extremely happy to have chosen Conrad.,50
"Having read great reviews and received recommendations about Conrad Macau, I booked a connecting suite and room for a 3-night stay in Macau in October 2013 with high expectations. Really, Conrad Macau lives up and exceeds my expectations totally with excellent services I experienced from each and every Conrad staff throughout my entire stay.  My Conrad experience begins a week before I checked-in when I received a personalized email from Mr Herbert Leung from the Concierge team and he was so helpful to arrange for restaurant reservations even to the extent of trying to call O Santos several times when it was closed to arrange for my dinner reservation.  At check-in, Prem was so helpful to bring us to our suite and explain in detail the facilities in the suite. A surprised…",50
"Stayed here in the suite last week for a special occasion  Came across a couple of small issues which were addressed to the management . Once taken up by the super friendly GM , Mr. Troy and his team. We were pleased felt the true hospitality and why CONRAD is where it is today.   Would stay here again for sure",50
"I have stayed at the Conrad Macau two times now, once in April and the middle of October.  Both times I was contacted before my arrival by staff to ensure that my stay would be as I wanted.  This is one of the very few hotels I have experienced where I am in communication with someone before I arrive.  And the hotel knows what ferry I am coming in on and is waiting for my check-in !  This hotel is fantastic.  I travel all over the world and rate this hotel in the top category.  It is practically brand new.  The staff is the best part.  Friendly, helpful, willing to please.  Very impressive they remember my name after the first day and upon a second stay.  The service is top notch and breakfast in The Orbit is not to be missed.  The gym is large and spacious.  The pools are a…",50
"Booked two adjoining rooms on 4th floor.  Unfortunately, it was directly facing another hotel (sheraton?) which had continuous (very loud) music till nearly 2am during both days of my stay.  Music was so loud you could actually hear every word of the songs.  Extremely unhelpful when trying to get young children to settle down.  Furthermore, on the dat i was checking out the flush on the toilet decided to breakdown resulting in overflooding of the bathroom.  Bad to worse!  Complained on check-out, Supervisor provided with name card so next time he will ensure i get a better room.  However, it is extremely unlikely that I will be returning to the Conrad.... ",30
"I have been to Macau a few times but this is the first time for us to stay at the Conrad Cotai Hotel.   We were welcomed at the Ferry terminal and were escorted courteously by the staff to the shuttle bus.  Our luggages were  loaded and upon arrival at the hotel, the porter was waiting to pick up our bags.  We booked 2 rooms and were able to get 1 room as soon as we checked in. Rafael, the reception supervisor was very helpful and even showed us around to give us an idea of where everything was located.  We had a wonderful lunch at the Dynasty restaurant and when I went back to reception pick up the keys to the second room, I was informed by Rafael that since the room that we booked wasn't ready yet, he will upgrade us so that we can get our room keys asap.  I was impressed by…",50
I was taken to Macao to visit my brother for my 50 the birthday We stayed 4 nights really clean stylish deluxe king size room only thing was the bar fridge did not get drinks cold the breakfast restaurant was very full of food from all aspects I recommend you all stay here it was fantastic,50
These guys really know how to take care of HHonor Diamond members. Upgraded us to a wonderful Suite.  Easy check-in. Concierge was very helpful in directions.  There's a huge shopping complex connects 3 hotels together.  A big spread for breakfasy at yhe Grand Orbit  ,50

"I spent 2 nights at Conrad Macao Hotel, with mini-concert watching and Macau Tower sight seeing to celebrate my xxth birthday in Oct 2013.  Conrad Macao recognised me being a re-visited hotel guest, warmly greeted me upon arrival, provided me a splendid and well thought birthday surprise during my Tea time at their lounge.  The staff at Conrad Macao are all friendly, well-trained, caring, cheerful and resourceful.    To enjoy a relaxing & enjoyable Macau trip, you may need to differentiate Conrad Macao from the other 2 hotels which are also situated in Cotai Strip Complex.  Conrad Macao provided a more tranquil, relaxing, spacious environment & atmosphere to its guests.  You may need to spend a little more versus the other 2 hotels' room rates, but that is absolutely worthy and…",40
The hotel has a very good location in Cotai Macau. The hotel has provided very good service to the customers. The room has provided all the facilities we need. The mattress and pillows are very comfortable and make the stay very enjoyable.,50
"We chose Conrad in Taipa for a quick getaway as everything in Hong Kong is overpriced and congested.  We took advantage of a buy one get one free offer to have a break during weekdays to ""do nothing"" in a relaxed environment.  Totally enjoyed the luxurious fittings, nice separate bath and shower.  Appreciated the free wi fi to stay connected with the rest of the world.  It was fast once you are on for all the gadgets we brought.  Hotel staff is extremely friendly.  Was impressed by different nationalities of reception staff.  The pool complex is comprised of small size pools.  Forget about lap swimming.  Just enjoyed the jacuzzi.  The changing room was neat clean and very convenient.  Like the little spin dryer for drying your swimwear. Staff around the pool is very helpful too.",40
"I think this is the best luxury and new hilton conrad in asia. Of course conrad macao close to airport and ferry terminal. as you know you can use free shuttle bus. Whatever you lookford feel good more than imagine. Every hotel staffs are very kindness. And If you stay 2~3 nights, they can remember your face and name. So I felt it so friendly. And the concierige sevice was so specilist. and if you not good at communication in english. Your country's native speaker of the conrad will help you.Don't worry about that. So I booked again in Jan 2014.  I'll Strongly recommend to my friends and co-workers as  a excellent hotel in macao & hongkong.",50
"I was at a conference in Taipei Taiwan, & decided to fly to Macau with wife for 3 days & nights. Used a free nights certificate & points from Hilton Honors (Gold card) for 2 nights. I was pleasantly surprised by a free upgrade to a suite on the 25 th floor, with a great view. Then they gave free buffet breakfast at Grand Orbit restaurant (also a great place for service & food). The guest relations person (Shirley He) escorted us to the room, and asked if anything else we needed. My wife asked where is good place to tour & shop in Macau, Shirley then came back with maps & tour books for us. The bed was so comfortable, room was clean & quiet. Love the place. I would definitely recommend this place to all, and will not hesitate to stay here again. Still so much of Macau I haven't…",50

Upon check in, we're assisted by the manager on duty and he did everything beyond expectation, asked everything that we need and even walked us to our room.  The room is big and everything is top notch, with a king bed, a sofa, LCD, office desk, bath tub, shower. Cannot complain of anything  This hotel is part of Cotai Central where they have 2 other hotels (Holiday Inn & Sheraton), mall and casinos.

Nicole arranged a ""Honeymoon Cake"" to be delivered to our room upon arrival, and Warren made sue we had everything we needed, and helped us with information about the hotel, the city, what to do and how to get around. Great few days in Macau! Thanks so much!",50

It was the first time for all of us at the Conrad and it was awesome... the great staff everywhere from the moment one arrives to the departure, especially Mr Chandran Morgan. He went all out to make sure we were well looked after. The rooms with the spectacular views of the City of Dreams were beautifully furnished and  well thought out. After a busy day sightseeing ...a wonderful  place to come home to. Will we come back?...in a heartbeat!! Thank you so much for a most memorable stay.",50
"I think great staff always make or break any property, and this is where the Conrad Macao really shines. I've stayed here a few times since it first opened, and the hotel staff have always impressed. I also tell all my friends to stay here when they visit Macau, and all of them have gone away wanting to come back.   First, this is a fairly large property with a significant number of rooms. Yet, you get staff whom you've met maybe once or twice and they are still able to remember you by name without any prompting. That's something you see only at small boutique luxury hotels, but somehow, the Conrad Macao is able to replicate that on a much bigger scale.   Many thanks (again) especially to Nicole Lee, who made sure our stay went as planned. We were celebrating a birthday, and she…",50
"Booked a party of 3 rooms for a family vacation. Mum and I are Gold HHonors so both our rooms got upgraded to a nice suite, and our friend's room was upgraded as well. The suites are huge and overlooked the City of Dreams. While the lobby area (which joins 3 hotels in Cotai Sands) was confusing to navigate at first, help from the Guest Relations people were readily available. Everyone from the boys holding the door open to you, to the extremely helpful and very accommodating concierge, to the front desk people were faultless. Breakfast was extensive and even came with a carving station (baked ham!).   Used the spa for a massage on my first night there. It was excellent.  We planned to celebrate the birthday of one member of our group, and Conrad arranged for a cake.  If I have…",50
"I am normally not a person that hands out superlatives like ""outstanding"" or ""fantastic"" but this property is worthy of those terms.   The suite I was given at the Conrad was simply spectacular.  Beautiful furnishings, comfortable bed, jacuzzi and separate large shower, and awesome view were just some of the great things about the room.   What was especially great was the staff and their proactive manner of thinking of things before I even asked.   Guest relations called me and asked me if I had my return trip back to HK completed yet.   I had not and they transferred me to the Concierge.  Ana was a great help and was so patient, even when the airlines made things a bit difficult for her.   The breakfast buffet was superb and the gym facilities very luxurious.   My only mild…",50
"Spent 3 nights at the Conrad and had a great experience. From the pre arrival email from Nicole to check out, the time spent at the Conrad was excellent. Personal escort to the room was a nice touch also. Being HHonors Gold we were upgraded to a Deluxe Suite which was simply huge. Magnificent. Breakfast at the Grand Orbit was quite varied and of good quality.  Being only 18 months old, the hotel is in excellent condition. Cotai strip is the place to be. Don't bother anywhere else.  The hotel is part of a bigger complex which which which includes Holiday Inn and Sheraton and has access to loads of shops. My only gripe would be that they closed the executive lounge in favour of another gaming lounge. Surely there are enough already? I am told a new one is due to open by March. All…",40
"I stopped it to the Conrad Macao for 3 days on the back end of a very long business trip. Thought I would hop down to Macao to check out the sights before leaving from Hong Kong. Let me start by saying that it pays to be a Hilton Honours Member, it comes with great benefits! I was lucky enough to be upgraded to a city view king suite and let me tell you it is the size a small house!! It came with a few extras as well including late check out and a bunch of other goodies. The professionalism of the staff is mind blowing.... they are in a class of their own.   I have travelled the world for both business and pleasure and do prefer to stay and the Hilton hotel when I can. The Conrad staff would have to be in the top 2 best I have experienced, the other was a 5 star resort in the…",50
We recently had five nights at Conrad Macao. On arrival we were upgraded and our two young girls were treated to a welcome platter of sweets and biscuits and a personalised card. They also placed a Playstation in the room which proved a real winner. The teddy bear and rubber bath duck were well received. Service is first class - staff are friendly and accommodating. We spent some time around the pool with our girls - special thanks to Shirley and James who were very attentive and demonstrated exceptional customer service. A trip into St Paul's Ruin's both during the day and evening is worth it. A taxi only costs approximately $65 to $80 (Macau) one way depending on traffic. The science museum is also well worth a visit especially if you have children. I would definitely…,50
"I was typing up a different review and realized I hadn't done one for the Conrad which is the standard to which I now hold all hotels.  I stayed here on business November 2012 and no other hotel I have stayed at since can compare.  The rooms are palatial and extremely well maintained.  There is a pillow menu and the bathroom was incredible!  The hotel lobby and surrounding lounge areas were busy but not crowded.  We walked through the Venetian and what a difference, it was pandemonium where as the Conrad was quiet and serene almost.  The desk staff were very helpful and gave us plenty of information when we were ready to venture forth.  As english was our only language they ensured we were well prepared with translated cheat sheets to get us into town and back again with no…",50
"Hotel is so beautiful, service staff is great. Nothing to fault. Best of all, it's away from the bustle of the mainland tour groups which they would stay across the road. Guests at Conrad are better ""behaved"" as there were more Hong Kongers, foreigners and less mainland people.",50
"The Conrad is wedged right between the Holiday Inn and the Sheraton, so all three hotels share a mall, casinos and restaurants. There is even a food court here for those who want to sample an array of different Asian cuisine. There is also a bridge to cross to the Venetian.  Rooms at the Conrad are spacious, and amenities are aplenty. The health club was excellent, with lots of gym equipment, and a Jacuzzi and sauna were also available.  Service at the hotel was on point. My two (relatively minor) gripes however, was check-in was painfully slow in terms of having to queue up in a single line. But staff were friendly, and an express checkout service was offered. The pools are also mainly for relaxing, and not ones to really do laps in.  Overall, one of the best on Cotai.",50
"Stayed here for a family holiday in August 2013. Everything is perfect here and this property should be everyone's first choice in macau. Right from the pre arrival email, enquiring about the travelling party, all arrangements were made accordingly. We were upgraded to a suite (Hhonors Gold member) and baby amenities already pre arranged in the suite. They even provided sterilizer and milk bottle warmer in the room. We were escorted to the room by a front desk staff. Suite was modern and excellent. All the rooms and suites are equipped with a Nespresso Machine which was great for me, being an avid fan of Nespresso. Breakfast for superb.

"The Conrad is the most expensive of the three options at Cotai Central, and you can receive almost the same quality of room at the Sheraton or Holiday Inn. Note that I said almost - there is a difference.  In several ways, I was not the typical guest at the Conrad. It's not just because of skin color. Cotai Central is very popular with tourists from mainland China and Taiwan; at least 90% of the guests were East Asian. Despite English being the third or fourth language in Macau, I received excellent service at check-in and check-out, including baggage storage on my last day. More unusually, I stayed at Conrad while on a business trip, working in old Macau. Most guests visit on vacation. Cotai Central was very, very quiet at 8 AM when I left for work, and was much busier one…",50
"Excellent service throughout the stay, wonderful room(bed) and breakfast. It's a whole lot better than most hotels in Macau. Just 2 minor issues:  1) Missing an Executive lounge. This should be the first Conrad I stayed without an executive lounge. It's not about food or drink, but a private area where you can chat with one or two close friends. The Sheraton Executive lounge next door is a good example. Maybe turning parts of the meeting area to a Lounge?  2) Need free supply of bottled water. While it's a nice gesture to have 2 bottles of Free Evian in the room, it's not really what us needed. The casino downstairs offer free house-brand bottled water anyway, the hotel can simply supply those for the guests without limit.",50
"Our family enjoyed very much our stay there. Both kids loved the chocolate cookie plates and my mom was happy to receive the complimentary birthday cake and card from your hotel. She really enjoyed the jacuzzi at the swimming pool.  Beside, the suite is lovely and great place for family gathering.  All rooms are big and comfortable too.",50
"Great hotel, fresh and new - beautiful rooms - an excellent spa - nice pool and facilities.  The hotel is a perfect location - across from the Venetian and near as much night life as you would want.  The only issue was the English Level of the staff, but they spoke good Mandarin and were helpful, as much as they could be, I had to ask for a manager each time I called the front desk.  The hotel restaurants were so-so, but there were plenty of great restaurants within a short walk, inside the complex, so this wasn't an issue.  The shopping near by is also impressive.  All in all a good experience.",50
"The Conrad Macau continues to blow me away.  I stayed during the first few weeks the hotel was open - before the grand opening.  Not all facilities were finished at that time (notably, the spa) but i found the staff and service to be so incredible that i could not wait to return - which i did earlier this month.    I worked in the travel industry for 20 years and have stayed in hundreds of hotels.  By far, this hotel is my all time favorite for so many reasons.  The rooms are incredible!!!  Absolute luxury in every facet.  Well planned layout with modern amenities - ipad/iphone charger with speaker system, lots of easily accessible outlets.  Separate temperature controls for each room.

He is extremely helpful and assisted us to a fast hassle free check in.  This is not the first time we visit Macao. I must say that Conrad Macao had impressed us greatly with their warm and high level of service unmatched by other hotels we had stayed in Macau. The room is maintained very clean throughout our stay. The bed is super comfortable. Perhaps the only setback is that the hotel does not provide free Wifi for room guest. Free Wifi connection are only available in the Hotel lobby. Frankly, many other hotels are providing free room Wifi to their room guests.

"Just few days ago been in Macao. The city itself is actually nothing special, but hotels are fabulous. As a Diamond I got the suite, which was enormous: living room, media room, larga bathroom, two toilets, bedroom, 3 TVs, etc... Service was great, kind front desk. Only con is that there was no executive lounge ( under construction?), you get afternoon drinks in the lobby lounge... Would reccommend that hotel deffinitely - havent tried the pool though :)",50
"I booked Conrad Cotai Central for my 1st trip to Macau, in conjunction with my wedding anniversary. The service from the hotel is exemplary. The hotel contacted me even before my trip (Mr Edmund Tan, Chef Concierge), to find out details of my trip and how he can service me better. To be honest, this is the first time I experience such service from a hotel (I stayed in many 5* hotels but never get this before). I informed him that it is my wedding anniversary and he immediately offered to send a cake to my room as a surprise for my wife (I requested for choco cake as it is my wife's favorite and he duly obliged).  Edmund came to say hi to me when I was checking in. He had arranged for me to stay in a high floor (37th) as a good gesture for my anniversary. The choco cake was sent…",50

The Dreamworks Experience was a lot of fun for the children who got the opportunity to pose for photos and meet their fav characters. The Shoppes at Sand Cotai have an amazing kids store called the Kids Cavern which was definitely a hit with the kids. In addition, Conrad/Sands Cotai is walking distance from the Venetian so it was v quick for us to take the covered/airconditioned Sky Bridge across to see the Dinosaur show. Would highly recommend the Conrad as the staff & service were excellent, the rooms spacious.

"Spent 2 nights in Macao Cotai Strip. Upon arrival, the staff were there to help with the bags and usher us to the front desk.  We got upgraded to a 100sqm suite.  One word for me to describe the room - opulent.  From the silky bathroom sandals (His in black and Hers in magenta) to the bathrobes (HKD650 to purchase) to the setting in the room - opulent.  Even the Conrad bear comes in beige-gold and is made from satin-like material.  The view was fantastic as we got to see the Venetian hotel and its lagoon.  We also enjoyed the night lights from the surrounding hotels.  The suite comes with 3 TVs - 1 in the living room, 1 for the bedroom and 1 for the bath-tub.  Nespresso machine but only with 3 capsule types. The front desk staff were really friendly and helpful.  They sent up a…",50
All good. Staff very well trained and accomodating (beyond my expectations). Price a bit too high. All other stuff being comparable to other hotels in the area. Loved the bathroom amenities. With a discounted price will really consider staying much more often.,40
"This is band new hotel in coati, Macau. Good location, staff as well as the lobby lounge. They provide free shuttle bus to and from the ferry pier but they do not have shuttle bus to and form macau down town. Also, the breakfast room is little far and towards around 10 mins walking. I little bit upset that they do not have executive lounge as I hold the gold membership.",50
I recently spent 4 nights at The Conrad Macao and was very impressed. The hotel is first class and the service even better.  The service felt genuine and personalized and I was made to feel really welcome. Without being overbearing they identified my needs and really made my trip special.  The hotel is in a great location directly connected to The Venetian and a couple of minutes walk to City of Dreams.,50
"Stayed at Conrad 1-6 Sept and the service was beyond excellent especially for such a big hotel.  The staff at Grand Orbit dining for breakfast was very nice especially a young man JACK, he was friendly and efficient and anticipated customers' needs and most hardworking.  Kajana was also very helpful in ensuring everything went well.  The room was spacious and the housekeeping maintenance is good and everything still looks brand new even though hotel is more than a year old.  Highly recommend the hotel although most hotels in Macao are very nice, I think Conrad gives a personal touch.  It is a pity they do not have a club floor!",50
"When I check in from the port. It was raining, I was carrying a large suitcase . Female staff she wore the uniform ( the hotel joint two other and Conrd). I said when I check in to the Conrd hotel . And help me to carry the luggage. However, she refused to have said no, to my request. Male staff who was also nearby did not help at all. And if I know that the shuttle bus is (to carry a human) service minimum, reject any further. I would have selected another transfers. It was a response that I do not think the hotel service.",30
"Great stay for a king deluxe room... Nespresso machine, smart TV with bill view, comfy bath robe, choices of pillows, wireless internet if book direct online.... Best credit is to Chandran Morgan front desk manager of great service ",50
"We stayed one night at the Conrad as a wrap up to a great Hong Kong trip.   Our stay in Macau began by catching the complimentary shuttle to the hotel, where the driver was asleep at the wheel and didn't get out to help anyone with putting their luggage under the bus.  When we got to the hotel, the lobby was lack-luster and having stayed at a wonderful (and slightly cheaper 5star hotel) in Hong Kong I was a bit disappointed.  The staff were not as attentive as in Hong Kong with us having to ask for our bags to be sent up to the room ( I just assumed this was normal practise in a 5 start hotel).  Our booking was for a ""pool view"" room which ended up being a ""building view"" as our room looked directly into a neighbouring hotel with zero view of anything but windows.  The room is…",30
"I stayed there for a weekend. We had a junior suite. It was just amazing. The rooms are spacious. we had nespresso machine, Bathtub, shower, walkthrough closet and an amazing view to Hard Rock hotel and Venetian. Once you enter the people are so helpfull to navigate you wherever you wanna go. Very luxurious entrence and the distances are not that big as in some other hotels.",50
"This Hotel is a top notch. Design, Location, services, staff and rooms space, everything is high class and perfect.  Taking into consideration the price is very convenient and you feel like you are in the middle of action, all malls and Casino's is just an Elevator away. Highly recommended and sure i will always stay in if i came back to Macau someday.",50
"I was in Macau for one night before moving onto Hong Kong the following day and wanted to as much of the place as possible.   On arrival at the hotel the service was truly exceptional.  Usually I expect average, slightly monotonous service from large chain hotels but this time I was gladly surprised.  The greeting was warm and friendly.  I'm not a big gambler so decided to see what Macau had to offer and Ana on the concierge desk produced a fantastic walking guide (delivered to my door within 15 minutes of me getting into the room) of the historic part of Macau which was fantastic - Thank-you!!  She also recommended good locations to eat on the first night which I looked into.  The check-in and check-out team overall were all very good.   The rooms were very spacious and…",50
"Before I went to Macao for the first time, I asked my friends living there to recommend a hotel that is new, luxurious, convenient and not over the top expensive. Three of the gave me various recommendations each but this was the common one they all mentioned, so I gave it a try.  I was so glad I chose this one once I landed. Macau has two sides: the original older side and the newer Cotai side, the two sides are 20 min drive apart connected by a few long bridges. I will pick Cotai side each and every time I come to Macau in the future.   For me, Conrad covers everything you need: 1) Shortest drive to airport - you can literally see it from the airport next to the Venetian  2) Shortest walking distance to shopping - luxury and everyday shopping: The Venetian is right next door…",50
"me and my boyfriend were very happy with our short stay last weekends. Undoubtedly, there are many 5 stars resorts hotels in Macau, however, there are many recommendations from my friends and also in the TripAdvisor. So why not try it!?  It was very convenience to travel around in Macau for taking the free shuttle. We took only 20 mins from terminal to Conrad. The FO staff offered a complimentary upgraded to suite for us as my bf's B'day WOW~ then she escorted us to the room and introduce the facilities to us friendly. The room was superb BIG with dining rm, living rm, 2 washrooms, nice amenities , fantastic view... although this actually was a disabled & connecting room, we absolutely satisfied with this special arrangement! While we came back at night, there was a B day cake…",50
"We stayed in March and what a phenominal property and the staff were outstanding.  Working for many years in the hospitality business I realise what mediocre, good and exceptional service is - the staff at Conrad delivered that.  I must also commend Danny Wong (Manager of the Yum Cha restaurant and his team on one of the best experiences I have had in any restaurant  So good, my wife and her family when they came to stay went back for 3 meals.",50
"I was very happy with my previous stay when they first open this property in Macau in 2012. My whole family loved the Conrad executive lounge at the top floor. Quiet and spacious (the largest of all Hilton executive lounges I have ever visited), beautifully appointed and excellent (close to over) service and needless to say, the display and selection of food and beverage items! But one year later, on our 2nd visit to this property, the lounge at the top floor was gone. Instead they ""relocated"" the executive lounge to the noisy lobby bar - right in the middle of all hotel and casino traffic. What a major disappointment and downgrade. On my complaint, the management was apologetic and all. Yet, there is no more reason for us to come back to this hotel in the future.",30
"Everything is fine and good, the breakfast was very good, and the swimming pool was clean and tidy. But no free wifi in room was out of my expectation and please prepare drinks for yourself in room since the drinks is room are extremely expensive.",30
"All 5 of us had a super time at Conrad Macao. Service is always outstanding & professional as they bend over backwards to meet our needs. Edmund Tan, Concierge Head, is so incredibly helpful and insightful in advising us what to do, where to eat, best value for your $, how to get there plus changing to local currency. My 80+ year old father had a bad toothache and Edmund made the dental appointment for us immediately...so smooth and finally pain-free! Thank you Edmund! You are the best and the ultimate professional!  Front desk was great too. Whenever we called front desk, housekeeper, etc. for a request, it was dealt with promptly. It is obvious that the always smiling Conrad staff undergo very stringent training, you have great employee policies in place and management is…",50
"Check in was very efficient, no queue at all. The hotel lobby was very grand, impressive and very clean. The hotel itself was linked by shopping mall and bridges to venetian, so you do not need to step outside at all if its raining. We played in the hotel casino which is shared with Holiday Inn hotel, the casino floor wasn't too busy and the decor was a delight, high ceilings and ornate chandeliers. We were lucky and doubled our money!     The rooms were huge with 2 doubled bed and the bathroom so big that it will comfortably fit 4 adults. It came with complimentary nespresso and fresh milk. The turn down service was also pleasant, they drew the heavy curtains that it seemed as though it was still midnight when it was actually 10am. They also refilled the nespresso we used in…",50
"the friendly staff upgraded me to a nice executive suite. I did not get the suie wi the TV/karaoke room. He even took me to the room and showed me everything.  As a Platinum member, I get the afternoon tea for free.  We get coffee or tea and an array of sandwiches and cakes, total about 18 of them.  It was a $220 value for two people.  I did not go to the happy hour for free drinks. The free brekfast was one of the best.  It was mainly set up for Oriental.  There are egg and omelet cooking stations for non orientals.  It would have cost $118 +10% service charger if I had to pay for each person.  Internet was free for gold and platinum member and it was working fine.  Tip: There are free shuttle to the Pier.  If you like to go downtown Macau, walk to the City of Dreams and take…",50
Our stay with Conrad was for the dancing on water show package and the hotel and show exceeded our expectation. Breakfast was very good for a international style buffet - had everything we wanted to eat and more. We would highly recommend this to couples and families as the whole experience was one of the best hotel experience we had. Hotel rooms and facilities are very good as well only downer is the wifi is not free.,50
"Had an excellent stay at the Conrad in Macau, it's definitely a great experience ! In the Center of the Cotai Strip and perfect to do business and come back to rest in a luxurious setting.  Can only recommend !",50
"We just stay in the hotel just for one night. The room and service was really impress us. We stayed in  deluxe suite, a roomy suite with nice view. The room provide necessary amenities, including a free milk for your coffee or tea. The only drawback is a pool side party at Hard Rock Hotel for whole night. Hot music make us hard to sleep well.I complained the noise to front dest at my checkout, they said I can request a room change to other side of hotel, and apologize for that. Overall, this is a nice hotel to stay with, nice room and friendly service.",40
"The Conrad (Hilton) is a gorgeous hotel that opened in 2012 in the newest replica of the Las Vegas ""strip"" in Taipa - across the bridge from Macau, where many other casinos reside. It is attached to a shopping mall shared with two other hotels and connected by a bridge to even more hotels and shopping. As Vegas replicas go, it is pretty close with seemingly hundreds of high-end stores and expensive restaurants, of course casinos, and pretty much nothing else. Fortunately it is a short distance from Taipa town for at least a taste of the local lifestyle. It is a bit far from Macau, but there are free shuttle buses to go there, or a taxi ride costing around ten bucks US.  The Conrad is stunning and the rooms are spacious, well-designed, comfortable, well appointed and stylish. The…",50
"Conrad Hotel is very safe and comfortable hotel, Location hotel in the center of the city, near to city of dream. In city of dream we can see house of dancing water. Conrad hotel is very clean, friendly service, a great overall this hotel. In here you can gambling in casino. Near from the hotel. In here We intend to stay at this hotel again.",50
"Stayed here for one night for a short getaway. Stayed in a King Deluxe room, with breakfast included. The first thing we noticed when we entered the grand lobby was the sense of calm and the delightful scent wafting through the air. Although reception was very busy with many guests checking in, there were plenty of staff on hand to ensure an orderly process. The staff member who checked us in, Isac, was very friendly and efficient. We were shown to our room by another great staff member, whose name unfortunately escapes me. Luggage was delivered promptly. The room was stunning! The 'Himalayan' theme of the hotel really pleased my tastes. The cherry/plum blossom and bird feature design on the wall behind the TV is so pretty. Other furnishings, such as the curtains, wallpapers and…",50
"We are currently stranded in Macau, due to typhoon Utor having been raised to a level 8 storm. That basically means all transport is cancelled and you are to stay indoors. Although Macau got old quickly (I'm not a gambler nor a huge shopper), I could not think of a better room to be stranded than the suite we were upgraded to. It is over 160 square meters, including a separate media or karaoke room, guest bathroom, dining room, etc etc. The main bathroom is the size of an apartment in Europe. The staff have also been incredibly resourceful and helpful. Kajana from Guest Relations escorted us to our room, and made sure to find us a room for early check-in despite the high occupancy at the hotel. She always had a smile on her face, and thoroughly explained the details of the…",50
"I recently stayed at the Conrad Macau for 3 nights and did a little video review of the hotel grounds and room 2525 -- a 1700 sqft suite!  If you'd like to see what the hotel and room 2525 look like, then check out the video here: http://youtu.be/NutXte_s_m8  This room was truly awesome and I was upgraded to it as a Gold member! Huge living room, media room, and a ridiculously large bathroom.  Highly recommended!  The hotel itself is located in the Cotai Sands Complex which is a complex of three hotels (Holiday Inn, Sheraton, Conrad) that share a common casino/shopping mall/eateries.  The complex was recently completed in 2012 and is located directly across the street from the Venetian and the City of Dreams.  The Conrad provides a free shuttle bus from the Taipa Ferry Terminal.…",50
"The Himalayan theme to this hotel is a nice feature of the main entrance and hotel lobby. Check in was super friendly and we were escorted to an amazing Suite the size of my home with stunning views over the PRD and the Macau skyline. Really nicely furnished in a pretty neutral style, super comfortable bed, great bathroom (shower could take a football team in it). Even a Karaoke room. Great accomodation and great value. Now the walkway has opened to the Four Seasons across the road accessing the shops there is a breeze, and it's a 5 minute 5 walk across the street to the City of Dreams. Really is in the middle of the best that Cotai has to offer. Oh, you can do a bit of gambling there as well.",50
"I just love this hotel.  The staff are outstanding - from check in to check out they were efficient, friendly and couldn't be more helpful.  And... they did it with a smile.   I can't praise this hotel enough and will make it my hotel of choice every time I visit Macau.",50
"I booked a room at a very decent price for a Conrad (about 1000 HKD) and was upgraded to a huge suite as a Hilton Gold member.  Very friendly and pleasant staff during my whole stay.  Great breakfast with both Eastern and Western spreads. Several restaurants in the mall on the ground floors, which were not as great as the Conrad hotel itself.  Direct access to Venetian complex (Casino, etc.)",50
"it was my first visit to Conrad Macao. what I can say in a word is EXCELLENT!! thanks for Chandran and Edmund who make our stay so memorable and happy. Edmund was very helpful before we heading to HK on the next day. Nevertheless, all the staff in the hotel was very friendly and helpful that make us feel very warm. highly recommend if you're visit to Macau.",50
"This is a big hotel with thousands of guests so it was of no surprise to us that we had to queue at times, at check in and for breakfast. However, this said we were very happy with the friendly staff, the room and facilities. Check in wasn't great as although the staff serving us was polite he didn't seem too clued in as to what we should get with our package and I had to ask for several things. The noise in the lobby was so loud at that time I found it hard to hear him. The room was nice, new and clean and we found no fault in it. Breakfast was good but busy and the same can be said about the swimming pools. On the whole we enjoyed our time in the hotel and had a fun lunch at xin and our son enjoyed Qube2. Only thing was we found everywhere so cold and actually had to go and…",50
Great hotel in a great location! Service was good and rooms are big and spacious. Nice amenities in the room huge bathroom. Can be expensive at peak days but reasonably priced during low season or weekdays.Will keep coming back whenever in Macau1,50

Having breakfast in restaurant in form of buffet, have plenty of food, delicious. Room is big and quiet. Its design is fashionable. Room is comfortable.",40
"I know that the Conrad Brand is very good and have stayed in some marvellous hotels but the Conrad Macau has just surpassed all my expectations and counts as one of my most enjoyable stays. I only wish that we could have stayed longer. The welcome from Nicole Lee the guest relations manager and the check in receptionist was one of the best you could wish for and fully recognised our status as HH Diamond. We had spent the last month travelling in the USA and were slightly worse for wear after some of the hotel experiences we had encountered on our trip! Coming back to Asia makes you realise how different the level of service can be and how the hotels here go the extra mile to make your stay an enjoyable experience. Our suite room was superb, more like a luxury appartment....…",50

Ms Waraha made sure that we have everything we need from my friend's beautiful Birthday cake & all the different bath amenties we have requested for! Mr Tan, the chief concierge had been most helpful in making restaurants reservations & recommendations for all the wonderful meals we had. He even went thru lengths & breaths to surprise the birthday's gentleman with a palate of Yummy sweet fresh strawberries & deliciously fabulous whipped cream the best I have ever tasted! The rooms are what U expected from the Conrad Hilton Standard! Big & luxurious!  I have stayed at many 5 stars properties under the Starwood & Hyatt…",50
Our first ever visit to Macau. The staff greeted us right at the reception and welcome cookies for my son were waiting in the room. Very good gesture from Mr Edmund and Mr Morgan Chandran on my birthday by sending cake to our room. Whenever we go to Macau will make sure that we stay in Conrad..,50
"Stayed in Conrad from 30th June to 2nd July. Once we got down the CotaiJet shuttle bus, we were greeted by the friendly staff and led to the lobby for our check in. The lobby smells exceptionally nice and seeing the beautiful bright pink pot of plant in the middle somehow does brightens up one's day. Room was very spacious and clean and bed was comfy too. Went back to our room during one night and found a plate of strawberries, with a hand written greeting card from Chief Concierge - Edmund Tan. Would really liked to thank Edmund for his impeccable service and of assisting us with booking our ferry tixs to HK and also recommending places to go in Macau and HK. It was definitely a memorable stay for us and even as we went HK the next few days, we were still reminiscing about our…",50
"Having seen so many positive reviews about Conrad macau, we decided that we would stay in Conrad for our next trip to Macau. We booked 2 rooms for 3 nights through the Sands online system in end of February to enjoy the special promotion. However, we never got any confirmation from Conrad since we had made the booking. This was weird as we had made several bookings before through the same system and the other hotels would always contact us promptly to confirm the booking and ask if we needed any special arrangements. So this time we needed to call long distance to check with Conrad to see what happened with our booking. It took almost half an hour to sort things out. I had requested that the two rooms (one junior suite and one standard room) should be arranged on the same floor,…",40
"In term of service, this hotel has to be the best we have stayed in. The Conrad has always delivered when it come to service. The previous Conrad stay was in Hong Kong many years back. Free shuttle service from Macau Ferry Terminal and check in at the hotel counter was fast. Counter staff was friendly and efficient. We arrived late and missed our dinner but the counter staff managed to identify the available restaurant and informed us as soon as we reached our room. That was really efficient. Room 2615 was clean, spacious and comfortable and yes, there was an Espresso machine, like all doubletree hotels. Equally spacious bathroom and there was a flatscreen TV there too. A birthday cake was sent to our room on my birthday, July 14th. That was fantastic gesture by the hotel…",50
The Staff are professional welcoming and provide excellent service what a fantastic place...upgraded on arrival to a fabulous suite the best yet....well done the Conrad you certainly provide the wow factor...every little detail is well thought through and the food is excellent...if your going to Macao anytime soon I highly recommend you book into the Conrad you won't be disappointed.....the hospitality is super it truly is an amazing place........even for us veggies lots of fresh options and presentation is outstanding.......try the high tea!!!!!! Wow it's excellent.....,50
"What would i say.... There wasn't really any word that could describe the experience i had perceived from the staffs at conrad macao. Would like to show my sincere appreciation to the front desk staffs for their flawless service. The smile they put on their face doesn't seems to fade away from day to night. I totally felt at home with the warm welcome and services. Mr chandran thank you for the kindess and the joy you brought to me. Ms sojin, thank you for your attentive service. Mr Edmund u did a great job, by arranging a nice location to dine and making me and my fiancee's night a memorable one. The best hotel i had stayed so far. Thank you conrad macau.",50
Definitely a must to visit and stay at Conrad Macao. From the moment our family stepped into the hotel to us checking out - we were well looked after. We have not had such service in other similar hotels. I will especially thank Mr Chandran Morgan for his assistance in preparing the room and recommendations. It definitely takes the stress out from me arranging things for the young kids and the older parents. Worth the visit.,50
"Conrad Macau is really were you'll find yourself a king! From the moment you approach the entrance with 2/3 doorman opening the way for you to the impressive lobby and very nice reception (excellent staff... we, being portuguese, were greeted by a fellow countryman that did our check-in and walked us though the hotel making us feel at home).   The rooms are luxurious with huge bathtub, the best (and stylish) bathrobes and bedroom slippers, a king size bed and wonderful view. Nice touch with the ""honeymoon"" cake and internet access offers! A Nespresso machine also made our delights (ah! the urge for good coffee when abroad).  The place is wonderful with direct access to the Venetian and right next to the City of Dreams/HardRock/Crown! Be advised you'll do a lot of km's of walking…",50
The warmth of the welcoming of the guests left me dumbfounded !!! Hospitality was at it best in Conrad !! The view from the hotel was amazing !!!   If I were to visit Macua one more time Conrad Macao Cotai Central would be the place I would stay :))),50
"It was my first time visiting Macau and took ferry from HK. Super crowded in ferry terminal due to long weekend in HK. We were really tired and just wanted to relax once you reach hotel. And finally I reach Conrad Macau and it was just ""Wow"". I've been to many 5 star hotels but this hotel really amazed me with service. You don't have to wait til your check in day. Because I got an email from concierge and offered me assistance. It was really ...touched!!! And check in was done by very friendly lady, Sojin and Chandran(guest relation manager?) showed me to my room. Just loved everything about Conrad Macau even all their furnitures!  Since we didn't actually plan anything what to do in Macau, we tried what concierge team offered us. Everything was just flawless. : D  Just look for…",50
"The Vegas of the East means that there is a lot of choices for you to stay when you go to Macau.  As part of a ""Group"" of hotels (Holiday Inn, Conrad & Sheraton) they sit across the road from the Venetian (accessible via overhead bridge) and a short walk to the Crown, Hard Rock and Hyatt and most importantly - The House of Dancing Water show.  Having walked through the surrounding hotels, the Conrad is a sea of calm.  Is does not smell like smoke (Holiday Inn) and there is no sound of gaming.  You can therefore choose if you like to go gaming somewhere or get lost underneath the Venetian.  The Room was excellent, as the Strip is still being built, the view is good but mainly looking at construction down the road.  Everything worked, the bed was comfortable and they delivered a…",50
Conrad Macao is almost one of the best hotel in the world.  Everything is great except this hotel does not offer any executive lounge area so people with gold or diamond status are kind of stuck without place to relax.  They only offer 2 small bottles of water per day and they will charge you if you ask more than what is allowed.,50
"I've stayed there only one night, and the only thing I can say is that I wish I could have stayed there much longer!!  I have been upgraded in a suite (gold member), and it was amazingly peaceful and relaxing. It's not fancy nor ""new design something"", it's just as good as a ""home away from home""! I hardly remember sleeping so well, and I agree on what I read previously when someone said that we just cannot go out from the bed! Also, you can convert the sofa into an extra bed for 2 (in a separate room), and the living room is very pleasant, with a nice view of Macau (both from the living room and your room). Their slippers of different colors and size for male and female are very nice, and we bring it back home as a souvenir :)  This being said, what impressed me the most apart…",50

The next day, I lost my mom whom i'm supposed to meet at the hotel lobby. Upon looking at my frantic expression, the front office duty manager, Chandran Morgan, actually help me look through the hotel cctv to see when my mom left the room and even offered to look through the shopping area first and second floor. I am so grateful and touched by the sympathy that they offered. Then after we found my mom, and we left for a sightseeing trip to…",50
"The check in was very smooth with Michael at the front desk, we were arranged to a Premier Suite which made our 2-night trip perfect.  We didn't want to travel too far for food and enjoyed every restaurant we went - Italian dinner at Bene, Peking food at Dynasty (they also have difference cuisine in the menu like Zichuan, Chiuchau and Cantonese).  The best part was they offered a fruit plate with a bowl of dessert soup on the side complimentary to each one of us at the end of our dinner, very nice gesture.  We also tried lunch buffet at the Grand Orbit, wide range of choice with good quality.  Our 7 and 9 year old enjoyed the pool, not the size of the pools so much, but the friendly and helpful staff, thanks to Cristina for the pool games.  Concierge is also very helpful for…",50
"This calm quiet luxury hotel is the most high end part of the trio of the ""Sands Cotai Central"" and connects via the lower floors with the Sheraton and Holiday Inn which have the casinos under them.  There isn't much of a theme compared to the Venetian but it is much more sedate.  The lobby is quiet and smoke free (rare in Macau) with a high end shopping center connecting via bridge to the Four Seaons and Venetian shops.  Dining is a bit too pricey in the restaurants.  The Grand Orbit Buffet was expensive but good.  The room is high end casino plush with a big marble bathroom and good extras.   Only problem when I checked in the ""non smoking room"" smelt strongly of smoke.  They changed it quickly for me.  So don't be afraid to request a change if the there is a smoke smell -…",50
Will definitely stay here again if given the chance. The hotel is near to The Venetian and has lots of choices in the breakfast. I wish though that the internet was provided as complimentary to the guests.,50
"What a fantastic stay we had at the Conrad Macau. The check-in was just fantastic. We arrived by the early flight from Shanghai and had no problem checking in early. You also got to know that the hotel has free shuttle bus from the airport and it's 5 min door to door. The bell boy who showed us to our room was great. He had already asked us if it was our first stay in Macau and as we said yes, he had prepared a customized tour of the old city with all the places to go and an introduction for each of them. I wanted to leave him a tip but he was already gone when I wanted to reach for my wallet.  The room itself is beautiful. The painting on the wall behind the TV is so nice. The bathroom is large with a funny shower system. I think it's also in details that you realise the 5*…",50
"This hotel is the best of the 3 cluster property Sheraton-Holiday Inn-Conrad of the sands group. From their fabulous lobby decor and floral arrangements, the room amenities (love the bath robes and the slippers), to the service rendered by their top notch team, the 2 nights stay left us wanting nothing more. The concierge knowingly made alternative dinner reservations for our group at Antonio in lieu of Fernando's which wouldn't accept reservations, everything was spot in with their guest services team. The turn down bear and rubber duckie with dice in its belly were signature Conrad giveaways to take home the hotel with you. The only thing that i found odd was the extra charges for internet connection in the room. And during the check out, I paid for an umbrella but encountered…",50
"I am just back from this hotel. There is a very glamorous lobby. The check in service is very good and well mannered. Thanks, They can provide a late check out for us. The decoration of the room is splendid. There are complimentary Nespresso coffee, evian water which are very nice. However the weather being very windy which impair our pool experience.",40
"We booked 2 rooms, and being Hilton  gold member we received upgrade to one of the room. The room is huge and opulent (common by Macao hotel standard), but what make this hotel special is the service from their personnels. Every personnel will greet you and make you feel comfortable at home, from front office, housekeeping, swimming pools, restaurants, concierge and  even the lift boy. Special thanks to C.Morgan, K.Sivakumar, Bobby and Nicole. I have seen the review on the Trip Advisor prior to booking rooms in this hotel and have certain expectations, however the service my family received was well beyond and above expectations, clearly a notch above ""common"" 5 stars hotel!",50

Everything in the room was perfect and the bathrobe was very comfortable. The check-in area is actually a separated and quiet space adjacent to the lobby, which is much better than that of Sheraton and Venetian. Breakfast selection was superb although pastry could not be re-heated.",50
"There aren't many places you can get away to if you live in Hong Kong - the easy option will always be Macau which is one hour boat ride away.   I have previously stayed at the old Holiday Inn and The Venetian (twice), but I never had the urge to write a review regarding those two hotels on TripAdvisor; however, our experience at Conrad this weekend was nothing short of amazing and its ""excellent"" review is well-deserved. We arrived late at around 10pm on Friday and was relieved to see that there was no long queue at the reception - we had a long day and all we wanted was to get to our room quick and rest early.  Clark at the reception was extremely helpful and friendly.  We booked a king deluxe room with the summer getaway promotion, and I was joyfully shocked when Clark told…",50
"I found the hotel excellent with very good hospitality and clean rooms. The restraunts were clean and very bgood, staff were courteous and friendly, shopping facilities at the hotel were very good. I will definately reccommend this hotel.",50
"When my time on earth is done, and I'm met at the pearly gates by St Peter to get my heavenly reward, he will check me back into the Conrad Cotai.  At that time, the hotel and staff will only be improved by a choir of heavenly angels singing praises in the promised land.  The staff was exceptional.  The person checking us in escorted us to our room.  The room was very comfortable, with a large bed, large bath tub, and nice shower, marble and chrome throughout.    Before my final meeting with St Peter, I will be spending time on my knees praying for just a few minor changes to these palatial estates.  Oh, St Peter, how great thou art.  Please, oh please, St Peter, extend the hours on the swimming pool past 8:30pm.  I'd love to avail myself of this worldly pleasure, but the great…",50
The excellent service given by the staff made the stay an enjoyable one. Pleasant surprise when we returned in the evening that the room was made up after check-in in the afternoon. Beautiful room. Would definitely stay there again if the rates are reasonable.,50
"The Conrad Cotai is a first class hotel in all aspects. From checking in to departure, it was an amazing experience. The staff was welcoming and extremely helpful with any needs. The rooms are very well appointed and the amenities were great. I cannot say enough about the quality of this hotel.",50
"We stayed at the Conrad Macao for four nights. Our stay was from beginning to end absolutely perfect ! We were upgraded to a deluxe suite. It was the biggest suite we ever stayed at and got a great honeymoon cake. The benefits for Diamond members were great too. Complimentary breakfast in the room or at the restaurant, afternoon tea, and evening cocktails at the lobby lounge. The concierge service was great too ! We were given a map of the hotel, walking routes, a map of Macao, things to do, ... When we told them we would like to go to Disneyland Hong Kong they booked our ferry tickets instantly. We tried room service and it was quick and the food was great. This hotel has outstanding service and is a very nice place to stay at!",50
"Excellent Hotel, Great Service, Superb Room. We went to Macau for a short getaway from my work in China.  As I am a HHonors Gold member we were given a free room upgrade, early check-in/late check-out and complimentary breakfast. The king suite which we were upgraded to was very nice, with dining room, huge bathtub and even a movies room. My partner was totally amazed by the room.   The service is 5 stars as well, with Ms Nicole Lee contacting me via email regarding the check-in timing, and she also assist us with the check-in, showed us the nice room and also explained in details about the room. All the staff we encountered in the hotel was very polite and nice. The room is checked from time to time to see if any item needs to be replenished. I think this is a very nice touch. …",50
"We went to Conrad Macau in June to celebrate my grandma's birthday. Upon arrival, we were greeted by polite staffs, who are all very attentive ALL THE WAY from arrival to checking in to showing us to our room. Wonderfully service !    Rooms are spacious and modern and housekeeping services are excellent as well.   Special thanks to Mr. Chandran Morgan for arranging a small surprise for my grandma and also made the already wonderful experience in Conrad even better !   A truly 5 star experience, not only because of the beautiful hotel, but also because of the excellent services provided by ALL the staffs in the hotel. Thank you very much ! ! !   We will definitely stay in Conrad again when we visit Macau again !  Ms Choong",50
"I visited Macau on 8th June, with absolutely no clue on Conrad, on a suggestion by someone. Now i am a happy person as Conrad is exactly what i wanted on my visit to Macau. Well connected with the Sands Cotai shopping complex and a bridge to Venetian, this was the perfect 5 star hotel ... Rooms excellent, service superb, location ideal, food great, and one of the best shopping complex just a walk down from my room and of course casinos, do i wanted more ... The staff is very helpful and polite, and the hotel is not so crowded as what i discovered at other places. Conrad is Luxury with value for money. I am going to recommend it to all my friends ..",50
"Whilst Macau is for gamblers, if you are wanting to see a new destination, and you choose Macau then stay at the Conrad and enjoy a great experience. Made even better with the best Concierge in the business, Edmund Tan. Edmund goes out of his way to ensure your stay is unforgettable. Thank you Edmund for that extra service that very few hotels offer.",50
"We went to Conrad Macau to celebrate my son's birthday. My son received tons of greetings from the staff once we stepped out of the free shuttle. While we were checking in, people were just so friendly, saying good morning ma'am and happy birthday to my son. Ms.Cathy of Front Desk was just great, she made us feel right at home and that we could approach her anytime. She even escorted us to our room and greeted us everyday. She goes out of her way to make sure all our needs are met. My son felt very special when he received a very yummy chocolate cake coming from Mr. Hamid Naseem (Director Of Operations). I informed him earlier that it was my son's birthday, he also took the time to welcome us. Mr.Waren and Mr.Mark (bellhop) were also very efficient and helpful. Mark personally…",50
"We chose this hotel for a night away as a mini break and an excuse to burn off some expiring frequent flier miles.   The hotel is recently constructed and all the amenities are in perfect condition. The staff are very well drilled in good customer service practices. They are clearly eager to go the extra mile whenever an opportunity arises.   The rooms are large. Much larger than a five star in Hong Kong for the same price. Nespresso machine was complimentary. Pillow gifts were fun (teddy, rubber ducky, boiled lollies) and we took them back for the kids we'd left with a sitter at home. Bed was luxurious. TV a good size. It is quiet in the rooms. The pool is good though we didn't use it. Wifi is not free in the rooms (I think) but we were off grid anyway. Room service meals were…",50
"Amidst the bizarre casino world of the Cotai strip (the reclaimed land that connects the former islands of Coloane and Taipa) is this haven.  Extremely reasonable tariff, loads of very customer-focused staff, very comfortable and well equipped rooms.  It's within walking distance of the Venetian (has to be seen to be believed but surly not somewhere to stay) and the 'City of Dreams' where the Dancing on Water show is performed. Tip - if coming from Hong Kong take the ferry to Taipa rather than Macau.",50
"Stayed here for 2 nights 30 & 31 May, really enjoyed everything about this great hotel/resort, we got the transfer bus from macao ferry terminal & got to hotel very quickly in around 15 minutes, check in was very easy with very nice & helpful staff, we had a deluxe suite with a city veiw worth the little extra room #2220, it was excellent great layout, huge lounge very well fitted out with sofa, huge tv & dining table, the bedroom was huge also with a great bed very comfy, bathroom was brilliant with everything you could wish for, the service we received from everyone at this resort was first class from the bellboys to the waiters in grand orbit thank you, also a quick thank you to the guest relations manager nicole lee she was very nice to us & sent chocolates to our room, the…",50
"Great hotel, service, food and rooms.  I am a diamond member so was upgraded to a Deluxe Suite with a city view. Very big room with 2 toilets and living room with dining area.  Only thing missing is a dedicated Executive lounge for Gold and Diamond members. I have stayed in other Conrad's and these lounges are the perfect place to spend during your free time. Although the Grand Orbit/Lobby Lounge provided is good, it doesn't feel exclusive to Hilton Elite members I hope management will address this issue soon, but otherwise it is one of the best in the Hilton chain.",50
"We stayed in this hotel on 26 and 27 May 2013.  The receptionist, Eric, is very polite and helpful.  We are upgraded to a deluxe suite, room 2110, which has a beautiful view facing Crown and Hard Rock. You can choose the different knids of pillows and the gown is very comfortable.  We buy one at the hotel shop for HK$675 after 10% discount.  You simply apply a member card in the casino then you have discount in shopping in the gift shop and having meals in the restaurant. All the staff members I met in the corridor, swimming pool and the entrance of the lift lobby are very polite.  In the swimming pool, there are chairs and individual shelters with fans on the top.  There are pools with warm water or cool water.  In addition to the room cleaning in the morning, a worker asked us…",50
"Stayed in this hotel for 3 nights.  The hotel is very new.  The room is comfortable.  The lobby area is quiet and exclusive.  This is the hotel to stay in if you want to avoid busloads of tourists at the lobby.  Since it's more exclusive, the check in and check out is quick and efficient.  The hotel staff are well trained and very helpful.  The location is great.  It's just across the road from Venetian and Four Seasons.  It's in between Holiday Inn and Sheraton.  It's walking distance to City of Dreams (to watch House of Dancing Water), Hyatt hotel, Hard Rock hotel and Crown Hotel.  There is a free shuttle bus to and fro airport, so do make use of this great shuttle bus service.  If you want to go to Zhuhai, there is also a free shuttle bus to and fro Zhuhai provided by Conrad…",50
"Stayed there on 26 May 2013 for wedding anniversary celebration. The hotel was very kind to upgrade us to King Deluxe city view on high floor, and gave us a complimentary cake, with a hand-written card from Nicole the relationship manager. We traveled with our 10-month-old daughter, and were very impressed with the baby amenities: milk warmer, milk bottle steamer, baby cot, baby bathtub, even baby slippers, bib, diapers, toiletries, and the plastic thing for you to suck into the socket to protect the baby from electricity! The manager at the check-in counter even gave our daughter a Conrad panda doll :) Room is great and we like the capsule coffee machine. Thumbs up to Ken (the Japanese staff) at the check-in counter was very meticulous. The female staff called for baby cot and…",50
"I stayed here only one night on business, but was completely blown away by the quality of the hotel and its staff. Especially the reception staff and Nicole Lee, Guest Relations Manager, really went up and beyond the call of duty. I was upgraded to a very spacious suite on 22nd floor. Excellent bathroom, very good bed. In the middle of night I woke up to a thunder storm and couldn't get back to sleep. Feeling little peckish, called the room service and received a very good sandwich some 15 minutes later.",50
"We stayed here for just 1 night - it pretty much rained all the time we were in Macau - but that did not spoil our enjoyment. How good can a 5 star hotel be - from the reviews I was expecting it to be good & ready to rate accordingly. It was our baby daughter's first birthday the night we stayed, though the hotel did not know - but must have found out when the staff were asking how old she was. Early evening they delivered a personalized cake & greeting card to the room - which of course was very special to see. Our thanks to the guys from guest relations - who did go above & beyond in terms of service with nothing being too much trouble. They also delivered a full set of baby items along with the cot. Everything from the room to the breakfast buffet is well thought out &…",50
"This is my first time in writing a hotel review as I would like to share my experience in staying@Conrad Macao.  As there are now many 5-star hotels in Macau and the prices are about the same, so I have spent some time in looking at hotel reviews hoping to choose a nice hotel.  And I think I have made the right choice in choosing Conrad. My friend and I stayed in a 2 Queens Deluxe room with city view (looking across were Crown, Hard Rock & Venetian).  Conrad is a great hotel with nice room, nice bathroom, large and cosy bed, Nespresso coffee machine (refillable capsules) and ipod docking station etc.  It was my birthday and my friend has arranged in advance with the hotel for a complimentary birthday cake.  When we checked in, the birhtday cake was already placed on the table…",40
"I recently had an excellent stay at the Conrad Macau Cotai Central hotel. The staff were exceptionally helpful - they even walked my wife and I up from the front desk to the room, and then introduced all of the features in the room.  The concierge went out of their way to schedule a number of reservations for us, and the pool and other facilities were in excellent condition. There is a footbridge across to the Venetian and City of Dreams is across the street; all the typical Cotai shuttle routes are also available.  If you're looking for a quieter, more relaxing place in Cotai than the Venetian / City of Dreams hotels, Conrad is an excellent choice.",50
I was staying in Conrad Macao with my family last year. Service was fantastic in every areas especially from Front Office and room was well decor. My son was so impress with the cute teddy bear and duck that we could take home. We definitely will come back to Conrad Macao again. :),50
"Found the hotel quite accommodating, with early check-in and then, without asking, late check out. Requests to housekeeping and the like were filled promptly and without need for reminder calls.  It was my wife's birthday and hotel was great about providing a birthday cake. All in all very happy with the service.   Room was rather nice, of good size for a family of four. View nothing much to write home about (mostly construction sites) but so it goes.. The 'garden' show of Chinese theme performers is a good touch. Taxis were easy to get, which hadn't been the case in some time (but maybe supply has improved in Macau).  Himalayan theme of lobby seems a bit out of place, but perhaps has to do with original plan for hotel to be a Shangri-La. Heated pools were a nice touch on an…",40
"Too small of the pool, didn't fancy it and didn't even swim! Otherwise, its very convenient on the spot. Facilities are so so. Rooms are good and comfortable. Will stay again for business but not leisure.",40
"A location is good and is convenient for the movement of neighboring hotel circulation and shopping malls. The buffet of the breakfast restaurant is luxurious beyond comparison with other Conrad, and there are many kinds. The breakfast is recommended.",50
"We stayed for 2 nights in a Junior Suite room. The room was spacious, certainly big enough to accomodate 3 of us. It had a separate living room from the bedroom. 2 TVs, an ipod dock (i never figured out how to turn this on though), the usual toiletries, a coffee and tea-making facility. Our room rate included free wifi + a LAN cable. You'd have to confirm with reception though if your room rate includes free internet. We weren't able to try the breakfast as we'd wake at around 10ish in the morning already so it would've been a waste.   Location was good. It's easy to get around Macau though. Shuttle buses are available at many hotels/casinos and there's an abundance of taxis everywhere. Conrad is within easy walking distance to the Four Seasons, Venetian, and City of Dreams. I…",50
"Perhaps the largest we've stayed in. Absolutely the sleekest, most stylish of the big casino hotels. Can't recommend highly enough - and that goes for Edmund Tan, the extraordinarily professional and courteous concierge, as well.",50
"We stayed for one night but should have stayed longer, it's everything and more than what you would expect of a western-style 5 start hotel.  I wont go into the usual things because they were just fantastic, but will highlight some of the experiences we encountered.  Service: we arrived by ferry to Cotai strip.  Once we saw the conrad lady, she greeted us and walked us to their courtesy bus from the pier to the hotel (which is shared with Holiday Inn).  Upon alighting from the bus, another lady greeted us by name, another person took our bags also greeting us by name, and walked us straight to the reception desk.  Check-in area was large and relaxing - big deal in Macao!  Staff greeted us by name, that deserves special mention.  Room:  it is to die for!  Gym: one of the biggest…",50
Very easy to get to from either ferry terminal.  Enjoyed the pool and fitness center.  As a HH Gold member was upgraded to a suite.  Very large with great furnishings.  Great casino action with 3 large casinos with in walking distance,50
"We've stayed in many 5 star hotels over the years and the last week.... This is one of the best,..... Great room....spacious, all the amenities you could ask for....nespresso coffee, iPad/iPhone player, great views, to name but a few... Good service..... Would defiantly recommend if you got to macau...convenient location, and great shuttle to/from ferry...or just use to go to the old town or Grand Prix museum as we did...worth a stay in this crazy town..... Has the potential to be much bigger than Las Vegasin10 yrs...difference is its planned..",50
"Fantastic facility and location, excellent service and very attentive welcoming staff, it was a great experience. Restuarant were top notch, though expensive. Checkin and checkout very easy and no issues. Complex had so much to offer and so close to other complexes. There are connecting free shuttles to other venues and the ferry. Conrad has really got it right here and is absolute luxury, loved it. Only downside is that someone had obviously smoked in our room, due to the odur and the burn holes in the beautiful carpet, this was not that great given we stipulated a non-smoking room.",50
"Stayed during 20-22 April 2013. Took the shuttle bus from the airport. Check-in was smooth, was attended by Elvis. Very polite and smiling man. The staffs were all very professional. Was upgraded to the King Deluxe Suite with a magnificent view of the Cotai strip. The hotel itself was connected to Holiday Inn and Sheraton, across the road was the City of Dreams and The Venetian. Immaculate services. I could stay in my room the whole day. It's worth to give the pillow menu a try.",40
"Stayed here for 3 nights and have nothing but praises for the hotel. The experience starts days before you arrive with a personalised email from the concierge manager Edmund. He really deserves special mention for all that he have done to make guests at Conrad Macao feels welcomed and special.  Upon arrival, everything is ultra smooth & sleek. Service staffs - bell to house-keeping were efficient and polite. The Deluxe Room I stayed in was spacious, clean and new. There was even complimentary strawberries on the 3rd night :)  Definitely highly recommended!  What I like: Everything was great and what you'll expect of a stay in a 5-star hotel  What I dislike: Nothing really.. My only personal complaint is to have adjustable overhead shower head in the standing shower.",50
"This was the 3rd time I stayed at Conrad Macao, it was not easy to find a concierge staff who can speak Cantonese, as I am not fluent to speak and quite weak to listen native English and Mandarin.  One week prior to arrival, I found an eStandBy Upgarde option by paying extra $200++ per night for a Junior Suite. Finally I got the offer at check-in. I saw a handwritten $400++ next to the room rate field on the check-in information form. I felt fine as I was staying for 2 nights.  The Junior Suite was 1.5 times in size of typical Deluxe Room (~850 s.f.). There was a parlor next to the twin bed, which contains a sofa and LCD TV. The environment was even more intimate than Deluxe Suite. The accommodation experience was fine throughout the stay.  At check-out, the concierge staff…",40
"Rooms are spacious filled with wonderful amenities including a jar of handmade candy, teddy bear during turn down service and also a cute rubber duckie. Hotel wasn't crowded like other bigger hotels in Macao. Definitely a good choice to be staying at this hotel.",40
Location is perfect. All the staffs were very polite and helpful. Everything was fantastic! The Concierge was very informative in my enquiries and prepares a list of places for me to visit/do everyday (according to my interests) on their own accord. Superb!,50
"All you expect from a 5-star establishment. Macao has a lot of hotel options but the Conrad will remain one of my top options for my next stay. We have nothing but positive things to say.  Service is personalized and quick from check-in, check-out, room service, etc. They go out of their way to make sure you were comfortable and have everything you need to enjoy your stay from printing out walking tours, booking reservations with print outs of the addresses, and these days it's rare for people to actually remember your names and here they did.   Rooms are well-appointed, beds were comfortable, nice view of the city, even when there was a party going on we couldn't hear a thing in our room. One of our friends staying in a nearby resort was in a higher floor and could still hear…",50
Everything works perfect in this location. The hotel is one of the bests i ever stayed. The accomodations are gorgeous. The view is amazing. The atention with Honnors guests are one of the most impressives i ever had. The shuttle from the Ferry is an excellent service. Allways on time. And the best of all: is close to the best entertainament of Macao. Macao=Conrad Macao. Miguel Petry.,50

"This is my first experience with Conrad Hotel. We were traveling with my 1 year old son and my wife is still breast feeding, so we take great care in finding a hotel that could provide us with a family friendly environment and also a freezer facility to help freeze the extra milk so that we could carry back Malaysia after our stay.  We started of rough. We arrived at Macau about 6.30pm, I recalled clicked the 'Arrange transport' option when I booked the hotel but no one were there to pick us up. We catch a hotel shutter bus to get to the hotel. Upon arrival the bus stopped between Conrad & Holiday Inn, nobody approach us for our luggage. We have to drag it while carrying our son, literally infront of Conrad only helps arrive. The check in were fast, we were lead to our room by a…",40
"I stayed at the Conrad in late April 2013 for 2 nights. It was a weekend stay and I was pleasantly surprised that check in was quick and orderly. We got our rooms promptly at 3pm but I noticed some guests still had to wait for their rooms. The rooms were big and comfortable. I love the bed and the extra touches such as free teddy bear, a rubber ducky, and some candies. The hotel provides complimentary evian water for guests. The only grouse I had was wifi is chargable unless you book the rooms direct with hotel on their website. I had stayed at the Grand Hyatt, The Venetian and Bayan Tree at Cotai and not once did they charge guests for wifi in the room. Anyway I booked my room through the hotel and so I had free wifi.  The gym is spacious with lots of equipment but no view and…",40
"I have never made a comment about any hotels before but The Conrad Macao Cotai really deserves one. I will preface this with the fact that I am a Diamond member and this hotel takes that serious (not all hotels do).  I have stayed in 5 star hotels around the world and do so on a regular basis. I am typically a Marriot person (also a platinum member there) and the JW Marriott in Hong Kong is one of my favorite hotels anywhere for the level of professional service they offer from start to finish.   The Conrad in Macau arguably could be considered just a little bit better. They do all the normal stuff you would expect a 5 star hotel to do... meet you at the taxi drop off, turn downs, etc.. etc.. but they do it with so much professionalism and friendly attitude (even if they do not…",50
"This was probably the most memorable stay that I have yet experience in my 20 years of international business travel. Thank you again, and I will definitely recommend this property to my friends and colleagues.",50
Stayed here for three nights in April. Was fantastic from start to finish.  The shuttle buses to and from the airport run regularly as do the buses to the ferry ports.  The rooms are fantastic and the staff extremely helpful.  It is only a short walk to the city of dreams and to the Venetian.  Would definitely recommend this hotel to everyone and will definitely be choosing this hotel next time I come to macau.....fantastic :-),50
"I stayed at the Conrad Macao for two nights over a weekend and went away impressed by the great staff and fantastic facilities. Many thanks to guest relations manager Nicole Lee and Eric at the front desk, who both took great care of us. It's always refreshing to meet people who obviously enjoy their job, and it comes through very clearly to guests.   The facilities in our room were top notch and of high quality, which isn't always a given at some other hotels in China. We asked for Shanghai Tang toiletries, which we enjoyed very much.   The fitness centre also has some great staff, including Glenda, Case and Jeff. It's rare to find such consistently high standards of service all across a hotel, so many kudos to the staff for their enthusiasm and hard work. The gym has static…",50
"I spent two nights with Conrad Macau. It is located opposite to Venetian Macao and is in between Holiday Inn and Sheraton. It is just a bridge across the Venetian Shopping Center. We took the hotel shuttle from Taipa Ferry Pier and took around ten minutes to the hotel.   Once we arrived in the hotel, I felt that the main entrance is built like a tropical resort with the wooden top and lots of plants. The check-in area was exquisite, unlike Venetian Macao. I was check-in to my room smoothly and the staff was quite nice. Surprisingly, they were not cantonese speakers though, only Mandarin and English.   The room was very new and luxurious. It is truly a five-star hotel room. I really appreciate that they put two bottles of Evian every time they turned down the room. Wi-Fi in the…",50
"One of the best hotel with superb hospitality and service! Booked for a deluxe room and were upgraded to a Suite. Beautiful room with a fantastic view of the COD strip and the amenities were oh-so wonderful.   There were complimentary shuttles to Macau city to visit the historical St Paul site and nearby quaint shops.   For nearer shopping experience, the hotel is just a stone throw to Venetian shopping mall. Painted blue sky filled the ceiling, with street performances everyone to enjoy a minute or two. Just don't mind the sea of Chinese mainlanders tourists whom could blind you with their camera flashes...  Overall, we had a wonderful stay and would definitely be coming back for a second visit!",50
This hotel is superb excellent rooms both bedrooms and public rooms with well trained and attentive staff Only downside was room service where I took breakfast with the tray lacking a cup and serviette but other than that an excellent hotel,40
"Obviously, this is one of the greatest hotels with its hospitality and facilities. Despite this, there are small spots;  1. Executive room includes two small bottles of EVIAN for free each day, but we have to buy additional for about 3 USD per small bottle, which is very expensive! I would like you to prepare even cheaper bottled waters (not expensive EVIAN) for free as many as the executive guests' demand as other Conrad & Hilton hotels do.  2. There was a house keeping lady cleaning in my room after coming back from breakfast at around 10:00AM. I am staying only one night and am about leaving. I had to prepare leaving but the lady continued to clean. There was no towel in the bathroom! No sheets on the bed! Why you want to clean in such a hurry? It is normally busiest time in…",50
"Pre-paid for a Deluxe Suite on a high floor months in advance and saved a bundle that you WILL spend on room service and in the casino later on.   1. Check in went very easily once we found the desk (because if your taxi cab driver doesn't know where the Conrad is, even after showing him the cover page of my reservations details spelling CONRAD out,  after a brief radio communication it was all sorted out he dropped us off at the Sands Cotai entrance between the Sheraton and Conrad). The young lady at the desk that checked us in then accompanied us up to the room along with the luggage man and made sure all the details of the room were shown.   During the previously month before arrival, I started receiving communications between the Conrad website offering me an upgrade to a…",50
"The management team of this hotel should take a bow - what they have achieved, and continue to achieve every hour, day in, day out is remarkable - at a hotel of this size and scale.  The check in experience is pleasant and efficient. The staff are very polite and well trained.   The room - we had a Premier Suite. One word springs to mind - WOW. You have a large spacious bedroom, living room, 2 bathrooms and a TV room. We have a 1 year old who was given a Conrad baby box in the room - filled with baby plate, knife, fork, bibs and even Conrad baby slippers. Excellent.  The hotel itself is walking distance to the Water Show and it has a casino if you want a flutter.   This hotel is now the benchmark for us in Asia. I really cannot comprehend some of the negative comments/reviews on…",50
"Hotel is very new. The staff are friendly, very helpful, professional and attentive. Facilities are very nice, Grand Orbit restaurant offers superb buffet. Efficient service staff and always smile. Surprisingly a lot of staff from mainland China can speak English well. We need an in-house doctor due to some emergency, he came to our room right away and attend to my mom. Guest service manager constantly check with us about the status of my mom making sure everything we need are provided. Close to City of Dream, Venetian Macao is just across the street and there is air-conditioned bridge connecting to it. Sheraton and Holiday Inn located on the same hotel complex so you can variety of shops to choose.",40
"Stayed here for four nights during a business trip to Hong Kong. Never been in Macau before so I decided to take the speed boat every day to Hong Kong. As a HH Gold member they upgraded me to a suite that was very nice. The service is very nice but be aware that it is not a stand alone hotel.  Breakfast was very nice and the do really listen to the feedback given. I complained about my expresso (was over filed and tasted like a standard coffee) the following they I did get great coffee and they said sorry for yesterday. I think I will stay here again for my 2 week trip to Hong Kong, do think it is worth staying here and taking the boat to Hong Kong.",50
"Hotel is new, walking distance to 'water dance' show. Staff are professional, friendly and carry smiles on their faces, and are so thoughtful. It was my wife's birthday on the day when we checked in. When we returned from our celebration dinner late at night, we discovered that a lovely cake was delivered to our room, we ate half of it even though we were full. Room is elegantly designed & large, bathroom is fantastic, bed is very comfortable. Breakfast buffet is impressive and good value. Will definitely come again!",50
"This is a very new establishment and the rooms are in excellent condition. I got upgrade to a suite so even better forr my 2 night' stay in Macau.   Negatives : the staff/concierge service can certainly improve. I had emailed concierge before my arrival on 2 things, book a lunch and a birthday cake for my boyfrend.   When I checked in I asked the staff about my lunch booking, it didn't seem to appear on my record and after calls to concierge they couldn't even confirm whether or not they did make the reservation or not (despite the fact I have an email from Conrad saying that they have made the reservation). In the end all was sorted but I expect better.   On my 2nd request on the birthday cake, I asked them to deliver at 11am to my room as a surprise. However, I waited until…",40
"This is a 5 star hotel in every aspect.  I stay in nice hotels all over the world and this property is certainly one of the best.  Excellent service, wonderful buffets, beautiful rooms.  Thanks for a great stay Conrad!",50
"Have stayed at most of the hotels in Macau, including Venetian, Wynn, Hard Rock, Crown Towers, Grand Hyatt and last time I was in Macau I stayed at the Conrad.  I was very happy with my stay there and now think Conrad is one of the best hotel in Macau.   Rooms were great, service was great, activities in hotel common area were fun and the shopping mall next to hotel was really good too.   Highly recommend this hotel.",50
"My husband and I stayed at this hotel in March 2013 for two nights and we are very impressed with everything. We were upgraded to a suite which was a wonderful surprise as we did not expect it. The room was beautiful and gorgeous. We also got the lovely view of the city. The bathroom was massive and the king size bed was comfortable. My husband requested for a different pillow from the pillow menu as the original pillows were a bit too soft for him. Even then, the pillow was sent promptly to our room.   We had breakfast at Grand Orbit. The range of food during the breakfast buffet was also impressive. The quality of food and service was exceptional. It was convenient to get to the hotel from the Taipa Ferry Terminal as shuttle buses are available. The shuttle buses that are…",50
"We recently stayed at the Conrad Macau and although there were positives to our stay, we found it to be, overall, a very disappointing trip. Let me start with the good things about the hotel:  -The rooms are stunning. We were in a standard kind-sized room and it was very, very spacious and beautifully appointed. We were pleasantly surprised by the size of the room and bathroom. My daughter especially loved the giant tub! -The pool area was beautiful and despite the cruddy weather we really enjoyed our time down there. Two of the pools were heated and swimming was fine in spite of the cold. The hot tub also looked really nice, but I did not go in. -The mall that it is attached to is quite nice, however the selection of western restaurants in very limited. We often ate at the…",10
"My experience with Conrad Macao started about 2 months ago when I decided to take my family to a trip to Macau for 3 days. I booked 2 rooms with city view, and right after my booking, I emailed the hotel and requested to be put on the higher floors with better view and two rooms on the same floor, next to each other... a connecting room if possible and of course, it never hurts to ask for an upgrade.   Everything seemed okay and I even got an email from the staff I originally exchanged email with a few days before my check-in. Upon arrival, as my sister checked in an hour earlier than me, I had to separately check-in even under the same booking which is understandable. Of course, being Easter Holiday, I did not expect to have any upgrade which is totally fine. When I checked in,…",20
"We booked the hotel about three months prior to our trip and were upgraded to suite by Sands points. We are also rewarded with free WIFI during our two-nights stay. I'm really appreciated since we payed awful a lot just to check an email in The Venetian during our last visit.  The room, needless to say, is close to perfect. But still there's two minor issues that could be improved. 1. Because it's spacious, mom has to walk through the living room to fill the kettle in bathroom just to make a cup of tea, which is a little inconvenience. 2. Would be better if there's a mirror stool.  The casino is smaller than Galaxy and The Venetian, you don't have to take a lift up go through all the shops then go down just to avoid entering casino, which made hotels in Sands Cotai Central an…",50
"The hotel is new and luxurious in every respect. Outstanding service. We got an upgrade and a complimentary cake on our anniversary, as well as some Easter cookies for my kid. The free teddy and the duck also kept my kid amusing.  The suite is huge with two toilets. The bathtub is also comparable to the size of a small jacuzzi.  The three heated pools provide good fun for family even though they are not big. Very family friendly hotel indeed, no casino right at the hotel (since it shares the casino at the Sheraton nearby connected through the shopping mall). good fountain show too. The selection and quality of breakfast at the Grand Orbit is also top rated.",50
"Stayed at the Conrad Macao in January and could not fault anything about the hotel, it is exceptional, certainly a 5 star hotel! As a Hilton honours gold member my family and I got our room upgraded to a suite.  The suite was amazing, it was spacious and very comfortable (even had a small movie room). The service at the Conrad was first class, and the buffet breakfasts are very nice. There are 5 pools, and two are heated during the colder months which is very convenient. It is located in Cotai Central, with lots of shops, restaurants and casinos close by. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and am definitely hoping to return!  10/10",50
"We are back to Hong Kong after our three-day trip in Macau.  Our family of 6 ppl had a really fantastic and enjoyable stay at Conrad Macao these past three days.  Thanks to Kajana, Simpson and the team at Conrad.  We booked three rooms and they managed to upgrade two out of three for us with advance email communication, which makes my in-laws really happy.    The Conrad bears and duckies made my daughter cheerful all the time.  And we are still talking about how happy she was when she saw the cookies platter specially made for her (with her name on it) waiting on the coffee table......a surprise!  We were able to check out two of the rooms via express service via phone hassle free.    We left our luggages at Concierge after the final check out.  The arrangement was so smooth. …",50
"We would like to thank you for a very warm welcome during the stay. I had informed the staff that this trip was to celebrate birthday for my friend and they had arranged a yummy cake for us upon arrival. The most impressive experience was a bell staff was wishing my friend a happy birthday although we had not checked in yet!! We are still wondering until now how did he know.  For the bell service, they worked really fast. All luggage were already in our room when we arrived. We did not stop by anywhere. Just went direct to our room after checking in.  The room was spacious and the beds were so comfy. We will definitely visit again if there is a chance!!",50
"My family of 4 stayed in Conrad Macao for 5 days, 4 nights last week. The experience was excellent and began 1 week prior to our stay with a personalized email from Guest Relationship Manager, Nicole welcoming us to the resort and enquiring if there were any special request. We were greeted at the check in counter upon arrival and given an upgraded suite since I am a HHonours Diamond member. As my wife and I were celebrating our wedding anniversary and son's birthday, a special cake and cookies were prepared for us. We were made to feel very welcome and special over our whole stay in Conrad and special mention to the staff at the Grand Orbit led by Rhea and Pool staff, Jeff. Their personalized touch left a deep impression in us and our kids are still talking about them now that…",50
"The hotel is nice and new and service is impeccable and very prompt!   In my correspondence with the hotel over our reservation I mentioned that it was my baby's birthday, and they took the initiative to set-up our room with a very yummy cake plus a very lovely gift box filled with baby utensils and toiletries.   The kids were thrilled with the plush kids' robes which had been prepared for the three of them... My daughter said it felt like a bear was hugging her! Conrad duck and bear collectors will be thrilled with the black duck and pretty bear in the room (I was told the bear was a special edition Easter bear and hence much better looking than the normal brown bear with white tee).  The restaurants at the hotel served delicious food and our favourite was the Japanese…",50
"Stayed in late March using Points as a fun start to a 6 week business trip.  Hotel is what you would expect from a top casino property, nicely appointed with spacious rooms.  The best part is the staff. Very friendly, helpful, always knowing who I was.  I got more survey requests from each department then ever before - a sign they really try to do the very best.  Staff even helped me arrange a vehicle into China for the next leg of the trip.  The hotel is located in the newer Cotai casino area, not in the middle of old Macau proper.  Sands Cotai Casino area includes a Holiday Inn, Sheraton, and the Conrad.  Taxi to/from old section is 70-100HKD one way depending on time/traffic.  The Venetian, Four Seasons and City of Dreams complexes are within walking distance.  Free shuttle…",50
"We stayed there for a training last year. Conrad was just open in 2012 and therefore brand new. Rooms are spacious, beautiful and elegant. Bed was soooo comfortable. Turn down service was lovely and I love the signature Conrad bathroom duck decorated with spades, hearts, diamonds and club - the unique Lucky Ducky!",50
I stayed in this hotel for one night in January and this one night give me a lasting memories. I booked a deluxe room but when i checked in i was upgraded to a Premium suite. The room was huge and has tea room and living room.The bed was king size and a round spa bath tub with a small TV attached against the wall.There were 2 toilets and three 52 inches television.There was also a huge wardrobe and premium tea and coffee counter. the room was very clean and had a nice flowery fragrance.,50
"The hotel was so charming and really felt like a lovely retreat. Staff was very helpful. We were so pleased with the service we received by everyone. Room and amenties were great. From the location to the service, it was our right choice. Would return with pleasure.",50
"I was lucky enough to stay in this AMAZING hotel. As soon as I have arrived to the ferry terminal, the hostess welcomed me warmly and escorted me to the Conrad Shuttle to get to the Hotel. From check-in to Check-out this stay was beyond memorable. Emily was super friendly at the check-in just like everyone else! The facilities at this Hotel are excellent. In fact, the staff brought my hotel guest experience to a WHOLE NEW LEVEL. The service was extremely personalized and they have had always anticipated any need that might come up during my stay. No matter how busy the Hotel is , it's more than guaranteed that each and every guest will get the best service ever! Looking forward for my next trip to Macau to make a new memory that will last for a lifetime in this Hotel.",50
"This is the nicest hotel we have ever stayed in. From the check-in to he huge room, the pool and athletic center everything was perfect, but the nicest thing was the people who work there. You can get just about anywhere in Macau by taking a free casino shuttle bus from the Cotai Strip or the nearby City of Dreams. Staff are very helpful with directions.",50
The hotel exceeded beyond our expectation.The hotel is well located between The Venetian and City of Dreams. Probably a five to ten minutes walk between hotels. Very conveniently located. The hotel also provide complimentary shuttle services to / from the airport and the ferry terminal. It would have been advantageous if the hotel could expand their bus routes to other places such as Taipa Village and to Senado Square.   The hotel nicely placed us to the 33rd floor double queen size bedroom. The room is equipped with ipod / iphone / ipad docking station to play your music. Two TVs are installed; one in the bedroom and one in front of the bathtub. The room was brand new and quiet. The hotel also provides turn down service in the evening. Wifi comes with a fee. The bed is…,50
"This is a fairly new first class property located at the Sands Cotai on the Cotai Strip of Taipa Island.  Besides Conrad, there are two other hotels siting on the Sands Cotai which are Sheraton and Holiday Inn.  Location wise, it is pretty strategic as The City of Dreams Complex (housing Hard Rock Hotel, Crown Hotel, Grand Hyatt Hotel)  and The Venetiian & The Plaza Complex (housing The Venetion Hotel and Four Seasons Hotel) are just next door. The airport is so near that it is actuall reachable by walking.  However, there are plenty of hotel shuttle buses to take you to the hotel from the airport.  From the Cotai Strip, there are also many shuttle buses that can take to you the various ferry terminals (to Hong Kong, to China) and other areas in Macau Island.  Taipa Village is a…",40
"Conrad team, you did it again. Congrats. This is our second stay in Conrad, but slightly difference is that with my elderly mum. Thank you to Guest relationship, Paweena for arranging a high floor accessible upgraded room together with the wheelchair. It is very convenient for us to bring our mum around the Cotai strip for sight-seeing. Also, prompt response in offering alternative, from the restaurant manager in Grand Orbit during our breakfast feedback was impressive. Keep it up. Human touch is what guest needs. :)",50
"This hotel is located 5 minutes taxi from the airport.  I’ve took the ferry from Hong Kong, which had to go across town to arrive at the hotel.  The taxi ride from the ferry terminal took approximately 20 minutes.  The hotel offers free shuttle bus.  It’s green color and provides service for Holiday Inn and Sheraton which are adjacent to Conrad.    Service is top notch.  Although I checked in at 2am in the morning, I was still greeted with very attentive and professional staff.  The hotel manager even walked me to my suite which overlooks the city.  Every last detail went into making the room comfortable.  Separate bath tub and shower, soft robes, HIS and HERS slippers.  There was a large flat screen TV in the living room which I plugged in my portable media player which worked…",50
"Located in Cotai Strip, the Conrad is part of the newest integrated resort of Sands Cotai Central together with the Holiday Inn and the Sheraton. There’s a shopping mall next to the hotel.  The Venetian shopping mall (which is the biggest in Macau) is just directly opposite connected with a pedestrian bridge.   Upon arrival at the Macau airport, you could take a free bus ride or a short 7 minute taxi ride (which costs HKD30). Being located along Cotai Strip, it is a 15-20 minute taxi ride to downtown Macau (which costs HKD 80). You could get a free bus ride to/from the Sands in downtown Macau.   Upon checking in at around 4pm, I was informed that room was not ready. However, I was then upgraded (I would assume that the normal rooms are fully booked) to the King Deluxe suite,…",40
"We stayed in Conrad Macao for two nights for my Husband's birthday from 24/2 to 26/2. We have been upgraded to the second largest Premier Suite (1650 sq ft) in Conrad . I like the deoration with simple and warm feeling like home as well as the Expresso machine and tea sets with fresh milk. To my surprise is the free gifts - A little teddy bear , silk slipper with printing Her and His, a swimming duck with lamp ( special design for Lunar new year) and box of sugar. They provide good service from the time we check in, the house keeping and check out service. We enjoy an English high tea set in cafe very much. We will definitely come to stay in Conrad Macao Hotel again.",50
"I have stayed at a number of 5 star hotels throughout Asia  but in Conrad Macau I was pleasantly surprised with all the extra little touches I received from arrival to the breakfast service; the personalized service made me feel welcome and recognized. This was even more impressive given that I stayed during Chinese New Year, which is one of the busiest times of the year in Macau ( night of 17th Feb). After a full day walking in the old town or shopping, treating yourself to a massage in the Conrad Spa is a must.",50
"My family and i stayed here for 2 nights over chinese new year - there was ample staff, check-in was simple, polite, with minimal fuss, no queueing required (unlike other hotels in the same development!), professional, and the staff spoke excellent English!  My parents throughly enjoyed their stay and commented on how this was one of their best experiences in Macau in recent years - as a family unit, we have stayed at a number of the new casino developments in Macau and this really was a great experience!  We ordered room service for breakfast and the food was hot, the coffee lovely, and the staff were professional and unobtrusive.  The only development point was that our rooms were not made up on the 2nd day until we called housekeeping, but that was a minor point (a 30s phone…",50
"I selected this hotel for stay from 2 to 4 Jan 2013. The physical aspects need no elaboraton as it is of excellent Conrad standard. Got nice room (1220) with a stunning view of winter special light n laser show at Venetian.   What makes this hotel so remarkably special is the attentive n personalised services rendered by a dedicated concierge team.  Edmund, the Chief Concierge, sent a friendly note to welcome me before my check-in date, n offered me  some helpful tips after learning that it was our first time to Macau. He also promised to pass me some guides on Macau, which I received promptly once he knew I checked in at the counter. Edmund has provided a few nice eating places (which I could not possibly cover all during the short stay, n I will cover the rest at the next…",50
"Stayed with friend and family members from 26 Jan - 29 Jan 2013 through a friend's arrangement. Check in was smooth even we arrived way before the check in time. Although the hotel was experiencing high occupancy, we were attended to promptly upon our arrival via the complimentary shuttle from Macau International Airport in Taipa. The hotel is located just 5 minutes of bus ride away from the airport.  We took 2 rooms in different level due to room availability. Our room was ok but the other room stayed by parents was not properly made up by the housekeeping maids. The carpet was dirty and after we walked on the room carpet with our socks on, our white socks turned greyish. Parents' room did not have the Conrad bear on the bed during turndown service on the 1st day while our room…",40
"We have stayed at a number of 5 star hotels throughout Asia including Macau, but all the extra little touches here make the service a cut above the usual experience at hotels in a similar category. This was even more impressive given that we stayed during Chinese New Year, which is the busiest time of the year in Macau.  Room: We stayed in a suite, which was enormous - even for Macau. In addition to the separate bedroom, there was also a media room which was great to use as a separate room for our 2 yo to sleep in her cot. Living/dining room was massive. It was a shame not to be able to use the Club Lounge as we had read good things about it before our stay, but hopefully it will be open on our next visit.  Concierge: Emailed us before our stay to see if we had any requests,…",50
"Stayed in an amazing suite - lots of room.  Service was great! Hotel staff were very helpful - even helped us plan our journey to Guangzhou. Location very convenient to the 'City of Dreams' and the Venetian. Shuttle buses nearby to ferry you to town, airport, ferry and the border.  The breakfast buffet was substantial. The promotional gifts, a teddy bear, flashing rubber duck and jar of candy, were an added touch to the stay. Oh, the giant crystal chandelier in the bar was awesome! Would definitely stay here again!",50
"My wife and I has take a one night stay in Conrad Macau on 10 Feb 2013. This is our first time to stay here. And in the inital stage, we have some plan to cancel the trip due my wife not feeling well in the morning time. But she thought she still can manage, so we keep on the original schedule. When we stepped in the hotel, we have a good feeling due to its so clean and grand. At the same time, one gentleman has guided me to check in and I am quiet amazing that they are so efficient and within 15 mins, I can go to my room and take a rest. At the night time, my wife not feeling well again due she had a sore throat, and we thought we may leave the hotel and see a doctor in Hong Kong. However, its already 10 pm and also during Chinese New Year, it was very difficult to see a…",50
"If size is the only thing matters, then Conrad is the place for you. It was the biggest suite I ever had for the rate I paid. Everything was big, even the toilet nook; it’s bigger than the bathroom of some hotels. As a matter of fact, it had two, one in the master bathroom and the other by the foyer. Service was great too; the staff was friendly and efficient. So why was I not exactly satisfied?  Here is one reason, as soon as I walked into the room and looked out to the pool area below and the cityscape beyond, I was stunned by the streaks of grimes on the windowpane that dimmed my view. When I mentioned it to a receptionist at the front desk, she smiled as if she had heard it before, jotted something down, but the dirt remained for the three days I was there.  Another surprise…",30
"We visited Macau at the end of January 2013 for an exhibition and made a weekend of it. The hotel is relatively new but well located for access to the Venetian exhibition halls. From the moment we arrived we were looked after superbly from the bellboys at the main door to the lady at reception. Joana then ensured that we were checked in smoothly, all our needs were met and we were taken to our room within minutes. The rooms are spacious and well laid out. The bathrooms were wonderful, clean and spacious as well. Upon checking about the possibility of trying to find some vegetarian food for my wife, Joana once again stepped in from the reception desk and introduced us to the senior concierge who gave us numerous suggestions, two of which were within 2-3 minutes walk and located…",50
"My husband and I are took a few days out of our HK trip to visit Macau and settled on the Conrad after a bit of internet research mainly because it had the largest room size for our money. We booked the King Deluxe City View and it didn't disappoint!! The room was HUGE and luxurious - bathroom was absolutely beautiful with double sinks and a tv in the bath. The hotel is quite new so everything is spic and span and tastefully done. Service is fantastic - special mention to the concierge team who went out of their way to recommend restaurants and make bookings for us - even before we arrived via email!  Nice little touches like Aromatherapy Associates toiletries, nespresso machine, sweets. We enjoyed the location as we did want to experience the casino glitzy side. We went to the…",50
"We stayed for five nights at the Conrad Macao and loved almost everything about it.  Best of all were the staff, all of whom were capable and helpful and so many of whom seemed genuinely sweet.  (It's almost unfair to single anyone out, but a number of people were awfully good to us:  Poy, Vicky, and Cathy in reception and guest services; Susan, Lily, Rain, and several of their colleagues in the Lobby Lounge; Jen, Ivy, Rhea, Chris, and their co-workers in the Grand Orbit restaurant; and chief concierge Edmund and his staff.)  The facilities are also of the quality you would expect from a Conrad.  We were upgraded to a suite that was the size of a comfortable one-bedroom apartment. It had panoramic views, mostly of other Cotai hotels but with the airport runway, the ocean, and…",40
We normally lay over in HKG but was very happy we made the extra effort to get to Macao. This is an amazing hotel still feels new staff are totally amazing (perhaps a little OTT). We were upgraded to a suite as a Diamond member which the room was amazing. Shame the exec lounge was under renovations. Make sure you time your ferry services well to airport....,50
I was upgraded to a beautiful suite. The service is quick and excellent but fundamentally the issue I had with this excellent property is that it is really in a shopping mall with the Sheraton and Holiday Inn and some of the public areas and restaurants are right in the shopping mall. I did not really like the shopping mall atmosphere. THe pool/fitness area is only ok - the pools are small and only some are heated and the hours are not great.,50
"I've been staying 4 days/ 3 nights at the hotel. It's conrad, everything is luxury and perfect.  So, I will just list down some brief review - Internet was a complimentary; however, the signal is weak (stay on the 25th Fl), the WIFI password was given didn't work out. - The cordless phone at the desk was no battery - Compare same rate Venetian, the room here is smaller in the area of living room (sofa) - Food court here is better than Venetian (pricing, and taste) - I like when we walking from the elevator to the room, there is a nice freshener scents like we are walking in the flower garden. - Due to the newly open, the casino and conference zone here are less smoking smell than Venetian. - Staffs are very friendly and very helpful.",50
"This was our first stay in Macau for my fiance and I. We just stayed here for 2 nights as a side trip from HK and found the Conrad Cotai through TA. This was a trip to celebrate our recent engagement and they really did make us feel special by upgrading us to a suite! It was so perfect, clean, large rooms with separate lounge area, big bathroom with a massive tube, very comfortable bed and plenty of space to relax! The were also 4 TVs in the room, a Nespresso machine that we used daily and nightly turnover to reset the room.   The highlight of our stay were the amazing staff at Conrad. Check in was a breeze with Cathy, June and various other staff went over and beyond to help with bookings and travel tips around Macau. We even got a personalised written letter to congratulate…",50
"When I arrived and discharged from the bus, the hotel staff immediate approach me and asking ""are you Mr X"".  I was so suprise.  They said because I informed them I will come with my 3 Yeats old son and arrived around noon time so they were expecting.  The services were excellent, nothing can go wrong.  The room was clean.  Highly recommend to anyone who travel to Macau.",50
"Checked into Conrad Macao on Feb 4th. The check-in was smooth and very welcoming. The concierge was very efficient and prompt and my luggage arrived in the room very quickly. On the whole, my time in Conrad was fantastic. All the hotel staff I encountered were very well trained, attentive and professional.   The only downside to my night's stay was that I had very noisy neighbors and at 4 plus in the morning, I was woken up by their activities in bed. This continued for quite a while and really disturbed my rest. :( :(",40
"My gf and I stayed at Conrad Macao for 2d1n on Feb 2 - 3, 2013. We reviewed various comments re other hotels in Macau (including Galaxy, Venetian ...etc) and decided to give Conrad Macao a try. The experience was fantastic and there's really nothing we were not satisfied about. The hotel was very new, the room was beautiful and clean, the breakfast was awesome, the staffs and housekeepers were nice and thoughtful. There's really nothing we could complain about. We wished we could have stayed there longer. One point for Conrad Macau to consider: free internet service will make it even better.",50
"I stayed for one night in this property on October, 2012 and I regretted that I hadn't book longer. Their loyalty member recognition was excellent and all staff are very friendly, helpful and tentative Customer relations manger who replied my email greeted herself and escorted us to the room. Their handwritten letters made my stay even special. I was upgraded to an Executive suite, and the room was very nice and spacious. Bathroom was well structured with a huge bath tub. The room service was also good with reasonable price.One minor drawback was the dining staff at the buffet restaurant.  I would recommend Conrad macao to my friends and colleagues and will definitely stay there again!",50
"Stayed at the Conrad Macau with husband on January 26-27, 2013.   This was our first time leaving the kids at home to Macau for a ""relaxing"" weekend. It was also our anniversary. We usually stay at the Banyan Tree, but this time, seeing it's a new hotel, and never stayed in Conrad, only HIlton, we decided to give it a try.  From the first email correspondence to the hotel directly, I knew the reviews in here were right on. The service from the guest relations department and the concierge were impressive. Efficient reply, informative, and very professional.  Edmund Tan, the Chief Concierge was the name worth mentioning. There were hiccups during our stay, but because of the professionalism and attentive care by Edmund, our stay was not disappointing, and very pleasant indeed.…",50
"I gave full rate as it's all beyond my expectation.   To celebrate my son's 2 years old birthday, we planned to visit Macau and stay in your hotel. June, a Concierge, was very thoughtful and readily  upgrade my room upon my request. Also, he was very friendly and helpful to show us the best route to Macau Science. The room was huge, beautiful  and clean, there was a living room, dining room,  enterainment room and having individual bed room.   We  much appreciated the hotel prepared a birthday cake and a toy bear to celebrate my son's birthday.  We also appreciated the bell service.  The bell boy was very nice and helpful showing us the room and its items. During stay, we requested baby stuff, those was delivered quickly . On the last day, we received a letter from June…",50
"My girlfriend and I went Macau for an overnight trip on Saturday to celebrate her birthday. I stayed in a king deluxe suite as I got upgrade with a member status. The suite is really great and I got everything I need in the room. The location is convenient and actually you can reach everywhere in macau with a cab within 30 minutes.  We received warm welcome by Miss Venessa, she's really nice and helpful. We asked her to book a restaurant for us and turns out it's full, but she calls back with another similar already booked for me. Most importantly special thanks to her for the surprise to my girlfriend with a birthday cake on the dining table.   Overall, I will recommend it as one of the best hotel in macao, I will definitely stay here when I go to macau again.",50
"My friend and I stayed here on an overnight side trip from Hong Kong.  Being fans of the Conrad brand we were really excited to stay at one of their newest properties.  Service was amazing and the rooms were absolutely gorgeous. The standard room we stayed in was massive. The bathroom itself is probably the size of my apartment in Japan.   The staff was very friendly and helpful. There was a typhoon that came into town the night we stayed there and the staff made sure we were up to date on all the news on the storm. We had such a delicious dinner at their bar/lounge right off of reception that we decided to go back for high tea the next day.   All in all it was a fabulous, luxurious stay.",50
"It was our 3rd visit in Macau in 2 yrs. and truly it was an amazing stay.  My husband and I were there from Dec. 28 until the 30th with our children plus family friends with their children too. We got the executive club services and we never regret it. So happy having chosen this hotel over others in the area. I highly recommend this hotel not only because the rooms are comfortable and new but the staff are superb, from the front desk ladies, including of course the manager, to their ever smiling waitresses in their restaurants. The food was great as well.  We promised to return again this year.",50
"I have stayed at thousands of hotels for work over the last decade, this was a top 5 stay. Being a Hilton Honors member is a perk but not necessary as the customer service was above and beyond for everyone here. Room was fantastic. Great bed, shower, and view. TV channels for every nationality on giant flat screens. If you want quick food, there is a food court as the hotel is connected to a mall (as well as the Venetian). My lasting impression was the customer service. I'll admit, I stay in so many hotels that I'm used to being treated as a transient. Here, I was treated as an actual ""guest"". I felt appreciated and comfortable. Thank you again to the guest relations manager for the hospitality.",50
"The hotel shuttle bus is a little difficult to locate from the ferry terminal but once you are on it, you are on your way to a lovely stay.  The locals at the terminal have little to no English so beware!   The room, staff and surrounds are lush and it comes with the territory (Its the Vegas of Asia). Stayed for two nights with our little 5 month old and they brought us a cot, bottle warmer and bottle sterilizer. Plus a large box of baby necessities (see pic)!  I'm very impress with their service.",50
"It is really impressive hotel with perfect service. Hotel is located in Cotai Central where all Macau attractions are. You are very warm welcome in reception when check in. We had a booking that we could choose either room upgrade or free breakfast. Because I am Hhonors Diamond member, I got both. Deluxe Suite is a huge room. Probably around 150 sqm.  Breakfast is very rich with much choice.  In hotel and shopping mall you feel the top luxury. No need to explain much. Perfect hotel.",50
"Stayed here for a short trip from Hong Kong. We booked three rooms, but only got one room when we checked in in the afternoon. They were still cleaning the other two. Anyway, when we got back to the other two rooms at night. We were surprised that they upgraded our room. The kids were literally screaming when they opened the doors. There were three TVs in our room! All rooms were equipped with modern TV and furniture. We also got great views. The swimming pool was okay. It was clean but a bit too small.    It's also very convenient to travel around Macau from our hotel. The staffs told us that we can walk to Galaxy, which is right next door, and take their bus. The wait time for the bus wasn't too bad.   They also gave us $500 certificate to spend in restaurant and spa. They…",40
"All hotel staffs are very nice and always give all suggestion to stay in the hotel. They also kindly introduce all hotel facilities such as pool, gym. They upgraded us the room, that was impressive although we need to wait more two hours for ready. However, I was surprise that there is no turn down service for my room !! so I didn't get the lovely teddy bear like others.",40
"Stayed here for 2 nights. Upon arrival to the airport used the free shuttle bus to Cotai Strip. Check in was fast, friendly and smooth, and as HH Gold got an upgrade to Deluxe Suite on 10th floor, which was really huge and beautiful. Staff excellent and really helpful. Executive lounge sadly closed for refurbishment, but will try it next time. Transport around Cotai and Macao very easy and free with tourist (Casino) buses running everywhere. Transport to central Macao in 30 minutes just with free buses. Breakfast very good with a lot of choices for every desire, internet very fast and reliable. A lot of entertainment choices during the day with prices that are really reasonable. Hotel has food court with plenty of reasonable priced choices to get you thru the day. Will stay here…",50
"Wrote to hotel for enquiries. Concierge manager, Edmund is very helpful and reply my emails promptly. He is very thoughtful and even upgrade my room upon my request. Overall hotel is perfect, clean and beautiful. All staffs are very helpful. Definitely will stay in Conrad if in Macau.",50
"I stayed here for 3 nights & would rate this property high on every parameter.. A huge hotel with excellent staff ready to take care of your every basic need..Got a very warm smiling staff at time of check IN which only took few mins.. Rooms are quiet big with all the latest amenites .. Hotel has Casino, shopping, food courts , coffee shops etc & hotel is on the famous COTAI STRIP.. you get regular hotel shuttle services to all around MACAO city ... Got stuck in lift for a minute but hotel was quick in apologizing for same & infact at my Check OUT a staff lady specially came again to apologizing for Inconvenience to me due to this... This you  call a world class hospitality for making customer feel special .... I loved my stay here & would recommend all CONRAD MACAO :)",50
"first time to be there and it was a great hotel, very professional staff eg. FO-Sojin and Conc-Edmund. Both of them were friendly, informative and valuable staff. Will come back again in the future. Its was a nice stay and thanks for the arrangement for the upgrade to suite.  Thanks everyone in Conrad, Macau. Vicky Mok",50
"We stayed there in Oct 2012 for a Bachelors night. Completely taken care of by the staff from the beginning until the end. We were pleasantly surprised by some awesome amenities when we started the night (Beers & Pretzels). They knew exactly what we needed to fuel our night.  The rooms were awesome, so large and really comfortable beds. Only there for one night but still had to try their big bath and watch my favourite tv show while having a soak.  Would definitely recommend this to any type of traveler, caters to everyone!!!!  Special thanks to Nathan Kung who ensured that a party of 20 people had a great stay, awesome service and a truly memorable experience at The Conrad.",50
"Came here on a business trip for a conference.  Was amazed at the level of service by the hotel which started prior to arrival with easy to understand instructions on reaching the property via ferry from HKG.  Was upgraded to a suite which was large and comfortable.  One negative is that while this was supposedly a nonsmoking room, there were ash trays in the room.  So, I suspect that smirking is allowed in all rooms.  This is something the hotel should enforce, to have nonsmoking room on non smoking floors.  I have allergies and this can be an issue.  The service from everyone at this hotel was beyond belief.  Very helpful with room service, housekeeping, concierge, etc.  I felt very pampered here.  One regret was I didn't have time for the spa :(.",50
"I stayed at Conrad Macao for a conference and I'm highly impressed. The quality of the service is exceptional. I went to the wrong check-in desk and the staff member took the time to walk me to the right desk. They escorted me to my room after check in and pointed out the complimentary duck and bear which make a great present for my kids. The store and bar staff are all friendly and I didn't have any language difficulties at all.  The room quality is excellent. It's quite spacious and well appointed. I think this is the least amount of noise in any room I have ever stayed in. I've stayed in other hotels in mainland China where build quality was an issue, here that was not the case. Housekeeping is excellent as well. They seem to magically fix up the room the moment I leave…",50
"Have always wanted to stay over at Macau to accumulate either Hilton or Marriott points, so it is nice that there's finally a hotel at Macau where I can take advantage of my Hilton Honors status.   The Conrad (originally designed for the Shangri-La who pulled out of contract last minute) is conveniently located across from the Venetians and Four Seasons, and within the same building block as the Holiday Inn and Sheraton. It is linked to one of the most ""shoppable"" mall in Macau, not the fancy brands but normal stores normal people shop at. The Holiday Inn next door was perviously planned as Traders Hotel, and in addition, a St. Regis was planned next door but that seems to be on the halt and you see the mega-property appears to be unfinished with half-finished swimming pools and…",40
"opened for about 6 months only. our package was really a great bargain, including free lunch buffets and a MOP 500 dining voucher in Cotai Central per room, maybe because it's new. check-in was fast because there were very few tourists here...  very spacious room with a king bed, a large sofa, large-screen tv in bedroom, a small tv in bathroom, many tiny gifts from the hotel - a box of conrad candies, a conrad gold bear, and a congrad gold duck. the hardwares were really new and nice. nespresso coffee maker, very good bathroom. the room view was the sheraton hotel nearby and some deserted land of cotai strip.  lunch buffet at grand orbit was nice, many choices, good desserts especially opera.   dinner at dynasty was great too. new-style chinese food with good services. though a…",50
"We had two fabulous nights in November 2012 at the Conrad Macau ! This is a very new hotel and the rooms a impeccably decorated, we also had a nice view of Cotai from our room. Our stay at the hotel was flawless and truly enjoyable. We felt as if we were the only guests in the hotel. The attention to every single detail made my birthday weekend getaway with my husband an unforgettable one. We were pleasantly surprised with the delicious cake we found in our room on the night of my birthday with a personalized message from the hotel; staff! A big thanks to Edmund at Concierge who helped organize our weekend getaway. All arrangements with external dinners, tour suggestions were right on spot, and the special dinner arrangement for my birthday at Aurora Restaurant was…",50
"Stayed for one night with friends. We were greeted by courteous, friendly staff, including Edmund, the Chef Concierge, with whom I had been in email contact. Check-in was smooth and efficient. The room (King Deluxe City View) was very spacious, comfortable and well appointed. Overall, the service was excellent and the hotel exceeded our expectations. Would definitely return!",50
"We celebrated our daughter's 6th birthday in Conrad, Macau. As soon as we entered the room, we got the surprise of our lives. The room was huge! There's a living room, dining room and an entertainment room! The bed was king, the room was clean.. The duckie and the bear adds to the superb amenities the room has... My husband likes the espresso cafe machine. My daughter immediately tried on the huge bathtub (more like jacuzzi) while watching her favorite cartoon! We have the very good view of the city especially the Venetian wall at night. It's like Macau was celebrating her birthday with us as we view the fireworks from our window! My son treated the entertainment room as his own and he had a privacy of watching his favorite AXN show on his own tv. And for 2 days, my husband and…",50
"We stayed at conrad hotel for our honeymoon and anniversary. Upon arrival we were warmly greeted by kentaro whom recognised it was our special event and quickly checked us in and escorted us to the suite then proceeded to give us a tour of the large room and kindly answer any queries we had.   The club suite was very spacious and had luscious bathrobes and a variety of pillows to choose from! The gym staff were very attentive and remembered who we were on our second visit.  Staff were always keen and ready to assist in every way possible. Overall the stay was excellent. Everything well exceeded our expectations. Compared to the surrounding hotels, conrad felt as though the staff were much friendlier and welcoming which made us feel more exclusive and comfortable. The staff also…",50

it was weekend stayover at the hotel and it prove to be a great choice to make. all was good from check in to the room all the way till check out. the staff from front desk to housekeeping made my stay a wonderful and realxing one. Will definitely choose to stay in Conrad once again when i am there.,50
"I've visited during a short weekend getaway to meet some friends who are working in China and this trip was a great detox of my stressful lifestyle. The duty manager was very kind to show me the way to my room and surprised me with an upgrade of room type to suite! all the staffs are very nice and cheerful! They will remember you from the start of your check in until you need to check out, they will walk you out for your bus or taxi! Give 200 out of 100 for this hotel!!!",50
"We got a suite.  Nice view, spacious and clean room, elegantly decorated, complimentary Nespresso coffee, candies and rubber duckie toy.  Service was also excellent.  They really go the extra mile to make your trip a memorable one.  The staffs could communicate in English, were polite, warm and friendly and capable.  We were really happy that we stayed in Conrad.  Thank you for making our stay a perfect one!",50
"We were deciding whether to go on a promo with Sheraton or a regular discount of Conrad. Both were recently new kids on the block on the Cotai Strip and based on tripadvisor Conrad has some pretty good reviews so I decided to go with Conrad. I knew it is a 5 star hotel and Sheraton is just a 3-4 star one. When we reached the airport at 11pm there were no more free shuttle so we just took Taxi. Please note that most Taxi in Macau don't speak english and couldn't understand them so better get some chinese translation before hailing a cab. There were some surcharge also on the taxi from airport to the hotel. Anyway, once we reach the hotel we were greeted by the staff and after some standard procedure of checking in, I asked if we could be upgraded and they gave us a suite. I…",50
"Stayed at the Conrad Macao for a few days and was impressed with the property from time of arrival until departure.  Before arrival, the concierge reached out and provided us details on how to best get to Conrad and organised sights for us to see.  Upon arrival, the hotel Manager and staff immediately went out of their way to make us feel welcome.  Check-in was quick and hotel room was an amazing suite on a high floor which had a view of Macao.  The Grand Orbit and Dynasty 8 restaurants were excellent and the food was fresh and prepared just right.  The hotel location is also perfectly situated on the Cotai Strip within walking distance of plenty of entertainment, shopping and more.  I highly recommend this hotel to anyone planning a stay in Macau.",50
"As HH royalty member, I am glad to take Conrad Macau as my second family in Macau. From now on, I will have strong feeling that I really want to visit again and again. And I am confident that Conrad Macau will achieve Luxury Top Hotel very soon as hotel has excellent staff to assist on the road.  I can always feel their staff sweet smile, warm welcome, considerate service and all the assistant which they would like to try their best, all these professional service makes my each trip much more easy and comfortable.  Because of them, I am so happy that I have more friends in the fantastic city.",50
"My hubby is a very particular man when it comes to accommodation & based on recommendation, we have chosen this 5star hotel for our 5D4N Christmas vacation.  Guess what?  This 5star hotel has given us all the WOW and an amazing vacation!    Other than providing the Best stay for any traveler, some of the things we loved most are... the lovely souvenirs, the cosy bathrobes & the sweet bedroom slippers!  WOW! ! !",50
"Stayed at Conrad Macao for 1 night last week.  The Duty Manager & assistant was really very nice and excellent in services. No crowd in reception  so let me feel comfort. Suite is really nice and elegant and we even didn't want to leave the room til night. Actually, just the same word that I told the manager  when checking-out, it's fantastic! Concededly prefer Conrad again in the next time trip to Macao.",50
"I stayed at the Conrad Macau for 2 nights early December for leisure with my parents.  As a frequent traveller and have stayed at many business hotels around the world, my expectations are rather high.  Given some of the negative reviews I've read here, I initially had doubts about choosing this hotel.  I did encounter some issues when I first made the reservation, but it was addressed immediately when brought to management, and since that point onward, every aspect of my stay was outstanding, from pre arrival to departure, we were well looked after in every aspect.  The hotel itself was very impressive with well designed spacious rooms and spectacular views, but it was the tailored service that made our stay truly memorable.  A special thank you to Kajana for all her effort and…",50
"just arrived home from a 4 day stay at Conrad Macau.  We didn't want to leave the hotel it had everything to suit our needs - even a ZARA amongst a massive variety of shops! the beds including ""the pillow menu"" were the best we have experienced in the world and we have travelled extensively.  When we booked our reservation included the premier club (which we paid an extra premium for) however when we arrived the lounge had been closed some months previous.  We didn't have to argue or barter with anyone as soon as the hotel realised this they honoured all of the extras in other outlets within the hotel - no drama at all.  Concierge (all staff) were exceptional and went above and beyond to ensure they met our needs. If I could single out 1 person it would have to be Jana, one of…",50

Upon entering the hotel, the pleasant scent puts you on instant R&R mood! Both Anne and Jess from concierge were so geniunely hospitable and made our stay in Aug and Nov overwhelmly pleasurable! I will definitely recommend all my friends and business contacts to stay in Conrad Cotai, Macau!",50
We just recently stayed at this hotel for 2 nights (Dec 11 - 13) and was extremely pleased with the service and our room.  Staffs are very polite and service is excellent.  Nathan who accompanied us to our room and gave us an introduction is also from Canada.  He is very pleasant and his attention to details (he sent us a plate of cookies with my 3 years old daughter name on it) made us feel like a million dollars.  This is the high end of the Hilton chain and thanks God as this hotel just saved my horrible experience with the other Hilton hotel in Japan.  Thanks Conrad for your great service and keep up the good work.,50
"I have stayed in Conrad Macao for the past weekend (Dec 9-Dec10) for a night to celebrate my birthday and Conrad definitely did not disappoint me! When we arrived the hotel, we were greeted by Kota at the front desk. After they found out it was my birthday, we've got upgraded to the Deluxe Suite! Kota accompanied us to the hotel room and explained briefly on the amenities inside the room. My first reaction when i entered is ""WOW!! The suite is HUGE!!!"" The room is facing Venetian, hard rock, and city of dream which gave the full city view of cotai. The bathroom was perfect with the TV at the bath tub and other than Peninsula, I have not seen any other hotels so far with that. The expresso machine in-room serves really good coffee as compared to the regular instant coffee powder.…",50
"Stayed at Macao Conrad for the first 2 nights from 27 Nov - 29 Nov 2012. First pleasant surprise, an upgrade to a suite room!  Had a fantastic view of Hard Rock Hotel and the Crowne Hotel. Truly spacious, good size for 2 person. A separate TV room if you have kids on board, a dining area for 5 or 6 and a living room with another TV! The bedroom - you'll wake up a beautiful scenery. The super huge bathroom consist of a family size tub, sinks for HIS and HERS, wardrobe cleverly located in the bathroom and of course the shower room that fits the whole family. The thing about Conrad Macao; rubber duckies, Conrad bear for souvenirs (that you are allowed to take it with you), silk in-room slippers and fluffy bathrobes. Fiji water as complimentary room amenities, little bottled…",50
"Pros: Got upgraded to the suite which was quite nice. Overal, it is a brand new; well designed hotel.  Cons: Lounge is under re-construction; the replacement lounge (is for diamond members; but the manger was kind/reasonable to provide access to it); it is in a high traffic area; right next to the check in counters; and shops; with little privacy -- probably good for entertaining; but bad for working.  HHonors Gold Member",40
"It was a ad hoc trip to Macao. When we arrived the reception, the supervisor, Prem approached us immediately and assisted us for check in. Prem was very friendly and helpful. He even upgraded us to a very nice suite. Our trip was impressed by the room, the staff and the services of this hotel. Frankly speaking, I have been working for a 5 star hotel in HK for over 12 years, the services in this hotel was amazing! We will definitely come back to this hotel next time.",50
"Love this hotel for it's service, from bell service staff, reception, housekeeping...are always courteous and smiling. Special regards to their bell service staff, which they have go the extra mile to help us during our stay.  We booked a deluxe queen room (with view of the hotel pools). Room size is big compared to most of the hotels in Macau, and equipped with 2 decent size of queen beds. It has a Nepresso Machine with 6 free coffee pods daily, branded tea bags, and free milk in the fridge. Bathroom has both bath tub and shower cubic, and double sink. This hotel is located within the Sands Cotai Central, which houses the Sheraton, Holiday Inn and Conrad. It has 2 casinos within, and some shopping.  Overall stay is satisfying, but there was an incident I wasnt quite happy. On…",50
This hotel is AMAZING - a true 5 star experience.  Staff are exceptional and go above and beyond in order to make the stay memorable. My suite was on the 38th floor and was truly spectacular.  Decadent and opulant hardly describe how beautiful the rooms are.  This hotel only opened in April this year so everything is still very new and has a real classy feel about it. It is in a great location just across the road from the Venetian where there is good shopping if you can't afford the highend shopping like myself. I cannot wait to return to the Conrad and also Macau.  I did not expect to love Macau or the Conrad as much as I did. Do yourself a favour and treat yourself.,50
"Stayed at the Conrad, on my recent trip to macau. Loved the country and loved my accomodation! Stayed there for 3 nights and further another 3 nights after a two days visit to HK. The first time was a little put off with the blinker attitude... but later realised that it was the normal behaviour and not meant to be arrogance or non-coperation...the problem was the inability to communicate in English. But getting to the English-fluent staff, staying here was just awesome and great!Met very warm, efficient and excellent folks working here.....made me feel proud and complete to be a HH member.Was upgraded to a delux suite at the first stay and even a higher one at the second stay.....a suite as big as my apartment back home! The hotel is very well placed wrt  convenience to travel,…",50
"I spent my wedding anniversary in Conrad Macao. The manager upgraded my room to grand suite, allowed early check in and late check out , also offered us a bottle of red wine and a chocolate cake with wordings on it at my choice. The staffs were very friendly, nice , professional and helpful, I will definitely stay there again next time I visit Macao !!",50
"Early this year I came when it was just opened . The service and the stay was great. They have not disappointed me this time either,  except I missed the top floor lounge which is now converted. The view of the boulevard and Macau from the room is impeccable. The room is almost everything I can ask. The manager Nicole and her staff are great. I would not mind to return next visit.",50
"If you have status with HHonors, this is the place where you'll feel those perks better than any other property in the entire Hilton brand.  To start with, as a Diamond, you're directed to check in at the Executive Floor where the concierge desk immediately gets you a drink of your choice.  While checking you in, the endlessly hospitable staff is waiting to get you any details you may need about restaurants, sights, etc. in the city-state.    The lounge itself is hands-down the best Hilton lounge in the world.  Everything is fresh and delicious, down to the honey that's dripping from an actual honeycomb and the famous Macanese egg tarts as good as anywhere else in Macau.  Not only is the lounge excellent, but it's authentically Macau.  As for the room, the views were spectacular…",50
"Maybe it is new but the service standard is simply inferior to most 5 star hotels.  The exception was the concierge manager. The room is clean but I would not consider it big for hotel standard in Macau. The pools that I viewed from my window look rather small for such a hotel.  Design of the lobby is not so appealing to me as well.  The shopping mall at Sands Cotai Central is not as good as the Venetian mall but hopefully when the connecting bridge is fully completed, it would be more convenient for the hotel guests to shop at Venetian mall. Overall, I am quite disappointed.",30
"I went to Macau for 2 nights with my wife and young son to celebrate my 40th birthday. Was hoping for something special and the Conrad did not disappoint. From the moment we arrived, we were treated like royalty and were given a truely amazing experience. The hotel staff were polite, helpful and really went out of their way to make you feel welcomed.  Upgraded to a suite with a view over the City of Dreams and the Venetian gave us excellent views in the evening. The suite was wonderful and tastefuly decorated to very high standards. The attention to detail and willingness to help was outstanding.  An abundance of shops and restaurants within the hotel complex and just a few minutes walk to the Venetian and City of Dreams for many more shops and entertainment.  If you are…",50
"We wanted to explore the old Macau and Taipa and to do it all required an overnight stay.  The hotel opened very recently and is immaculate - still has a slight 'new carpet' smell.  Our room was huge and immaculate - overlooked the Venetian hotel complex, City of Dreams etc - all geared to shopping and gambling.  The concierge and reception staff were first class and very helpful.  There are loads of eating options as this complex is linked to the Holiday Inn and Sheraton - and will soon be linked to the Venetian.  The hotel runs a free bus service from the ferry terminal at Taipa if you are coming over by fast ferry from Hong Kong.  You can walk to the old town of Taipa (go past the Venetian and use the footbridge and travellator to take you to the town - allow 15/20 minutes)…",50

I booked double queen room and was upgraded to junior suite , room was really nice with great view , everywhere is clean and mattress really comfortable.  Head of Concierge and team were extremely helpful and took initiative to recommend itinerary for each day via a personalised letter.   Room facility is top notch as you expect from Conrad , but there are additional personal touches which is a pleasant delight, including the Nespresso machine with options of light to strong coffee, little lucky ducky , and the bear, and also the strawberry with dips which is kept chilled in our room. Extremely great service :)   All staff are very friendly and…",50
"This is our first time booking at Sands.  Even the reception area of Conrad sign is not very prominent and difficult to locate, lucky we met Conrad's relation manager Paweena and thank you for her clearly explanation and arrangement.   The room she arranged to us was spacious, well equipped and comfortable.  Other staff are efficient, well manner and helpful.  The housekeeping staff will always greet you with a smile.  The check out process is fast and smooth.   If free wifi service can also be provided in the room and not only available in the lobby would be much better.   Conrad Macao will be our first choice when we visit Macau again next time.",40
Stayed in the Conrad in August. Very impressive hotel just opposite the Venetian Macau. We arrived at 10am but were made to check in to our rooms at 2pm. There’s nothing much to do as the shopping gallery was still being furnished on the 2 and 3rd floors. Very limited food choices with only a few restaurants in the area. The room was very nice with nice luxury touched. The pool area was relatively big. Apart from the strict check in and check out times this hotel is quite nice!,40
"For people who travel to Macau a lot, they will know that it's not a city famous for its services.  So it came as a great surprise for me that around 10 days before my trip, I received an email from Mr. Herbert Leung, Assistant Chief Concierge of Conrad Hotel, offering to assist us in making touring or transportation arrangements, booking a spa treatment, reserving dinner, getting tickets to any performances, etc and asked if we are travelling with kids and offered to arrange something nice to them.  I replied the email telling him the age and name of the little girl travelling with us and they sent us a plate of cookies with angry birds made in sugar on a plate with her name written in chocolate together with a hand written card with Disney princesses stickers on it.  She loved…",50
"I've stayed at quite a few luxury hotels but this is the first one that truly made me feel like a VIP.  A few examples: As a Hilton HHonors Gold member I got upgraded to a nice suite with a great view of the surrounding area. Shortly after I was shown my room by a guest service agent, the bell service duty manager visited to introduce himself and give me some information about nearby attractions I could visit. Both of them left their card and asked me to contact them directly should I need anything. Every time I got out of the elevator on the ground floor, a friendly bellhop greeted me, asked where I wanted to go and escorted me there. The evening before my departure, the bell service manager even sent a hand written card to my room thanking me for my stay and informing me at…",50
"We were offered an upgrade to a Suite which we will take happily. The room is immaculate with all the goodies except for INTERNET! Why all the hotels should charge for internet connection? Anyway the hotel itself is very good because there is not much gamblers and Mainland Chinese around.  We had dinner at the chinese restaurant of Conrad. Don't compare this with Golden Leaf in Conrad Hong Kong. It is no match. Don't waste your money.  We will recommend this hotel as a slightly cheaper alternative to the Four Seasons. Having tried most of the newer hotels in Cotai region, we will stay in the old town for our future visits.",50
"It was an ordinary looking hotel but with surprising experience inside. We had a good experience staying there! The staff were really good, friendly, polite and always with a smile. They even upgrade us to a suite with a huge sitting and dining room, a warm decorated room with all necessary things you need, The bathroom is stylish. You don't want to go outside once you enter the room. Their buffet breakfast is excellent, they had variety of food to choose.Though I stay for only 1 night, I had a memorable evening.",50
"One of the only hotels in Macao that does not lay claim to having a casino.   Has a great ambiance as you walk through the doors, fantastic service, guest rooms luxuriously appointed, walkway to casino or Venetian property .  The Titantic Exhibition and the Human Bodies Exhibition was on so saw both.   Titantic was awesome , one of the best exhibitions I have seen.   Quick visit to the old part of Macao where the Portugese settled.  Fabulous facades to buildings, totally different feel altogether.   Believe it is only a quick trip across the border into China where you can spend the day shopping with familiar brands at a fraction of the cost you would pay elsewhere.  Also some gorgeous day spas to settle into for part of your day.  Easily accessed by fast cat from Hong Kong ;…",50

Dear Conrad Macao  My name is Watanyu Wong, and I would like to give a compliment letter to your staff, miss Paweena Waraha during my staying on 12-14 of September 2012 (I don't remember my room number, sorry) I would like to thank her for a warm welcome since she realized I'm from Thailand, it felt like home when you can be able to communicate in own language while you're abroad. Miss Paweena Waraha escorted me and my friend for many things, introduced hotel's info, given direction to restaurant and places, given info about shuttle buses etc. She was very friendly yet very polite. I've been in Macau several times, this is my first time staying @Conrad Macao and this is the first time I have ever met hotel staff who can speak my Thai,…",50

"My wife and I made a quick visit to Macau after doing some business in Zhuhai. Chose the Conrad which turned out to be a very good choice. Staff very accommodating, hotel new and sparkly, rooms clean and well sized, bathrooms well appointed. Only in Macau for a couple of days but overall, very satisfied with our hotel choice. Enjoyed the ""high tea"" in the lobby restaurant area. Would recommend for business or pleasure. Perhaps only negative is that it is some distance from the old town.  The fitness facility for the Conrad was undergoing some construction at the time of our visit but we had access to the Holiday Inn facility which was convenient and acceptable. Great pool area!",50
"Best service I ever received from hotels in Macau in the last 10 years! Chandran - the on day duty manager at the front office greeted us in person during the check-in process, and was flexible enough to upgrade our stay with a spacious and luxurious suite!  We were highly impressed by the facilities in the room and the personal service at the hotel. Looking forward to another stay in the near future!  I would not hesitate to recommend the hotel to my friends. Thank you very much for making our stay so special and memorable!",50
"I'm a HHonors Diamond member based in Hong Kong and usually struggle to find anywhere close to redeem my points apart from the very expensive Conrad in Hong Kong. So it was a nice a surprise to discover that there is now a Conrad in Macau. I booked a City View deluxe room on a points+pay deal for me, my wife and my baby daughter who is six months old.  We got into the shuttle bus at the Taipa temporary ferry terminal and check in was a breeze at the hotel. We were personally escorted to our upgraded (junior suite) room which was very nice and almost tip top condition (one of the false cupboard fronts near the entrance had fallen off - it was fixed next morning without us asking).

I am in Macao for business a couple of times a year and have been travelling to Macao from Australia via Hong Kong for the last 4 years. The Conrad Macao has put the destination back on the map as far as a prestine corporate hotel experience. Be it a corporate trip/conference/event or even personal vacation I could not more confidentially tell you that I have not had a better experience at Four Seasons HK, Shangri-la HK or even the new Ritz Carlton in Hong Kong. The team in Macao really need to be congratulated! From arrival the doormen/women are courteous and welcoming. The lobby is gorgeous with the check-in conveniently offset to the…",50
"apart from the delayed check in, everything else is perfect. It's perfect for a coffee bug like me as there is a nespresso machine in the room. It's a huge huge room with iPad dock and a huge plasma tv and the view is like Las Vegas although far from it. Must go to the pool and soak up the sun, it's fantastic and everything is so new and grand. Very much love this place and the gigantic pool",40
"3D2N trip with family. Upgraded to suite with breakfast with Hilton HHonors gold membership. Areas deserving special mention: Suite was of excellent standard - size, cleanliness and value-for-money Service and amenities was thoughtful to the details - especially when we travel with a child. Family with children, including infants can rest assure the this hotel will take care of you and those whom you love. Breakfast - large variety, clean and good food. Pools, especially the heated ones at 33 degree Celsius is Like Like Like for children and their parents. No worry of getting chill. Some may think it is too small but it may not be cost effective or may even be environmentally unfriendly to have heated pools of olympic size. Areas that will give it a 6-star: Entrance is difficult…",50
"Been staying in this hotel in late September. Few comments: 1. Hotel entrance is bit difficult to be found, This may just a minor problem as hotel had arrange staff to escort customers once you just arrived in the arrival hall to the hotel lobby. 2. Free wifi is not available in room.It should be provided as this is quite a basic stuff for tourist. 3. If you had pay for a meal with the room, timming it are more flexible than other hotels as it provide buffet breakfast and lunchn 4. In roon nespresso machane are great for coffee lover 5.pedestrian flyover connecting the cotai sands and venetian is in progress, which will make me to travel to venetian more convenient in the future 6. Swimming pool is a bit small  Overall, the hardware and sofeware of this hotel is execellent.",50
"I only stayed for a night. I booked the rimowa package with breakfast and they upgraded me to suite room which was very nice.  The staff even showed me the room and gave me a brief introduction.  The only drawback is the whole hotel area over 80% of the staff speak to me in Mandarin. The native language should be cantonese. When I reply in english or cantonese, half of them cant understand me.  The buffet breakfast had great variety of food but the taste was poor. It is china standard but nothing close to macau / hong kong standard.  I hope the hotel can improve their taste in food and train the staff to great in cantonese or english.",40
"Stayed with my family, the pool is equipped with warm water which is very good for little kids, the amenities inside the room impressed me, such as Conrad Bear during turn down, a Conrad duck at the bathroom, a little bottle of candies, Fiji water, JBL iPhone / IPad dock, it's amazing!!!! ",50
"Room 1314  Not sure where to start as improvement is needed.  Please note that my stay was in July 2012 so improvements may have been made since then.   I was really looking forward to staying here as I have fond memories of my stays in other Conrad facilities. In my mind, the Conrad brand is considered a “fancy schmancy” five star hotel. If you read my other reviews, you will see that I range from guesthouses to Super 8 to Shangri La’s. I really do adjust my expectations accordingly based on the hotel/motel type and cost.  The room itself was beautifully decorated but had a strong sewer smell.  Great seating areas with a sectional sofa, nice comfortable bed, separate tub and shower, multiple coffee and tea choices.  Incredible bathrobes. Very cute Conrad duck (clear with dice…",30
"Best service I have received so far with the great Corad Brand. It is def. a good solid choice in Macau. Room is clean and luxury with the Aromatherapy products which I last time saw it was in ""The Club"" in Jersey Island. Staff speak good English. It is a little far away from the sights but its a great escape from the Venetian chinese crowd and smoke. The mall is brand new so dont expect too much btw.",50
"A very new hotel and briliantly located. Didn't travel to other places just stay within the area you will find all sorts of entertainment and food.Got a room upgraded to suite. Very large bathroom and service was excellent. Suana and jaccuzi is lovely. Didnt use the pool - looks small to me but cant complain about it , is not a resort. The bed was a bit too hard for me.Overall service received was great.",50
"The Conrad is a luxurious, reliable hotel as are all hotels under the Conrad brand. It's centrally located on the Cotai Strip, within easy reach of the City of Dreams and the Venetian.   The lobby is imposing with a high ceiling and a faux Himalayan feel. Staff were welcoming and efficient, a concurrent theme throughout our stay. We stayed in a deluxe room on the 33 floor with a city view; good view of the city although the blackout curtains did come in useful in blocking out the big flashing Sands sign on the City of Dreams next door.   The room was spacious with all the amenities travelers have come to expect - gourmet teas, nespresso, Fiji water, etc. I liked the special touches the Conrad has - the little teddy bear given on turndown, the rubber duckie and the complimentary…",40
"Both my husband and I enjoyed staying in Conrad Macau very much!  The hotel is clean and tidy.  Service is excellent! Special thanks to Mr.Chandran Morgan, Front Office Duty Manager! The day I stayed in Conrad Macau was my birthday, the staff there is too kind to give me a special arrangement, very impressive!",50
"We have travelled and stayed at many places around the world but the Conrad Macau was a definite highlight. We were upgraded to a Superior Suite which was just that, superior.  It had a lounge and dining room, media room, powder room, a monstrous bedroom with big king bed and sofa and a spectacular bathroom with round bath, a huge shower and equally large self contained toilet.   The Club Lounge was closed for refurbishment but had nightly cocktails in the Lobby Lounge.  We were quite taken aback that Moet was included free of charge for the two hours.  The cocktails (food) were quite tantalising and very 5 star.   The hotel now adjoins two casinos, Himalayan and Pacific (this opened whilst we stayed here). The facilities around the hotel including restaurants and shops were…",50
"I visited this hotel this weekend and had a blast? Here are the good: room was unbelievable. Spectacularly clean and spacious. Jacuzzi bath, coffe maker, complimentary water, slippers, robe, iPod speakers, nice amenities. Extra tv, karaoke room. Great staff who opens doors and offer compLimentary water.  Pool w nice showers and free lockers equipped w comb, tooth brush. The bad: no microphone for karaoke or karaoke disk. Long 20 min cab line.  Spa was under construction.  Food was overpriced and not great value.  There was a free ferry bus to the hotel.",40
"This is by far the most enjoyable stay in Macau. It was my birthday weekend and Edmund Tan from Conceirge  organised birthday surprises and also gave my husband & i  really helpful & well thought list of places to visit & dine; thoughtful handwritten letters & notes. The hotel room was pretty new & comfortable and we really liked the bedroom slippers, plush bathrobe, nice shanghai tang shower gel set, teddy bear, toy ducky-so cute!!  Great room service too as I asked for extra slippers to go to the poolside. The white sangrias at the poolside was AMAZING. The best sangria we ever had. This is the 1st time i experienced exceptional service at the poolside where there gave us cold towels, evian face sprays, iced-grape popsicles etc during the 4 hours at the pool.

"I visited Conrad Macao Cotai Central with my wife for a short trip (mainly seeing friends at Macau) few days ago & we're both impressed by the overall facilities & staff performance. We were assigned on 23/F with lovely pool view & the room was very comfortable (it would be better if free WiFi privided in room then no need to go downstair.) .  We appreciate very much with the staff ""Henry"" (House keeping) who was very friendly & patience though kept returning few times for filling stuff we needed. The effiency & helpful check-out service by ""Suki"" from the counter of Front Office. Sure, we would love to return this hotel for experience some more about the facilities & services we haven't tried during this trip (due to our rushing schedule). I think 2 to 3 days would be the best…",40
"From the date of I made the reservation, I already felt so warm as firstly, they replied email extremely fast and since this trip was for my girlfriend's birthday, they said they are going to arrange a small gift for my girlfriend, finally they sent us a birthday cake into our room with a handwritten card!  The most impressive upon reservation stage is Edmund from concierge team, he helped us to reserve table in their outlet, give us recommention. His professionalism is the thing I have never being treated before.  Upon arrival we dropped off from the coach, a staff already there and lead us to the reception for checking in. The staff is professional and friendly, the process went smoothly.   The room is so huge with JBL iPod / iPad / iPhone speaker but the most impressive…",50
"I visited Macao in July and went to check out the new Conrad Macao hotel and Sands complex.  My first impression of the hotel lobby was that it was beautiful. Moreover, we were highly impressed with the Concierge team (especially Edmund) who were there ready and waiting to offer us as much advice as we needed on the local area and all its eateries.  After leaving the hotel, we were already convinced it was a no brainer to ensue we stayed at the hotel for my birthday celebrations.  A couple of weeks later, my friends and I booked a couple of rooms at the new Conrad Macao for my birthday weekend celebrations.  Whilst checking in to our rooms, the hotel staff we very attentive and courteous.  I was also impressed that they already knew from their notes that i was there to celebrate…",40

"After I've been to Macau for a few times and stayed with different hotels, perhaps Conrad has the best hotel room/suite I've experienced so far.  The hotel is conveniently located in Taipa, only 5-min ride from the Taipa pier by the hotel shuttle.  My husband and I had booked the Summer Escape package that included one night stay, MOP500 dining credit, and one way business class ferry ticket, which is a pretty good deal.  When we arrived the lobby, their staff gave us immediate attention to assist with the check-in.  All staff at the front desk speak fluent English.  This is perhaps the first time I didn't have to speak Chinese at a hotel in Macau.  Surprisingly, they upgraded us to Club Premier Suite.  When we saw our room, it totally blown us away.  The suite was huge and…",50
"Conrad Hotel Macau is located in a complex shared by Holiday Inn and Sheraton Hotel which is 5 minutes away from Macau Airport & Taipa Ferry Port.  Venetian hotel is located across the street and City of Dreams is by the side of Conrad.  Big comfortable bus is available free on 15 minutes interval from Hotel to/from Airport/Ferry Port /Border with China.    Club Suite Room is huge and luxury with 1 bedroom, 1 living room, 2 bathroom, walk in closet, 3 TVs.  Service level throughout Conrad Hotel is excellent and club lounge is the largest within Conrad group occupying the whole 39th floor.  We enjoy the breakfast which has wide spread of choices with excellent quality food.  While Conrad and Venetian both belong to Sands Group, we prefer Conrad's Club Suite Room over Venetian due…",50
"This hotel is incredibly nice. The staff are all very good as long as you stay in the Conrad property itself. As soon as you go downstairs into the casino, the employees are Sands and not up to the standards of Conrad. The property is a little odd since the Holiday Inn shares the same building. I arrived by the bus from the airport and it was very easy to find. All of the casino buses are located on the right-most side of the arrivals level when you exit the baggage claim. It takes just a few minutes to get to the property from the airport. I had a club suite on the 32nd floor and it was great. It had two bathrooms and had very modern decor. The suite was gigantic. Make sure to get a city view room. The pool view rooms will only have a view of the Sheraton next door. The club…",50
"We booked on a summer escape package - basically a room with breakfast and a ferry ticket back to HK included - for a Friday night. Maybe because its low season and a little less busy, we were offered a free upgrade to a ""premium "" suite. The room was HUGE ! Wow. We also were given a few hundred dollars of hotel credit, which we used for a pre dinner drink and drink by the pool on Saturday morning.   Great hotel, excellent staff and service. Nice pool. The Breakfast buffet was very good also, as good as any we have been to on our travels. It's reasonably central location for all the other ""attractions"", and our biggest tip would be make full use of the free shuttles that take you to / from ferry, airport, Macau centre etc. Taxis seem to be a bit scarce. The Conrad is also right…",50

When in Macau, we normally stay at the Venetian Hotel but after reading the reviews of Conrad Hotel on Tripadvisor, we decided to try it and booked 4 rooms.    From the moment we arrived at Conrad Hotel, we received warm  welcome  from the helpful staffs of the concierge.  At the reception,  we were checked-in by Ms Vanessa, who is a  very gracious  and  accommodating  front desk supervisor.   We requested for  2  rooms with  2 queen size beds each and 2 rooms with king size beds.  We were all happy with the rooms that were assigned to us especially the upgraded rooms with king size beds.

Let them know if you are celebrating a special occasion the staff organized everything for you, like Kota and Nicole ! A big thank you to club manager Nicole, and her team, they really made a memorable stay for us! We defiantly will b back for that!",50

Since the moment we stepped foot onto the hotel we were contiguously amazed by the quality of service this hotel has to offer. Our room was spacious and beautiful, service of staff was friendly and warm, food was delicious, I can go on... Usually I have a hard time traveling because I generally find the quality of the bed at most (five star) hotels poor, but I loved the bed in our room. We were there for 3 days and at least half a dozen staff knew my last name and recalled details about me from our earlier conversations and asked how my stay was.We had access to the executive lounge, it…",50
"Upon arrival at the Conrad Macao we were greeted by warm, friendly staff who made us feel very welcome. We were lucky enough to receive a room upgrade and when we entered our suite, we were blown away. The suites are beautifully-appointed, boast great views and offer sumptuous bathrobes that are such a pleasure to wear. I wanted to buy one straight away!  The management staff, particularly Chief Concierge Edmund, went out of his way to provide excellent recommendations which made our stay even more memorable. The staff always tried to go the extra mile, despite the occasional lack of English.   In room dining was reasonably-priced and good quality. We also dined by the pool and the burgers were very good.  Overall, we really enjoyed our stay and would recommend this hotel to…",40

We booked the Summer Escape package which included two nights in Deluxe Room, daily breakfast/lunch at the Grand Orbit, $1,000 spa/dining credit and one-way first class ferry tickets.  Upon arrival at the check-in, we were delighted to be given an upgrade to the Club Premier Suite, which was 1,679 sq ft – bigger than our flat in Hong Kong. It featured a huge living room, a TV room, a master bedroom with a separate big bathtub and shower area. The bed was very comfortable and we had great sleep.  There is a pool deck in the hotel but it is relatively small, compared to the Venetian and Galaxy. That did not appeal to us at all so we decided to spend our time…",50

Plenty of marbles in the bathroom and the bath amenities were divine. Room service was great and the food was delicious. Bedding was comfortable. Check in and check out were efficient.All staff I encountered have been friendly. The big plus for me is the TV in front of bath tub, I have always liked this feature a lot.   Management team is attentive, willing to help and had a genuine passion to make this one of the best properties in Macao despite all the tough competition on Taipa (eg. Banyan tree, Okura, Altira, Crown, Four Seasons etc).   Dynasty 8 was also a great signature restaurant as we had dinner there and food was fabulous.The spring…",50
"My family (2 adults with 1 kid) stayed at the Conrad Hotel for 2 nights in the 2nd week of August.  The hotel is new and clean with great bedding.  Most of the staff are very nice with a smiling face.  However, as a resort, the swimming pool is too small.  It will definitely discourage guests to swim in such a pool.  Our room is on the 26th floor and we experienced regular noise, some vibrating sound like aircraft?? all through the day & night.  We don't know the source of such noise but it has inevitably affected the sleeping quality which counts too much for a good hotel.",30
"I have stayed here a handful of times and let me say overall service can be improved. At times most of the hotel can be average at best and since it's a Conrad that is not really acceptable. Especially as a platinum starwood, diamond hyatt and plat Marriott customer as well I am used to staying in hotels.   But I will say this. When in the lounge I feel right at home. The whole team there is wonderful, attentive and friendly.   I especially enjoy the duty manger, Nicole. She has always been extremely helpful to make sure all of my needs are met. I stay at the hotel for this team and the nice rooms. ",50
"We were here this afternoon and everything was really great so far. They upgraded us to a suite as we are a diamond member. The hotel staff were so friendly and helpful, taking every detail seriously. The club lounge is huge and the food served was good, not to mention the free flow of Moet & Chandon champagne and lots more wine selection at cocktails hours. We were really spooked for choice. The room can't be better, it's huge with nice decor. I love the bathroom amenities, the toiletries from the UK brand Aromatherapy Associates smells so good! Food from the room service was good. The rate we paid for includes a pair of free dirst class ferry ticket back to hk and a lunch. Its really value for money. The ambience here is definitely better and more relaxing compared to those…",50
"stayed here for 6 nights the room and staff are very good the business center was also very good as was the casino and all the facilities ---  the one problem I had was the late night room service food quality should be upgraded I also had an overpriced  meal a the restaurant ""Pink"" if not for the average food I would give this place 5 stars",40
"Stayed at the newest addition of luxury hotels in Macau, the Conrad. Service was excellent and super attentive from arrival to departure. The hotel is part of a big complex yet still feels very intimate and cozy, that's a real unique benefit in Macau. The Concierge team and guest relations ladies were always there and really switched on. My room was spacious, luxurious, big and awesome with no attention to detail missing (coolest thing is the bathroom duck with golden dice!). Good idea is to book the Club Floor as the lounge is great for breakfast. Had a dim sum lunch at 'Dynasty', the Chinese restaurant at the Conrad which was really good too although it took me a while to figure out it was part of the hotel as restaurants are located in the mall. Would always go back to the…",50
"I am a frequent traveller and stayed at the Conrad Macao in July 2012. My experience was less than satisfactory. We checked-in at the Club Floor and were met by a snobbish Duty Manager - Nicole Chen. She was rude, moody, not friendly at all and with limited vocabulary. Considering the money we spent on food, drinks and accommodation, we expected a reasonable level of service. My husband and I wondered why Conrad Macao hires someone who is so inexperienced and with such poor manner. We certainly won't be returning to this hotel again. No thanks.",10

Got met at the ferry terminal by a GRO escorted to the shuttle bus service from the ferry and was greeting immediately upon arrival and shown straight to the room by Cecily Chan the Director to Front office and Kajana Sivakumaran, the Guest Relations Manager.   The service was first class and a special mention must be given to Sean Cho and our waitress at Dynasty * I think her name was Lanny,  who was always on hand to answer any questions and take care of my two small children 5 and 7 who were treated like the kids of Rock Stars and greeted by name wherever they went.  We had a great experience and the staff could not do enough to ensure our stay was perfect.   All the hotel staff spoke excellent…",50

We stayed at Suite room and used executive club lounge on 39th floor. The club lounge was huge and it was just excellent. It was so convenient and quick we checked in and checked out at the club lounge (39th). Our room was big, everythigng was nicely arranged and the view of our room was the City of Dream and the pool of Holiday Inn which was fantastic at night!

We exchanged a few emails and he gave me a lot of tips in places to eat and explore in Macao.  When we arrived at the hotel, there was a long line waiting to check in.  However, all the check in counters were open and the staff were working efficiently and professionally.  Surprisingly, we didn't have to wait that long to check in.  Our rooms were ready for us and everything was perfect - nice size, clean and with modern amenities like iPhone/iPod dock!  The turn down service was very nice and love the cute Conrad bears!

The property is very new so immaculate, all the furnishings and fixtures perfect and of a very high quality. (When the property Cotai Central is fully opened I believe it will generally become alot busier so enjoy the peace and quiet while it lasts).   Pool area, exquisite, warm pools too!. Room - luxury, comfort, everything you could need and more... I have never been so happy in a hotel room in my life.

Facilities in the room were what were expected of a 5 Stars hotel. Suite was clean and big at 1,100 feet and has two toilets (living and bedroom) and came with the usual 42 inch TV in living room and bedroom. There is even a small LCD TV installed in front of the bath tub so that you can watch TV while enjoying your bath. Upon checked in, I asked for a baby cot, and the service staff bought along a cot, baby food warmer as well as a baby bath tub into my room. First feel was this is a baby friendly hotel.

"Stayed at the Conrad for 2 nights and it was a wonderful experience. The room was large, enough to fit 4 regular size asian people, the bathroom was also large with a bath tub and a separate shower. The hotel is fairly new and every facility in this hotel shows a very high standard not only with the service but also with the what they provide in the rooms. the toiletries provided are of a good brand but would probably suggest to have Gillette shavers, the room also has a Nespresso coffee making machine which are being refilled everyday. Turn down service is also provided with an update for the next day's weather and a cute little Conrad Teddy bear placed on top of the bed.

With a minor exception from the confusion occurring when making the reservation I must honestly say that this Hilton Property is one of the best I have experienced in the world.

When we arrived, the fragrance at the hotel lobby was refreshing, reception staffs were very helpful.

"Our family spent a three-day, two-night trip in Macao, staying in the wonderful Conrad Hotel located on the Contai Strip. We loved the well appointed King Suite that we stayed in, with its pleasing color scheme, spacious bathroom. We enjoyed, in particular, the fluffy and welcoming bed-and-pillow combination. We were also very appreciative of the superb help provided by Mr. Edmond Tan, the Chief Concierge. He was able to secure for us some hard-to-come-by reservations for a special buffet and a show (both at different hotels) on extremely short notice. In addition, Mr. Tan provided a printed walking map with written directions and explanation for my hushand, highlighting spots for photographic opportunities, when my husband casually asked about where some of the scenic spots…",50
"This was my first time in Macau and I didn't know what to expect as Macau was more known for its casino than anything else. I've been to a few hotels which are catered to mainly casino's guests and as the service was never really particularly impressive to speak of, the service standard in Conrad Macau really stands out by a mile.  When the group of us arrived in Macau, we were picked up at the ferry terminal by the hotel staff with a sign bearing our name even though we had not arranged for it in advance. At the hotel, we were also greeted at the door by the Guest Services Manager, Sri Ram, and his team who helped us to take care of our luggage.   The room that was assigned to each of us was really lovely - spacious, clean and comfortable. The bed was comfortable, and the…",50
"Macau is often misunderstood as only a gambling mecca.  It certainly is and any hotel on the Cotai strip is away from old Macau and designed to get you interested in gambling.  Same is true for the new Conrad, which shares space with the Sands and Holiday Inn (the largest in the world), and is located across from the Venetian.    Still, this is a wonderful property with gorgeous rooms, beautifully appointed and huge bathrooms.  The service has its glitches (some due to language issues, some due to poor management and training) but they WANT to impress and often do.  Plus, I found the staff to be truly dedicated and helpful...very willing to go out of their way for me.

We've been staying in the Suite in Four Seasons, MO and Grand Hyatt in Macau in the past 3 years and sorry to say, it is really not up to standard! The room is ok, as a suite in the Cotai, it is small, The suite in FS is mush bigger and with much amenities in the room. You just won't expect you need to ask for a DVD when you stayed at the club suite which I will think it is something very basic! But you need to call them to ask for a DVD, then they told you we have to wait since it may not be available (Can you imagine you need to share this machine with the guests from both Holiday Inn and Conrad!). Then what till the DVD arrived, it…",30
"I booked two rooms for two nights at this new property and we had a fantastic time.  I read a lot of reviews prior to booking this hotel and in trying to think of new information all I can say is that this is a luxury hotel that manages to make you feel comfortable.  The service staff are truly amongst the best and genuinely seem happy to help and speak casually and comfortably, as equals and not strained client-to-staff type interactions. For example, after a simple question the next morning we found slipped under our door a note from the concierge with more ideas and suggestions, and a personalized walking tour map).     The rooms are well equipped and thought out, with details like high quality surround sound speakers in the bathroom that can be controlled from the TV above…",50
We recently returned from our first trip to Macau where we stayed at the stunning Conrad Macao Cotai Central. We traveled as a family group and had booked 4 club rooms. The club staff are nothing short of amazing - nothing is too much trouble for them and they will (as other reviewers have stated) - walk you to the street or the other side of the hotel just to show you the way. We were constantly amazed at their attention to detail and genuine warmth. Rooms are massive and well appointed and the club afternoon tea and happy hour is fantastic. We would go back to Macau just to stay here again.,50
"Had just come back from my 1 night stay at Conrad. This hotel is impressive, the staff was very professional,really went all out for you with a smile, we didn't know where the Sands shuttle bus was and the staff walked with us all the way to the other side of the hotel just to personally show us where the bus was :)..the check-in was fast,used the express check-out which was really convenient...just one minor hiccup,requested for some sugar and they came and thought i was asking for candy...they clarified by asking whether i meant coffee sugar..i said yes that's it, so they apologized and quickly came back with some sugar,other than that it was a splendid stay,big room with nice comfy beds,even had a iphone dock and a nespresso coffee machine,one of the best i've stayed…",50
"I would like to write my recent trip to the Conrad Macao was just amazing! I spent 2 fantastic nights there. Upon arriving the hotel, my family and I were warmly greeted by Sri Ram and his bell staff who were so attentive towards us until we felt like royalty. Upon check in we explained to Sri Ram that this was the first time that our family had visited Macao thus he kindly brought us to the concierge where Edmund planned out a 2 day trip around Macao. He was so enthusiastic and patient with us, even printing out maps and a walk about plan for us! Kudos to him and the wonderful planned trip. Once done, Nicole Lee took us up to our rooms, she did an excellent explanation about the hotel and where the club room was and where we could have our breakfast. She was very kind to us as…",50
"I am most impressed by the fantastic service at the Conrad. We were ushered into the reception by Mr Sri Ram. He gave us a walkdown on the best places to tour in Macao, he helped to explain to us the best transportation routes around the island. Mr Sri Ram also introduced us to Mr Edmund Tan who was most helpful and planned a day's tour for us. He also printed information on historic sites and provided us with the road map for a day's tour. Following which Ms Nicole Lee ushered us to our rooms. She not only showed us around the room but also briefed us on the services provided in the hotel. Mr Sri Ram also brought us to the 39th floor where we were greeted enthusiatically and given a tour around by the attentive Sean Chu and his fantastic team.   I have never been to Macao and…",50
"Absolutely loved this hotel. I just returned yesterday and and the service there is excellent. I've booked in a Club Suite and enjoyed the great time at the Club Lounge and the Club Suite very much. The efficient check-in, and check-out, the helpful staff at the Club Lounge,  which made me very impressed!!! Special thanks to the handsome and helpful Club lounge Manager Sean, he was the best of the best. I am certainly will be back to stay in Conrad hotel again.",50
"To find Macau Conrad among he Sands Hotels group can be confusing when you arrive the in common main entrance where the God of Fortune stands; and it did take us a little while to find out where to register (you found the elevators first and much easier. )  As a newly opened hotel, there was expectantly some growing pain but I would think proper signing is badly needed.    But I got excellent service once I connected with the Hilton Honor desk, and Poy and Andy got us to the executive lounge for drink and snack among the great and panoramic view of Macau, Taipa, Airport and the China beyond.   The rest of checking in process was painless. The hotel is brand new and room is very nicely appointed, with plenty of facilities and great view of the Sands, Venetian and the City of…",50
"Had spend 4 wonderful nights at Conrad, firstly when steping in, the fragrance at the hotel lobby was refreshing. After that, we are greeted with Nicole upon arrival and excellent explanation on the arrangement and perks for Hilton Gold member. Special thanks to Jiawen, for suggesting a wonderful planned day trip in Macau peninsula and arranging excellent seats for watching 水舞间 performance. Overall, will rate a AAA rating (highest investment rating) to Conrad Cotai for ""investing"" our travel experience with it. Great jobs and keep it up. ",50
"Stayed at many of Macao's top hotels before, but Conrad Macao certainly stands out. Being a hilton gold member, was upgraded to the junior suite and the room condition was immaculate. Chief concierge Edmund Tan went the extra mile to assist with ferry bookings, even though Conrad did not have any arrangements with turbojet; where he could simply have asked his staff to assist. All in all, no doubt the number 1 hotel in Macao.",50
"We stayed at the Conrad Macau for 2 nights earlier this month. We live in Hong Kong so have pretty much visited all the 5 star hotels that have opened in Macau the past decade.  Thought we would give the Conrad a try seeing that it is newly opened with competitive promotional fares. Our group booked 5 rooms for a weekend R-and-R trip.  My expectations were tempered by some of the negative reviews below. However, I must say that we experienced none of the problems that were mentioned.  In particular, although we mainly only speak English (and do not speak any mandarin), we did not encounter any difficulty in communicating with any of the staff, including in making requests over the telephone, when ordering, etc.  If they spoke mandarin first, they simply switched over to English…",50
"Stayed in hotel for two night  Mixed feeling, room is great Rest it could be better Check in process was difficult and late Rest of the stay was good",40
"This Conrad Hotel only opened its doors about 2 months ago. You still enjoy the new hotel smell (if you like this). Staff is extremely friendly, though sometimes a lack of training is apparent. For instance, the guy who picked up my laundry didn't speak any English but insisted to discuss the laundry form with me. Or during breakfast, they regularly brought filter coffee after I ordered a coffee from the machine - acknowledging my earlier order only after I refused the filter coffee ... But the property is really nice, with large rooms and an even larger executive lounge, if you qualify. The location is on Cotai Strip, where most of the casinos, shows and shopping malls are located - but a bit away from the town center.",40
"We thought that the Conrad Hotel was a luxurious 5-star hotel in Macau but to our surprise, the hotel facility/service was below that standard. First of all, we found that the toilet in our Club Suite was blocked up on 2 occasions during our 2 night stay & had to call the guest service twice to get their plumber to unblock the toilet.  Secondly, the food variety available in the Club Lounge was limited. We intended to take some hot dishes (e.g. the buns & dumplings) which was supposed to be available in the afternoon tea but having waited for an hour, we only saw the waiters taking trays of food in from the kitchen & then abruptly taking them back to the kitchen since all of them were still cold (it was already 4:50 pm by that time).  Tired of waiting further, we just took a…",20
"Since Conrad is one of the new opened, worth a try,  before checked, I didnt study much about this new Cotai Central casinoplex at all , only know Holiday Inn also opened at about the same time, surprise to know, both Conrad and Holiday Inn are actually in the same building, just matter of the front and back end.  It's interesting when check in, since the lobby is like located inside a forbidden city, 2 small door for in&out, service are Conrad standard, friendly, helpful and smooth.  I had a 2 queen-bed room type, the room is spacious, equipped with high-end JBL iphone/ipad dock, along with my fav in room gadget - nespresso coffee machine.  In bathroom also spacious ( slightly  comparble to Venetian ), I love the built-in TV at the tub but the signature Conrad duckie was a bit…",40
"I just came back from a weekend in macao. we went to the Conrad hotel with no expectation. We knew it was  only 2 months since the opening and we thought it would be nice to stay in a new clean hotel. To my surprise, not only clean, but also spacious rooms, staff hospitality and excellent help from all the employees. We stayed in a Club King Suit, and let me tell you, the room was bigger then our apartment in hong kong. The check in time was long and even though we booked a Club King Suite we had the same queue and waited around 10 minutes. The Club floor lounge is excellent and it is huge. Afternoon tea, cocktail hours 5 to 7 and an excellent clean breakfast. Guest officers at the club lounge are really nice and helpful. Sean , the Floor manager came to check on us every time…",40
"Just come back from Macau, can't wait to start to write this, the ferry was crowded, I am glad that they have Edmund Tan, the chief concierge to take good care of my return tickets, he noticed me once he think that might me a problem for customer. Everything is good, the room is clean and spacious. Apart from the check-in takes a bit of time, although I booked through the Conrad website and already a Hilton member, I still had to answer a lot of questions. If stay with kids, the pool is too tiny and small, comparatively to Holiday Inn which is even larger . Should have signboard to specific which pools is belong to which hotel.  I felt so embrassed being  advised to leave the Holiday Inn's pool when I already started to use  it. Apart from that, this hotel is the only hotel that…",40
"clean rooms? check.  nice breakfast buffet?  check.  good location?  check.  coming from the four seasons in hk, it was hard to be overwhelmed, but the conrad was new and everything was simply nice.  but the one thing that set this place apart for us was edmund tan, the chief concierge, who a week prior to our arrival, shot me a form email with some details on macao (this was our first time) and wrote that he could help us with any questions.  well, i had a lot of questions.  what is the best way to get there from my hk hotel?  what is the best bar view in macao?  can you get us tickets to the macao tower bungee?  can you book our ferry to the airport?  and on and on.  and to my pleasant surprise, he answered all of them courteously and thoroughly, completed requests with a…",50
"Had a surprise transfer from next door Holiday Inn. There was some hick-up at the check-in due to the confusion of the transfer. I have the feeling that some of the staff are still working hard to get used to the new working environment, which I hope they can learn fast for the upcoming high season.  Otherwise the hotel is truly 5-star, big room, very comfortable beds, huge bathroom... The swimming pools are nice and relaxing. In general the service is very good.  As this was my first and only night, I found it rather easy to get lost in the big complex. The breakfast buffet restaraunt is a bit of walking in the shopping mall. Perhaps the hotel should improve its road signs, or have more staff to help the directions.",40
"First off, I just need to say, that you will not find a better hotel in Macau with a higher standard and level of hospitality and service that we experienced here at the Conrad. The service that we had here for our 1 night stay was beyond wonderful. As we walked into the hotel lobby after we got off the free shuttle from the ferry terminal to the hotel, we were greeted and immediately shown to the front desk. Staff and other hotel personel were readily available to assist guests as well. Everything was very professional and efficient.   One thing that I would like to add as a suggestion though, is that there seemed to be a bit of confusion about among the staff at the front desk. My mom is a HHonors Gold card member, and when we asked the first person at the front desk (we were…",50
"The new Conrad Macau (opened April 2012) is a nice hotel, I stayed in a Club King Suite which was huge and quite well appointed, very comfortable beds and massive bathroom. The door to our room was sticking and when we checked in, the reception girl who showed us to our room thought she would call maintenance to get them to check it out. They did, at about 9pm and were there until 10.45pm. They genuinely thought they were helping out, but it was more of an inconvenience than anything else, particularly given the door actually did work. It should have been done once we checked out. We mentioned this to the duty manager and I must say the service and professionalism shown was excellent and much appreciated. In fact the service was outstanding through-out here; without the door…",40
"I had specifically requested to stay at this hotel after reading the great reviews online. However, during my stay with them a couple of weeks back for a business trip, I was utterly disappointed with the level of service quality at the Conrad. Quality of service was scattered all over the place, with the clear lack of sense of efficiency and direction. Not only that, the layout of the entire place doesn't even feel like I was staying in a proclaimed 5 star hotel. Basically did not feel the unique sense of belonging and the satisfaction of being pampered upon. Honestly had expected better service. On top of that, the main triggering factor was that I had specifically requested for a high level city view. Instead I was given a low rise floor that reeked of smoke with a…",10
"I spent four nights at the Conrad Macau and I was really impressed.  Others have mentioned how nice the rooms were and there's not much more I can add as my suite was certainly stunning.  However, what was most impressive for me was the staff.  Whoever did the training must be congratulated.  From check-in to check-out, I have never experienced staff that were trained so well.  The staff at the Conrad Club were attentive yet not intrusive.  I was escorted to the elevator after Breakfast every morning and they seemed genuinely interested in my opinion on whether any improvements needed to be made.  Everywhere you walk in the hotel, the staff smile and greet you.  They even stop vacuuming when you walk by in the hotel corridor.  On the occasions when I had questions, every person…",50
"We stayed as a family of four, with two inter-connecting rooms. Everything was perfect, starting with the very warm welcome letter I received from Edmund, the chief concierge, even before arrival at the hotel. he was then on hand to greet us personally and through the trip took personal care of our queries and needs. Service standards are uniformly high and all the staff extremely friendly. Will definitely be back!",50
"I booked the Conrad on recommendation from my travel agent based in HK. I was not disappointed. The head of concierge, Edmund Tan wrote to me a couple of weeks before I was due to arrive asking if I needed anything. Amazing as it was unprompted and no one has ever asked me if I needed anything before I arrived at a hotel before. I request soya milk and also some restaurant recommendations. I took up the offer of Edmund to help me book Beijing Kitchen (right opposite the House of Dancing Water theatre) and Tim's Kitchen (a one Michelin star in Hotel Lisboa). Both were of very good standard. The food in macau is quite good I found. Tim's Kitchen was slightly better then Beijing Kitchen. I pre-ordered peking duck in Beijing Kitchen and Tim's Kitchen in Lisboa Hotel had fresh sweet…",50
"Fantastic. This is one of the best hotels in all Asia. My wife and I stayed for our 25th wedding anniversary and it was just brilliant. The staff were superb, the facilities excellent and the attention to detail faultless. Don't bother staying anywhere else in Macau. Many thanks to Coco and Sean for looking after us.",50
"Just visited the Macau and stayed at the new Conrad Macao.  They have complimentary shuttle bus from either the macau ferry terminal or the temporary Taipa terminal.  The hotel is nearer to the Taipa terminal.  Make sure you take the shuttle called called the Macau Cotai Central.  Once I got there, it is right across the street from the Venetician.  The hotel was nice and was greeted by the staff.  They upgraded my room and got free breakfast as a Gold Hilton Honor member.  They do have a Club Lounge area but is made for the suites guest or Diamond member. Hopefully in the future, they might give free entrance for Gold member.  Excellent breakfast at the Grand Orbit and many fine dinings at the Cotai Central.  Definitely will stay there again.",50
"The Conrad Macao, Cotai Central is brand new - opening in April 2012. We arrived at the property to be greeted by name by reception staff (before we had even checked in), who had obviously been trained to exacting standards to provide a truly personal guest experience. The property is stunning, designed around a Himalayas theme, with beautiful restaurants and public areas. Hard to fault on any level! Stay on the executive floor and be in an amazing suite overlooking the strip. The attention to detail is incredible, whether the TV in the bathroom, the clock next to the bed that lights up when you pick it up, the great coffee machine, toiletries, etc. Orbit buffet was extremely high quality and very inexpensive. Hard to fault on any level, this is the best Conrad I have stayed at…",50

"My wife and I stayed at Conrad Macao 12-13 June and it was a fantasic stay we have ever. As a Hilton HHonors Gold member, our room was upgraded to Suite room which was over 1000 fts!!! Room is spacious with living room and bedroom. Check-in process was smooth with the help of Ms Nicole Lee who is very kind to take care of our needs. Bed is comfortable and we had a wonderful sleep at night. Room is quiet and got a view facing City of Dream. We were celebrating anniversay and there is a cake provided complimentary which make us very surprise.  Breakfast at Grand Orbit is excellent. There was a lot of food to choose, chinese, western, breads, cereals...etc.   Check-out process is smoothly with the help of Ms. Vanessa wong, the front office manager. We told her than Conrad Macao is…",50
"I stayed Conrad Macao last week, myself, it was just so fantastic!!! Every amenities are literally new and luxurious and the staffs are cannot be more helpful and friendly, outstanding hotel out of whole Macau city.  The city view room is spacious enough for 2 ppl (I was able to running around in the room haha), bed was so comfortable, the city view from my room was breathtaking... but the most fabulous thing in Conrad Macao is the bathroom!!!  I love bathroom so much and I almost slept in there not on the bed lol Bathtub was nice, so was toiletries, basin was super duper luxurious (marble finishes) and the size is huge (about half of the room size).  Only bad thing was, Cotai Central area is still under construction, not many restaurants or shops opened yet. But that's fine,…",50
"The hotel is new and is part of a complex that includes the Holiday Inn and the Sheraton Hotel.  The Conard claims to be a 5-star hotel and in many respects this is true.  Staff are ultra attentive, the room was large and well equipped, and the pool area, spa and gym were of equal quality.  However, except for the quality of the staff, nothing was really outstanding, just the usual acceptable 5-star quality.  What is really off putting with the Conard is that everything else is missing that one usually associates with a 5-star hotel.   By this I mean restaurants, fine dining, a decent bar.  The Conard is in effect located in a Casino and a rather large Shopping Mall.  The hotel lobby is separate from the Casino and Shopping Mall but that is about all. What passes for a bar is…",20
"Spent 4 nights here on business. Rooms were exceptionally clean and large and well kitted out. Service from the staff was brilliant in that nothing was ever a problem, they were just so helpful.  On the only occassion they didn't deliver something that was promised - it was rapidly fixed with a simple phone call. Food at the conference lunch was pretty average. But rest of the food was fine. If you're staying there outside of business there are plenty of really great places to eat in the neigbourhood and in the old qtr.",50
"My family and I just got back from a weeks stay and had a great time. The rooms and facilities were top notch as was catching the hotels shuttle to and from the outer ferry terminal. Top notch casinos, shopping, and restaurants were all within a  short walking distance. Shuttle busses are close by which will take you over the bridge where you can easily walk the side streets and see the various tourist sights. As a very seasoned traveler I must admit their staff was the most attentive and helpful I've ever experienced. My compliments to Hamid, the Director of Operations and all his team for an outstanding experience. We'll definetely be back.",50
"We were thinking of staying at the Holiday Inn but for a little extra we chose the Conrad and were so glad we did so as this is truelly a five star hotel in all ways.  Firstly, unlike many of the Macau hotels we were given a room prior to the normal check in time (it was just after noon).  This was the first indication that the service was far superior and probably the standard for the Conrad branded hotels.  We were shown, in detail, the various aspects of our room which we found very personal and helpful.  The hotel is based on a Himalayan theme and that is only subtlely.  The slippers were the most praticle we have found in a hotel.  The robes looked like rainjackets which was amusing but this went along with the jungle theme.  The amenities were of a high standard, down to…",50
"What a great experience at this excellent hotel. Check in was quick and efficient. Our one bed suite on the 32nd floor was exceptional. Both the lounge and separate bedroom were spacious. The marble bathroom was very large, with large separate shower and oval bathtub. Lots of nice amenities, including gowns and slippers. The bed was extremely comfortable and the whole suite was both new and spotlessly clean.  We had access to the club lounge on the 39th floor which served a hot buffet breakfast, afternoon tea and evening drinks and snacks. The lounge was large, clean and comfortable. The food and service in the lounge was amazing.   Check out was just as quick and efficient as the check in.   Thank you for a wonderful stay and we look forward to returning in the future.",50
"Conrad Macau Cotai Central s located as the name suggests in the Cotai area; the newly developed stretch of reclaimed land close to the Airport and basically opposite the Venetian and next to City of Dreams. The Building is huge and basically split in two, half is the Holiday Inn and the other half the Conrad. The Lobby's are connected by some retail areas and a smallish Casino (By Macau's standards) but there are separate entrances and Lobby's with the guest elevators next to one another centrally located b/w the two Lobby's. The décor of the Lobby and outside areas is Himalayan/Tibetan styled; the Lobby and entrance in my opinion works well, the style is different, Asian inspired, rich and decadent but not kitsch and over the top! I believe it is a great move not to try and…",50
I had the opportunity to stay at this fantastic venue and couldn't be more pleased.  The service is first rate and the venue quite comfortable.  Well done attentive staff and management.,50
"The hotel is brand new and the service was great. We got upgraded to a suite and it was just huge. All staff were very attentive. The location is great as it is like 10 minutes walking distance to City of Dream, which is good if you are going to the Dancing House of Water. The new Cotai strip is connected to the lobby although it is not very big. The complementary breakfast buffet is inside the mall and there is a large selection of food.",50
"My wife & I just got back from a nights' stay at the new Conrad Macau.  We had the pleasure of having Club access and the service rendered to us was impeccable.   Every service member is attentive to your needs without overly intrusive.    The complimentary afternoon tea & cocktail makes the Club access price very attractive.  As an expatriate working in Zhu Hai across the border, we will definitely be returning and staying at the Conrad Macau. We hope they can maintain the standards in many years to come.  Highly recommended.",50
"A brand new hotel with great and clean environment. When we reached the hotel, there were not a lot of people (when comparing to holiday inn next to it). The reception worked quickly and give polite response. Besides, there were staff provide assistance proactively.   What's more, after we checked in, we used some of the stuff inside the room and we left there for dinner after a couple of hours. When we come back, we found that all the things were fixed and refilled. That's a wonderful service!",50
"I just spent a night in this new hotel in Cotai Strip and we are most disappointed with the poor, non-existent service of this hotel.  1. When we were lining up for taxi, we were being pushed in by another mandarin speaking tourist.  My husband told him to line up like everybody else but was shouted at and me, being a pregnant wife, felt threatened and looked to the usher at the taxi stand but he just looked on and did not attempt to mediate the situation.  We find this unacceptable as we feel it would be the usher's job not only to stand there (he did not even open the taxi doors for the guests) but really to attend to the line and make sure the passengers can be safely escorted off the hotel property.  2. We requested for a non-smoking room on a non-smoking floor.  However,…",10
"I stayed there last Saturday with my friend. It was a great experience. When we got off the hotel shuttle, staff helped to carry the luggage and bring us to the lobby (this is abnormal at Cotai hotels). We checked in at the Club Lounge, staff are nice and helpful. The view is fabulous at this 39th floor Lounge. The afternoon tea and evening cocktail are tasty. Suit is perfect. Love everything. The Conrad duck was waiting us in the huge bathroom. The swimming pool was the only disappointing spot in this hotel - too small, we can't SWIM. We would prefer to spend more time at the changing room for the steams and jacuzzi. Breakfast in the lounge is for trenchermen like us, it would be absolutely perfect if they have hotcakes and waffles!",50
"My husband and I just stayed at this gorgeous hotel with our elderly mothers. From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty, with special attention given to our Mums, who were attended to  and fussed over on every excursion through the hotel. We were upgraded to 2 fabulous, 2-room suites, with an ethereal view over the Venetian,  lagoon and Macau-city high-rise in the distant, misty background. The ''Himalayan'' decor everywhere is exquisite, right down to the uniforms of the front desk staff. I was so taken in particular by the beauty of the jacket, I asked if I could acquire one - to no avail, unfortunately.  We enjoyed the tasty offerings in the Executive lounge on several occasions and downed some delicious cocktails, including their wonderful, complimentary Lychee…",50
"This new property is part of the Sands Cotai Central development.  I stayed there on the night of April 17, 2012, which purpotedly was the first day that the hotel took reservations.  Traveled from Hong Kong by ferry, then boarded the free shuttle bus to Sands Cotai Central.  The lobby was quite nicely executed.  I felt the ambience was a cross between an ancient Chinese palace, and (weirdly enough) an ancient Chinese tomb - like the idea of the Terracottas.  Due to the way the Sands complex was laid out, the reception area, lift lobby, and the restaurant for breakfast (called Grand Orbit) are quite separated.  For example, after arriving at the ground floor, one needs to walk around 5 minutes, pass some shops before one can reach Grand Orbit, which is literally separated from…",50
