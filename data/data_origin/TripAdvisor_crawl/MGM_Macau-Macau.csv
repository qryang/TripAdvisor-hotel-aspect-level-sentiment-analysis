"A big thanks to their Guest Experience team especially Charlene who helped me a lot in arranging this big surprise for my friend! We really had a blast here in your hotel! The communication between different departments are really good!  We've been late to check in and the front office agent-Fai (sorry that I couldn't remember the name but I think is Fai or Wong...) also called to the restaurant to confirm our table will be reserved until we're here. He event escorted us to the restaurant, also gave us a brief of their hotel's art decorations. TBH, MGM Macau is really a great place for photos. Their VIP check in area is really a MUST visit place. The deco, the interior designs are luxury and beautiful.   The swimming pool is also one of the highlight of our stay. The infinity pool view over looking the Taipa area is SUPERB. their jacuzzi is in warm water and that's my favorite during this stay!  Breakfast are good, flavorful. I wondered if it's because of  COVID-19 so they wrapped everything with plastic wrap. We need to unwrapped it by ourselves and we found the foods are cold. Other than this, foods are really good. The xiao long bao is my favorite among all.   We really enjoyed our stay in MGM. Thank you for all the good services!…",50
My friend and I suddenly booked the room for friendship celebration. We arrived hotel in 30 minutes after the reservation was made. The staffs Vincent and George were friendly and we were informed that the room had been upgraded to a suite and the room amenity was setup as well.   The room was nice and comfortable. Room facility was good enough to us and the best thing was the complimentary minibar including soft drinks and beers.   The breakfast was rich and the portion was good for three. Checkout procedure was smooth by the staff Lucas.   I will suggest MGM to my friends. Thank you for the service provided and MGM is in my selection forever.,50
"The MGM Macau - this shiny 3 colored metal building sit on the outer harbour at Macau side, outstanding 3 layers elegant curve exterior is beautiful and classy, I believe you will give extra sights when you pass by this iconic building.  There was a typhoon heading to Macau before my visit, Mr. Fai and Ms. Jenny share couple calls to remind the weather status, for me to decide if I might want to change the staycation plan. They also take care of my restaurant reservation before my visit. The thoughtful cares from the guest relation team is not only during your stay in hotel and extend before your visit.  The hotel wasn’t busy as usual during my stay, I met Ms. Jenny at the hotel lobby and she lead me to my room for the in-room check in, I am delighted my room got upgraded to Grand deluxe suite with 2 bedrooms. This suite is not only huge but has cozy and modern design. Step in was a huge living room area where you can lay on the sofa to enjoy a pretty Macau city view, the 2 bedrooms also have similar view and included the Macau outer harbour view as well. It was wonderful to look at the azure shiny harbour that the first thing you woke up in this bedroom. Both bedrooms have their own bathroom, this luxury bath area has golden warm colour tone design that made me feel laid-back and immediately like to have a relaxation hot bath in their jacuzzi. I also like the lighting system as well as the AV system in this suite, they are cool and giving extra enjoyment for guest staying in this room.  Turn down service was very rush, the house keeping staff was just ring the bell and ask do I need to change towels and that’s all. He doesn't even keen to come in to tidy up the room and turn down the light/ window curtain.  Try out the Chinese restaurant in the hotel for dinner-Imperial Court. I quite like the atmosphere once I walked-in, in sight surely Chinese style decorations, the dragon relief pillar you hard to ignore, adding the dim and colorful lighting, that create a very modern unique atmosphere for the restaurant. The tableware are also echo with the restaurant atmosphere, symphony colored liuli material with Chinese pattern is really pretty. The foods was just ok and close to my expectation, but some dish was quite disappointed like the steamed crab claw, obviously overcooked that made the texture of crab claw and egg white are really solid, also cannot taste the fresh from seafood and the fragrance from the Chinese wine…just bitter.  The spa in the hotel is fantastic - the wooden and glowing forest theme is lovely, the breathing led light dots on the grass wall just look like the fireflies are welcoming you to walk-in to the forest for a relaxation time. The spa treatment was very pretty good as well, with the light nature background music. I nearly fall sleep during the treatment. Don’t miss out the wet spa facilities on the 2nd floor. There have steam room, sauna, relaxation beds, and the forest rain shower is the most I like.  Always like to enjoy lunch in Rossio at the hotel’s Grand Praça, you can have plenty sunlight in this indoor environment filled with Macanese decorations; seasonal installations that keeping refreshment for this square; lotsa tropical fishes swimming in the aquarium in the middle of the square; Sitting in these unusual combination environment for lunch made me feel I am having a picnic time in fairy tales world.…",50
"This was a very good experience at the MGM Macau Front Desk for enrolling a seat in a charity workshop held in MGM Cotai mid-July.  I was enquiring if I could enroll without going to MGM Cotai and Front Office Supervisor Mr. Simon Leung has helped me through the entire process. He called and checked with his colleague for information and procedure, it took me less than half an hour to complete the entire process. I was given a receipt as a prove of payment and email was sent in half an hour as a confirmation. In this way, can save a trip travelling from Macau to Cotai.   I would like to send my sincere thank you to Simon for his good service and he has shown his enthusiasm in his job. Keep up.  ",40
The room was big ang clean and staff are very helpful and accommodating. Pool area is nice and relaxing. Food was great and good presentation. Overall experience was superb! Highly recommended to my friends and family. ,50
"We chose MGM Macau to celebrate the start of summer holiday. We have availed the Macau Local package with the dining credit of $800 which we think is very practical for family spending. During check in, FO staffs are very informative by answering all our inquiries and giving some ideas on which places we could go around to. The rooms are very spacious with the nice view overlooking Taipa island with amazing amenities good for Adults and Kids alike. Staying with MGM Macau is definitely worth it, we will surely recommend it to our friends.",50
"Stayed in a villa, which was always a bit of a mystery to us because we could only find one single decent illustration of it through a set of photos taken by Tripadvisor, and it wasn’t even the one we stayed in.   Ours was an enormous 2-bedroom villa, with floor-to-ceiling windows facing 3 different sides, with 2 corners and unbelievable sea/city views. It included a karaoke room and 2 big jacuzzis, one of them with a view!  The villa itself was exceptional and it was paired with impeccable service from its staff, from front desk to concierge to guest experience, from decoration to amenities to food and beverage. A special thanks to Kin, Fredo, Fai, Jenny and Theresa for the top-class service, always with a warm smile on their faces. ",50
"This was my first time staying in MGM Macau, overall it is a pleasant experience.   We got upgraded to a suite and they prepared baby amenities for my little girl. We had a wonderful staycation here.  Highly recommended.",50
"Thanks for concierge team to assist on the decoration setting. Also Cyrus for the room upgrade, bobo Chan for the arrangement, Yannis for the the laptop and IT support. Without their effort the proposal will not be success and wonderful.",50
Super nice staycation in MGM Macau. Personally think it is the best deal in Macau and definitely the best view they have. Thanks to MGM Macau Guest Experience Team. Surprisingly my room was upgraded to a suite and the suite was excellent with large space and very nice amenities. They even provided kid amenities and plush lion for my son making him so happy.   Definitely the best hotel with the best staff in Macau. Strongly recommend to stay in this hotel. ,50
"A prefect family staycation in MGM Macau, from check in to depart the hotel, eveymoment we enjoyed very much. we will stay again in July for my aniversary.  This is the 6 months celebration for my baby girls and it was prefect. We got all mummy baby amenities in the room.   we look forward our upcoming trip in July.",50
"It’s a good choice to spend my hubby’s bday there at MGM Macau! They offered free upgrade to a suite with sea view and jacuzzi, what a blessing! We enjoyed a relaxing day at the gym and swimming pool, then a great dinner at Imperial Court made that day perfect. The hotel sent some Chinese bday buns to our room after dinner, what a hearty arrangement! The yummy in room breakfast wrapped up this wonderful staycation, but we were not in hurry to check out for a late check out was offered as well. We are planning to have a short-term vacation at MGM with our kids soon, can’t wait to have another great one.",50
"As soon as we arrived we already were greeted by a very nice staff. She also gave us a tour about the feature of our room and the operating hours of many facilities inside the hotel. The in-room breakfast was great with many options to choose from. You just need to call them and book in advance and the breakfast will be delivered to your room. The snacks, sandwiches and pasta that we ordered at the outdoor pool was tasty and the portion is more than enough. I highly recommend MGM Macau if you are looking for a pleasant stay.",50
"Our first good impression was being welcomed by the staff, Bobo, at the front office reception. Bobo expressed her concern to me when she realized that my residential building went ablaze in that morning so I had to quickly look for a hotel room for me and my two children to stay. She helped me to carry my suitcase and bags, and led us to an upgraded two-bedroom suite. She showed me all functions and features of the suite and amenities of the hotel in a gentle manner. Before asking for some baby stuff, Bobo had already arranged a baby crib, milk bottle sterilizer, baby bathing tub and a low stool to the suite. She was just being so thoughtful and kind. Another impression was when I was served by Simon at front office reception when I extended my staying after 2 days. Simon…",50
"My friends and I really enjoyed our stay in MGM macau. The staffs were very welcoming and friendly, I was impressed with the professional service provided by Miss Angela Choi and also Miss Bobo, they introduced me the facilities in the hotel very welly and I felt good being there as a hotel guest. I will be visiting again soon!",40
We have spent great days in MGM Macau last week. The room is nicely decorated with full set of amenities. The view from the room is wonderful! Staff are attentive and polite in all aspects. Great job MGM and will definitely come and stay for another time.,50
"マカオに入るのに体温を測られたり書類を書いたりしましたが来てよかったです。日本よりもコロナ対策がしっかりしてる印象ですね。スイートにアップグレードしてもらい素敵なワインまでいただきました！中華のレストランしか空いてないようですが快適です。  Macau seems much safer than Japan actually.  Noone knows that MGM provided special upgrade to suite with nice wine! Even though the only one Chinese restaurant is open, MGM’s hospitality is special. I have to go to the casino later ! Everyone should notice that Corona in Macau is not serious.",50
We stayed for 2 nights. Im impressed with the high technology room. We left our shopping bag in the taxi we request if they can review cctv to get plate number of the taxi. But the staff cannot communicate well in english. But definitely it Is Highly recommended 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼,50
"I guess my last visit was 2 months ago, the service is remaining as good as before ;) my parents are really happy to staying in MGM Macau, closed from tourist destination and the border back to HK. I’ll be back xD",50
"Highly recommended hotel. Staff was great, check in agent Alva noticed my birthday was a few days ago and sent a small pastry to my room, a very nice surprise. Check out agent Alex was great as well, very friendly. Concierge staff was knowledgeable when asking for directions. As someone who works in the same industry, really appreciate the small efforts the staff makes.",50
"A first class experience. From check in to check out, everyone made us feel special. Friendly and helpful staff throughout the property. Fantastic room with views overlooking Cotai across the water. They made my birthday very special with a wonderful welcome waiting in the room. Great location in Macau, easy walking distance to many other hotels, bars and restaurants. The only negative was the smell of smoke periodically wafting through the vents of the room from other smoking rooms. They even provided a complementary transfer to Cotai to our next hotel. A wonderful stay and much better than other hotels nearby including the Wynn. The first choice if in Macau again !!!",50
Went to this hotel because of the beautiful glass butterfly. The aquarium was stunning too so a great place for photos and selfies. Conveniently located with lots of shuttle buses to get you in and out.,40
"The staff at MGM Macau Pastry Bar was so rude.  I purchased a birthday cake online. Then I went there  to pick up the cake Today. I didn't go there on time, so they called me for 4 times. But I missed the call as I was in the meeting. When I arrived there I showed my purchase order to the staff for picking up the cake. When the staff was packing the cake another staff spoke to me and said that she had called me for 10 times today but I didn't answer the call. The way she spoked to me was so rude and like telling me that I have created a lot of trouble bother work and that is my problem I didn’t answer the call. Is that mean I have to stand by there and do nothing to wait for your call??  In truth that is so annoying the phone is buzzing when the meeting is ongoing. In fact that…",10
"Greet by friendly staffs as soon as arrived the hotel after a 4-hours flight and the heavy traffic to hotel. Front desk staffs are really friendly and always smiling.  I ordered a cake in advance to celebrate my boyfriend’s birthday, and they arranged and prepared well for us with addition souvenirs by the hotel.  I recommended this hotel for families travel too, as the hotel have great people with excellent hospitality that make you feel welcomed and home.  I would definitely choose MGM again for the future visit.",50
"Two years ago I was involved in a credit card dispute with the Bellagio in Las Vegas.  While it was ultimately resolved in my favor, it was so frustrating and time-consuming dealing with that hotel that I swore I would never stay at an MGM branded hotel again.  Therefore, it was with some trepidation that I broke that vow and booked the MGM Macau, but I needn't have worried.  This hotel is five star through and through, and the staff was incredibly helpful and attentive.  If you had problems with the MGM hotels in Vegas don't let that deter you from booking the MGM Macau.  I would recommend this hotel to anybody",50
"We had 4 nights here and had a Grand Studio corner room with great views across the river. We can’t fault the room or hotel. Service was up there with the best we’ve had. We found our mattress too hard and asked the front desk if they had any mattress toppers. Got back to find they’d put two toppers on for us and it was perfect. During our travels we’ve had some wonderful birthday treats from the hotels we’ve stayed in but MGM’s spread takes the cake. See photo. Our MGM lions are coming home for the grandkids. We chose this hotel as it was close to the old town and had a view over the river. I think if we visited Macau again we’d prefer to stay where the action is on the Cotai strip and it would have to be MGM Cotai. Having said that, the big plus of this hotel is that it isn’t…",50
I stayed one night with my family  Korean live in Hong Kong. We ve visited Macau several times but the staying at MGM Macau was really comfortable staying and unforgettable good memory.  Special thanks to Jason and his colleagues. Thank you much MGM Macau,50
"This is my be lated comment from last month. I was staying at MGM Macau with my boyfriend for our 2yrs anniversary. And the receptionist was so nice and kind! Give us free upgraded to 1bed room suit with ocean view ;) Also the hotel location is good, easy to get to the heritage sights. Nice place for vacation! THANKS A LOT MGM!",50
"This is our 2nd or 3rd time staying at MGM Macao. The room is spacious, bright and clean. Hotel reception and customer relations make us feel very welcome. Shopping centre and the casino are pleasure to walk around, food choice is enough for a 3-4 days stay, that you won’t have to worry about finding meals outside. Square 8 opens 24 hours. If you want somewhere less crowded, MGM Macao is a perfect choice. For Pokémon Go trainers, 2 gyms at entrance and 1 on the side is heaven. ",50
"First visit to Macau, with a friend recommending the MGM Macau.  What an amazing experience.  A beautiful hotel, and the most wonderful staff, who went out of their way to make us feel at home.  The room we were given was exquisite, with wonderful amenities.  The jacuzzi bathtub was so nice I could have spent the entire trip there!  We dined at the Rossio for both dinner and breakfast.  Again, wonderful staff, and the food was fantastic.   I would like to at least add one negative comment, but I truly can't find anything such to say.  I would highly recommend this hotel for your stay.  You will not be disappointed.",50
Really spectacular main lobby nicer than the one in Cotai. It is near the Wynn in Macau so worth visiting the two of them. Nice harbour area outside can get free shuttle bus from macau peninsula to the cotai/taipa hotels.,40
"Once again, I would like to appreciate MGM Macau hospitality, Louis's Concierge service and Jason’s check-in service in VIP hall.  On 7-July Macau Family trip, we choose MGM Macau again, it was a perfect and pleased accommodation experience in this trip.  While arriving lobby, everyone friendly said hello, “welcome back, Mr. Lai"". Meanwhile Concierge advisor Louis was waiting us in vip lounge, receptionist Jason help us to proceed check-in, gave us a very detail and useful hotel information which includes amenities, aquarium, and room features… also welcome drink, it is summer now.  Louis and Jason’s service let me feel he is an friendly, enthusiastic, charming, well-trained and professional receptionist. MGM Macau generously upgraded the room to 2 bedrooms suite.

"I kept my luggage at the MGM concierge. They gave me a luggage tag so I can retrieve it. But due to certain circumstances, I was unable to retrieve my luggage by myself at that time. So i gave my passport to my friend to retrieve my luggage for me and as per concierge the luggage cannot be retrieved and questioned why my passport is with my friend. So my friend called me to talk to concierge staff to prove that I gave her full permission to retrieve the luggage in behalf of me. After wasting one hour of conversation and procedure, the staff requested me to write an authority letter and attach passport together and email them, so my friend can retrieve the luggage. By the time they receive the email from me and the authority letter it is still not enough. They still keep on…",10
"If you are in Hong Kong and want to get pampered, take a trip over to Macau for some fun.  You will not be disappointed even if you are not a gambler. The hotel properties have so much to offer. Gourmet restaurants, luxury spas, cocktail bars and 24/7 casinos will keep you busy.  Look for room specials ahead of your trip to save hundreds per night. All reports are major developments so find anything and enjoy.",50
The service is cordial and the equipment is exquisite and luxurious. Thoughtful about the needs of adults and children.Let people completely relax and get a rest environment. There is also a hearty and delicious breakfast. I feel very satisfied with the accommodation experience.,50
"I booked this hotel in the ferry peir but a clerk in there miss spelled my partner's name. So for that reason, i and my partner need to wait about tweenty minutes. but they lead us to the vip guest room and also offer an upgrade our room to the one of the best room in their hotel even we check out the very day. It was a real shoke when i steped in this room. Awsome view and really nice interior .. It was the best hotel room i've ever stayed also thank you for your good care about your customer:)",50
"Macau is a foods' lover's paradise, but MGM hotel provides more than upgrades : delight. Bliss. Superior comfort. Amazing service, not just small details : everything was wonderful. I had decided to spoil mother for her 80th birthday ; no place on this Earth could have been more appropriate than this address. We were constantly treated as if queens -and this means much much more than bed size.",50
"My deluxe room is upgraded to a sea view one. It’s a rainy day, so the scenery outside is grey. Spacious room with a superb shower. A bonus is the soft drinks in fridge is free. Amenities in Gym Room on 3/F is great and spacious. I’ve tried the buffet breakfast that costs MOB$220. Dining place is quiet but not so many food to select. Compared with Wynn Macau, this one is not so grand, but meet the basic needs.",40
"We travelled to Macau (Via HK) on our way to Bali from the UK.  We were picked up from the airport by the hotel shuttle, which was efficient, but it dropped you at the opposite side of the hotel.  It was not an issue, as we needed the exercise after the long flight and jet boat across.  The hotel itself was stunning, the staff very friendly and accommodating.  The casino offers lots of variety and is a lot of fun.  If staying in Macau, we would recommend the MGM Hotel",50
GREAT STAY IN MGM MACAU. Friendly staff and good room view with good room decoration. Delicious food. Will recommend my family and friends to stay here. gym and mini bar is free of charge  HAPPY MEMORIES,50
"Went to Macau for a few days to get away from Thailand heat (and play at the casino, just a little)  Had dinner at Rossio in the MGM Macau - an upscale buffet, supposedly Vegas style. We went on a Thursday night, so NOT on their seafood buffet night, but we ended up eating crab claws for 2-1/2 hours with unlimited wine, including a very decent prosecco for less than 60usd each.  Decor - full marks. Airy, spacious, uncrowded, stylishly casual  Food - 4/5. The only complaint was that selection was just a little thin...4 kinds of sushi, carvery with chicken, pork, beef, pretty ordinary stuff but well made (which frankly is better than the reverse). The seafood corner (on the not seafood buffet night) consisted of decent sized boiled shrimp, a Portugese style ceviche and the…",40

Great environment with great staff. Upgraded to a suite on 22nd floor with a very beautiful view. Come back often. Steven checked me in with good smile.  Hope to bring my friends and my family here to stay!,50
The hotel is located by the water on the Macau side and is only a few minutes taxi or bus ride from the ferry terminal. This hotel has very friendly and helpful staff. The rooms aren't overly big but spacious enough. The hotel is very opulent with an array of high end shops and restaurants and well as some more reasonably priced asian eating places. The seafood buffet was quite nice but expensive as was the buffet breakfast. It's a 15 minute walk into the old town part of Macau and the Wynn casino is right next door. I'm not a big gambler so the casino didn't do much for me. Hotel courtesy bus doesn't start in the morning until 9am which is a bit weird so we were forced to use a taxi on check out.,40
Verged. the staff is very nice.So enjoyed stay with my friends here.people very nice.we arrived hotel so late.feel so tired.Check in very fast.so we got the room key soon.Staff also very professional. I hope can visit this nice hotel very soon.,50

All of the staff speak fluent English, Cantonese and Mandarin and were very friendly and eager to help.   I would also highly recommend using the free shuttle service! It was a great way to get to/from the the airport and the Cotai area. We were not asked to show proof that we were staying at the hotel every time we boarded the shuttle.  My only complaint is that we were on a non-smoking floor and people were still smoking and leaving…",50

I want to make a special mention of Louis at the Concierge. He was ready to help at a moment's notice. He quickly helped us to make taxi reservation in order to go to the city center.

"It’s my 1st time staying MGM Macau even though I came to Macau many times. I booked a sea view room of this hotel for 3 nights through an agent website. The receptionist was so polite and care us for check-in. Fortunately, we got an upgrade room to 1-bedroom suite. The room is very spacious with a little pantry and a city view bathroom.  We ordered room service last night, the service attendant provided an excellent service to setup the table and served us the meal! In general, the hotel service is very expressive to me. I highly recommend this hotel. ",50

"The mgm Macau is very beautiful and it is famous for arts. The staff is smiling to us and offerred  water to us when we approach to the counter. Mostly surprised us is they upgraded us to the two bed room suite which made us trip more memorable. Even the staff coco and cici escorted us to the room, and introduced us the beatifiul suite.

We had a great time in MGM Macau. The front office service is impeccable 😬. Good large rooms and great restaurant choices.  Rooms were well cleaned daily and sheets changed as well. Loved our stay in this hotel. ,50
"It was a WOW experience in MGM Macau.  My Super VIP guests stay in here for total of 5 nights during the peak season (mid-autumn festival), from the check-in services to departure, they stayed in the room with a great firework view on the mid-autumn festival night, my VIPs were amazed by the hotel staffs, the enviroment, the rooms, the arrival amenities, and the great customer services.  I kept hearing my VIPs' great comments about MGM Macau. Especailly thanks to Concierge Alfredo De Asis, with his coordination among different departments in the hotel, (bell services, transportation arrangement, front office, room reservation, F&B...etc.), Alfredo De Asis paid attention to every details to ease my work looking after my VIPs.  He gave me and my VIPs an extraoridinaries experience…",50
We decided to spend a night here 9/11 on our way to Bali. The hotel is new and amazing!  The service upon our arrival and the amenities  provided were fabulous. Definite recommendation for anyone unsure of where to stay in Macau. Thanks!,50
Our recent trip to Macau allowed us to visit many different hotels. Amongst One of the few that we saw was the MGM Macau. We took a bus to the older part of Macau and walked through the hotel. We saw the beautiful Atrium and the huge Fish tank  that stood in its midst. The area was beautiful and had an area where guests could sit and enjoy the beautiful surroundings.  I am enclosing a few pictures for your pleasure and viewing. It’s a Grand hotel with opulence and amazing furnishings and artefacts. ,50
The staffs are very friendly and provide The excellent  service! I like the lobby that have fish tank. Mgm macau also has free shuttle service to different border points. I really enjoy the stay and will definitely come back again in the future!,50
"Its my 1st anniversary and would love to enjoy a night with my wife. The original booking was a Grand Room, weekend price. I have also arranged to order a flower bouquet and a booking of dinner. Telling the CS that its my anniversary and would like to secure a King bed room. That's the start of the non-stop surprises and extra offers provided by MGM Macau...  - Louise, the CS that continuously contacting me for all the arrangements, with superb services. Working during his holiday also. Thank you and the team! - Upgrade from Grand Room to Grand Suite (thats huge offer! great luxurious room!) - Welcome anniversary cake, decorations in bed, chocolate cake. Everything perfect. - Great flower bouquet arranged at arrival. - Extra offer of drinks and cake during dinner - Surprise…",50
"Beautiful hotel right in the heart of Macau great places to eat in the hotel. The pool deck was very nice. I enjoyed the smoke free casino that was a pleasure. I encountered some really nice staff who were very helpful. Lorry and Chim Ru from the concierge helped me with dinner reservations and my  booking for the ferry to Hong Kong, they were very friendly and displayed excellent customer service. Lychee the hostess from Rossio was very nice and helpful. Eric in room service as well provided excellent care in setting up our dinner in the room. A hotel is only as good as its staff and MGM Macau delivers in all areas. Thank you for a great two night stay. ",50
Stayed for just night but check in was super helpful and in English no less no translator app needed huge plus.  I have business in the area opening a new center they gave me hand written directions as i did not have data service and went out of the way to make sure i had everything i needed.  5 stars for sure the breakfast buffet included for free was excellent western food taste done right as well as traditional Chinese options.  The fridge was also stocked with free drinks cola water and juice.,50
I just checked in to MGM at 3pm (checked in time) and was told I can only have 1 room the other one is not ready and they do not know how long it could be! Then we took 1 room and went up and the key did not work and could not access the room then had to go all the way back to reception from 20th floor and had to stand and wait for them to issue a new key! And finally was told the other room will be an hour for it to be ready.    The first receptionist staff was awful.  Good job I went back downstairs and got someone more helpful.  I expected more from MGM I am very disappointed with the service and don’t think I will be coming back!!!,10
The hotel staff is very pleasant and friendly. This was my first time here love the hotel room and the experience at there beautiful pool was refreshing after a hot day sightseeing will recommend this place,50
"We had a very pleasant stay with MGM Macau on 13 June. The room was cozy and comfortable. Beyond that, we would like to say thank to Front Desk team and concierge for their friendliness and outstanding service.   We arrived on a rainy day, after spending some time enjoying our room and the nice view, front desk had recommendations  us some restaurant choices all within 10 minutes walking distance, also mentioned there’s a 24-hour grocery shop nearby so that we could pick up snack and drinks on the way back. We appreciate the thoughtfulness and prompt service from the team. The next day after check out we meet Mr. Kin Chio he helped us on planning our day trip. He made triple sure we knew our way around as we did not have data and cell receptions in town. We had been well taken…",50
"The service is very good! I have arrived around 45 minutes earlier, then I was taken to enjoy the wet facilities. The lady attendant Heng was very nice and she immediately offered cold towel and water to me when I was enjoying the foot jacuzzi. Therapist Pina was very professional and good, she realized that I have very stressed shoulder and back, after finishing the treatment, she handed some “wellness tip” cards for me. I will recommend this spa!",50
"Let me first say, the customer service was very very nice! When you first arrive and approach the desk, you are greeted with a warm welcome. If you have any question or concern, they will be glad to help you in every way. Our room....well, I love the automation they provide in our room. Also, they provide you with free drinks out of the refrigerator and that was impressive! The room service is super nice and friendly. It's a beautiful hotel with a beautiful staff. I didn't find any bad things about this hotel.",50
" The checked in staff was not professional as a 5 star hotel staff, chit chat with the colleague next to him during the process, the smile was not for welcoming guest but the conversation with his colleague. ",30
This was our first stay at MGM Macau and we had a good experience and will return on our next trip to Macau. Rooms are a good size and comfortable. We had the sea view which gives the room a plus for sure. My wife likes it because she was in walking distance of 'the old town' with its small back streets and local shops and restaurants. overall a very good experience. Front desk and concierge staff efficient and accommodating.,40
One of the best pastry in Macau. I wanted to buy unique chocolate for my grand parents abroad. The breakfast set here is also reasonable price. Cakes and bread made is also recommended. Service here is remarkable . ,50
"New decor at the lobby in MGM Macau. My son is happy to see the aquarium there and use his own camera to take the photos. Those nice giraffes and birds look very amazing and inspiring. Each season has different decor, 2 years ago was full of butterflies. Haven’t stay in MGM Macau this time as we stayed in MGM Cotai.  They have free shuttle bus travel between 2 properties. ",50
"I would like to appreciate MGM Macau and Eric Lei's service in Concierge.  On 28-FEB Macau trip, we choose MGM Macau to stay, it was a perfect accommodation experience in this trip.  Since arriving lobby, receptionist Eric help us to proceed check-in, gave us a very detail and useful hotel information which includes amenities, aquarium, and room features... His service let me feel he is an enthusiastic, charming, well-trained and professional receptionist. He is also a very generous guy to share information of local attractions or iconic Macau restaurants.   Once I need additional service, such as anniversary cake, champagne, rollaway bed, ground transportation booking and luggage deposit, I only ask Eric for help, because he always provides precise and fast service during MGM…",50
"Simply the best hotel I have ever stayed in.  Booked a Queen room but was given a complementary upgrade to a suite. Photos speak for themselves. Staff all spoke good English and were super helpful. Acidently tried to check in at the VIP hotel reception, instead of being snotty with me (as they would in the US ) the recprion girl was really sweet and helpful, they assigned a Bell hop to take me to the main reception, he insisted on taking my bags, stood patiently while I checked in and messed around being ferry tickets from the concierge. He then took me to my suite gave me a guided tour of all the controls and offered to pour me a drink from the large minibar.. I usually hate tipping, but I tried to tip the guy a few hundred MOP (he had more than earned it) but he refused,…",50
"We were upgraded from Grand deluxe Ocean view to a stunning Suite room which is very clean and well kept. Was puzzled the service staff did not open the heavy doors for you at the VIP lobby. Special commendation to Manager Mr Cyrus Lei for his excellent service. Good restaurants and beautiful deco. Though disappointed with Rossio as the special arrangements did not happen for our silver wedding anniversary celebration dinner, the overall experience was good. Would stay here again.",40
"it's a fantastic place, even you don't have time or budget to stay in the luxurious hotel site like this. It's definitely worth visiting, especially during this time. There is a really great decoration site in the plaza. Do join the dreams",40
I came here for my first visit to Macau. The hotel was absolutely stunning. The suite we stayed at was very beautiful. We enjoyed ourselves very much. The service was top notch. I would definitely recommend this hotel.,50
"Well we found our trip quite tiresome  expecially after a 12 hour plane ship and the mad rush to the train phew , one thing not a lot of respect from the locals for the older and pregnant on trains,  first in best dressed and pushing past people but I must admit I do love there trains in Hong kong but be willing to stand  lol but true, then we took a hour and half trip to little Vegas what a beautiful place sooo clean , we were  booked in the MGM hotel we didnt gamble at all just wanted  tosee the themes of hotelsjust loved Maccau every hotel was 5 star we only stsyed 3 days there and spent a few days in the older part of Hong Kong, which as I said love there trains  they know how to put a great New Year celebration been twice saw the New year in wow  but out of the two places …",50
"Overall service is good, staff are friendly and attentive, there are lots of art decoration throughout the property. There is a plaza between the lobby and casino where you can feel the artisty of Macau architecture while enjoying sunlight through the glass ceiling. Its a great place to have a walk and enjoy a relax afternoon.",50
MGM Macau more than confirms the long held belief that Asian hotels are second to none in the service excellence department. The dinning options in the hotel were too many to mention but I can recommend the breakfast in Rossio & The Imperial Court serves wonderful Chinese food. The One Central Shopping Mall attached the hotel offers enough shopping to burn a whole in your credit card so be warned .... The service throughout the hotel was friendly and helpful and the room was very spacious and classy....  Highly recommended...  ,50
"When our friends came at around 4:30, nobody assisted and welcomed there even there were lots of staff near the buffet.The staff who gave our bill do not know about the price mentioned in the website.The staff did not asked if we have membership card for discount, we have to ask her if they offer discounts",10
This is a very new hotel and as with most new places there will be a lot of teething problems.... However the dinner we had at Grill 58 was excellent food.  They were unable to serve the set dinner... I guess they have not yet gotten that part of their act together. We ordered a la carte and all of us enjoyed the food.  The servings were quite generous and could almost be shared... All in in all a wonderful evening.,40
"We visited during Chinese New Year. No matter the new MGM Cotai or MGM Macau service were all slow. The staff seems new, and don't know what they are doing. Try to avoid Janice Wong Cafe and Cake shop, and all kids areas.  Compare to Wynn, MGM is really behind. ",20
"Went for the Dinner Buffet and had a great time, nice and relaxed not rushed at all and took advantage of the extra all u can drink option too. Great service good food and as an added bonus I made a mistake with payment an overpayment which was promptly returned to me. So really honest staff too. Would I return ohh for sure if I were ever to be in Macau again.",40
"This hotel is a tourist attraction in its own right, especially around Christmas. Magnificent central area with huge fish tank, lots of lively restaurants to visit. Highly recommended for a walk through! ",50
"I had a fabulous birthday celebration at the MGM Macau. From my pick up at the airport, to my departure a few days later, i couldn't have asked for more. I felt as if i was the most important guests in the hotel thanks to the staff and especially Sarah, my guest relations host, who greeted me outside the hotel, escorted me to my room for check in and who helped answer any questions i had during my stay. She was incredibly professional and skilled, the MGM should take great pride in Sarah and the other staff i met in guest relations. I met friends for dinner. The hotel is not inexpensive, but for a special occasion, it was incredibly fun and worthwhile. I would love to visit again. Thank you to Sarah, Joe at the airport who guided us through the airport as if we were visiting…",50
"We Stayed here over night, but i guess over night is not enough, check in very smooth, all faces are smiling, from the bell boy very polite, the food amazing, the room so huge, everything is perfect, kudos mgm macao OVER ALL EXCELLENT 👍🏻👍",50
"I went to MGM with some friends for the octoberfest event, and a random caucasian pushed me when I am standing next to my table, I said that's not a route and that's guy push me like crazy. And the security came to separated him and then act like nothing happened, I requested for medical attention as my friend was hurt during the incident, the security seem don't care what I am asking for until I mention PJ (Macau special police). They arranged the guy for apology but I don't think the guy was told what he is coming for and seem the security told him I am going to say sorry to him. And I requested to call PJ again but this time the security let the guy left and I requested the security to check CCTV for the incident, after waiting for 20 min they came back and said the CCTV was…",10
"The hotel maintains in good condition. The room is clean, big and comfortable. With lots of facilities such as spa, gym and swimming pool, I can enjoy and have relaxing holidays at these facilities. There are several restaurants with different styles of food, the prices are very reasonable. Transportation nearby is convenient as well.",40
"Stayed back on Sept 2016, the hotel is really grand, luxury. Nearby the food and beverage outlet they have Valkyrie Octopus at Grande Praça! Promoting diversified cultural exchanges between China and Portugal . Inside those there is a hug aquarium. Super cool!!",50
I mostly recommend sea view room cause you will see the busy roads and bridges of Macau and enjoy the vehicles travelling around with yourself lying on a very comfortable and soft bed. The shower room is great! Everything was great! But there are a few restaurants nearby in which needed to be upgraded. Travelling is not very convenience because shuttle buses are only provided for several places and the location of where the buses parked is a bit far away.,40
"Hotel check-in was excruciatingly slow even though we checked in at 3pm and there was hardly any guest checking in.   My husband use a Company credit card and reception keep asking if he could use a personal card instead (It's a business trip for him). We find it rather odd as we never face this problem with any hotels we have stayed in Macau  (Grand Hyatt, The Venetian, etc) or any other country. It was to the point of getting annoying, we never get to find out why but in the end he get to use the credit card.  We were than informed we could not have our room yet as it is not ready; even though check-in time is 3pm. In the end our room was ready after 4pm.  Luckily room is ok and rather spacious with a small sitting area.  A little gaudy, but that is subjective.  Bathroom is…",30
"Haven't been back to MGM Macau for almost 6 years and it still looks great.  The room is not huge and glamorous compared to other new hotels in Macau but it's still very tidy and decent with a great seaview. The French restaurant Aux Beaux Arts serves a very fresh seafood platter and a killer crepe suzette so don't miss out!  And they're holding a gold exhibition till September which I think really worth visiting, most important it's free admission and opened for public :)  Heard they're opening a new MGM on Cotai side end of this year. Quite excited to check it out when it finally opens!",40
"I don't know but I felt like I was in one of those Hollywood studios back in the golden age of Hollywood. There is a massive aquarium in the lobby with fishes, coral and even a stingray that children might like. ",40
"We visited MGM in the month of April ,on Bussiness travel.It has great ambience which will attract everyone.Rooms are very spacious and U would love to be in that rooms,all rooms has great view where u gonna Enjoy your stay.Food is too good with great spread.Staffs are very helpful,Mr.Roy(GM) is great support .Thanks to MGM ,We had a great time in Macau.Definetely I would like to go back to this place once again.",50
Excellent hotel .. very majestic .. little issue if sharing room with friends . You don't have closed showers ..and you can not lock the door from inside .. it's easily  accessible .. interiors of the hotel is just amazing .. casino is huge .. ,50
"This hotel is absolutely depressing. The whole place needs a revamp. The lighting was absolutely awful and the design barely fit for a gambling addict.  That said, VIP services were excellent, and the food was yummy.",20
"My and my friends spent the weekend in MGM Macau hotel and casino. It is located on the other side (old area) compare to most of the casino. The hotel and rooms are is very nice, well design and the price was good too.",50
"MGM pastry bar. A quite worse impression for me to invite a friend who came abroad to have an afternoon leisure time, the staff offered bad manner for us, who should have put the stuff on the table lightly.. as well when we asked sth about the drinks, she even got no idea for that, I meant compared what's difference between two type of tea, a simple information the staff should have known who worked in a hotel, isn't that?",20
The hotel is in the MGM hotel in Macau.This is a very well furnished nice place. The food is very good quality and the service is great. There is a nice terrace for getting air or smoking. And last one ; very close the casino and entertaiment areas.,50
"Was in Hong Kong on a business trip, some of us got a spare day, and we took the ferry to Macau, stayed at this wonderful property. It is very welcoming, you would never want to leave:-)  The place has amazing restaurants catering to the taste buds of different regions across the globe. It is one of the best properties in Macau, the stay was wonderful, plus you could also roam around the hotel on the streets to take a walk and explore, it is so wonderfully located. The casino is so large and spread out, you could literally get lost if you dont ask for directions on the casino floor;-)   The staff is not only amazing but very helpful too. They are very courteous and humble, always ready to help.",50
"I visited Macao for work, MGM was the most spectacular Hotel that I had saw in that city. Magnificent, luxurious, precious! I can't forget it!!  I want to come back and visit it again! Lovely place!!!!",50
"Such a beautifully designed and decorated hotel, the staff were very attentive in all areas of the hotel and we particularly enjoyed being close to the old town of Macau.  All of the facilities were world class and the rooms are very spacious.",50
"This is a cassino resort connected to a mall. It has indoor and outdoor pool, spas, great restaurants and all amenities one can expect from a 5 star property.   Located close to the main center of the city, visitors may try to walk around however taxi is recommended.   Property is very well kept and seemed new.  The bedrooms are big, clean and very modern. Television offers many cable channels in english, room has free wifi, minibar, ironing board, hair dryer and desk. Air conditioning eorks really well and allow one to sleep in freezing environment if he so wishes (which is my case).  Bed is really comfortable (really hard to get out in the morning) with new linen as well as both soft and hard pillows.   Bathroom had all amenities one can expect from a 5star hotel, and had both…",50
"Great hotel I think it's the best one in Macau. The staff are great great and friendly . The scenery beautiful , the restaurants great and shops really good. I really recommend visiting this hotel if you stay in Macau.",50
"We stayed in a large 2 bedroom suite, it was amazing. Modern and clean and the view is fabulous. The rooms are spacious with a huge living room. The bathroom was large with a Jacuzzi and the best part is the power shower. Everything you'd hope for is in this suite. Check in was so smooth at the VIP lounge. Wifi is free. Overall excellent hotel that I would surely be back to.",50
We took the MGM shuttle from Macau airport. The bellboy was waiting for us on arrival. It's connected to an upscale shopping mall and The Mandarin Oriental.  Simon the manager met us on arrival and was very accommodating which made for an excellent start.  Our room was spacious with a great view.  You can walk to the city and do shopping the Grand Lisboa is close by and The Wynn was right across the street. You can catch the Wynn shuttle and go to Cotai to walk around the hotel/casinos. First time westerners and discovered this area to be very eastern. This was almost the last leg of our trip so we really wanted some familiar foods.  Lillian at the concierge desk was very helpful as it was during the holidays with some restaurants closed. Maybe five or six Western restaurants in…,50
"We had a large, 2 bedroom suite at the MGM. It was a lovely room and the hotel is beautiful. Everything you'd hope for, from a MGM hotel.  My only let down was the staff. Although friendly, they didn't make me feel special. Something they could learn from the four seasons.",40
"Good location and nice hotel.  Stayed in VIP hotel wing with private check in. Our suite was large and modern.  Service was very good, but not as good as the Parisian. Bed was much better than the Parisian but smaller.   Really liked the room and the hotel felt boutique.",50
"Designed to separate you from your money... well, you can't blame them for that.  This is a very modern and attractive hotel in the Las Vegas style. It is big and bold, but seems to lack ""heart.""  That is, it is designed to process large numbers of tourists and gamblers as efficiently as possible.  Can't blame them for that, either.   There were some quirks... my wife and I sat down on chairs in the lobby outside of the restaurant that was closed for the night.  A blue suited security guard came over to us and made us get up and sit on a nearby bench.... we were not allowed to sit on chairs.   The breakfast buffet was adequate, though not spectacular.  Guests can sit here, but not there.  Eat this but not that.  Like I said, they have Rules!   Location is not near the other big…",40
"We stayed here for a night and the room is very spacious. Wonderful sea view and the night view was awesome too. And we were only on the 5th floor, the higher floors must be even more breathtaking!  Very quiet room and clean. The bathroom has a standalone bath tub, a separate shower and a toilet, very fun for couple. Not to worry you can use the curtain to block the view from the bedroom.  However we found the beds to be quite small.",50
"The rooms are very bright, with views over the bay of MACAU,Staff at your service, surprising concierge. All your requests are made at any time 24/24 car with driver made available establishment to recommend",50
"Rooms are spacious and well appointed with large bathroom. Nice set of amenities. Good choice of restaurants and cafes (great pastries) and high quality food. Breakfast spread was varied and food excellent. Fitness is well equipped but unfortunately no steam room or sauna available, another 400MOP are to be paid to enjoy those in the nearby spa. Quiet disappointing, given that these features are standard in any luxury hotel worldwide. Overall a good stay at a reasonable price.",30
Though it has been opened for quite some years already the up keeping of the hotel in general is quite good. They are revamping the shopping area to give some freshness. The staff was very friendly and the lady at reception was very helpful and informative. ,30
"I was fortunate to be able to spend one night here in this grand opulent hotel in a lavish room. The hotel is very well designed, and everywhere seems larger than it is due to very clever architecture, and the opulence of gold in the surroundings gives it an opulent feel. The lobby could be better and have some seating , but that is only a small thing, as adjacent to that is the atrium with the fish tank in the middle. This is a very calming and open space and the cafe here is excellent with great buffet for breakfast, and then later as well. The desk staff are very friendly and extremely helpful, but due to the size and grandeur of the halls, lobby and open areas, it seems to lack a certain something, and has not a lot of soul. The room was very well appointed with a very large…",40
"We were given 3 vouchers for a night's stay at their suite, spa treatment and dinner.  When we arrived, one of the biggest hiccup was forgetting to bring the vouchers! Panic set in as we were not sure whether we were able to stay as we had by then travelled quite a distance from Hong Kong... When we arrived at the hotel, we were served by the Front Office staff named Meko. When told of our predicament, she proceeded to put our minds at ease and mentioned that there were copies of the vouchers that we had sent earlier and that we can couriered them after... A huge relief set in as we would otherwise have to go back to Hong Kong just to come back with the vouchers... Not only will it cost us time, it will cost us extra US$80 just to do so!

"I set the bar high, so maybe that's why I was disappointed. A little bit more from this hotel would have been nice. Being the MGM brand I assumed it would be pure luxury, but compared to it's American competitors like Wynn and Venetian properties, I did not think it was up to the same standard even though they charge the same price if not more. If they modeled the room after their American property, just like the Wynn does, I think it would be a much better room.   The property itself is very nice, but I did not particularly like the rooms. The hotel is old, and you could feel the rooms age. They should do some upgrades on the room. In addition, the room was a bit small and really had that typical Asian room feeling with a very hard bed which I did not like. I would much rather…",30
"If Las Vegas is too far from you, try the MGM Macau, get mesmerized with the welcoming views of the grand lobby and the Macanese Staff. Got extra bucks feel rich at the casinos and sign up with their membership to benefit if you planning for long stay.",40
"Absolute pleasure and worth the money. Rooms were nice and spacious with excellent view. They have excellent shuttle service which allows you easy access to the ferry so anytime. All the in-house facility was  perfect, the stay , staff , F&B and the hotels everything was just right !!",50
"Ideal weekend getaway in a dreamlike MGM world encompassing great art gallery, ""butterfly garden"" leading to the grand Cantonese restaurant and Rossio Cafe etc., and a grand well-managed smoking-free casino !  The F&B items in the Chinese restaurant and Western cafe and bar may be somewhat outshined by their excellent customer service. The Rossio's buffet tag is overpriced @ USD60 compared to its Chinese cuisines in Imperial Court.  If you could locate the top service staff, JoJo Lin in Rossio Cafe, you could be truly pampered by her 5-star personal hospitality ...",50
"We visited the hotel after midnight and most of the things were shutting down, expcept the casino. Their aquarium looked amazing and the staircase was beautiful. But they were in midst or rearranging something in the decor and we couldn't get the grand view we were expecting after visiting Venetian and Galaxy. Their restaurant eight which is open all night was a saviour of us when we were hungry and no other casino had anything open. Everything about it is designed in gold which gives it a very lavish feel.",40
"need to take ticket for shuttle bus when other casino dont need,you can see how stingy they are,better dont play there and play somewhere else.inside very gloomy and environment sucks,waitress very rude,disgusting place,worst casino in macau",10
Spent a weekend here and it was just wonderful. The room was superb and the amenities first rate. Breakfast was excellent and it was so pleasant sitting in a cafe setting. The pool was great but we were disappointed at not having free access to the sauna area. Overall it was a bit of luxury and I recommend it.,50
"We were so impressed by the service at this hotel.   Simon at the front desk was so helpful and personally showed us to our room which had a great view.  I can't say enough about the rooms, very modern, comfy bed and squeaky clean.  The location of this hotel is also great and we were able to reach Senado square via taxi within a few minutes.  We were warned in advance about the taxi service in Macau so we knew exactly what to expect.  We left this hotel feeling like VIP guests because we were treated like VIP guests.",50
"I did not stay in the hotel, I went here when I was visiting Macau. I spent the afternoon in the hall with the big aquarium, there was a feeding show for the fish and it was fun...the place with the sunlight was beautiful...  The thing i want to emphasise more is how nice the hotel staff was...",40
"Attracted by the aquarium in my last visit, I've decided to book MGM for my family! Surprisingly, there is a new theme about butterflies and gardens! My family and I were truly stunned by the amazing decoration!   However, there is a large room for improvement on the service in this 5-star hotel. I arrived at the hotel at 3:30pm and the reception said that the room is not ready (although I've already stated that I'd arrive at 3:00 at the time of booking). They said they'd call me once the room is ready and it turned out to be a lie too. We didn't ask for any coupons or sth, so my 60-year old mum and I hanged around the hotel just to wait for the room. my mum saw a large painting in the corridor of the 2nd floor and she wanna took a pic of it. Suddenly, a middle-aged security…",30
"This is a really cool hotel, in the 'Mini Vegas' style.  Great rooms and service, very swish all round.  Awesome Breakfast.  For a traveller not interested in the casino though (me) it was away from the action a bit.  The view from the room was across a sort of wasteland before the water whcih was a bit unappealing.  Its kind of at the end of the road and by itself it felt so everything is a cab ride and th traffic is not always great.",40
"Beautiful place, Nice and friendly people, Saw the Monumental Work Exhibition by Portuguese Artist in MGM Macao, . A courteous staff explained everything about the display in the exhibition. a must visit place in Macau.",50
Stayed here over night for our friends bucks night and the size and level of luxury is just awesome.  I am told it is not the cheapest place to stay in Macau but well worth it for a special occasion and will stay here again should I have the opportunity!   The major hotels all have shuttle services from the ferry terminals so utilise them and look for MGM's orange bus service which takes about 20 minutes from Taipa.,50
"only for one day, but still so beautiful that aquarium and the staircases just so airy and light.  We came for the casino and were pleasantly surprised, probably the best lobby/atrium entrance I've seen.",50
"The MGM in Macau is hosting an exhibition of Degas sculptures until the end of November 2016.  It is brilliant.   First, however, I have to say it took determination to actually find the exhibition.  We had seen information in an in-flight magazine, but when we visited the hotel at the beginning of May, even though the exhibition has opened, their own staff didn't seem to know anything about it.  First they sent us to another hotel!  Eventually, after considerable questioning, we located the Art Space.    To save you the trouble.....simple really.  Enter the main courtyard with the butterflies and the amazing fish tank....cross to the double staircase, go up to the second floor and follow signs to the MGM Art Space.   This is one of the largest displays (74 bronze sculptures) of…",50
"My stay at the MGM hotel was very impressive! Probably because I was travelling with family and friends, and in order to accommodate all of us, we had to stay in a suite. The suite was very well facilitated- the beds were huge, the dining room was decent, and the washrooms were grand (super luxurious indeed)... However, it's quite a pity that we didn't spend much time inside the hotel and couldn't enjoy the facilities. Still, solely based on the interior design/facilities, the suite was perfect for a family stay!",50
"This was a lovely hotel with plenty to look at but it wasn't somewhere I would like to stay due to the fact that you get so many tourists coming in to look around, if you get a chance go and look around.",40
"We took a large group of family and friends to the hotel for an anniversary dinner. Coordinating the times for the ferry tickets and number of hotel rooms, some accessible by a wheelchair, was a nightmare. However, once we told the hotel of the final arrangements it was like watching a well oiled machine swing into action. Nothing was too much trouble and they coped with our numerous changes without missing a trick. We just had to tell them once and we could rely on them sorting out all out. The hotel itself is magnificent with amazing decoration in both the public areas and the rooms. But that was not the most impressive aspect of the hotel, it was the staff. I do not know how they train them but staff at all levels were some of the best I have ever experienced. From the…",50
This is one of the best experience of my recent stay in Macao. Luxury Hotel with an awsome food display. Would recommend in a flash. Big rooms with a view over the island or the Casinos.  Has also a huge shopping mal with one of the biggest Casinos.,50
"We did not stay in this hotel, but we stayed a good 30 minutes in MGM Grand's Foyer. There's this huge floor-to-ceiling cylindrical aquarium in the middle of the square. Beautiful giant butterflies adorned the ceiling around the tank. Everything was beautiful, and we felt as if we were in an underwater fantasy land. If you're on a hotel/casino tour in Macau's peninsula, don't miss the Aurora!",50
Two spectacular works by famous American glass artist Dale Chihuly can be found in the MGM Grand Macau entrance lobby: a “Fior di Paradiso” ceiling and a large 45-panel wall behind the reception desk. Other smaller scale but beautiful works can be found in the gallery leading to the Mandarin Oriental shopping arcade. A spectacular cylindrical aquarium dominates the covered atrium.,40
"We checked in last night for a 3 night stay for our wedding anniversary and my 1st impression as soon as we saw the room was WOW!!  The room is spacious and very luxuriously appointed true to its brand and image.  The view at night is just spectacular!  We have an ocean view with the bridge as the backdrop with nearby hotel lights etc.    We went to Rossio for the dinner buffet.  While the buffet was quite decent with a typical arrays of the seafood, hot dishes and dessert what made our night memorable was the staff that attended to us that night Kelven Ky.  Kelven was a true professional who always made sure we have what we needed yet was never intrusive.  He mastered the art of service & attentiveness without over doing.  As this is our 1st time to Macau, he was so heldful in…",50
"I booked a room on a week in advance, check in on late afternoon and i had to wait for a room for 25 min., and i had to sleep on a single bed.I was very disappointed, after a long day i was expecting to be treat as a guest in a 5 start L hotel, but didn't happen.I hope service will improve to be avoid in those accident.",20
"Had an amazing lunch at their Cantonese restaurant during a short visit to the city. The hotel itself is modern and grand. Visited the casino side as well, I understand the one in MGM coati will be amazing! There were people throughout who spoke English. The cuisine is some of the best I've had in Macao with a grand setting.",50
This is the life ;) absolutely love this hotel!  Have been to Macau a few times and I love the MGM - From the food to the crabs tables.  Great range of shops from LV to cafes!! Bought a stunning LV diary and LV monogram cover they embossed it within 20 mins. Excellent service and range.   This place is worth every penny love it 😍😎😘 ,50
Everything in the hotel was great from the minute we entered till we left. Great staff..awesome rooms..abf was a great experience. .you cannot ask for more! Simply tge best on the island. Also the view from the hotel is amazing.,50
"After a great lunch at Henry's galley, we went for a walk with my friend and finally ended up at the mall nearby Mandarin Oriental.  We noticed that corner patisserie shop offering a great selection of pastries on display. Great quality overall at very reasonable prices.  Our bill was wrong (charged a full caked) but quickly corrected was apologies.  We will definitely go back again.",50
I went to Macau for my Company Retreat and stayed at MGM Grand for 2nights. The hotel lobby is amazing.. Richly decorated arts worth spending your time just to look at it. Rooms are spacious.. Views are great too. Good wifi connections. Many variety of food cuisine to choose for breakfast! Its expensive but really worth it!! ,50
"We stayed at the grand studio of the mgm Macau last week. The room is at the far end of the hotel but definitely deserves the long walk from the lift lobby . The room is large, with a walk in closet and double sink bath room equipped with bath tub and rain shower . The bed was comfortable and clean. Our room can see the tower of Macau , the sea and the city .  The minus things about the room is that there were no bath robes, and the air lingers a tinge of cigarette smoke despite it being a non smoking floor. Perhaps there are just way too many mainland tourist gamblers who don't bother about rules, or the air purification system was actually faulty . I could not imagine staying in other casino hotels since their lobbies already are very smokey in comparison with mgm.  The hotel…",40
"Stayed in a 2 bedroom villa suite in early December.  The suite included a kitchen, living room, Karaoke room, and more.  Nearly 4000+ square feet of living area and decadence.  If you can afford it, stay here!  The restaurants are all delicious too!",50
Really lovely hotel . Beautiful rooms with views over the water . Friendly staff and great service . Nightlife is limited. Only one bar for an evening drink . The mall is fantastic and quiet. For good restaurants you need to be in other hotels.,40
"I keep mentioning Sound Insulation in my Hotel reviews because personally by default,  I don't have Insomnia issues - it's just that I am here at a hotel to relax my mind and having Tranquility helps you to achieve that and maintain a sound sleep.  Here MGM Hotel passed with flying colors.  Positive News -  1) Great Sound Insulation as mentioned. 2) Late Check-out is available until 1pm.   3) Security at Hotel and Casino side is top notch. 4) Desserts and Gelati at 1st Floor are not to be missed.  Currently they are also doing a Chinese New Years theme with street carts selling many local Macanese food and beyond.  5) Very nice Bath Tub and Sofa spaces.  Nice view both towards Macau city or towards the Ocean.  6) Artistic installations all around the hotel,  and a huge Fish Tank…",50
"Its hard to fault anything at the MGM Grand. So instead I look for excellence. The one aspect that shines out so brightly is the attention, care and professionalism of the staff. I can honestly sat they are all 6 star. I've stayed in Hotels that were more expensive and higher rated, but I have never experienced such a consistent, across the board, display of excellence.",50
"Once we get off our car, their are 2 staffs came over to help us with our luggage. Then two ladies opened the door for us and another one to lead our way to the front desk. What can I say more. The room itself and the service from the staff is spotless. Excellent price value.",50
We spend here for two nights and we never fail it was ended very nice hotel. With lots of variety for breakfast we enjoyed some of the show and bars drinks was a bit pricey but it's okey because the service was magnificent thank we will sure be back here.,50
We were lucky to be there during their feeding time. There was a guy with his wetsuit and oxygen tank on his back spreading fish food. It's quite narrow for him but fish seem very happy;) We sat next to the aquariums and having some small bites. I forgot what I was eating completely. Fish are more fun!;),40
"We booked this via OTA and got a super deal (non-refundable booking) and was excellent value money. We arrived early and checkin was not a fuss and gave us a super room with a super view of the harbour on the highest floor available. Staff were courteous and very helpful on things to do and all.   The hotel also provided a free shuttle to and from the ferry terminal, which was great. But small word of advice the coach terminal to the hotel is right at the back - so bit of a walk with luggage, but a nice walk :-)",50
"Stayed as a family with a small child. Very nice, big room, attentive staff, breakfast a small disappointment as well as the long time of required notice for babysitting service. Pre stay communication excellent.",40
I went there with my girl friends and we enjoyed our time at the MGM. We booked the Grand Deluxe Suite.... It was luxury. elegant. The hotel had everything I needed..... Staff very helpful and nice service.......Our room had a great view tho.......,50
"First class casino where they include complimentary drinks and water in the refrigerator.  And if you need an extra camp bed, it is free and very comfortable.  The people who frequent this hotel seem more civilized than for example at the Sheraton.  The choice of restaurants are plenty, and the quality of food really top grade.  Service is rendered always with a smile.  Security is very good throughout.",50
"We really enjoyed our stay at MGM during the mid autumn festival weekend. This is a hotel decorated with a lot of modern artwork around the main lobby, hallways, unlike other casino hotels we saw that displayed diamonds and antiques instead. There is a huge aquarium near the lobby with fish feeding every morning at 11 and the casino entrance discreetly behind it. When we booked a nonsmoking room online but got a smokey room instead, the staff immediately changed our room after we called the front desk. Our room was large and facing the water view, and everything in the fridge was included in the room! Service at the front desk was prompt and really helpful, offering recommendations to our trip itinerary, even showing us local diners at 10pm. When my flight back home was…",50
The room we were in was huge and beautiful. we also enjoyed the view as it is facing the sea. we definitely had a great time winning and losing at the 24 hours casino on the ground floor. there were quite a number of halal indian restaurant around the hotel. there were also choices of seafood and chinese food within walking distance. the staff was friendly and courteous.,50
"I have not been to Macau for a long time and was looking forward to going back and seeing the changes.  I selected the MGM Macau because of price and location, preferring to stay on the mainland rather than the Cotai strip.  I made a good selection! On arrival at the hotel, I was courteously greeted by the front desk staff and following formalities, was escorted to my room.  The gentleman who showed me the room took great care to explain the features - which included a stocked minibar with beer and soft drinks at no charge. The room was very ample and very comfortable, affording a view out over the water towards Hong Kong.  Appointments were excellent and the room was spotlessly clean.  It was comfortable, indeed.  Wi Fi is free, as it is in most hotels in the region, and it was…",50
"The hotel is great, and since we were on our anniversary, they even upgraded our room! The staff are courteous, and more than willing to help (though one of them did misguide us, but I don't think that was intentional, more of a communication problem), but the stay itself was great. There is a casino (but of course) and a mall in the same hotel. The restaurant in the hotel is amazing. It's one of the best meals I've had. Everything we ordered was off the menu and recommended to us by our server (since we are vegetarian). It was fine dining and a very reasonable price (The meal cost the two of us a little above $50)  The hotel is quite close to the old city, so it took us hardly 20-30 minutes to get there. This hotel is especially recommended for those who go to macau with the…",40
"This is one of the most beautiful hotels with it's simple and elegant outside and beautiful inside courtyard.  There is artwork from Dali and Chihuly permanently at this hotel.  There are two check ins at this hotel (regular and VIP).  Regular checking has Chihuly art on the wall and a Dali sculpture in the center lobby that leads into a beautiful courtyard that is a replica of the Gran Pria of Lisbon.  The courtyard has different displays throughout the year.  I've been to this hotel many times and they had a butterfly pavilion, an undersea theme and giant tank, and different art exhibitions.   The rooms are big with a little sitting area and small sofa (not a sofa bed and big enough to seat two people).  I love that the tub (a claw-foot tub) is separate from the shower and it…",50
"Very nice rooms, impeccable service from all the staff. Very good restaurants. Very happy with our choice. If you are catching a ferry from Hong Kong as we did or from HK international airport direct free shuttles are available. Front desk really goes the extra mile to double check everything to make sure your return journey is also hassle free ! The casino is pretty good too.",50
"One of my favorite hotel in Macau. :) the staff is so cool, smiling face, and friendly. :) I remember when one of their Nepali staff guide me, going to there attraction place because I didn't know where am I will stay coz I'm waiting for someone. :) ",50
Everything is excellent . Rooms are nice and clean.  Front desk are very accommodating. Slot machines are not as nice as employee there.  the bus pick you up from the boat dock  for free. No taxi needed unless you want to.,50
"I go to macau with my family last weekend.    We book two rooms at MGM for $3,XXX for each but we only got two standard size rooms!!!  We are very disappointed about the hotel as follows:  1.The corridor of the non-smoking floor is smelly.  2.The room size is only standard.  3.The decoration and design is old style and not deluxe.  4.We need to walk more than 15 mins to the main attractions.  5.Check in time is late at 3pm, but check out time is early at 11am.  6.The blanket have stinks.  Dirty!!!  7.Someone suddenly go inside your room to make up in the afternoon.  8.The curtain of the transparent bathroom is control outside the bathroom!  9.The quality of the restaurant chefs is very poor, they can't cook well even a fry egg!  10, The quality of the breakfast is not good, but…",20
"We stayed here for 4 nights last week, it was our first time in Macau.  After staying at MGM grand in Vegas we decided to stay at MGM in Macau.  We arrived by ferry from Hong Kong & was ripped off by taxi driver to hotel which isn't hotels fault (but it would if been nice to know they had a free shuttle.. We got free shuttle on the way back to ferry after our stay) When we entered the hotel it smelt like roses and we were happy we finally arrived. The staff at reception was very friendly & recommended a show for us to watch during our stay ( dancing on water =  AMAZING)   The mini bar was free  & tops were charged. We got some laundry five which I though was abit pricey for 8 items.   Our room was beautiful. We had a huge shower, double sinks, electric curtain separating bed…",40
"Got a massive discount online for a Two-Bedroom Grand Deluxe Suite, it was only HK$6500 a night!  We stayed two nights.  It was almost the best hotel room we've ever had, definitely the room with the best view!  The room and service was excellent and beautiful.  For that price I would not consider staying anywhere else ever again in Macau!  Alas I think the original price is over double that a night.  Can't recommend it enough.    To put it into better perspective.  I would pay double for the room.  The view alone, overlooking the harbor and at Cotai was worth it.  The dining room was well appointed, the bed was very comfortable, the living room space was amazing, kitchen was small but functional.  The bathrooms were amazing with Jacuzzi in both, the TV in the mirror was a nice…",50
"World should learn the real meaning of customer service from these guys. The vip concierge the lady there is so good, in fact the whole team got together to find ways to plan my next travel destination to Hong Kong. To such minute details that even my shopping malls brands taxis buses by the minutes  everything was planned by the time i got back to the hotel roaming around in macau. If they tell u they will get back in 5 min they do it somehow and not in 6min...super ",50
Our initial experience was a little disappointing we arrived from the airport and took the hotel shuttle bus. This dropped us off at a side door (entrance to casino would you believe) we had to ask for help to locate the lobby to check in. As the MGM LV caters to Westerners so the Macau version is aimed at the Asian community. Most games etc in Chinese language/ characters - why not? Room we were allocated had a rubbish view - despite an electric curtain round a huge bathroom 'so you could enjoy the view' a waste of money as the view was the roof of the next building  Staff very attentive AbA (French) restaurant excellent special daily menu at a reasonable price and good service.,40
The best place for coffee whether it's for business or leisure in the whole Macau. The pastry bar has unbelievable cakes and chocolates as well as fantastic staff. We were served by Eagle a young Chinese guy who was considerate and professional in his service. The besutiful seating allowed you to sit and relax or dine at the tables. This dining area had the highest quality of food and service at the most reasonable if not cheaper prices than other places. The menu was varied and offered light and hearty meals from breakfast to evening. All servings were large. It was a hidden gem that we had been told about and we went back three times and we weren't staying there. Would definitely  recommend and return.,50
"This was the only casino where I actually won, covering all my loses and more. Easy positive. Big space and friendly staff. It also always helps to receive a few free beers. Only negative is the staff only brought around 1 over two hours (maybe it was Because I was winning).",50
"A beautiful hotel with great design. Nice lobby and stylish display. The hotel was relatively not as crowded as other hotels with noisy groups. A good way to enjoy our holiday here other than gambling. Not the hotel fault, the traffic in Macau is really bad and difficult to get taxi to explore the city. ",50
"Great hotel and staff, but at the time of check in, we were told we will be given twin beds (for me and my wife) where i have requested a king bed. They then upgraded the room to a suite which was amazing. Unfortunately, the safe doesn't work, just imagine going to a gambling city and not having a safe box to put all your money in! Would love to give it a 5/5 for the lovely staff but could hardly give it a 4/5.",40
"This was my second stay at the MGM Macau and my experience was mostly positive once again. The room and bathroom is clean and spacious. The only downside being that most of my time was spent in the casinos, and I really only came to my room to sleep for a few hours daily.  The bed is very comfortable and the room provided to me had a panoramic view of the sea and Taipa.  Just a couple of things I couldn't figure out. The first being that there was an option to book the room without breakfast on the CTrip website, but this option was not available on the hotel website. I was forced to take a room for 3 nights including breakfast even thou I knew I would not be able to wake up for breakfast. I did try booking the lower rate on the CTrip website initially, but there was some…",40
This is simply the best hotel I have ever stayed in. Excellent service and rooms; nothing else comes close. My family enjoyed the stay thoroughly. We stayed for only two nights but now wished we had booked it for a week.,50
"I had the immense pleasure to meet Peter Finamore in Taipei, where he used to run the Regent, and so when he became the GM of the MGM Macau I knew there would only be one logical stay. I took my family there for the New Year's and although we had all caught a very bad cold in Hong Kong, Peter and his staff took care of us. They put us up in a breathtakingly beautiful two bedroom villa, provided 24-hour around the clock care of us while we were recovering, and made sure we had plenty of healthful soup and other foods to nourish us back to health. We will not soon forget the kindness and thoughtfulness they warmly shared with us throughout our stay.",50
"I stayed with MGM for 5 days when I was on a business trip in Macau. The spacious room gave me a wonderful surprise, and the bed was soooo comfortable that I slept like a baby. Breakfast at the buffet restaurant was nice, and the Asian restaurant serving cantonese/malaysian/singaporean cuisine was really good. I almost ate there everyday. Six Senses spa was like heaven that you can't miss! Overall it was a pleasant stay.",50
"From an European point a view, most of Macau 's hotels/casinos must seem splendours.  There's a kind of an opulence esthetic going on, a need to show richness, affluence, lavishness, sumptuousness, luxury.  Business took me to Macau, and i never visited Asia before. Macau is a small island off the coast of China, that used to be Portuguese, so i was very curious.  The hotel has a dramatic entrance. It has a Dali flamengo dancer statue  on the lobby and it is organized around a central ""praça"" that makes a reference to Macau's Portuguese heritage, and in the middle it has a massive round aquarium that is a beautiful living artwork. Usually they have art instalations or chinese decorations (like the newyears) in Grande Praça - untill October 2015 they have Joana Vasconcelos…",50
"Business took me on a quick trip to Macau, a small island off the coast of China, in February, where I had been before.  This time, I selected MGM Macau.  The rooms are designed with a modern sensibility that lacks any kitschy reference to old fashioned notions of what Chinese travelers expect.  The bathroom had a big separate tub and a spacious shower, plus double sinks and big fluffy towels.  Amenities were private label and of good quality.  The room was very well maintained.  The hotel is organized around a central ""praça"" that makes a nodding reference to Macau's Portuguese heritage.  In truth, it may not have been the most modern choice but the colors are tonal and pleasant and a glass roof allows light to stream in.  The hotel does a lot of decorating and events in this…",40
"Great rooms comfortable beyond words, nice decoration, accurate service, great breakfast  for an additional fee... but honestly .. Is this worth the exorbitant rate? Maybe not.  Ok to experience once, but nit to return.",30
"I visit Macau frequently and have stayed in the mgm many times. I have had regular rooms and full apartment suites. The place is quite grand of course, it has a dramatic lobby and an inner atrium which has several restaurants and an open sky feeling. the restaurants are nice but slim on western food options. Prices are of course, expensive. The rooms themselves are cool. Automatic shades and full glass bathroom with curtains to close. There are a few hints of wear and failed maintenance, but nothing serious.",40
Wonderful hotel with top quality rooms. The showers are great with a small TV to watch the news. Located next to a shopping mall with many restaurants.   Also walking distance to other Chinese-style casinos. The Wynn is close by as well.   Be sure to check out the aquarium and get a nice photo.,40
"Great location , lovely building lots of people there but lacked a little spirit / noise for me ! Thought a casino would be bussing and loud ! Even they only serve drinks "" beer "" after 8 !!!! Didn't stay long ",30
"We visited this hotel in early Aug 2014.We manage to get a corner suite for 3 of us, the room is so spacious and beautifuly furnished,they even include a majong room, just imaging,it's the biggest we ever had in Macau.The hotel itself is so grand,the staffs are all so friendly and professionally efficent,the casino is so huge we almost get lost whenever we played there.It had all kinds of table games.We really enjoyed staying,wil definitely recommend to our friends.",50
"I must say it was not just the first experience with MGM, so it actually made me write the review about MGM, the way they welcomed me as always it made me feel like I keep on coming back again and again .. The restaurant at the ground floor which dosnt have any vegetarian platter but still the chef himself made a pure vegetarian meal for me for almost 4 days.. This shows that the respect for the guest ...",50
"I should say, it's one of the best hotels I have even stayed. Well designed, lots of events giving me real fun during stay, good restaurant you can seat outside watching the fish and enjoy delicious food. Shuttle bus is very convenient, located besides sea and lake. Love it, and also macau.",50
"Hotels has excellent location close to ferry terminal ( with complimentary shuttle bus ) and all local attractions. Lobby and all public areas are excellent. We stayed in deluxe suite which was absolutely great: VIP wing with private check in and lifts, massive ( around 150 sq m ) with excellent decor ( good quality materials as well ) and nice view. Big and comfortable bed, bathroom with city view. Service was very good as well. All together I highly recommend it.",50
"The Casino is fantastic as are the shopping Malls and food halls in the fairy take Buffet Bars near the immense tubular floor to ceiling Aquarium. The colours in this room are amazing. What I did want to mention is the Double up at Dawn Cocktail Bar opposite the Fish Aquarium. We lobbed into the plush elite bar on the off chance at about 5pm and wouldn't you know it, it was Happy Hour Buy one get one Free or BOGOF as my partner calls it. There is a huge selection of cocktails to go at and our wonderful barmaids kept right on bringing us free bar snacks, olives, blue American Style potato chips and nuts.

"The MGM Macau is totally amazing!  From the moment you step inside, you are greeted with a friendly smile and the staff do their utmost to ensure your stay is pleasant.  The room we stayed in was huge, clean and modern.  Bedding was very comfortable and they have a nightly turn-down service.  Bathroom was also very large and featured a bath, separate shower, and twin basins.  A pack of amenities is also included in case you forgot something (toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, etc).  The hotel has free wi-fi but here's a tip: Ask the reception desk for a wi-fi access code so you don't have to register online with your phone number.  Just near the hotel lobby is a large salt-water aquarium, surrounded by restaurants and bars.  No expense was spared here!  Overall, I'd highly recommend…",50
"unlike many Macau hotel casino's the MGM has a bit of style to it.  not over run by crazed Chinese gamblers but space to move and a elegance about the property.  restaurants were world class accommodations the same and the adjoining shopping centre houses every 'brand' you can think of and want to wear if your credit credit only had a $100,000 limit.  the hotel/casino creates a really good 'feel' to it the moment you walk in the door.  everything is spacious they spared no expense on the fit out as a westerner I felt really at home there.  of course my view may well be coloured by the fact that I also won and have no intention of giving any of it back. my children can be assured that as a result of my stay they et to eat next month.  the month after may be a different story and…",50
"By far, MGM is the best hotel that we stayed in during my month long trip in Asia. With comfy beds, luxurious bathroom and exceptional view, we could see why the hotel has such a great ranking. We were greeted with friendly and service from the concierge staff, reception as well as restaurant staff and the overall vibe in MGM is not cluttered and more relaxed compared to my past stays at the Venetian and Galaxy.   The hotel has a beautiful pool which is not crowded with kids during my time there. A lovely place to relax and wind down during the day. The patisserie serves some of the best pastries in Asia. The cakes are delicate, dainty and divine. We managed to try five different ones and I wish we could try them all. The high tea from their cafes are just as good! The casino is…",40
"Hotel was very nice.  We were upgraded for free to Junior Suite which was beautiful.  Only thing negative about our stay was that the room service food was actually inedible.  Not sure how you mess up fries and a burger, but they managed to.",40
"Stayed in July 2014, western couple, first time in Macau, frequent travelers. Overall, we were really happy with our stay at the MGM. We visited many of the other large properties (mainly casino and shopping areas) and would likely choose the MGM again for the price if we ever return. We have two complaints but the rest was seriously great.  The rooms are huge and the service was spot on.  Anytime we had a request it was met instantaneously and the staff always addressed us by name, which was a nice touch. Those we dealt with spoke English very well so communication was not an issue. Room service arrived within 20 minutes each time we ordered and they even got our special food requests right.  The location is nice as well...plenty of other options within walking distance: Wynn,…",40
"The hotel was okay.  The rooms were a good size with a nice bathroom, but didn't really smell the best! The Swimming pool was a disappointment with no food or bar service at the pool. The casino is great but pretty much the same as all the other major hotels in Vegas, and no where near the same as Las Vegas!  Overall it was an okay experience but nothing to write home about!",30
"I had a booking and a little problem with my money. I lost my credit card and was waiting to receive money the next day via Moneygram. But the receptionist first told me, check in is after 3 pm. So I had to wait for over 1 hour. Finally at 3 pm she didnt want to let me check in without paying a deposit to the room. I explained her the second time, that I will receive Money in the morning and just had so much cash, to go out for dinner and so on. This was a big problem for her. She was not friendly at all. She had to call the manager and he finally said, ok, but if I would order any service to the room, I had to pay cash. I said sure, thats no problem at all.  I felt not welcome from this lady. The service in the hotel was ok so far, but not special. I guess I'm not chinese,…",30
"The hotel of my choice every time I visit Macau.  Major reasons include the hotel rooms, excellent location and great restaurants.  The hotel room has an automatic system for the blinds which surround the glass aligned with the luxurious bathroom. Facing the sea, is the room I usually choose and you can see the view of the Macau international airport and the skyline.  There is a free shuttle bus service from the ferry pier and really convenient.  Can't recall the name of the Chinese restaurant on the upper floor, great food and service.  Don't forget to visit the spa,it is excellent.",50
"It's been awhile since I last visited MGM. I remember it was the huge floor layout with marble and the high ceiling. The view from the room was stunning. My mom loved the coffee at the hotel. The food at a restaurant on the left the hall (if you are facing the casino) is good but not outstanding. I used to stay at the neighbouring hotel as well, but I have to say I prefer the room and the bathroom here. I don't gamble. So, there is nothing much I can say about their casino. Still, it's worth taking a look. I give 4/5. 1 for it lacking personal touch. Also, water leaked when I took a shower. On a plus side, it is not crowded like other hotels in Macau.",40
"Stayed at the MGM for two nights. Booked through ebookers and the hotel received a wrong room preference. Upgraded to a larger room (Studio). Service from hotel staff was good, spa, restaurants and room service all fantastic. Casino staff were rude unfortunately, and it's hard to avoid them.",40
"We stayed at the MGM Macau for 5 days at the beginning of March 2014. This hotel/Casino is just amazing. Upon arrival at the Macau ferry terminal we were greeted by a MGM concierge who assisted us with our baggage to the MGM bus. The MGM has many buses that run to and from the Macau ferry terminal and other areas of Macau, they are clean, tidy and almost brand new. At reception we were pleasantly surprised with an upgrade to a Grand suite. This room was just amazing with a huge floor layout of granite and marble. The view from our room looked over the Macau harbour and Taipa, we had 180' degree view of the harbour, It was just amazing. The staff were so friendly and helpful, in particular Serena, and most spoke English which assisted greatly. We visited the restaurant Square…",50
"This espresso/pastry bar is located at the MGM near the fish tank not far from the lobby.  We returned back to this place day after day (we were in Macau for 5 days) because it simply served the best espresso in a very relaxing atmosphere. After a few hours of walking around old Macau we came here to simply relax and recharge for the afternoon excursions.  The service is very good and solicitous, the servers, there seem to be 2 or 3 always available, were prompt to offer water and were quick to return with the espresso. My pet peeve with most espresso bars, especially chains like Starbucks, is that they hire unskilled people to make a perfect espresso.   Just having the best machines is not sufficient.  Here, at the MGM, the espresso is perfectly made with the mandatory crema…",50
"We visited Macau in January and when we wanted to stay, there were no rooms available at this hotel, so had to book somewhere else but we did visit the restaurant of the hotel for dinner. The choices on the menu, quality and taste of food and the service was outstanding. The food including the dessert was freshly prepared. We would like to compliment the chef, hotel Manager for managing this hotel so well.",50
"I lived in vegas and when i came to visit Macau, i was amazed!!!  I had a fabulous time, the only downfall is taking the ferry, i hate that!!! I will definitely go back and introduce this place to my friends. From food, gaming tables, rooms you can never go worng!",50
"Stayed in the MGM for business last Dec and was blown away by the amazing service of the hotel. From pick up at the airport to check in and the upgrade to the amazing suite, I was totally WOW'ed by their friendliness and efficiency. The staff even acceded to my request for a property tour which I find rare.  While its one of the smaller casino resorts in Macau, I do love its intimacy. You don't feel lost or over awed anywhere on the property.  Only complaints are that they need to improve the room amenities with plugs next to the bed and was a little irritated that by curtains could not completely close but none the less, would highly recommend it. Will be back soon!",40
"When looking for a hotel in Macau, we had two stipulations – it had to be on the island where the old town was and it had to be a casino resort for the full Macau experience.  I was a bit tardy with my bookings and missed out on my first choice but I am SO glad I did.  This hotel is completely fabulous, luxurious and all-over spectacular without having the tackiness and crowds of some of the other similar hotels, particularly on Cotai Island.  The pictures on Street View make it look like it’s kind of in the middle of nowhere but it’s not.  There are bars and restaurants just a minute away (try the Jack Daniels Whiskey Bar over the road, table service, dice games and karaoke) not like on the other island where you are stuck between resorts.  The casino culture can get a bit…",50
"A few months ago, I went to play in their casino for an evening and got a free Golden Lion Club player card.  Then last month I got a sms message from them that I get a 1 free night stay in December.  I then call a number on the card and ask their host if I can get 2 nights free.  They let me! And I'm not really a high-roller.    Their casino is very nice.  With the only craps table left in the Macau city area.  Wynn, Grand Lisboa, L'arc, Sands,  no longer have craps.   Nice blackjack rules too,but there are only 2 tables and they're usually full of players.     The lunch buffet at Rossio is exellent.  For $208 per person, great value, quality, and seletions.  Most people go for the seafood and sushi bar, but a got a few tacos and bbq. The seatings outside is much nicer and…",40
Good location. Impressive interrior everywhere in the hotel and casino. Good internet connection. Helpfull staff on Recepion Desk - expecially Stephy Pang. The staff in confecionery inside in front of aquarius is not enough kind.,40
"This hotel is ideal if you want the best Chinese restaurant I've ever eaten in with super attentive staff who remembered our names and our order, good gym with plenty of machines and weights, the best breakfast buffet I've ever seen or tasted with a ridiculous selection and the best macchiato's!! We got upgraded to a lovely room with a good view (although it was very smoggy) and the lovely check in lady added complimentary breakfast for our 4 night stay which was actually worth paying for!!  The massive aquarium in the main courtyard was beautiful, you actually felt like you were under the sea! Look forward to coming back next year already.",50
We travel to Macau in late August and arrive with the Hotel shuttle bus. The hotel room is stylish and comfortable. They upgraded our room with amazing night view over the Taipa city and bridges. We love the Aquarium and the atmosphere inside the plaza while we were having a fabulous buffet breakfast at the restaurant. I will definitely select this hotel again when I return.,50
Stayed for 2 nights in early November. Got a normal non smoking room on the 14th floor. Room was clean and the fixtures in good shape. The Reception staff and Bell Boys were very courteous. Food at Imperial Court was also nice and the waitresses were very attentive. Room was made up with fuss and clean.  Getting cabs from the front of the lobby is quite tough. I'd recommend walking to OneCentral Mall or the Casino exit to hail a cab. The Casino Tables were also more expensive than the Wynn across the street,50
"We had a grand suite on a high floor and wow what a room.  Extremely luxurious - large spa bath with view across the city, huge shower with flashing disco lights, enormous sumptuous bed, marble floors, plush furniture etc etc ..... Breakfast was excellent.  The service faultless.  Didn't use the spa but the outdoor swimming pool was attractive and empty! Didn't love Macau but the hotel certainly compensated.",50
"This is my second time to stay here, grand deluxe room. I came back because Wynn fulled and I was satisfied with my first stay in grand studio. Everything was fine and the lobby was not as crowded as some other Macau hotels.  But my nightmare came before check-out! Hotel checkout time is 11:00 which is earlier than some of the Macau hotel at 12:00. At 11am sharp, when I was packing my thing, the hotel staffs keep ringing my TOILET room phone for 3 times without saying a word, I think this is the way they use to wake their guest up from bed.  After 5 mintues, a hotel staff (a man) open my room door without permission. Yes, he has knocked the door but at the same time opening my door. Within 2 seconds for me to reach the door from bedroom, he has already opened the door and ask me…",20
Nice hotel with a very relaxing room. the buffet restaurant was better this time and the staff are very helpful. The patisserie has a very delicious pastries but the staff working at the lions bar small dark guy was rude to us and has an attitude problem,20
"This property defines Luxury. The staff is as wonderful as the hotel itself. From front desk, to concierge, to room service and house keeping. Always ready to help. We were upgraded to a sea view room upon arrival instead of urban view and it was absolutely stunning to sit there and sip a coffee in the mornings. Always try to push for that and a higher floor. The bathrooms were one of the best I've seen in any hotels I've stayed. Equipped with luxury fittings and amenities. They service the room twice a day which is unheard of. Things kept in the mini-bar are free of cost. A first again. And it includes beer. HUGE casino inside the property. But that's expected from MGM. No area in the hotel is a dead area. There is something happening everywhere. Like all big properties in…",50
"The worse Spa experience ever... After checking in, I was taken to the Spa area and left to my own device. The attendant just disappeared without explaining to me the facilities available. I felt tempted to try the ""Experience Shower"" but as soon as I pressed the button for the small jet I felt a burning sensation on my face. I initially thought that I had touched something not clean and therefore I pressed the bigger jet button in order to rinse off, but then the pain got worse. That's when I realized that the water of the shower contained a high concentration of mint, which was causing the sensation of burn. With difficulty as I couldn't open my eyes, I exited the ""Experience Shower"" and took a warm shower for 10mns to rinse off the mint concentration. During this whole time,…",10
"MGM Macau is one of the few hotels that completely blew me away with its over-whelming yet attentive services. We originally booked the Grand Suite in a last minute fashion to celebrate our long-due anniversary but eventually upgraded to the villa upon check in. The check in was smooth and the staff was very helpful overall.  Complimentary fresh fruits and drinks were prepared for us and they even provided a mgm plush toy for us knowing that it is for a special occasion. The room was very elegant and the interior details was second to none. Each room of the villa has its own remote service platform supporting light, curtain and entertainment part, which was very convenient and easy to use.  It was a great hotel to stay and we will definitely return in future when visiting Macau.",50
A Typical Las Vegas Hotel(Much smaller though). We booked a 2 bedroom Grand deluxe Suite but eventually upgraded to the villa upon check in. Super Awesome Villa with 2 bedrooms and even better baths. The entire experience was overwhelming. It is a much better option than the Venetian. Unlike the Venetian this place does not feel like an amusement park with a casino. Also the location is great. Not too far from the few attractions in Macau.,50
MGM as the name suggests is a grand hotel by the group in Macau. It has a grand entrance with very nice staff and well appointed rooms. The pool is just perfect and the spa is great. It has a very nice shopping area with all the luxury brands in it. Very nice casino as well.,40
"After a 15 hr flight from north America we were tired to say the least but the mgm Macau took good care of us, after a long shower and a 4 hour power nap we were ready to go and MGM made a great base to explore from took in lots of sights and went to the am ma temple and many of the Major casinos. all in all a great palce to stay.",40
This Hotel was really one of the best that i have stay with my girlfriend ... had very big rooms and they prices were not so high :) the stuff there was really kind and helpful :) inside the hotel also they have big casino like in every hotel there as i remember good :),50
"Though we had stayed in other hotels in Macau earlier, this time we chose MGM Grand hotel.  The hotel is located in Macau island. Chic & Elegant. Nicely decorated rooms with soft beds. The shower & bath room was designed in classical style with the barh tub with its English looks was big & nice.  We stayed in the sea facing room which in the night offered excellent views of the bridges over the water.  The hotel is adjoined to the Central Shopping Mall. Unlike some hotels in Taipo, this one is not so crowded. Hence its a nice shopping experience. The hotel shuttle buses to Taipo area (where other attractions like the Dancing Waters show happen) is not so frequent. Taxi is fine but we couldn't wait for the govt Taxis & had to take the hotel's taxi which costef us 170HKD. So if u…",50
"Just stayed there over the weekend. The overall experience exceeded my expectation as a regular Vegas goer I wasn't prepared for this MGM to be so trendy and stylish. The renowned buffet looked awesome (dinner) but I wasn't able to get in as it was fully booked. The french restaurant was a delight and all the service staff was very friendly and courteous with genuine smiles.   Only one thing to be aware of is the phone charger that requires an English-style (or HK) three-prone adaptor, which one of my friends didn't have, who was asked by the front desk to either enrolling in the casino play membership or get a room so that they could offer the convenience of charging his iPhone for him in the Lobby (he came by to meet me for dinner)...",50
The breakfast buffet was amazing! There was maybe more than 30 different kinds of food! The rooms were very spacious and comfortable and very quiet--despite being close to the road. The staff was very friendly too.,50
"There are two Macau, the one with a busy street life where restaurants, banks, pawnshops, street vendors, as well as some new and almost all the old casinos congregate, and there is Cotai, 15 minutes by car across one of the bridges, where the mega casino resorts a la Las Vegas strut their stuff. Cotai is almost completely devoid of pedestrian traffic, unless you go into Taipa, a small town nearby. Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas mogul of Venetian fame, has been the prime mover of Cotai. Therefore it's not surprising that one of the first major casino developments there was a Las Vegas Venetian clone only three times larger. Cotai was created from nearly nothing less than a decade ago, but it already has become the crown jewel of gambling and tourist destination in Macau.  Even…",50
"They have good attention to Guest and always ready to give helping hand to Guest. They have welcome smile and willing to offer assistance any time. Having breakfast in restaurant in form of buffet, have plenty of food, delicious. Room is big and quiet. Its design is fashionable. Room is comfortable.",50
"A small group of us went to the hotel for a quick gambling trip.  Upon check in, we encountered several problems with our bookings which took nearly an hour to solve.  The night manager spoke fluent English but he really wasn't that helpful - always deferring the problem to someone else. The 2 bedroom suite was very large and well appointed but perhaps a little tacky in a few areas.  The bathroom was huge.   We ate once in the 24 hour cafe late at night.  The food was bland and none of the staff spoke English which I thought was a bit odd.  We paid 600 usd not including breakfast.   ",40
"Getting a room at this hotel is not easy; it has exceptionally high occupancy rates, and I understand why, even leaving aside the large number of rooms occupied by high rolling customers. I stayed in a suite in the VIP area, which has its own entrance/ reception and lift access. The room was huge. Large bedroom, though with a typicall firm Chinese-style mattress, wonderful bathroom, acres of room for two, with rain shower and mood lighting, walk-in robe, lounge and kitchen, should you need it. The highlight was the bath...great view over Macau. Room service was efficient, though the English skills of staff are variable. The Six Senses spa is fabulous, as is the pool deck area. The hotel tower is well away from the gaming floor, separated by a faux Portuguese square, featuring a…",50
States for a night at a grad deluxe ocean view room. Fast check in. Friendly staff and most I portent nice room. Everything clean and tidy. Big lobby. Nothing to complain about. Big bathroom and comfortable bed.,40
"Everything was very good about the hotel.... except, I was not happy to walk into my room to the fairly strong odor of cigarette smoke. We specifically requested a non-smoking room, so were disappointed by the stench. Being our first time to Macau, we were unaware of what a ""smoking culture"" it is. So be aware, non-smoking room may simply not exist. ",40
"We (5 girls) stayed in a 2 bedroom suite for a night, although we all wished we could stay longer. From the moment we checked in until we checked out, our experience had been an unforgettable one.   Arriving at 12noon, our room was not ready (check in is at 3pm and guests staying at the suite check in at a special VIP room), which was understandable but Kim (the supervisor on duty who helped us with our check in) tried his best to put is next in line for the next available room. He also gave us lots of information on where we can have our lunch and even personally walked us to the direction of the restaurants. Every staff that we met were super helpful, friendly and speaks English.  When our room was ready at 1.30pm, Kim personally brought us to our room and since there was so…",50
A smaller hotel than some of the others in Macau means check in/out is very pleasant without the queues.  Room was of a very high standard.  Walking distance to the historic center of Macau.  Free transportation to the Venetian etc (as well as the ferry) if after the more full on casino experience.,50
"I stayed in MGM grand the first time I went to Macau, the experience was pleasant, the casino was good. Problem was its location was quite isolated to others in compared to hard rock hotel where Venetian just across the road. Therefore pretty much I just stayed in the hotel. Been to the the bar, the club and some gambling. I had a great night there. Room was super spacious, clean and modern! Good view!",40
"We stayed for 2 nights in Jan 13. We were upgraded to a suite as it was my birthday. The suite was outstanding, the highlight being the bathroom which had excellent views of the Wynn and Grand Lisboa. More space than you could ever need from a hotel room, lovely Molton Brown toiletries and 4 42"" televisions.  Casino was good, my only criticism of the hotel would be more dining options would be good - there's not quite the same range of options as the Vegas hotel/casinos.",50
"I stayed in a suite, the design is trendy and the swimming pool located at the top floor is perfect. The hotel is just a block away from Wyne, it's good location if u like gambling, surrounded by many larger hotel casino. It will be my choice if staying near the old habour. If for tourist love sight-seeing, staying this area is more convenient for visiting than another side of Macua like The Galaxy and The Venetian.",50
"Stayed for 5 days in Mar 2013 with wife and one and a half year old baby girl. Not the first time staying in this hotel but the bad experience has not changed a bit. Check in at 12 pm, was informed room not ready until 3 pm. Try my luck again to check in at 1.30 pm with a sleeping baby, room is still not ready but the Chinese nation man beside me with just a MGM red colour membership card and no passport identification was able to check into a City view Grand Room within 3 minutes which was the same room type that I book. Finally at 3 pm, check in again and the room is still not ready.The MGM cleaning staff must be having a very long lunch plus tea break! Finally, front desk checked with her manager and ""ofter me an upgrade"" to a sea view grand room.   Nothing to say about about…",20
"We really enjoyed our stay in MGM Macau... The room was really spacious, luxurious, comfortable, and has great floor to ceiling glass windows.. The view/ panorama was just excellent, especially at night.. We spent our night just chatting with our family, eating chips, and looking out thru the window... The view was just spectacular..  The toilet was spacious, but we have to cover the glass wall with the curtain, to get privacy during our bath in the bath tub...   There are shops/ restaurants outside the hotel.. and the casino was great ( better than the Venetian IMHO )   Beside the price of the hotel room rate that is rather high... all is just perfect for us....",50
This is a high standard hotel with a good rewards program that with a little planning could see your rooms free for your stay. The casino floor is huge as big as Crown Melbourne and bigger than a lot of vegas casinos.  There is a great selection of cafes and the best lunch buffet I found in Macau.,50
"We stayed in one of the two bedroom deluxe suites. Room 2613. Firstly, I just want to say how impressed I was with the room. A large lounge room / dining room. Each bedroom has its own ensuite with spa, double shower separate basins, panoramic views and massive walk in wardrobe. Seriously, the suite is the size of a house! The shower deserves another mention, I it has a ceiling fitted wide rain shower head, and 6 directional wall mounted jets. Best shower I've had in my life. The sea views are amazing at night. Quite smoggy during the day, and but that's no fault of the hotel. Now on a more serious note. The behaviour of some of the guests is quite alarming. When checking in, some guy pushed to the front of the line and started speaking over us to the hotel attendant. I…",50
"stayed here for three nights in march 2013. Arrived at the ferry terminal expecting to have to get a taxi there but they provide a free shuttle bus straight to the hotel. We were a few hours earlier than check in time but they checked us straight into our room with no issues at all. Very helpful staff at the concierge. Breakfast at the rossio resturantt was great and the lobby was amazing. Definitley recommend eating at the imperial court restaurant.  Excellent hotel, worth the money",50
"We recently visited the MGM Macau to see the recently opened Gold Brick Exhibition, featuring the works of artist - Wang Kaifang that is taking place between 7 Feb to 2 April 2013.   The Gold Bricks are all on open display, six being in the main Grande Praca area of the MGM Grand while the rest are located in the One Central shopping arcade and mall area attached to the MGM Macau and Mandarin Oriental Macau and one being outside on the Nam Van Lake promenade just outside the hotel.  The gold bricks to be quite interesting to inspect and look at.  Unfortunately, with the vast number of visitors in the Grande Praca, you have to compete with sizable crowds to enjoy these pieces.  However, the others located in less heavily visited areas were easier to see.   Overall, they were…",30
"We were 4 people in the Grand Deluxe Suite at MGM Macau / It was nothing but spetacular. Great surrounds and a nice suite. Of course Macau is not like Las Vegas, but the room was definitely the greatest experience we had at a hotel.  Highly recommendable IF you are not on budget :)",50
"This is take 3 to Macau and felt like the MGM.   In fact I wanted to stay there last time, but it was sold out.  It's not a big as the Venetian or anything on Cotai, so there are no long queues, huge malls and vast walks.  The rooms are fantastic and are to HK/ Western tastes.   The Lobby was jaw dropping as it was prepared for Chinese New Year.   Unlike the huge Macau/Vegas casinos there is a real attention to detail- the service was fantastic in the main casino, spa and in restaurants.   If you want somewhere classy, spacious and European friendly, plus well located in old Macau rather than Cotai, this is your number one choice!   Very good.",50
"We were there Dec 23-25.  Hotel staff especially concierge are well-trained, very friendly, eager to help,  and deserve 5-star commendation.  We had the Grand Room with sea view.  Our room, while not fancy nor grand, was clean and comfortable with only basic 5-star hotel amenities.  The sea view is nice to have but may not be worth a premium coz there's nothing much to see during the day, night time is nicer with some lights flickering afar.  In general, the hotel is very nice, conveniently located, and their casino is very decent and offers a very pleasant atmosphere for gambling.  Below are some issues for management's attention: 1. The hotel is 5-star but unfortunately a lot of its in-house guests or patrons are not.  We were shocked to spot leftover lychee shells and seeds…",40
"This is my second visit to MGM this year  I was upgraded to a 2-bedroom suite once I checked in because there are no availability on my is definitely a penthouse (but they have more luxurious villa suites and duplex villas suite), each room have a big jacuzzi pool, a large LCD TV and good beds....  I have nothing to complain on my two visits to MGM this year.",50
"Our room was lovely, large, spacious, comfortable bed, enormous bathroom with a great shower, and the front desk gave us a sea view which was lovely. The staff were helpful and friendly and attentive. I do find casino hotels a little impersonal though but there's not much you can do about that in Macau. I'm glad we stayed on the peninsula and not in Taipa/Cotai strip and there was more to see and do here. My main issue was the smell of smoke that was everywhere. We booked a non smoking a room but they either made a mistake and gave us a smoking room or the ventilation system is terrible and we were getting smoke pumped in from the casino. Either way, it did sour the experience somewhat.",40
we spent a night in Macau on the way to hong kong and decided to book at the MGM. what a great choice was that. the hotel looks amazing. every step makes you feel like in a dream world full of goodies. the front desk upgrade us to a suit and we couldn't get enough of the ocean view. restaurants are top of the line and the staff will go out of they're way to please you and to make sure all your needs are being taking care of. thank you MGM.,50
"Recenly completed my 5th stay.  The property is now 6 years old and still presents itself as if it was recently opened.  I have stayed in an entry level room as well as a 2 bedroom suite.  Both were extremely spacious - the first measuring 58 sq.m and the 2 bedroom suite measuring almost 200 sq.m.  The rooms are well equipped elecronically, the beds very comfortable and the bathroom is spaciously laid out with twin sinks - separate toilet - walk-in shower and stand alone tub.  The bathroom in the 2 bedroom suites are off the charts with jacuzzi which includes lights as well as lights that pulsate and change color in the shower, fortunately you can turn that feature off if it's not your thing!!  The hidden large TV behind the mirror in the bathroom in the 2 bedroom is…",50
"I spent 3 nights in MGM on a business visit to Macau. The rooms were clean and functional, but not exceptional.  The fact that Host took us to neighbouring properties for meals is an indication that the food may not be outstanding.  The in room dining menu was comprehensive and i enjoyed a good breakfast. Although i do not have any major complaints, in future i will opt for the Wynn or Encore next door.",40
"I stayed at the MGM Macau on my last trip there. The room was clean and spacious, the restaurants served some excellent food, the casino was good, and the service was of the usual high standard i have come to expect in the Far East these days.  I have stayed at many different hotels in Macau, and would definitely choose MGM hotel again on my next trip there.",40
"Absolutely Classy hotel !! Excellent rooms , magnificent view of lit up Macau Casinos , I really enjoyed my 4 nights stay in MGM . Rooms were good but  the bathroom was really big and gave a feeling of luxury .  Restaurants were really lit up with a nice combinations of coloured lights ... suiting your moods in every sense .  MGM casino was also big ( but not as big as Venetian Macao ) and full of action .  You'll love the breakfast too ...",50
"We were move up to a junior suite at arrival, since we wanted a double bed. I don't know how they can call this kind of suit ""junior"" because for us was simply the larger hotel room(s) we have ever been in.  The hotel and all it's amenities are spotless clean, well serviced and catered and, if you get a view over the Grand Lisboa building, stunning views from your room.  You have all the services you need and everything you want to do, in this mini las Vegas, is there.  Fine restaurants and piano bar are present in the hotel plaza, just after the check in area and before it's casino.  Don't miss the extremely good breakfast, the best I have seen and tasted.  I'm not a casino fan at all but I have to say that, although huge by my standard, I find the MGM one more amicable than…",50
"This place might as well be the Las Vegas of Asia.  The MGM Macau has everything you need to indulge in adult related activities...they have shows, gambling, girls, pools, great food, etc.  Be sure to check out the shopping if you do not mind over-paying.",40
One of the best hotel I've stayed in. Everything was so classy and service was excellent! My room was very stylish. Hotel lobby is very elegant.The Chinese New Year decoration was amazing.I would definitely recommend anyone to stay there. I've stayed in cheaper hotel in Macau and the experience is different. If you are on a budget then this hotel will not be on your list.,50
We were there for three days and did not need to step out.  The rooms were modern and very luxurious. Their staff were polite and helpful. The in-house casino was decent. It was relatively empty when we were there but we still had a great time. We spent most of our time in the Casino or the room..  Also there is an Indian restaurant very close by which delivered yummy food to us in the hotel.  This was my best luxury trip ever.,50
"This hotel was very clean, very supportive staff.  Very nice rooms, well appointed. Their buffet was very nice and the facility very modern.   Suggest the butterfly setup in the centre square, pretty cool setup especially enjoyed by the younger crowd.  Walked out of the casino with a bit of cash so all around a good stay. The shopping here is a bit on the high end, so if you're interested in brand mane watches and purses etc, this is your kind of place.",40
"So unique, so elegant, so modern.  i spent there my most wonderful memories ever.  i would recommend it for couples.",50
"As you would expect from an MGM Hotel.   Check in was efficient and staff were friendly.  Rooms are a good size, but due to excessive partying i never actually slept on the bed.  Bathroom was great.  Pool area was very nice, but didn't get a chance to swim in it.  Nice hotel, connected to a nice mall.",40
"I love the location, MGM Macau is not so good but not a bad hotel, i guess they dont have the standard of a five start hotel, staff is not friendly, no shuttle service. The hotel wasn't that full but when we requested for a later check out from 11am to 1 pm I was immediately informed that I have to pay without checking the availability. No welcome drinks not that I needed it and no fruit baskets in the room. If you like to stay at the casino you will enjoy this MGM... Nothing special at this hotel but the location..",40
"Located walking distance from city central, I enjoyed walking around the downtown area where the locals hangout.  If you are a gambler, Cotai Strip is probably a better location but MGM had just enough and was less crowded.  MGM is a great location for family with small children.  Plus, MGM offers free transportation to the City of Dreams which is located on Cotai Strip, and you can just cross the street to the Venetian for some more shopping experience.  The shopping experience by MGM is more high-end whereas Venetian offers more variety of options for shoppers.  I just got a standard room with an ocean view looking out towards the Cotai Strip.  The room was clean, mini bar had soft drinks, which were free of charge, and the bathroom had two sinks, a large tub, separate…",50
"We went on a family holiday earlier this week and originally booked 2 connecting Grand rooms with a request for early check in.  Upon arrival, no connecting rooms nor early check in were available, so to prevent us complaining further they upgraded us to a 2 bedroom Grand Deluxe Suite.  This is accessed from a separate VIP lobby which is decorated in extraordinary marble and opulence.  The suite did not disappoint.  It was 220sq metres with its own kitchen, dining area and living room. Each bathroom was massive with its own jacuzzi and rain shower.  Views were both over the harbour and the city.  Soft drinks, beer, coffee and tea were complimentary in the room.  Our rate included breakfast at Rossio. The beds were comfortable. Curtains were electronically controlled and each…",40
"The rooms are well designed, decorated and finished. It was simply excellent and above expectations. The bed and pillows are very comfortable. The bathroom amenities are at the best quality. The bedroom slippers are so comfy.     Our room is at the sea-view which is so beautiful and spacious. We felt very relaxed watching the sea during day and evening time. The food are all very tasty with many restaurants to choose from, especially the Patisserie.  It’s not easy to find a taxi near hotel. The normal check in time is at 3:00pm but we waited till 4:00pm, we were not that happy about this.",40
"We took a complimentary bus from the ferry station to the hotel and checked into MGM around 2:50pm was told our room was not ready yet and it would be ready in an hour's time, when the check in time was at 3pm.  So we weren't happy and then the staff asked us if it was ok to have a smoking room but we refused as we asked for a non-smoking room. She then went onto say if we could just check into the room first and then could transfer to the new non-smoking room in an hour's time.  We were upgraded to a room with the view of the sea, which wasn't very nice anyway.  The room was very spacious with alot of storage, mini bar, refridgerator, Tv, clock, safe, complimentary drinking water, slippers. No free wi-fi.  The bathroom was very spacious with separate shower and toilet, with a…",20
"Due to its good reputation,I chose it without any doubt for my first trip to Macau.it's easy to get via various lines of free shuttle bus within the city.a fantastique shopping mall is next to door.bath room is nice with big space and huge tub.however,free wifi is only available in public area.few plugs spaces are provided in the room which can't make cell phones and cameras get recharged at the same time. No breakfast is provided,either.they don't even provide foreign money exchange.all mentioned above are pities for this stay.and I may not repeat my visit in this hotel in the near future.",30
"This hotel is at a good location, right next to the Wynn and a nice walk to the old part of town, but sadly, that is all that is good with this property! The Casino was ok, but then again, none of the casino in Macau can stand up to LV.  Macau is more like Reno then LV! Our room was poorly maintained, bathtub did not hold water (really!!), bathroom was not particularly clean, shower floods the bathroom floor.  Overall disappointing for a room that cost almost $300 US a night! On the other hand, staff at the front desk and bell station was extremely polite and efficient!",20
"My family and I are loyal MGM Vegas customers, but MGM Grand Macau just blew us away! The resort is really beautiful, from the design interior, flowers arrangements everywhere, grandeur feeling, nice services, to daily fruits in our room. When we arrived, we're struck by the amazing lobby. And when we got to our room, we're again so amazed by the incredible view, cool modern luxurious design of the bedroom, and the oh-so-amazing bathroom. The bathroom is a state of art; it is very big, with a huge beautiful bath tub, a separate shower room, and a separate toilet room.  When we strolled around the resort, it got even better, especially mesmerized by the indoor garden, where we had our high tea. The location is nice, just 5 minute drive from Macau downtown. It's connected to a…",50

"We stayed in  different hotels to get more experience during our holiday in Macau on February 2012 and MGM Macau is the best hotels from the other 2 hotels we ever stayed. We were waiting for 45 minutes to get our room...we can't complaint  about anything because the receptions so friendly, polite & they gave us the best room ever...room number 1711. We asked a plug & they delivery it to our room straight. Our room so clean & its incredible the way they prepare everything in details. They don't have free wi-fi but its okay for us, because we really enjoy all the things in MGM. I love their jacuzzi pool; even it was too bad the floating pool broken on the period we were there. This hotels just incredible.....architecture, interior, service & etc makes us amaze....of course, its…",50
"Stayed here in '08 when there was a bad storm and we couldn't take the ferry back to HK. Beautiful rooms with an awesome view. Casino was a lot of fun, shower was great, clean hotel, friendly, English speaking staff. If I ever find myself stranded in Macau for whatever reason again, I know where I'm staying.",50
"We visited Macau for the first time in January for two nights, and stayed at the MGM.  It was a very positive experience.    This hotel is on the southern tip of the Macau peninsula, so it's in the older part of the city, right across the street from the Wynn resort.  Rooms will have either a view of the Wynn and downtown Macau, or a view of the water.  We were on the water side on the 15th floor at the end of the hall.  The front desk upgraded us to a larger room than we booked, a notch below a suite.  Being on the side we were, a bit of traffic and other noises were heard, but it wasn't really annoying.    The room was spacious, modern, with a walk-in closet area, plenty of glass and windows, and a nice view (obscured by the foggy and dreary Macau weather).  The bed was comfy,…",50
"Was fortunate to have someone book us a 2 bedroom suite on the 25th floor in the VIP section.  Room was clean, decoration is very nice, great view, and they use all Molton Brown amenities.  Nice and big jacuzzi bathtub as the centerpeice of the restroom.  Will come back.",50
"Staying at the MGM Grand Macau for 4 nights was a really bad experience for me. I had the biggest suite which was something about 138m. When I have just arrived to the hotel lobby, I was redirected to the ""Vip Lobby"" for an express Check-in, but unfortunately the check-in took about 30min, because I had in front of me someone that didn't understand what I was saying (I was talking english), that person had a very cold welcome and was releasing a very negative energy that was making me feel uncomfortable.  Once the long check-in process finished, I was pleasantly surprised by the room size and facilities, to be honest it was just outstanding! ...Jacuzzi in front of a sea view, huge dressing room, comfortable bed...etc. During my whole stay I had experienced some other good things…",10
"Hotel is  great and huge, its a grand building with extreamely friendly stuff. The standard room is amazing, made in american art deco style,  with free mini bar,  turn down service, bath tube and shower. The  marble is everywhere, fabric is gorgeous, furniture look fresh. Hotel  in walking distance to all city attractions. Can't say anything bad. Share one building with Manadarin oriental, and i strongly recommend to visit bar there. It's just fantastic.",50
"Staying at the MGM Grand Macau for just one night over Chinese New Year in January 2012 (just last week), was worth the experience.  My friend has had many experiences in Vegas hotels and was rather impressed by the Macau version of the MGM Grand; since he was responsible for the booking I would say he did a rather good job of choosing.  1) Sure there are many other cheaper alternatives, but if you're staying for such a short time (less than 3 days) it is well worth the experience.  I would NOT rate this hotel as 5 Star for many reasons but would give it a solid 4.  I'm not going to nitpick on the details as they aren't going to influence anyone's stay but suffice it to say, my experience with 5 star hotels, my background in the Service & Hospitality industry have trained my…",40
"Being a Vegas traveller, MGM Macau was nicer than MGM Vegas.  The rooms were very big and nice with a large bathroom with separate shower and tub.  The bed was comfortable and the rooms were nice and quiet.  However, I found MGM Macau to be very smoky.  People smoked in the lobby and in the hallways near the elevators.  Even the hotel rooms smelled of smoke.  The MGM has a very high class decor and pretty atrium.  However, they do not offer as much as the other hotels.  Having visited the Venetian, there is much more eating and shopping options at the Venetian.  Also, the new Star World offers more eateries and a cinema.  All in all, MGM is not a bad hotel, but I think you get more if you stay at Star World or Venetian.  Those hotels also have more free shuttles to go to other…",40
"Stayed 2 nights, got lucky with a good room rate for the standard 'Grand Room' online. Lovely room, comfy bed - what you would expect from the MGM chain. Bathroom was especially good with a large bathtub and a shower with regular and rain shower head. Concierge were very good, booked restaurants for us and then printed out itineraries and maps. Location of the hotel is very good, close to the city and other interesting hotels/casinos. When we went the pollution was very bad so the view out over the water from our room wasn't great.  The lobby is nice enough, and there is an indoor courtyard/atrium with natural light. Plenty of designer shops to look in. The hotel is nice as it is smaller and thus more manageable than others (e.g. the Venetian), so it doesn't take 25mins to walk…",40
"I went to the countdown party with my girlfriend. The cost was $500 hk p/p and you get 2 standard drinks. It had a live band and some good music.   My problem and the reason why I felt rip off is I went to buy a drink, each drink is worth $60, But you cant pay with cash. So I had to buy a cash voucher. The only cash voucher is only $100, I asked if i can buy $120 So I can could have 2 drinks and they said No.   The cheapest bottle was $600 hk which I didn't want to buy. I did my maths, I have to buy $300 worth of vouchers just to get my moneys worth so I don't lose a  cent. The voucher could not be exchanged for cash, and I could not get my $40  back,   I made a complaint, complementing the hotel on their sneaky way of rip people off for 2012, They told me they didn't think of…",10
one of those hotels you hope will give yu a break in regards to the price but they are consistently in the 220 usd range at their cheapest good rooms huge casino nice room service and views of the sea from the room  the facade of the hotel is beautifully lit at night and the lobby and the grand praie is just spectacular  must stay once just for the heck of it...recently has a mall attached to it however most of us can only window shop there.. they have a hotel tower and a more private vip tower great mood lighting throughout the hotel,30
"Most of Macau's casino resorts are brand new and offer competent service, so they have to diversify through style. What follows is very subjective. I wish MGM would have played more on the movie theme, which one would expect to be their forte; instead, they went for a glamorous flavor long on gold but short on cultural references, which may work well with the South China new rich but makes the place less interesting to me. The relative lack of taste in the interior comes in contrast with the building's striking and elegant appearance when seen from a distance.  This being said, I found no fault with the excellent service level, or the superior comfort of the very large rooms. Management appears to have cut no corners to ensure consistent quality in the guest's experience. The…",30
Nicely located hotel along Macau hotels strip. Friendly staff although some of them don't speak good English. Nice sauna and Gym. Restaurants were good as well. Biggest disappointment was the Casino which was small and full of smokers everywhere . Nothing to do with MGM Vegas. Finding non smoking rooms was also a challenge,30
My husband and I stayed at the MGM and the experience was totally amazing.    Check in was a breeze and once escorted to our room we were like kids.  The room was huge and contemporary and the bathroom was what every girl dreams of having in her house.  We had a view of the Wynn from our room.  We also used the gym and the rooftop pool.  The gym is very well equipped and the attendants are also very helpful.  There is also a spa area on the same floor as the gym and pool however we didn't get an opportunity to use it.   We also ate at the restaurants in the MGM and the food was delicious.  Although a bit prices the food was totally worth it.  Being a vegetarian it was nice to find options for myself.  The wait staff was also very good.  No complaints at all.    Since the hotel…,50
"Location is decent, close to Wynn, and about an easy 15-20 minute walk to the famed Portuguese area in Macau.    Staff were good, helpful, but nothing exceptional.  Breakfast Buffer at Rossio restaurant located in the hotel is a bit pricey (about $25 USD/person), but exceptional.  Food is very fresh, and high quality, although selection is about 1/3 of what you'd find in a Vegas hotel buffet.  Room was good, although they lost my non-smoking room, and the smoking floor was, obviously, very smokey, and you could smell it in the room.  They did upgrade it to a larger room with ocean view, so that was nice.  Not as extravagant and luxurious as the Wynn, so keep that in mind.",40
"My husband and I stayed here for three nights as part of a longer trip around the Far East. We got the ferry from Hong Kong airport and there was an MGM Grand shuttle bus at the ferry terminal in Macau that took us straight to the hotel.  The hotel is absolutely beautiful and the staff are all really friendly, helpful and obliging. Check-in was quick and easy and we were escorted to our room on the 10th floor. We had a standard room but it was gorgeous. It was modern, sleek and immaculate. The bathroom is a large glass enclosure within the bedroom with electronically operated curtains for privacy if required. The bathroom has a huge rolltop bath and a walk-in shower with a rainfall and standard shower attachments. It was really a fabulous room. We walked from the hotel to the…",50
"MGM is a hotel I will definitely be coming back to, again and again. No need to go outside in the heat for your shopping, eating or entertainment, because the MGM has it all. The rooms are well appointed, the staff are great and the restaurants cater for every taste. At night, the casino is the place to go where everyone can try out their luck; whatever your budget is and if you don't feel like having a bet, go and watch the other punters, it's worth a look-see. Thank you MGM for a memorable stay.",50
stayed at the MGM for 2 nights at the end of Sep 2011- upon arrival i asked if my room can be upgraded and the receptionist checked for a vacant suite and approved it- the suite was breathtaking!!! huge with complimentry soft drinks/coffee machine/refrigerator/ 3 flat screens TV and everything you can ask for.  I ate at the hotel's pastry shop and it was amazing- great coffee served with yummi chocolate cookies and also great spinach salad- try it! Also got to use the gym and it was well equipped with up to date treadmills and cross trianers. Didnt use the spa as it was a bit expenssive (460HK$). I got a free cupon for Square 8 chinese restaurant but i didnt like the food as it was so authentic for me :-)  over all it was a GREAT stay and i would recommand to book it.,50
"After being told we had been ""upgraded"" imagine the surprise when we were billed for the upgraded room.  Even after disputing this fact, they tell use that we in fact asked for the upgrade and they would not budge and still charged us.  The receipt even shows a handwritten amendment to the final price.  I'm still shaking my head in disbelief.",10
"Really excellent hotel; they check all the boxes. We were greeted at Macau ferry port by a car, even though we had not told them when we were arriving. They transferred us swiftly to the hotel, all at no charge. Check-in was nothing special but nevertheless speedy and efficient. Make no mistake the hotel is fantastic, if not a little over the top in places but that is what Macau is all about.  The hotel room was nothing short of luxurious however they also got the little things right: high speed internet, free drinks from the mini-bar (including alcohol), luxurious toiletries provided each day, new towels provided twice a day (they replaced them in the evening whilst we dined), a really comfy bed and reasonably priced movies on the TV available in various languages including…",50
"I have spent a night in MGM last month with my husband.  I personally like the style of this hotel much more than other new hotels (like galaxy). The room is big with sea view, but I was hoping that the hotel should at least provide free wifi and iPhone charger. It turns out that the wifi charge is quite expensive and we need to bring the iPhone to the front desk for charging.   As this hotel is a little bit cheaper than other new hotels in the area, I think it is value for money and the location is really great.",40
"When we got our complimentary upgrades to 2 beautiful sutes from deluxe rooms we boooked I really felt good. Then after seeing the huge rooms around 250 m2 each with lavish atmosphere , marble and woood extavaganza on the decor flt even bettter. Our rooms were perfect, the hotel has quite a small lobby compared to its size, I would expect something more impressive than that. It was a wonderful stay .",50
"We stayed for one night at the MGM and had to rate as one of the best hotels we stayed in.  The room was large, clean and good decor. The free standing bath with the glass wall to look out of the hotel was a great touch, likewise we loved the rain shower.  It is a short walk to the main town and sights, and there are free buses to take you to the other island. If you find there is a large queue, taxis are cheap as everything is short distances.  The food and drink prices are very reasonable for hotels, given that they want to attract the gamblers. If you don't have breakfast included, then head to the Patisserie restaurant, they serve great value options, as well as lunch also, it's tucked away from the other restaurants so was never crowded.  The only minor negatives was the…",40
"My wife and I stayed here for one night on a long weekend in Hong Kong/Macau. The MGM is a large hotel, not as large as the MGM in Las Vegas - more like its little brother. Our room was nice with an Ocean view though the view is of the Ship Canal and the other side of Macau.  The bathroom was big with double sinks and a great soaking tub my wife enjoyed.  They have buses to all the major attractions in Macau so you don't need a cab.  While there is both wired and and wireless WiFi, you had to pay so I skipped it.  Given the room rates one would think it would be free. We also had an issue with maintenance noise when we checked in and the next morning. Once the duty manager was convinced I was not happy (after the second complaint), he did take care of it to my satisfaction. …",40

From the Chihuly glass lobby to the Portuguese courtyard area to the spectacular rooms, to the impeccible service I would definitely recommend this property.  The ""real"" Macau may be disappearing startlingly quickly, at least there are buildings like this one.  The people were so nice and helpful from directions to recommendations of where to eat and what to see, you couldnt ask for more!  Eddie the concierge made a whole list of things specifically for us to eat and see.  He wouldnt even accept a tip!  That wouldnt happen at any MGMs here in America!!

Also, they have a decent gym. With the opening of One Central, there is a mall to bang around.  Unless you gamble, Macau is a pretty short stop. So this is a good place to spend your time.",40

"My wife and me visited the MGM Grand in January this year buoyed by the fabulous reviews on Tripadvisor. We were looking for a place that was opulent and not bustling with people at the same time and boy o boy was the MGM a perfect choice.   The hotel itself is imposing, being built in the form of 3 waves but is not ostentatious like the Venetian is. The lobby itself is imposing and brilliant and has Dale Chihully's glass masterpieces all over. The Grande Praca itself is a sight to behold and presents an aura of great class.   Our check in was perfect and we were upgraded to the Corner Sea View Suite which was a fabulous start to the holiday and made it more worth our while.

"I stayed in Macau for the second time in the past two weeks for another night.  I had an absolutely amazing time at the Four Seasons and so was a bit hesitant going anywhere else...  In terms of the MGM; it was a breeze getting to the hotel from ferry, well marked and continuous flow of coach shuttle buses (easier than the Four Seasons was).  Also great location on the historical side of Macau.  Check in was smooth.  We asked about complimentary upgrades and were thrilled when we were moved into a corner, ocean view studio room with free mini bar (no hard liquor but still great).  The studio was very nice.  Lots of room, clean, nice beds/linens (although mattress a bit hard).  Again great location, was within a 20-30 minute walk of all of the Portugese historical landmarks.  The…",50
"Here are the facts: there is only one Las Vegas and there is only one MGM Hotel for me, and it's in Macau. This hotel has nothing in common with it's overbloated, irregular and unpredictable relative in Vegas. MGM Macau is refined, beautiful, stunning at times and offers some of the most beautifully decorated and appointed rooms in any hotel anywhere in the world. The staff is completly helpful, warm and accommodating. The restaurants are solid -- but the casino... head across the street to the Wynn. But by all means, stay at the fabulous hotel, face the water and relax at the elevated pool overlooking the bay. Not everything in Macau is a winner--but this hotel is!",50
"I wanted to try MGM Macau as I've stayed in the MGM in Vegas. I'd take Vegas any day!  The hotel looks quite striking from the outside. The room was beautiful and there are severral options for dining. The casino floor was quite - perhaps due to the opening of Galaxy on that same night. In fact the casino was so boring that I took a cab to the Venetian, where things are always happening. Plus the Venetian is the only casino to offer poker tables - which however are placed way to the side in a quite area out of visibility. And there were only about 30 players. I know poker is not that big in Macau but it's as if they want westerners out of sight.  I find Chinese hotel patrons in Macau and Hong Kong mostly unfriendly and probably racist. I've experienced this several times now…",40

The hotel has a lovely location. Their casino is not as big as some of the other hotels but that is a plus point.  Since the hotel is not spread over a large area. one does not have to walk too much. Its very quiet and peaceful with good views from the rooms. The food is good. The shopping centre is right next to the hotel The rates are also comparable with other top hotels,50
"The rooms are very nice; ""Asian modern"" is a good way to describe the decor. The main lobby and the Grande Praca are easily some of the most beautiful spaces in Macau.  But.  The casino doesn't give free drinks (the Wynn, on the other hand, does). I lost 20 000 HKD and couldn't get anything comped (in Vegas I'd have gotten at least 2 nights comped). The room was expensively priced (especially relative to Vegas). Honestly, the player's club is only worth it if you AREN'T staying at the hotel (!!!). The food at the MGM itself, whilst not bad, wasn't amazing.   The casino has a nice, elegant, subdued atmosphere.... it kind of looks like an Art Deco and much more restrained version of the Venetian, with more romantic lighting. Also has the equal best gaming conditions in Macau (tied…",30

Almost 220 square meters, luxurious, great views, all kind of amenities.... Staff was very efficient and polite. Modern and very comfortable in the same time. Great times!",50
"We stayed here for 3 nights in march. In hindsight this was 2 nights too long in Macau! The hotel is very lavishly fitted out with a huge and stunning glass roofed atrium between the hotel and casino. The rooms are very well appointed and a very generous size. The hotel is geared up towards the casino with only very small communal areas and strangely no lobby lounge. We ate in the hotel on the fist night in Square 8. We sent both dishes back. The Singapore noodles were cold and the Satay that came with the Nasi Goreng was raw (it was chicken satay!!!!) To sum up its a very nice looking luxurious hotel that just lacks the personal touch. On checking out we were not even asked if we had enjoyed our stay, just  for the visa card to settle our bill. That I think sums it up.....",40
We booked this hotel for our first anniversary.  It was an excellent hotel with great personal care taken care by the people of MGM.  Very friendly staff and cooperative.  excellent location and near to all the major Hotels for gambling. Free shuttle services to Fairy and New Macau.,50

We only stayed one night and would very much like to go back....but think we've been spoilt in being upgraded...if we could get upgraded again I'd like to go back for at least 3 or 4 days next time. The staff were fantastic, the food amazing, the gambling fun....it really did have everything...including a lovely champagne bar. We did think about going to the Venetian but when we went to have a look round we were so pleased to find that the MGM was soooooo much better. Thank you MGM for the upgrade it really made our trip!!",50
"First a warning: We booked a small, non-smoking room at first, however, it was immediately evident that people had smoked in it. A lot. When we at first complained, the staff came to the room with a spray can. We found this unacceptable and demanded to change to a room that hadn't been smoked in. This proved difficult, though (it's after all, China). Even on the second non-smoking floor, the corridors reeked of smoke. Also, the furniture in the rooms were stained, and also smelled of smoke.  When we got to speak to a manager, I promptly asked for my money back, so we could go to a different hotel which didn't smell (Grand Hyatt for example). He was unwilling to do this, but wanted to show us a different set of rooms. Taking us into the VIP area, our initial experience wasn't…",50
"5 stars hotel with 5 stars services! Though the rate is expensive but worth to pay for their services. All my request has been arranged in good! Little surprises in room is very much appreciated. The room is excellent, despite the weather not that nice which spoiled the view of the ocean. The decoration of the walkway to the restaurant and casino at the lobby area is really amazing!  The buffet at Rossio restaurant is fantastic! Definitely you got to try out the casino. Overall it is a great hotel to stay!",50
"MGM Macau is a beautiful hotel with a huge foyer, and wonderful rooms with glassed bathroom walls to really open up the space.  Big fluffy towels, rainshower, giant bed, all the trimmings.    Really helpful staff where nothing is too much trouble. Great location to walk to Macau town centre, St Paul's ruins and hunting down a good Portugese tart (Maggie the concierge was most helpful with planning and recommendations).  The shuttle buses are excellent for getting around to different casinos.  I must admit I am not used to smoking inside buildings (it is illegal in Australia) so I found that a bit of a hurdle to overcome.  Our non-smoking room though was a great refuge from the bright lights, casino & smoke.  Overall I would stay here again as the room really was lovely.",40
Stayed the 2nd time in MGM Macao with friends for a leisure trip (visiting concert in Macao). Rooms are spacious and stylish. Reception staff is a bit unorganized but friendly. Breakfast arrangements are good as you can choose from different restaurant in the facilities. The SPA and Pool area of MGM is the best. Great program (with OK prices compared to Hong Kong Hotels) and the pool area is quite and nice. For a Weekendtrip an excellent choise (compared to the crowded and overrated The Venitian e.g.).,50
"Everything about this hotel was fabulous. The free shuttle service from the ferry terminal to the hotel was quick and easy. When we checked in we were asked the purpose of our visit and when we said we were honeymooning, they promptly upgraded us from a double to a king room.  The room itself was divine - very spacious with opulent fittings. The bed was very comfortable and we had a range of pillows to choose from. Everything was very clean and in good condition. We had room service one night and the food arrived very quickly and was very good.   The casino itself was a bit of fun - we went to Lion's Bar one night and watched a fantastic cover band and drank cocktails.  We ate both lunch and dinner at Rossio's within the MGM Grand and both meals were excellent. The buffet dinner…",50
"We stayed here for one night and I am surprised to find all the good reviews MGM receives. This is not a 5-star hotel, the toiletries, the bath amenities, the beddings, lighting all spells cheap... 3 light are out in our room, and the lighting in general is very dim.  The toilet door / shower door are badly designed, and they could bang into each other, or you could bang into one of these easily.  Never seen a smaller pillow in any other hotels in the world, and we both had neck pain after a night's sleep.  The painting on the wall is slanted because there is not enough room for the lamp (doesn't really bother the functionality, but this is just not what you expect from a 5-star hotel).  No spare towels, no bathrobes unless on request. Swimming pool is not heated. Sofa is aged…",20
"Just spent 4 nights in the ""Grand Deluxe Suite"" at the MGM Macau and had a great stay.  The suites have two bedrooms, one with a king size bed the other two twins.  Both en-suite bathrooms had large jacuzzi tub as well as multi faucets showers.  The living room is quite big with a dining room and kitchenette as well as it's own toilet.    All the controls were via a master remote, one for each room controlling the curtains, sheers, lighting moods, temperature and TV channels.  The beds were very comfortable and the bathrooms had very good pressure as well as a ""hidden"" flat-screen TV behind a wall mirror.  Bath products were from Molton Brown and replaced daily.    My only complaint was that the noise insulation from the living room to the bedrooms were not very good.  If you…",50
"My boyfriend and i visited Macau for 2 nights in November. We arrived on the ferry from Hong Kong to a very rainy and cold Macau and had no idea how we were going to get from the terminal to our hotel. Luckily we were greeted by a bellhop to collect us and then escorted onto a bus which took us to the hotel.  Check in was very quick and efficient. On arrival i was extremely impressed and even more so when we were shown to our room!   The room was spectacular!! The bed was very very comfortable and the room was very quiet. I am not sure if they have thicker walls and doors but i didnt even know that we had people staying on our floor!  The MGM has a great range of restaurants. The MGM patisserie was my favourite, outstanding cakes and a very reasonably priced breakfast. I would…",40
Love me long time! Most best of the goodly hotel and food is with best handy. Would be back coming to this hotel. Many fine browie and other service.,40
You must use the spa! Sooo nice:) And the room was very comfortable. That was clean and Just good area.,50
The hotel is very well maintained. The lobby is very huge and very beautiful with every different style of flower vases all around. It has an artistic decor in the entrance with beautiful lights which change color as the day passes. It has got a huge shopping mall inside with all the branded shops and very different crystal  antiques. The rooms have a very good view that is towards the sea and it is very well cleaned with all the amenities a person wishes to have. It has also got different casinos. The hotel is must a visit.,50
"I was on scientific conference in Macao, and it took place in MGM MACAU.  It is amazing hotel! I love it! GREAT PLACE! Best room service, best menu in-room, great view. Great pull!  BEST EVER!!!",50
"Great place for a weekend away, location was perfect.",40
"I've stayed 2 nights there.  Modern design room with high tech control equipment. Impressive! Services provided by the managers were great but the junior staff were bad, thought this mainly becos' lots of new 5 stars hotel started to operate but not enough well-trained staff.   Frequent shuttle bus from hotel to piers, 10mins walking distance to city centre.  Swimming pool area- a bit noisy as there's a big construction site nearby, seems things would drop down into the pool anytime :( spectacular view to the macau coastline.",40
"Spent one night at the MGM on a mini vacation with friends.  The hotel is very new and we had a good stay there.  Room: Modern with average size.  The amenities were lacking in some area like no bathrobes, morning newspaper and no free Internet but the design is adequate.  Bathroom is nice and large with a shower room, toilet room and a nice size bathtub.  The TV was a LCD about 40"" but no music system.  Service was fast and efficient.  Restaurant: We had breakfast at Rossio and found the food not up to 5 star standard.  No fresh juice and the worst thing is that we entered the restaurant at 10.15 and after we sat down with some food they inform us that the place will be close for breakfast at 10.30!  Should have let us know first!  We also had lunch at ""The Imperial Court"" and…",50
"Well, the basic room cost about S$300++ per night but it's well worth it if you can afford.  The positives: 1. Got to check in at 1300hrs (early) 2. Got upgraded to Grand Studio Room (got walk-in wardrope so imagine how big the room is) at no extra cost 3. Got to check out late at 1300hrs at no cost 4. Great service from check-in till check-out, everywhere, everytime 5. Casino is cool (not so crowded with great service again) 6. Location not bad. McDonalds beside hotel. If keen on visiting other hotels can walk accordingly to this sequence: Wynn Hotel, Lisboa, Grand Lisboa, Sintra Hotel, then wow... we are at Senado Square! 7. Super big and deep bathtub. 8. Grande Praca is worth a sight during evenings / night. See the background changing!  Cons: Sorry but I couldn't find one...…",50
"I was very impressed with the quality of service in this hotel. I was there 7 nights, but within a couple days, the restaurant staff knew my name and room number. And the Patisserie Manager remembered how I took my coffee.  The hotel was clean and tasteful. Compared to others in the  Las Vegas type atmosphere, the MGM made a more subtle statement from the exterior. The lobby as well. The hotel side of the complex was adorned with Chihuli art and sculpture. The finishes were chic and understated. In order to get to the casino, you pass through a more playful  zone of colorful lights, panda bears, and fantasy architecture reminiscent of the historic part of Macau,  this area contains two restauarants overlooking a plaza. The casino itself is like most. I didn't spend any time…",50
"Very good hotel, perfect location, very friendly staff, NICE HUGE CASINO.  Rooms are very very good, perfect.",50
"We are big gamblers and planned a week long trip to Hong Kong and Macau.  We stayed in Macau for 3 days and had a good time gambling.  But there are very few westerners or Europeans there.  Felt a little uncomfortable and out of place.  I did have an odd experience in the hallway of the MGM Grand.  I was followed by 3-4 local guys - I almost felt as if I was being cased... or sized up, because it was obvious I was an American with some cash.  Nothing bad happened - but I did feel a little uncomfortable.    What I did love was the amazing food all over the city.  Every hotel and casino have all day dim-sum (YUM!) plus the Portugese influence in the local restaurants was very cool.  Great food.  Pollution is HORRIBLE.  If you're planning on being on the beach at all - change your…",40
"We checked in very late, about 2am, but the staff were so friendly even at that time. We even got a free upgrade which was just what we needed after a long journey all day. The rooms are very modern and spacious. We had an ocean view which was great. The hotel/casino is big but not too big like the Venetian is. It's restaurants are all exceptional, the bars are great and have a bit more life than some other hotel casinos in Macau. The lobby area based on the Lisbon station was impressive. The swimming pool is not huge but is still very nice all the same. Highly recommend the cocktails in the Vueve Cliqout lounge! We found good rates on rooms via getroomscheaper.com .",40
My best stay in Macau so far. Location is next to Wynn. Super clean hotel. 5 star service and the room is fantastic! You wont go wrong choosing this hotel !,50
"I was given a 'cash'  voucher to stay in almost any hotel in Macau with everything included for a night. However, the cost for this 'cash' offered trip was almost doubled the price offered by the hotel's online offers.  But because the voucher was linked to a specific agent there was no choice at all. We selected MGM Grand hotel because we would really like to enjoy its 5-star services.  Unfortunately, we arrived 10:30 in the morning and we were told that it was too early and there were no free rooms of our choice.  To be honest this was the low season and  judging from the number of participants taking breakfast in the restaurant in the following morning I am 100% sure that there were free rooms in the hotel that can accommodated us.  Eventually, we were given a room not until…",40
"Has all the amenities of a 5-star casino.  Well designed, good variety of reasonable food, variety of limits to play.  The test came at check-in.  It was 11pm. My wife and I were exhausted after the predictably late Air Asia flight. We were looking forward to our first weekend alone together since last fall (kids will cause that...beware).  At the counter we were told 'only twins available' AND you can't push them together.  We responded...""That's not going to work'.  After an offer of an upgrade to a Studio w/ Twin beds (same problem, bigger room) we asked for a manager.  I mentioned to my wife ""we'll see what 5-star service looks like here'.  Long story short;  We were put in a 2 bedroom VIP suite for no extra charge.  Gotta like those 8-head showers.  We aren't high rollers…",50
"This Hotel has a vibrant, very stunning look from outside but the services is not up to its class,  The checking in/out are smooth. The moment we step into the Hotel and way up to our the feeling a great, the ambient lobby and cozy corridor and room are excellent. The beds are very comfortable, the view is good, either side. But there are no magazines or brochure or anythings for reading pleasure  We loved all these.  We stayed here for 3 nights everytime we passed any staff, they never bother to greet you except the doorman. There is no lobby lounge, but there is one and only inside the casino, I can't enjoy it with my kid. The cafe offer good B/F but a bit expensive. Around the Hotel there is nothing to do about. We need to walk 10-15 mins Wynn Hotel which is behind MGM to…",30
"This place needs a soul.  These days hotels need to be more than massive buildings... certainly in Macau where they want to keep you inhouse spending personality and service should be paramount.  The hotel is lovely, well appointed comfy rooms which I enjoyed.  The staff weren't very helpful and didn't seem to care.  We found it ridiculously hard to find out what was going on in the complex while we were there... internal bars and restaurants had a very low profile.  This worked in our favour though as it meant we got out and explored Macau and had a great time.  I would recommend this to honeymooners or anyone who wants to lock themselves away in their room and forget about the outside world.  Anyone looking for action and adventure should try somewhere else.",40
"From the spectacular Chihuly artwork in the lobby to the large rooms and the dramatic bathrooms, we were very impressed with the decor at this hotel.  We ate dinner in a restaurant downstairs and it was great.  The business center was very helpful, too. There's a free shuttle to/from the ferry to Hong Kong, too.",50
4 of us check in for a standard room... i think its spacious enough for us...  The food serve @ Square Eight which was located inside the hotel casino were delicious.  overall it was a good experience.   BTW... we got a great desl via www.zuji.com.sg,50
"Pros: - Got there early and can checked in early; for some reason they upgraded us to a bigger suite (probably coz there was some arguements in the reception with another customer and it didnt look too good)  - The room was really nice, the design , the equiptment, the bed and the bathroom were fantastic.  - Room service was quick and affordable and the quality of the food was great - Check out was a breeze.   Cons:  -not much to complain besides the service is not superb.  But the concierge and the front desk people try hard to satisfy your request; but sometimes there might be a language barrier.",50
"For the price that we have to pay, I don't think this makes MGM one of the finest hotels that I will come back to. I'd love staying in good quality hotel and don't mind paying some extra money for this. But MGM Macau just lack of what a good hotel should have.  Room was pretty clean and huge (although for that price you could get much bigger room in any other hotel in Macau).  Service was ok but slow, from the time of arrival we have to wait 15 mins until our luggage arrived to our room despite we told them that we need to leave urgently after checked in.  Another annoying thing happaned was that our bathtub is leaking, and it took 30 mins for an attendant to check. They didn't move me to another room as there's no other available room with the same type. I didn't mind some…",40
"I work in investing in Hong Kong, and have a stake in one of the local casinos in Macau (not the MGM) so I decided to see what the competition was offering.  I hadn't had a chance yet to stay at the MGM before, although I'd stayed years ago at their huge hotel in Las Vegas (which I remember feeling at the time was a tad impersonal).  I booked the hotel through a travel agent, which is unusual for me (I usually go to the hotel website or call directly), but in Macau this is definitely the way to get the best deal.  The agents on the third floor of the Shun Tak Center in Macau, although offering some rather shady other entertainment products, do also offer some of the best rates for the Macau hotels, well less than rack rates or even the published Internet rates for the hotels. …",50
"After spending the first two nights of our short Macau trip at The Venetian, I had wanted to spend our third and last night in Macau in an area closer to the downtown Senado Square, where most of the action is. First choice, Wynn's, because its website pictures looked great! But the cost of a suite there kind of puts me off ...   So, I booked a One bedroom suite at the MGM Grand, my second choice but somewhat very happy with my decision of staying here. Our earlier request of a high floor, Ocean view and late check out at 3pm were all met with except that we were given a city view suite instead - not a problem, in fact, there is more to look at with the glimmering lights of Wynn's, Grand Lisboa and other hotels, it is a sight to admire and remember.   Check in was swift and…",50
"Hotels in Macau are typically opulent and slightly over-the-top. MGM is more understated than most. The rooms are generous and the facilities are great.  I had a problem with the small, square and soft pillows but it wasn't a major deal for me. However, in its zeal to be wonderful, I thought the hotel was pretty wasteful. I had used the toothbrush/toothpaste set that came with the room, and that tiny tube of tothpaste would have lasted me three uses. but barely after i squeezed a third of it, by the time i returned to my room, that and the toothbrush were replaced. it was the same with the towel. i returned to the room for a quick shower before an evening appointment and purposely hung up the towel, so it won't be replaced. when i returned to the room after dinner, it was a…",40
"Very nice property, much smaller than neighbour Wynn, feels more like a resort than city hotel. Room is huge, adequate for a family of four, TV channels enough to keep you entertained, casino is cute, has a rather hip lounge in it, and staff are generally more polite than Venetian's.   As you can see from the pictures, the pool area is GORGEOUS, should be fantastic in summer. Spa is operated by six senses, facilities are aplenty and top notch, hence its MOP450 just to use without treatments.   Checked in at 1pm and was upgraded to a sea view room, though not much of a view if you ask me. Its located in the old town area so very easy to get around, couple of minutes to Wynn (right behind), Grand Lisboa and St Paul's Ruins. As the main entrance faces the sea, to get to it from the…",40
"The interior of the hotel is nice, but the service rendered is definitely not up to it.  The service at Aux Beaux Arts Restaurant is horrible. Food is so-so, but the attitude of team is way below acceptable.  Note: if you are food person, go stay at the Venetian where you will be spoilt for choices; here, you only eat at the few expensive restaurants.  The operator forgot our morning call request and we missed our early ferry to Hong Kong.  There were 2 power blackouts on the first night.  We wrote a feedback to the hotel but they don't seem apologetic. I guess they just lost us.",20
"We booked the hotel thru their website with a specific request for early check-in, almost three months before the stay with a reminder three days prior to our stay. This request was not even communicated to the front office and their standard reply was the check-in time is at 3 pm (typical American corporate response). Maybe MGM should check how many flights come into Macau prior to 3 pm. We waited and waited ....3 pm came and went and still no room. When we finally got the Grand Studio we booked, it was a tiny corner room located facing the construction site. Of course, having to pay HK$2,700 per night, we had to tell the front desk it was not acceptable and we were finally given a more accpetable room. Other than this initial hiccup, the rest of the day was pleasant and…",40
"The hotel facade is just impressive, three color glass blocks overleigth in each other assembling like 3 waves. The hotel entrance has a Dali sculpture and the major attraction a look a like Portuguese Main Square, with reproduction of Lisbon historic buldings. This Main Square holds several restaurants, bars and casino.  I've tried the Aux Beaux Arts Restaurant and it's ok, nothing special, just ok. The Rossio holds the daily breakfast and despite the modern decor the food is very good, and the service professional and attentive.  The room is modern and with a medium area. For those who like the bathroom has a glass separation from the room itself, which allows you to face the room window while in the bath. It was a huge tub.

No 1 its a big chain from the Vegas so it had to be good and No 2 its on the main island in macau and is very close to all the hustel and bustel of macau that one has to experiance for sure.

The rooms are well designed, decorated and finished. It was simply excellent and above expectations. The service was also top notch!!! Its staff was well trained. Congrats to MGM. You have done an amazing job!!!!  Its a shame we didnt spend more time at the hotel.   I will be back!! I will definitely be back!!!!",50
We were greeted by a very helpful and courteous driver with the complimentary hotel limo (Nissan Elgrand) which is very big and grand for four of us (we are all Ladies).  The hotel is very new and beautiful with it's own Casino in the hotel.   I loved the auto bathroom curtain which you can open for the total bathroom exposed from the bedroom. The bed and pillows are very comfortable.  Even the complimentary water bottle is very unique. Every bathroom accessories are at the best quality. The bedroom slippers are so comfy that I keep it to use at home.   My room is at the sea-view which is so beautiful and spacious. I felt very relaxed watching the sea during day time.  The food are all very tasty with many restaurants to choose from. The service is excellent and fast too. And…,50
"In short words, the accomadation and public areas were just AMAZING. Comparing this hotel to the MGM Grand in Las Vegas would be way different however. I don't think it would even be called MGM Grand- as it's styling (very modern) and features (luxury- and not too busy or glitzy as in Las Vegas) are different. Here's  a breakdown of our stay:  Room: Again- WOW! The room was really large and spacious. At the entryway is a gray luggage area and a closet with three doors (one is for the safe area, but opened up it's all in the closet). Right near the glass bathroom wall was a small sitting area with a sizeable ottoman, a glass table with interesting footing (circles) and a leather chair with a removable top part (not that you need to know). Two double beds were to the left with 2…",50

"Heard very bad comments regarding new vegas-style hotel in Macau so wasn't expecting much before our arrival.   Turned out we quite enjoyed our stay, especially with the food.  Service was not bad although I would say I wasn't expecting much.    First of all - the room.  We were placed on the 16th floor facing the ""waterfront"".  I guess the weather has something to do with it because the view wasn't very spectacular - You can see the bridges and a big piece of undeveloped land in front of the hotel.  Night view was definitely better.  But our room was located directly above the main entrance so all the lights at the front gate appears to direct upwards...so even with the lights off and the curtains closed, our room was still quite bright.  It can be tough for people who need to…",40
"I booked a ""Studio"" room at the MGM and I've been impressed by the size of the room, the way it is room is styled and also by the view. All ""Studio"" rooms are huge corner rooms with exelent view on the bay of Macau - at half the price of the rooms at the ""Wynn"" hotel. Service is at 5* standard, very friendly and helpful. The Six-Sense-Spa located inside the hotel is another reason to stay at the MGM Grand.",50

"We had a 4 nite stay at the MGM Grand Macau and found that it was impeccable in all aspects from its design prestige, service, amenities to facilities. The rates were on the steep side but as we found out that all other hotels in the league were on par... so can't complain much there. We also found that the hotel is more of a place for swanky crowds to mix the pleasure of partying with gambling as it has few bars with good atmosphere and very exciting drinks menu and also a club that rocked the whole place up until wee hours in the morning with a big following in the venue on most nites we were there. As for some serious gamblers the place is respectable but aint as big as others we had visited in Macau but the Wynn is just 5 min walk right next door if needed. Location wise the…",50

When we arrived at the hotel upon checking in which was exactly 3pm - we were told the room was not quite ready and for us and request that we return back to the check in desk in another half hour.
